When you get a place you want, you choose your flag and also name your space program, like, \u0022Mike Space Program\u0022 or something, If you are in career mode, you start out with the VAB, Tracking station, and the Research and Development Facility, you also have to earn money to gain more buildings like Mission Control, SPH, Runway, or the Astronaut Complex. (You only get 7 Kerbals when you join.) But if you are in sandbox, you get to instantly build them without any money... Plus you get to choose where you want to put the other buildings! You must place your \u0022Space Program\u0022 on, or near the equator. You are not aloud to place your Space program right next to another person\u0027s space program, you at least have to be 5 or 10 km away from another one. You have to place your program on a flat area, or in a valley, (You cannot place your program on top of KSC2 or monoliths, or the abandoned airstrip... In the tracking station, you cant fly someone Else\u0027s rocket or plane, instead, if it is not yours, the \u0022Fly\u0022 button is replaced with a \u0022View\u0022 button, You are not in control of the ship, you can only move the camera, pretty much just like watching a live Youtube video. The debug menu will be controlled by the host, if they want Whack-A-Kerbal on, they can enable it and the GUI will show up for everyone. Time warp only effects you, so lets say that your friend in the computer to your right is playing KSP, and you are too, both playing on the same local server, if you time warp, time warp wont effect him, it only effects you. I\u0027m not sure, but I think you must need the same version, and both need the same mods. Yes, You are able to sabotage someone Else\u0027s station with your rocket. If you go into map mode. You can see everybody Else\u0027s orbits and time warping all around the planets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you liked my ideas, maybe it will be in version 0.27!
