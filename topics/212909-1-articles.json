For example, fuel tank FL-T400, you cannot adjust slider to get 0.06 t of methane. The marker always jumped either to 0.0800001 or 0.04 t. This also happened with 0.23 t which always jumped to 0.2 or 0.24 t. It also happened with others e.g. oxidizers, ablator, but at different amount. One thing I observed is that it occurred around the 6th, 11th, and 18th marking in the slider (the dash line that represent amount in the slider).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
