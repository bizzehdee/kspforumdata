For the most part it feels like (to me at least) another Mun or Ike that is sitting out in a semi painful to reach sector of space (Not super hard to get to for an experienced player but not as easy for the interplanetary noob looking for their first target). Dres may have a few neat geological features such as the giant canyon and a less crater ridden terrain but at the moment I feel as if Dres has been left rather bare and uninteresting (this will probably change a bit if we get an asteroid belt with Dres as the equivalent to Ceres). So I ask upon the community for ideas on how the relatively bare planet could be made into a more worthwhile target!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few of my ideas for how we could accomplish this include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Putting Dres in a Tidally locked orbit around Kerbol (so only one side ever faces the sun for the most part. This would also present an interesting challenge for those who haven\u0027t unlocked RTGs), and put a bunch of crazy Easter eggs on the dark side of the planet. Also the dark side be covered in ice planes in order to make the terrain more unique! In the end I feel that some very interesting base/ survival scenarios could come to life with a tidally locked planet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Give Dres more Canyons and maybe a thin atmosphere that is only really usable in them? (I remember the devs had a plan for the mountains of a moon to reach out of the atmosphere but I still feel this could be interesting)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T05:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose all actually sound pretty awesome. And along with easter eggs on the dark side, I\u0027d like cool stuff in the perpetual twilight belt as well. Maybe really good science boosts for a thin ring-shaped biome?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T05:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, NovaSilisko had plans for Dres to be a Ceres equivalent, and that it is where the asteroid belt was (is?) going to be. If that is still the plan, I would be happy for that to happen, though I would rather it was reduced in size significantly in that case. (Maybe to ~15km instead of the 100Km (?) it is now.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T05:48:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut docking ports on it.
