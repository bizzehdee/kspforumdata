For example, I will rebuild a new lander design and/or orbital stage for each mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like if I was operating a real space program, I would want to use hardware from other missions which has already been tested and ratified to keep costs down. (Sort of like what the Constellation plan was to do with Space Shuttle hardware, and what SLS is currently doing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt goes beyond just reusing bits of your launch stage though. Perhaps your service module performs exceptionally well, but you don\u0027t want to have to pay full price for a design which has been tried and tested many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, you can just grab a subassembly of that part \u0027off the shelf\u0027 and rather than pay full price, you instead have a discount on what the module would have normally cost (you still have to construct it, after all). This also helps when building launch stages, as instead of rebuilding your massive \u0027Jool V\u0027 launcher and paying out the nose for it, you simply grab a discounted version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does the community think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T05:23:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is already in the game.
