The game\u0027s SRBs don\u0027t have thrust vectoring so you need to rely even more on the main engines - the real Shuttle boosters have gimballing nozzles. Raising the external tank can help. Look at a side view of NASA\u0027s shuttle, such as at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nycaviation.com/2011/07/photos-space-shuttle-atlantis-lifts-off-on-final-mission\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nycaviation.com/2011/07/photos-space-shuttle-atlantis-lifts-off-on-final-mission\u003C/a\u003E , and see how the butt of the external tank is well forward of the rear of the shuttle - AND consider that because they used low-density hydrogen and denser oxygen, with the oxygen at the front, the centre of mass is towards the front of the ET too. This all means the main engines don\u0027t need to be so angled and don\u0027t need to gimbal so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your problems are when gliding or on re-entry.

Again, adding fins might ruin the American-space-shuttle feel your going for, but do remember that the space shuttles were some of the hardest to fly spacecraft ever made, and you might not get the hang of the art of space shuttling on your first few goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helped, Jaq\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-01T00:55:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2022 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Jaq\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb24","CreatedById":214340,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-01T14:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn testing, I did put two orbiters on one external tank, and it was stable, but I was eventually able to make a space shuttle that was controllable and looked somewhat accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
