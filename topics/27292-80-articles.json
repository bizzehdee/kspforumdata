Bill and Bob were selected to rescue him, and this time I decided not to take any chances with the fuel. This time, I used my Saturn V replica, sans the lander module and with a spare seat in the command module. This mission was more uneventful, and after I rendezvoused with Jeb, I had a large surplus of fuel (my rescue mission\u0027s transfer stage not being used up). This was probably the first time that the transfer stage was used for both transfers, and the rocket very quickly was returned to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel a bit sorry for Jebediah though.
