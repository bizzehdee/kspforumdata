aware of any real-world crewed spacecraft that have actual reaction wheels.\u00A0 Space telescopes tend to have them, because they can be used to manage pointing for rather long periods without burning \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel continually (occasional observation shutdowns are required, so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and desaturate the reaction wheels).\u00A0 You might recall Kepler\u0027s primary mission ended when a reaction wheel failure meant it could no longer be precisely targeted on its primary field for long periods, and Hubble has required at least one repair mission to replace reaction wheels that were approaching failure (bearings were failing, as I recall).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs noted above, however, real life reaction wheels don\u0027t have the power needed for routine maneuvering, and because the flywheels have RPM limits, they can \u0022saturate\u0022 -- that is, when the wheel can\u0027t turn any faster, it can\u0027t apply/absorb any more angular momentum in that direction.\u00A0 All the stuff that goes with rapidly accelerating and decelerating heavy rotating objects applies to reaction wheels, not to mention if something goes very wrong, a wheel can fail (and a failure of a massive wheel spinning at tens of thousands of RPM strongly resembles an explosion -- not something you want in the cockpit of your Space Shuttle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are in-game reasons to include a wheel (system), as noted in other answers -- but if you want maximum realism for crewed craft, you\u0027d have no reaction wheels at all (and be prepared to run out of monopropellant at an inopportune time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
