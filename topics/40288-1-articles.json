For a moment I thought they made it so you could see the nav markers behind it as if it was semi-transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a good idea. Things like the waypoint marker would show up behind the nav ball in a more muted color implying it is behind the ball. It would be a lot easier to find directions that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T16:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps this should be a slider in the in-game options menu, because I could see it getting really confusing if you are on a marker, and the anti-marker is \u0022bleeding\u0022 through the navball, so you don\u0027t really know what attitude you are at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis idea will help a lot when I can\u0027t find the maneuver nodes though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woppeldopple","CreatedById":74678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T16:30:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo transparency needed.
