Well that Kerbalstuff release is actually lacking a little bit. I had been meaning to revisit it.

The version of AVP I tossed up on KS is actually not compatible with the dev version of EVE Reboot. And all my info in the OP is becoming dated.

I Do have it \u0022working\u0022 on my computer at home with EVE Reboot and AVP but the city lights are all messed up and The clouds lack that volume.

I think I\u0027ll use AVP for space scenes and a separate install with volume clouds.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Currently I\u0027m trying make scatterer work. I\u0027m getting the border/line glitch that appears on the horizon and onscreen when you zoom in. It sucks out the immersion and has done so even before the ocean update. I have been editing my nvidia settings but they don\u0027t seem to affect much. I\u0027ll see if I can get it to work cause I love the ocean shader.\n\u003E \n\nWell, What are your system specs and are you on Windows 10? Win 10 will actually not run KSP in DX9 properly unless you add the ( -dx9) flag in the shortcut target field. And on that note. Are you running OpenGL or DX11?\n\nPersonally I find DX9 plays the best with Scatterer and EVE, yielding the best performance. You need the memory to run it this way. But it tends to smooth everything out. 16GB is really the best amount of ram to run this game with, when heavily modded."}]}
