to 1.1.3, for the way I play (long term, slow paced save file without excessive time warping).\u00A0 I shall post in the Add-on Discussions Forum, but I wonder if it may be too much to ask for someone to mod an older version of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh.\u00A0 Yeah, I think it\u0027s a pretty safe bet that nobody is going to be even slightly interested in writing a new mod for 1.0.5.\u00A0 I\u0027d be astonished if you find any takers on that one.\u00A0 Speaking as a modder, I know that

idea of costing money to hire them makes sense to me.\u00A0 The idea of escalating the cost as my career progresses makes sense to me, too.\u00A0 I just don\u0027t care for how it\u0027s balanced.\u00A0 The costs get\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E expensive, the curve is too steep.\u00A0 It\u0027s as though the game is strongly and arbitrarily biased towards forcing me to have a tiny space program with only a dozen kerbals or so.\u00A0 I don\u0027t like that.\u00A0 I like having a big crew roster, and once you get past the first dozen or so kerbals, the recruiting cost just gets \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Einsane\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E-- the cost of recruiting a single kerbal can be several times what it costs to launch a massive Jool mothership mission with multiple dedicated landers, probes, complete comsat network, the whole nine yards.\u00A0 And I also don\u0027t like that it\u0027s based on my \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecurrent\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E crew roster, rather than how many kerbals total I\u0027ve hired over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor astronaut-complex hiring to be a viable option for me, they\u0027d need to make a few changes.\u00A0 First, greatly reduce the per-kerbal-hired escalation rate, so that it doesn\u0027t skyrocket up to such ridiculous levels.\u00A0 Second, make it per \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etotal\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E kerbal hired, not just based on my current roster; if I hire, kill in an accident, hire, kill in an accident, etc., then I don\u0027t think I should get a free pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, what I\u0027d like to see would be some sort of balance between different events that influence the kerbal cost.\u00A0 Some factors would drive it up, some would drive it down.\u00A0 Higher cash on hand = more expensive kerbals.\u00A0 Hire lots of kerbals = more expensive kerbals.\u00A0 Kill off a kerbal = more expensive kerbals.\u00A0 On the other hand, there should also be some sort of mechanism that drives the cost \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edown\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, e.g. if increasing reputation decreases your hiring costs, so that could be a viable player choice (\u0022I\u0027m going to do this impressive thing to boost my rep, so that I can hire more astronauts at a reasonable price.\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut honestly, at this point I\u0027ve gotten so used to (and fond of) rescuing kerbals to staff my program that I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eanything\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Squad could do to the astronaut complex that would
