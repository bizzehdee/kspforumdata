First off this \u0022tweak\u0022 for the parachutes is in no way an official patch or representation of Majiir. With that out of the way we may begin, In the addModule.cfg at the bottom there is a GRAB config for a parachuteRadial and I changed evaPartPos = (0.0, 0.09, -0.23) to evaPartPos = (0.0, 0.09, -0.12) and removed this line physicJoint = true.
