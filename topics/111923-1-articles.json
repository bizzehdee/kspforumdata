Moderate\u002B difficulty setting (gotta have quick saves, KSP always crashes on me, it\u0027s just a matter of when now (Mac OS)), I don\u0027t want a grind so I can save up to invent the ladder or something equally absurd as I might do on hard.\n\n**Tourists**. I like the hawaiian shirts in the thumbnails, otherwise entirely uninteresting to me. Other people might like them, so not a huge problem, but they share the major issue with rescues, in detail below...\n\n**Rescues**. Grossly too many of them, and they are entirely unconnected to my manned spaceflight progress. Send a probe to Jool, then rescue missions for Jool pop up even though my first Duna expedition is en route, in orbit around the sun. They need to be not in any SoI you have not landed on the parent body of---with kerbals (test for if a flag was planted).\n\n**Parts testing**. Just as dumb as always. What, pray tell, is the difference between orbit (anywhere), and suborbital over \\_place\\_airless\\_world\\_here\\_? Ditto escape velocity out of X. You\u0027re in space (who thinks of these?). They are almost universally dumb. I only do any of them to take parts I want but don\u0027t have (and I do the test to get the part if so, I don\u0027t take the mission for the part, and do it later).\n\n**Explore**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I like these, but I have been not getting them reliably. Maybe I passed some milestone too fast. Last try I got the Mun one, the try before I got Duna, but never the Mun, etc.\n\n**Ore**. These contracts are written with the same attention to detail as all the others. Collect ore, and bring it from A to B. If A and B were meaningful, like extract ore from the Mun, and deliver it to a station above the Mun with an IRSU part\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 that makes sense. Bring X hundred units to Kerbin? Why? Or ore from Eve to Gilly? What? I have a probe in orbit, that\u0027s it. Dumb, all of them, IMO. I thought about doing one from the Mun as a sample return, but it\u0027s more than a single tank, and wasn\u0027t worth the trouble.\n\n**Surveys**. Random, with no context, hence pretty dumb. 3 in one area, a 4th somewhere heavily displaced (for reasons). What about altitude requirements\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 WHY? I would be fine with that if they made some sort of sense\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 wide field observations, then below 4000m, then surface data\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 it\u0027s like Ranger and Surveyor. But it\u0027s just random. I do none of these at Kerbin, usually. I would do them perhaps if they were from orbit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 an actual reason to launch a polar satellite instead of just launch missions.\n\n**Satellite launches**. I\u0027m fine with these around Kerbin. I never reuse them, that seems like cheating to me (they are commercial launches for a customer). Around any other body\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 they are really space probes, and should\u0027t be for 3d parties. If I send an orbiter, and there is a mission where the sat launch is right, I might take it, but I treat it as MY probe, not a commercial launch (I should;t have to pretend this way, science missions should be from MY program).\n\n**Visit A, then B, etc for reasons**. Utterly uninterested in those. Maybe others like them for reasons.\n\n**Asteroid** contracts. (Katateochi noted I had forgotten these) These are mostly also absurd make-work. Put it in orbit around X? Why? Do I then get a mission to build a base on the asteroid I just put in orbit around Eve, or did they just want to see me do it for reasons?\n\nThe missions/contracts are uninspired, and slapdash. They create no story arc---not a particular arc I want to see, but ANY story arc. I\u0027m fine with sandbox/open-ended career, but the goal is a STORY. If you read the accomplished mission objectives in chronological order reduced to a sentence or 2 each, written conversationally/descriptively, it would be nice if it made sense as a story. Flew an orbital flyby of the Mun to mark landing sites. Next mission they successfully landed, etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T14:56:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:09:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They create no story arc---not a particular arc I want to see, but ANY story arc.\n\nThis, in my opinion, is the problem more than anything. It isn\u0027t that the contracts are meaningless to me, it\u0027s that there is no story (or overarching context) into which the contracts fit. They are simply a mechanism to progress through the game, via another form of resources (funds).\n\nThe contracts are reflective of the fact that KSP is really a sandbox style game...that had a career system overlaid...in a series...of partial segments. It really creates a bumpy experience. And, on top of that, the open-endedness of the contract system doesn\u0027t really have any way to accept user preference.

I do however like the tourist missions, but only when they are for places that I\u0027m currently interested in going myself and when I can stack several of them together. What I\u0027ve really enjoyed is creating a reusable process for taking large groups of them around Mun and Minmus but now I\u0027m only getting contracts for further afield places. I would like a system that enabled you to state what destinations where available to tourists, rather than the tourists telling you what to do. (I\u0027ve got more detail on this, keep meaning to write it up as a suggestion).\n\n**Rescues**. Agreed. \n\n**Parts testing** I actually dislike these so much that in my current career I\u0027ve not done a single one of them.\n\n**Explore** These are good, but they need to be transfer window aware (ie they should start appearing for planet X just around the time the transfer window for planet X is coming around).\n\n**Ore**. yep, currently these are contracts for contracts sake.\n\n**Surveys**. Some of these I like; when you get a cluster of points all on the ground a short distance from each other, because finally that\u0027s a real reason to bring a rover and it\u0027s actually more like doing a transect survey. But yes, they need more structure; at the very least have some predictable and biome related order (ie once you\u0027ve been to a planet you start getting them, initially for the equatorial biomes and then as you complete those you get ones for the non-equatorial biomes and finally the polar biomes)\n\n**Satellite launches**. I get bored of these pretty fast and they just become more clutter in orbit (so I quite often deobit them once the contract completes). \n\n**Visit A, then B, etc for reasons.**  I\u0027ve pretty much completed my career (in terms of tech tree unlock) and I\u0027ve never had one of these!\n\nYou didn\u0027t mention asteroid contracts. These I think have much more potential and are not utilized enough. So far I\u0027ve had 2, one to bring one into orbit and other to eject one out of the system. The eject out of system ones are tedious and having done one I\u0027m not likely to do another (just because the only challenge is how good your patience is at sitting through a long burn). But the capture ones are pretty good and (sort-of) seem like they have a purpose, or at least you can then invent your own purpose for it. But there also needs to be more urgent ones to redirect potential threat asteroids. I made [this suggestion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124132-Impactor-Asteroid-Early-Warning-System) about having a early warning system and an obligation to protect Kerbin from potential impactors, but maybe a simpler thing might be to just have occasional contracts to redirect a specific asteroid on an impact course (and naturally these would have a much shorter window to complete it in than other contracts). \n\nThere also needs to be contracts to go and study specific asteroids (which should earn beaucoup science). Not necessarily to capture or redirect it, but to just grab hold of the target \u0027roid with a ship that has specific science parts. (and then actually be able to do materials/goo/other science readings from it). or maybe to take a specific survey team (ie two scientists and an engineer) to inspect asteroid X. You could then choose to take them directly to the asteroid or play it more like the proposed NASA missions and capture it with a unmanned craft and being it back home for the manned team to study more safely."},{"CreatedByName":"Carraux","CreatedById":60890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:09:52Z","Content":"Same to me...\n\nI do not have the feeling, that contracts add some spice to the game. More or less it is exactly sandbox, only with obstacles to come to a fully expanded parts catalog. IMHO, it adds nothing to the game, only delays the inevitable.

Same way as the sci mode equals sandbox with other type of limitations. Using either of these is totally optional. But what gaming shown me long ago is that limitations create challenge, and overcoming hardships is the source of fun. My first Mun-landing back in 0.24 was a blast. Mostly I didn\u0027t know what I was doing, didn\u0027t even know about the save-system. Than I becme an MJ junkie. In a few days I was sending motherships with multiple landers to Jool. I could do anything, and didn\u0027t -have- to do anything. Got bored quickly.\n\nNext time I undusted KSP, there was a science mode. I had a goal! I sunk many hours into the game again. Still with the help of MJ, but it was limited too and I had to work hard to access my usual functions. It basically resurrected the game for me. And now there is career with missions and funding. Another limiting factor that gets me to do stuff that I normally wouldn\u0027t. I have never seen a point in learning to build and fly efficiently before. Five mainsails, ten jumbo tanks - universal solution for either a Moho-trip or just a Minimus landing, right? Same as manual orbit-changes: I never understood it, and never wanted to until the sat missions made me realize that it\u0027s easy and fun. Now I\u0027m doing the rescues too. MJ is still there, but I really rarely touch it, using it mostly for the readouts.\n\n**There is no story, missions are silly**: I don\u0027t know what other story people wish for than running a low-tech, low-funding space-program until it passes all possible boundaries. I don\u0027t know how closer it can get than the current one-time milestone quests (eg.: get to LKO, Mun flyby, Mun landing, etc).\n\nAnd the random missions... yes, some of those make no sense. But who cares? It\u0027s Kerbals we are talking about. I believe all of us made things more stupid than our contractors require. And if not, we should be gald for them for further increasing the ridiculous-factor. I don\u0027t care if it makes no sense to test a Mainsail on a 10 km munar orbit. It\u0027s great fun to do so. Linking it to other missions and doing it efficiently also feels higly educational.\n\n**But there are types of contracts I dislike doing!** Well, yes. But I don\u0027t -have- to do them. Once my favorite missions run out, I can just fast forward time to get new ones. It might come with a penalty if I picked quests that I can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to do, but who cares until all resources are infinite. Yet, as gaming thought us min-maxing, this system inspires me to do stuff I normally wouldn\u0027t. It makes me find that certain operations aren\u0027t as boring as I thought. I totally like how it\u0027s done: it inspires, but doesn\u0027t forces anything. I definately prefer the current setup to one that would force me to do a set series of \u0027story\u0027 missions, even if those are -all- well written, make sense, and progresses a story better than my imagination."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T14:18:02Z","Content":"Kegereneku, you entirely missed the point of my space race comment. I wasn\u0027t suggesting one, I said that the existence of rescue missions *implies* a space race as a narrative. From a story standpoint, \u0022why\u0022 matters. My kerbal isn\u0027t the first on the Mun if there is a wrecked craft there that I know of (even if I don\u0027t take the mission). That implies another program, so I get the anti-immersive element of that, with none of the pluses an actual space race would add. If they are going to implicitly add competitors, why don\u0027t they make use of it.\n\nStory matters for immersion. It would be bad enough if there was no positive arc to play due to contracts, but it actually harms immersion. You are working towards the milestone of first kerbal on the Mun or Duna... And you get spammed with rescues on/around the Mun/Duna. Guess Jeb isn\u0027t the first. Planning a Duna Direct sorta mission with habs and isru en route, and a few companies want ore moved from Ike to Duna, and others from Duna to Ike? Just dropped on the ground, or do they have facilities there (the only reason to want a delivery would be to have someone to receive it).\n\nEvantis, some of the contracts aren\u0027t stupid, *most all of them are*. Most all part testing is bad. Rescues are bad due to inappropriate locations (where I have yet to send a kerbal), and HUGE numbers of them (there must be many competitors as they have more stranded in space than I have astronauts period). Ore contracts are *all* busy work. Sat contracts around any world but Kerbin are absurd. Station or base contracts are all absurd---all should be delivered, then abandoned by the player, they are built for a customer after all, not yourself. Asteroid contracts are also dumb. Ejecting one bound to hit Kerbin would be OK, but landing them? Dumb.

This would be a real reason to set bases and stations. The tourists could then be taken on flights, rover trips, surface visits, etc, from the base or station. \n\nNow, to continue in the format that seems to be happening here:\n\n**Rescues:** Also don\u0027t like the way the are currently. Having other kerbals out there robs you of any pioneering feel.Sure, if you consider the space program as a startup in a world where there are already many space programs, a lot of things about the game make more sense. But it\u0027s just not as interesting. Let the player make the historic first steps.  If there is to be kerbals to rescue, let them be found in places I\u0027ve already been a few times. \n\n**Parts testing:** I don\u0027t mind it, some of the odd things it makes you do can be interesting on kerbin, If you want something tested in space it should be a serious test.\n\n**Explore:** I\u0027d much rather the system Streetwind proposes: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120974-Missions-or-Milestones-Let%E2%80%99s-Expand-On-The-1-0-Contract-System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120974-Missions-or-Milestones-Let%E2%80%99s-Expand-On-The-1-0-Contract-System)\n\n**Surveys**: While there\u0027s nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, they seem a poor excuse for proper [surface exploration](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120014-Procedurally-generate-surface-objects-of-scientific-interest).\n\n**Satellite launches:**  I also don\u0027t mind this. It\u0027s sort of something your space program might be asked to do. But I do think it\u0027s still quit flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead of what happens now, satellites should leave your control once they are in the right orbit, and disappear from the tracking station.\n\nI suppose the same should happen with the base/station contracts. Perhaps they could be saved somewhere, so they can be re-appear if further contracts need you to interact with them.  Though I can see them having a place, being asked to by contracts is was a poor excuse for not having benefits to setting up stations/bases, though that is starting to change, now we have ISRU, and lab processing. (I still want research contracts though.)\n\nContracts do add a lot to the game, but I\u0027d still like some sort of [budget](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3444-An-aproach-to-Time-based-funding)... but that\u0027s a debate for another thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T16:00:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:19:54Z","Content":"What is needed within the current career/contract system (barring a total redo of the whole thing) is to have the contracts actually interact with each other in a meaningful way. That\u0027s in addition to eliminating all the really dumb contracts and replacing them (which is major, since the large majority are simply awful).\n\nAgain, I would like to see at least one new contract type---a MISSION, which belongs to the player to be introduced (it\u0027s just a contract with the player flag as the logo, not difficult). In addition, perhaps player chosen \u0022strategy contracts\u0022 that function as auto-completed contracts in a sense, and those are prerequisites for other contracts, more later...\n\nFor example in Tw1\u0027s tourism suggestion, there would be a station contract, but it would be to explicitly create a space hotel. Completing this contract unlocks contracts to deliver and retrieve tourists from that location.\n\nIn my \u0022Strategy Contract\u0022 suggestion above, there might be \u0022Tourism,\u0022 \u0022Probe Space Exploration,\u0022 Kerballed Space Exploration,\u0022 \u0022Kerbin Orbital Facilities,\u0022 etc, etc. You take \u0022Probe Space Exploration\u0022 and the \u0022contract\u0022 is instantly completed---but that contract is a prerequisite to unlock contracts to place space probes at various bodies (combined with current progress, so if you have already visited the Mun and Minmus, and you selected the probe contract, you\u0027d then get to see Duna, Eve, etc probe contracts).\n\nIt\u0027s a sort of smart, directed filtering. \n\nShort of that, at least have the extant contracts have more prerequisites/requirements before they appear. Have the locations less random, and more directed at some level. Have the Survey contracts (these should be MISSIONS, argh) worthwhile by making them ways to pick landing sites. What if science out off context was grossly lowered in points, and science done\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 scientifically, had a multiplier? First landing is always max data, but each subsequent landing (even in new \u0022biomes\u0022) drops the base points. They come back up in points via scientist skill, and via the survey missions, which direct the scientists to collect from specific areas of interest. Maybe even the multi-part contracts like explore/survey could require they be done in order\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 spitballing here.\n\nUnless parts testing actually unlocks parts, they are just to make stupid contraptions. Most all are just dumb, too. I can see testing a part in vacuum, but there is no possible reason it needs to be tested in identical vacuum over the Mun, or escaping Kerbin, whatever.\n\nStations/bases/satellites built for 3d parties should NOT belong to the player. They should pay out, change ownership, then open new contracts for resupply, repair, or expansion.\n\nOre? Any ore contracts should be predicated upon existing facilities. Moving ore is just dumb---though really ore to fuel should be only X% efficient so the dv budgetary issues are real (hauling ore to refine elsewhere should not be a thing unless you can literally jump off the body in question). A more immersive mission would be to resupply a certain existing facility with X amount of fuel every XX days for a while. Set it up so that IRSU is the ideal (though not only) solution. Moving ore from Gilly to Eve? That\u0027s like a mission to collect some snow on Mt. Everest, and move it to the summit of K2.

Once you get your satellite in orbit, it should become an unknown object like an asteroid or a kerbal to rescue (when you get close to it you get control of it, but if you get too far from it it becomes an unknown object. If you are controlling it and you take it say, too far out of the orbit or off the surface or wherever the company wanted it, the project terminates and you don\u0027t get the rest of the contracts for that project. BASICALLY, a set of contracts making up a project, that build on each other. 1 - get sattelite in orbit. 2 - use that satellite to transmit science from that orbit. 3 - move the satellite to an orbit around a different planet. 4 - land it on the surface, take more science. You get the idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T02:45:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For example in Tw1\u0027s tourism suggestion, there would be a station contract, but it would be to explicitly create a space hotel.

Give the player a reason to set up these things, and see them do it on their own, rather than telling them what to do each step of the way. Informing them they need a station/base to send tourist to would be helpful though."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T03:38:18Z","Content":"What about the dummy contract idea, perhaps? Select \u0022Orbital tourism\u0022 as a contract, and it autocompletes, which unlocks some sort of orbital tourism contracts which otherwise you would not have seen.
