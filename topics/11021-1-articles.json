Since air intakes / nacelles are cosmetic in 0.15, you don\\\u0027t need to bring those (yet)[/li]\n\n[li]You must land on the grass at KSC2, with all the bits of your plane still attached **Edit:** Nevermind, taxiing is so buggy this is unfair. Anything low \u0026 slow enough to toss the package out of the plane will do.[/li]\n\n[li]Your Mission Elapsed Time time ends at \u0027delivery\u0027 of the package (by stopping next to/inside **flying within about 200m** of the 2nd VAB)[/li]\n\nProof of the challenge should be 2 screenshots: one before launch (showing your plane at MET 0:00:00), and the second of your intact plane, stopped, touching **doing a flyby of**  **the VAB at KSC2.
