I also wanted to build a Focke-Wulf [Triebflugel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Triebfl%C3%BCgel) for some weeks now and everything fit together in just a couple of hours.  \n  \nFlight testing took about a day and everything seemed to work just fine, including the very tricky transition to horizontal flight and back again. Like the Roton, this craft has a few rather hair raising places in the flight envelope that guarantees loss of flight control, but so long as you\u0027re methodical and are patient with the rotor pitch controls, you\u0027ll be fine!   \n  \nA few Infernal Robotics and B9 strut tricks were utilized to rotate only the center section of the craft.  \n  \nKSP\u0027s SAS function helps a lot with the control and balance of this craft and it\u0027s not recommended to try turning it off. I\u0027ve tried to engineer it to provide ample warning and graceful failure modes but if the main rotor gets damaged it\u0027s the emergency parachutes for you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)  \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve made a Heinkel Lerche because of your machine but stopped developing it. With the stock parts we have, it is possible, just big, fat \u0026 ugly. Maybe with the new wheels it might be worth another visit. The IR docking plates you use as bearings are in fact a lot harder to recreate in stock KSP, so I have a central spine with the blades rotating around it."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceCars","CreatedById":123026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T14:33:03Z","Content":"Your creation is now featured on Kotaku!

I\u0027m a big fan of Gawker Media blogs like Jalopnik and io9! Thanks for the heads up I\u0027ll go take a look and kinja em! \n\n@Azimech - Heinkel Lerche sounds really fun to make. Even if using IR parts I think I will need to learn how to create bearing races using landing gear. I have a problem with rotor disk expansion under high RPM, partly my fault as I insist on using Procedural Wings which may be heavier or have weaker joints than the stock wing parts. But I\u0027d rather have one long rotor blade flexing in flight than half a dozen small sections..."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T18:33:23Z","Content":"That sounds familiar ...\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BToI8dHGi5A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:46:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That sounds familiar ...\n\u003E [https://youtu.be/BToI8dHGi5A](https://youtu.be/BToI8dHGi5A)\n\nIndeed.
