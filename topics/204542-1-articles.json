First thing\u0027s first- what version of KSP are you on? What mods are you using, and are you sure you have the right versions for your version of KSP as well as all the dependencies they require? (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E will do this automatically, manually installed mods often include their dependencies but not always so worth checking).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis guide shows how to get your log files and what to do with them when you have them:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002275006\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed218184426\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP.log is easier to find (it\u0027s right there in the KSP root folder) but is less detailed, Player.log has more information in it but is harder to find as it\u0027s buried in layers of folders and inside a hidden folder that isn\u0027t always visible. Try to get them both, upload them to a file sharing site and then post links here; don\u0027t post the contents of the logs straight into the forums as it\u0027s an absolute pain to try and read on a PC and nearly impossible on a tablet/phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting past the loading screen and onto a screen with the little planets icon but then crashing is pretty unusual, but to me that suggests that the game has loaded and compiled without any issues but something is then causing problems after that and if that\u0027s the case I\u0027d expect to see a huge spam of errors in the logs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long have you waited on the spinning planets screen? I\u0027ve seen it take several minutes to get through that screen to the main menu with a very heavy load of mods. How much RAM do you have in your PC and how much is being used by KSP when it fails? Open Task Manager (or Activity Monitor if you\u0027re on a Mac) and watch the memory use graph while KSP loads; if it hits 100% then you might be running out of memory which can cause things to go wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Kerbalisation Tech","CreatedById":211297,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-28T12:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo ensure you get the best and the most accurate support, please post logs, screenshots, modlist, computer specs etc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess this is probably a unsupported mod or a\u00A0mod conflict but you could also try waiting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you have a ton (100\u002B) of mods like me, then ksp might pause on the second screen for a LONG time (e.g. 10\u002B mins) so being patient might also be an option\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope this helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
