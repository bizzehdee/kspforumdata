However with rockets we have parts that serve no function at all other than ascetics that need attention, as well as rover parts and ways to pack them on to a rocket are far behind satellites and cargo bays. Not to mention the look alone of the spaceplane crew cabins looks far nicer than the rocket end, granted the MK1(the non pointy one) and MK3 cockpits do still need interior views done yet. Also the plane adapter tanks have fuel in them where as the ones for rockets are still a static part that just adds weight without function, but most of the rocket adapters have this nagging issue.

I\u0027ve gone through only upgrading the SPH and runway, but launching mainly rockets.\n\nEither way, you expand your mass limit and part count limit, and get access to action groups... the launch pad doesn\u0027t do anything the runway can\u0027t.\n\nThere are dimensional limits, but with current aero... pancake rockets are fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Having said that, the recent upgrades and the much heralded version 1 (hurrah!) seem to be overdoing the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Caero\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 side of the game and neglecting the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cspace\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 side of the Kerbal Space Program.\n\nTo be honest, there is not much to do space side...\n\nI suppose the most analogous change to the aero change would be to move to N-body physics... which they aren\u0027t going to do.\n\nNo Lagrange points or binary planets for us...\n\nThe 0.23.5 update gave you a lot to do in space (asteroid intercept)\n\nFine print adds a lot of \u0022space\u0022 things by giving you missions to establish specific orbits\n\nBesides... you don\u0027t really do much in space except small correction burns... almost everything involves interacting with a celestial body.\n\nTo do that, you always have to leave Kerbin, and its atmosphere is very relevant\n\nThere are 3 other planets with atmospheres, compared to 2 without. (although the moon comparision is very different... with just 1 moon with an atmosphere)\n\nAtmospheric modeling is very relevant.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I now have loads of cockpits, cargo bays and passenger modules for aircraft but still have to resort to using the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chitchhiker\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 for all my space stations, bases and spacecraft passenger modules.

You can use \u0022spaceplane\u0022 parts in pure rockets... in many cases, you should.\n\nThe Mk2 parts are definitely spaceplane biased, with the worse mass ratios, but lifting surfaces. In contrast, the Mk3 parts are basically the best rocket parts in the game.\n\nNo tank has a better mass ratio than the mk3 tanks. I also use the mk3 cargobay on some of my larger rockets - although most of the time, its just as a fairing (since once in space, I can just leave something attached by a docking port out in the open), we are getting fairings for rockets, so rejoice.\n\nISRU will favor SSTOs, this is true... but SSTO from where?\n\nI\u0027ve already made extensive use of spaceplanes... SSTOs with 150 ton payloads, and I never took them out of kerbin\u0027s SOI. Spaceplane to orbit, detach the 100% spaceship payload, land. Then I set up a rather large fuel depot, and use SSTO landers.\n\nI see the ISRU as a means to set up fuel depots, and use single stage tugs, landers, etc... why the heck would I use spaceplanes for that? I\u0027ll be leaving the jet engines in LKO unless I\u0027m going to Laythe... and even the wings... I probably won\u0027t take much... like the lander in this photo (ignore the plane... that was modded... what looks like basic jets are actually electric engines)\n\n[https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10646968_10103383186309343_3474581850619943652_n.jpg?oh=9ef96d73ab1f9bfb3eac48cbed264502\u0026oe=55827148\u0026__gda__=1434858541_a601e967f346e97146749ea9c0033871](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10646968_10103383186309343_3474581850619943652_n.jpg?oh=9ef96d73ab1f9bfb3eac48cbed264502\u0026oe=55827148\u0026__gda__=1434858541_a601e967f346e97146749ea9c0033871)\n\n[https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10993422_10103383186199563_5158911516060112349_n.jpg?oh=74619f2d4764553c7aeb459a5d8c6940\u0026oe=554D6806](https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10993422_10103383186199563_5158911516060112349_n.jpg?oh=74619f2d4764553c7aeb459a5d8c6940\u0026oe=554D6806)\n\nThere you see short stubby fins to help guide them to their landing site (like fins on a guided bomb)... that was using NEAR.\n\nThat SSTO refueled from here:\n\n[https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14061_10103383186214533_1729500212287608641_n.jpg?oh=7ef5b5794319f9ea224ca70ae3e3087a\u0026oe=554A024F\u0026__gda__=1435454013_b3101e98cc1173cea4f6de7fb93c5ee8](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14061_10103383186214533_1729500212287608641_n.jpg?oh=7ef5b5794319f9ea224ca70ae3e3087a\u0026oe=554A024F\u0026__gda__=1435454013_b3101e98cc1173cea4f6de7fb93c5ee8)\n\nWhich is the fuel depot \u002B tug/return vehicle...\n\nWith ISRU...
