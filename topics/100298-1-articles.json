It takes less time to cycle through ships/crashes, it\u0027s fancier to look at, and for most people there\u0027s \u0022more to do\u0022 since many of the difficulties in spaceflight are either missing or don\u0027t strike new players as being justified: Who needs to worry about orbital eccentricity when you can stick to good ol\u0027 fashioned up and down, high and low, ground and sky? I get the impression that the relatively silent majority doesn\u0027t touch rockets nearly as much as people think around here. And apparently some of the would-be Youtube personalities get this because they keep churning out plane after plane in FAR, usually emphasizing how it\u0027s modeled after some combat aircraft or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T15:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uncle Mort\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uncle Mort\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst off I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll admit I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do aircraft or spaceplaces; up to the point where I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even upgrade the SPH or the runway.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, given that there is virtually no difference now that we can move subassemblies, or use radial and mirror symetry...
