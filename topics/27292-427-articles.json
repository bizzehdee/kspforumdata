Best of all, it\u0027s got high-efficiency engines capable of driving itself to whatever planets/moons it needs to go to; I\u0027ve tested it, and it\u0027s got just enough to land on Pol from Kerbin orbit. Yes, land; it\u0027s a fully capable lander (TWR 0.3ish), with Kethane drills and refinery, so once I have these around all the critical places I\u0027ll be set. In my old career I had a smaller (200-ton) version of this design at Mun, Minmus, Gilly, Ike, Pol, Vall, and Laythe (refueled from Pol), but in the current career this is my first one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the booster you see in the background is a recoverable SSTO design (nine linked 5m stacks from KW Rocketry, capable of lifting ~500 tons to orbit), which cuts way down on the cost; the Valdez runs about 670k, the booster 2.58M, but recovers for 2.08M.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I put the finishing touches on the latest iteration of my best spaceplane, the \u003Cstrong\u003ESleazy Weasel 7a\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z3ef4D7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z3ef4D7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cRQdplI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cRQdplI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite massing 29 tons, it handles beautifully thanks to well-balanced CoM-CoL and plenty of control surfaces. I\u0027ve got smaller spaceplanes for Kerbin orbit work (launching satellites, recovering Kerbonauts, transferring crew to and from a space station), but this one can do far more. The landing legs let it land on its tail on airless moons (which also explains the spinal ladder), it\u0027s got a small cargo bay and a docking port on the underside, and the full suite of science equipment up front. For engines, it\u0027s got four RAPIERS (ascent in jet mode, and emergency thrust in rocket mode), four hybrid ion radial engines (functionally equivalent to two LV-Ns, used for most orbital work and landing on low-gravity moons), and two ion engines with plenty of Xenon. The ions mean that I can fly this plane to Laythe from Kerbin without refueling (although the burn takes a couple hours even at x4, so go watch a movie), so in theory this design could go to Laythe, land, and come home without stopping for gas anywhere along the way, but thanks to the Valdez depots I\u0027m placing along the way I don\u0027t really need to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually a triple-wing design; the \u0022wings\u0022 you see include a flat piece with all of the flaps, mounted gear, structural supports, etc., plus two angled wing sections above and below placed to seamlessly line up along the edges. Besides looking cool, this gives the design a LOT of lift without huge wing surfaces, and the RCS jets are inside the wing itself. Likewise, the panels over the center section add more lift and allow me to place canard-like leading surfaces without having bits stick out in inconvenient places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a really fun design capable of doing pretty much whatever I need.

The transfer ship made it and dropped off the Kethane scanner in a nice orbit, but ran out of fuel while adjusting the final orbit (stuck at ~300x500km) so I just sent the lander and rover down to start surveying. For some stupid reason I purposely landed about 15km away from where I originally intended to, thinking the terrain was better. It wasn\u0027t. I also just realized that Kerbals only apparently carry one flag at a time. Halfrid was driving around looking for nice places to put a base (and subsequently drive the lander to since there\u0027s not much spare fuel until the rest of the Kethane supplies get here) and yup, can\u0027t plant a second flag. So I pulled one of the radial attachment plugs off the rover (for KAS) and dropped it on the ground instead. Newdon will figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all I can\u0027t complain so far as I haven\u0027t run out of fuel on anything that matters, or broken anything (knock on wood). The rover is *slightly* unstable while docked with a load such as the lander, because I extended the wheelbase a little to prevent flipping with brakes but left the docking port closer to the front. So when it\u0027s actually carrying something it leans forward, probably defeating the purpose. Oh well. Next order of business is make a final decision on where to build this base before my Kethane supplies get here in 51 days and I\u0027m occupied with that. So basically I need to drive to where I think I want to put it (about 10km away as of now) and then drive to the anomaly nearby (about another 10km away from the potential base site, I wanted to be within a reasonable driving distance) and then drive out to the nearest Kethane site to see if it\u0027s a ridiculous amount of trouble to go back and forth, or if I need to move the base. At the very least the base will be out of physics range of the Kethane site in case I step up operations out there and start causing lag. Base will include habitation, solar, fuel storage, a lab, and hopefully a small long range biome hopper with science equipment. At the moment I just have a small Kethane rig on the way to pull behind the rover and use to refill the lander or anything else small that I might send out this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-09-2820-23-46-36.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-09-2820-23-46-36.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-09-2820-59-17-78.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-09-2820-59-17-78.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T01:34:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T03:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday updated my signature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems lots of newbie doing it wrong, and mostly rely on Mechjeb auto ascend and forget the fundamental of reading the Nevball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Moustache- PhD","CreatedById":116050,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T04:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I learned that 9,500 dV is enough to get to Moho, but not enough to get back....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T05:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFINALLY got my my lazy ass and put together the Venus mission video.

This is one of these videos I wish I could rate up more than once. How did you get Venus tho... is that the real system mod or something ? At any rate, this was excellent (music is not obnoxious, and very fitting), lots of attention to details (screen shaking, pressure sounds... wow).\u003Cp\u003EColor me extremely impressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using RSS\u002Bthe RSS visual enhancement mod to get the yellow fussy Venus with clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and in case you\u0027re wondering, your comments weren\u0027t deleted.

I had given up on Tylo until I got the .24.2 \u0022Explore Tylo\u0022 contract, but I still kept plowing into the ground.

In true Kerbal fashion, during the descent that had the best chance, I forgot to hit F5 before screwing up my suicide burn (again).

I did remember to hit F5 this time, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few total failures and a few F9s, I finally was so close... but I still ran out of fuel high enough to blow the lander to pieces.

It ended up being 17 minutes long (I\u0027ve gone insane). Felt the music got a bit obnoxious sometimes but it was really hard to find something that would fit. I think this might be it for my KSP videos. I worked myself into a corner by making this missions bigger and bigger, and I\u0027m not sure I can up this one. I dunno...
