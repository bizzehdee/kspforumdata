The conical adapter part\u00A0Kerbodyne ADTP-2-3 which joins really big Kerbodyne tanks to fairly big Rockomax tanks has lots of space inside it for equipment, considering it is solid and weighs 0.2 t and has similar stats to the shells I felt it ought to provide similar shielding to parts inside it, on launch, from atmosphere effects but it doesnt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put a Communotron 88-88 in there in extended mode on top of the end face of a Kerbodyne S3-3600 tank and while you can do this inside an airstream shell, inside the ADTP-2-3 / tank interface the Communotron broke when the craft began to accelerate at launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought maybe it was an oversight but just wanted to check before making a bug report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-20T14:52:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2016 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T19:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was never intended to do this, sorry, the hollow structure is for show.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T21:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answer sal_vager \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u00A0not a bug then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorkaround is to leave the antenna packed away until the craft is out of the atmosphere, though if the adapter cones are not acting like a fairing I guess anything inside them is causing drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-20T21:52:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2016 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
