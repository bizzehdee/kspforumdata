Oh, and why can\u0027t you deliver an orange tank into orbit with a spaceplane...? It took me a while to refine the design, but I use a cargo plane to deliver orange tanks, landers etc to LKO to resupply expedition vessels. If you attach a fuselage section to the back of the cockpit, put a docking port on the back of it, and then use two girders or truss sections to split the plane in two (i.e. fuel tanks and wings on each side, with a big gap in the middle for the payload) it works pretty well as long as it\u0027s suitably strutted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T06:31:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KBluey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
