I just launched it from the launchpad, but all of a sudden my spaceship is stuck in space, camera cant see it, and it says that it\u0027s at 72 meters at Kerbin. I thought the save file was corrupted, so I deleted each and everyone one of them, and when I launched a new one from scratch, it was still stuck for the Space Center. Please help me out! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E Oh, and I forgot to mention, the ship had some weapons from the BDArmory mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
