Some sort of [All / None / Custom] selector for pre-completed science could be very convenient.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T03:44:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OrbitusII**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:44:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Everytime I create a new save for whatever reason....\n\nAh, well I didn\u0027t consider you creating a whole new save often enough for this to be an issue.\n\nWell fine if you\u0027re looking for a permanent solution across saves then you gift yourself the science, go and unlock all the nodes, then just save a copy of the entire SCENARIO node for ResearchAndDevelopment. Boom. Done.\n\nIn older versions of the game, since you had to purchase individual parts, this wouldn\u0027t work as well without an exact listing of all the parts you\u0027ve also unlocked. but now you just need to unlock the node, so even if you had different parts as long as these lines are there\n\n    Tech{   id = [node name]   state = Available} \n\nAll parts for that node will be unlocked. So when you create a new save just copy your complete unlocked SCENARIO node over the new one in the SFS file.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T05:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden**"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:00:21Z","Content":"This request seems a variant of the more-common \u0022I want contracts in Sandbox mode/Science mode\u0022.\n\nThe only thing Squad could do to appease everyone at once is make a \u0022Custom\u0022 mode:\n\n[x] Gather science\n\n[x] Start with full tech tree (but you can still do science experiments)\n\n[x] Gather money\n\n[x] Unlimited funds (but you can still gather money)\n\n[x] Start with unlocked buildings\n\n[x] Start with max XP Kerbals\n\n[x] Do contracts\n\nThis would be really difficult to test every variation, though.\n\nAt some point Squad has to say \u0022we can\u0027t please everyone, these 3 options cover 99% of what people want\u0022, especially since there is a workaround for the few that want something custom - edit the persistent.sfs file (or use [this mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89473)) and then click 20 times."},{"CreatedByName":"Scientist","CreatedById":129760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:14:33Z","Content":"MM script to set all parts to starttech?
