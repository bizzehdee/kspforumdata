One is for Eve and the other is for Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile checking today if my Eve Sentinel was happy with its orbit, I looked more closely at the contract orbit requirements and was puzzled to see that the orbit is ABOVE Eve - I looked at it in map mode and it\u0027s outside Eve\u0027s orbit at all points. I then checked the Kerbin contract and it\u0027s even more perverse - it\u0027s all the way out near Duna (semi-major axis in the SFS file for that one is 19.05 Gm).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust for the hell of it, I sent a Sentinel out to match the Kerbin contract requirements and sure enough the Sentinel now says it\u0027s mapping Duna. When I warped heavily I was seeing some asteroids detected for that contract but then I realised I still had another valid Kerbin-mapping Sentinel active, and when I switched it off and warped for hundreds more days, not a single Kerbin asteroid was matched to the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess this is a (fresh?) bug. Anyone able to confirm?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve posted in the modded section because I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u0027s up to date as far as I can see (3.12.0.0) but this doesn\u0027t really feel like it can be a mod-induced problem anyway, given that the contract itself is fundamentally broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: it might be relevant that during the long high-speed warps, I saw an error flash up in the top right corner of my screen a few times - orange text, saying \u0022[ContractSystem]: Attempted to generate contract with no celestial bodies available.\u0022 I have no clue how to interpret this but it doesn\u0027t look healthy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-01T20:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2020 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Neilski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eaddendum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-01T21:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve encountered that in 1.8.1, most of the Kerbin orbits are well beyond Kerbin and the Eve contracts are requiring orbits closer to what were previously Kerbin contracts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
