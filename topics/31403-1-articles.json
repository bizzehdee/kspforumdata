But something like that is probably beyond the scope of KSP right? Well consider my findings on a flight today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a satellite carrying an ISA Mapsat dish to map the Munar surface in preparation for an Apollo style landing, placing it into a perfectly circular orbit of 150 km. In order for the Mapsat to do its thing, I left the game running and went to bed. Upon waking up, I checked the game, and found that the orbit had gone completely bonkers (for lack of a better term,) decaying its PE to 96 km, while its AP had gone to 226 km. The flight is still going, and I will monitor it until it crashes. I have telemachus installed, so I\u0027ll post a graph later if it shows anything of value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBug, feature, or noobish observation that I\u0027ll get flamed for?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T00:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you left the engine running at a low throttle. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stazi","CreatedById":68773,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T00:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the satellite have MechJeb on it or any form of ASAS?
