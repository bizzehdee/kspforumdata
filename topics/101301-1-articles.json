The only time I was unable to play a game I bough, it was because Steam was belly up. There\u0027s no reason for that, a single player game shouldn\u0027t need an Internet connection (or a client you can setup to be in offline mode). Period. Cards? Library? What the hell is that and why would I care about it?! I want to play the game, not exchange cards or whatever you do with them. I spent 20 years gaming with out a library of games in the cloud, I certainly don\u0027t need one now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the fact remains that the game looks cool and I can wait 5 years until it goes on sale at gog.com for 9.95. I have plenty of other games. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
