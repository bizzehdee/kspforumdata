Squad has also made it pretty clear that they will not add them to the stock game. I just want to know what you personally think of adding them to your games. This could be really important with multi-player on the way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T19:21:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Netskimmer**\n  \nClarification"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:17:36Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see a poll. My opinion: KSP is a sandbox game. The devs have made it clear that they won\u0027t add weapons in stock, because the focus of the game is on exploration. But it\u0027s a sandbox game set in space. Sci-fi space battles are cool, so people are naturally going to have them. I have no problem with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:28:15Z","Content":"Poll is up, for some reason, you have to make the post first, then add the poll."},{"CreatedByName":"LtWhiskers","CreatedById":140372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:28:18Z","Content":"Sorry can\u0027t find your poll but it\u0027s a good question. Obviously based on opinion but I\u0027ve found militarization can be quite fun, even if it does make me feel guilty enlisting unsuspecting kerbals. Even playing in stock it necessitates all sorts of fun logistical aspects. Ammo resupply ships, crew transport, rescue and recovery and of course armoring your craft. Frankly though, I\u0027m back to pure exploration/science collection since the changes in 1.0 have made me reconsider design aspects. I may militarize again, but for now I\u0027m content with the new challenges with heat and aero."},{"CreatedByName":"Draconiator","CreatedById":133772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:35:36Z","Content":"Just to be clear, I would never INTENTIONALLY target a manned ship/station/craft...Unmanned is fair game though."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T00:37:14Z","Content":"First off, let me say **thank you**.

There\u0027s been a lot of crossover in the real world; almost all of the early space launchers were built from military hardware, the early astronauts were military pilots, and even today the pilots are usually active duty military.
