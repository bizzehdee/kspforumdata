Only the surface of Europa is bombarded by that radiation. The ocean is protected by something probably like 50 km of ice and probably has much less radiation that even the surface of the Earth does, as we\u0027re \u0022only\u0022 protected by a magnetic field and a comparatively thin atmosphere, \u003Cstrong\u003Enot 50 km of solid ice\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I haven\u0027t seen it verified or not, but I do remember a paper suggesting that Europa\u0027s oceans could be oxygenated by Jupiter\u0027s radiation. If I remember correctly, the way it would work is that radiation would break down water ice into hydrogen and oxygen in the surface ice. Some millions of years later, the surface ice might get subducted into the ocean and melt, releasing the oxygen. So Jupiter\u0027s radiation could even be benefitual for Europan sea life. However, for all we know, oxygen impedes the genesis of life by oxidizing biological molecules before they can self-organize into something more complicated. So it\u0027s also possible that oxygen in Europa\u0027s oceans could keep Europa sterile! (Oxygen in Earth\u0027s atmosphere didn\u0027t exist until life produced it, so it was not present during the genesis of life on Earth.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you have no way of saying that life on Europa wouldn\u0027t resemble life on Earth.
