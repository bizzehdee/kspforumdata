Only the surface of Europa is bombarded by that radiation. The ocean is protected by something probably like 50 km of ice and probably has much less radiation that even the surface of the Earth does, as we\u0027re \u0022only\u0022 protected by a magnetic field and a comparatively thin atmosphere, **not 50 km of solid ice**.\n\nAdditionally, I haven\u0027t seen it verified or not, but I do remember a paper suggesting that Europa\u0027s oceans could be oxygenated by Jupiter\u0027s radiation. If I remember correctly, the way it would work is that radiation would break down water ice into hydrogen and oxygen in the surface ice. Some millions of years later, the surface ice might get subducted into the ocean and melt, releasing the oxygen. So Jupiter\u0027s radiation could even be benefitual for Europan sea life. However, for all we know, oxygen impedes the genesis of life by oxidizing biological molecules before they can self-organize into something more complicated. So it\u0027s also possible that oxygen in Europa\u0027s oceans could keep Europa sterile! (Oxygen in Earth\u0027s atmosphere didn\u0027t exist until life produced it, so it was not present during the genesis of life on Earth.)\n\nAlso, you have no way of saying that life on Europa wouldn\u0027t resemble life on Earth. Life tends to seek optimal solutions, and as such, it seems highly possible that life on other planets could closely resemble life on Earth, especially at the cellular level, with the most major differences being different DNA bases or a different chirality of proteins.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T15:16:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T15:16:05Z","Content":"Radiation in gas giants\u0027 belts doesn\u0027t penetrate more than 10-20 metres of ice (and I was very generous here). 5.4 Sv/day = 0.225 Sv/h of protons and electrons.

Well, that just happens to be the layer that gets the most sunlight in the ocean, meaning that lots of photosynthesis happens there. Most life is in the oceans, and there\u0027s a lot in that area to eat thanks to all the photosynthetic lifeforms. It\u0027s a great place, all right. Turns out there is quite a lot of life there. But since there isn\u0027t one of those on Europa, and it has tidal heating throughout the moon, life can happen.\n\nBut if it has happened, it\u0027s probably prokaryotic or at best very early eukaryotic."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T08:39:39Z","Content":"Yes, it can.\n\nAnd if this is so, the life will be concentrated where the sunken edibles and volcanic gases concentrations are max - i.e. at the bottom.\n\nSo the life distribution would be 2d (upon a surface), not 3d.\n\nEarth surface is 100 times greater than Europa\u0027s one.\n\nSo, on Earth there were 100 more places for life to take a chance to appear - and a sunlight energy.\n\nI.e. on Europa: maybe, if we\u0027re lucky, in several spots on the ocean bottom 50 km below the ice, we can find some strange micro-bubble colonies with chemical reaction cycles, primitive even if compare them to Earth bacteria."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T08:51:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, it can.\n\u003E And if this is so, the life will be concentrated where the sunken edibles and volcanic gases concentrations are max - i.e. at the bottom.\n\u003E \n\u003E So the life distribution would be 2d (upon a surface), not 3d.\n\u003E \n\u003E Earth surface is 100 times greater than Europa\u0027s one.\n\u003E \n\u003E So, on Earth there were 100 more places for life to take a chance to appear - and a sunlight energy.\n\u003E \n\u003E I.e. on Europa: maybe, if we\u0027re lucky, in several spots on the ocean bottom 50 km below the ice, we can find some strange micro-bubble colonies with chemical reaction cycles, primitive even if compare them to Earth bacteria.\n\nThere is NO 2d at all in this universe. All objects are 3d.\n\nPlus, you\u0027re using Europa\u0027s surface, not the sunken area.\n\nAll things would float down until they become buoyant. So, in the middle, in a nice three dimensional area.\n\nThere\u0027s not a hundred times more places for life to appear. You need to take into account all of the requirements of life. That limits you. Then, Europa and Earth are actually pretty equal. I mean, life had to form either in a hotspring or near geothermal vents. A heat source is very likely to have life if possible. Europa has a lot more water, and more sources of heat. \n\nLife could not have formed on the solid surface of the earth (well, some kinds of life MIGHT, but not very many, as they come later on in history). That immediately removes almost 1/4 of your \u0022100 times greater area\u0022 thing going on. Then you rule out places too cold.... And more of Europa\u0027s ocean is warm. They\u0027re pretty close. But, no photosynthesis could occur in Europa, it would have to be chemosynthesis. Which has happened on Earth."}]}
