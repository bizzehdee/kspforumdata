Why else make it look like a J-2X, compared to the 4 RS-25s of the 3.75m booster? To me, that Isp range makes perfect sense, when you consider the Mainsails and Mammoths to be lower stages (F-1, RS-25), the KR-2L, LV-T45, and Skipper to be upper stages / sustainers (LR-105, LR-91, J-2), and the LV-909/Poodle to be vacuum engines (RL10)."}]}
