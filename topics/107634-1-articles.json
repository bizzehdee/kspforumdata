Good enough for government work and a lowly 63 Parts. Potato friendly!\n\n![lOuX3g2.png](http://i.imgur.com/lOuX3g2.png)\n\nIt will misbehave if you let it, it requires finesse. However you are rewarded with overpowered manoeuvrability and the feeling that this truly is a fighter jet. This was more for aesthetics than replicating the performance. Ideally it should use smaller control surfaces but wanted to use the wet wing. For a more realistic thrust level, limit the two turbojets to at least 50%. She\u0027s a touch twitchy if you keep her on the ground beyond 40-50m/s at full power. Some weird torque got into it that I cannot seem to fix. It will bite you if you ham-fist it, it will tickle you pink if you caress the controls.\n\nFeel free to use this as a base and improve two areas: The front nose - I\u0027m going crazy trying to figure it out.
