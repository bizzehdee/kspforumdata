Granted I am running a lot of mods but it shouldn\u0027t really be an issue. I have had to turn down some of my settings because of it. I have a good PC that can run Arma 3 king of the hill on standard settings at 30 FPS with 30 players and that is a VERY intensive gamemode. I have been playing this game for 1 1/2 years on this PC and longer on my old one but haven\u0027t really had any performance issues until 1.0.4 came about.
