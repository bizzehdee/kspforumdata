For example, according to TT loading distance needs to be reset while switching vessels, and then set again (which might result in race conditions). From what i can tell, you\u0027re elegantly avoiding this, by letting the engine do this checking: You keep an instance of the class attached to the craft, and then if the craft during vessel switch is removed, you destroy the instance. At least, that\u0027s how i understand it - maybe the instance-destruction actually covers even more situations as a sideeffect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it is basically those attributes i posted that do stuff.

The reason is quite simple: Say you have 10 vessels landed on the surface somewhere, you have a lazor enabled craft in orbit within the set loading distance from the landed vessels. If you then timewarp at max timewarp you will then rapidly load and unload those vessels every time you make a pass. This will eventually lead to a crash because the engine can\u0027t handle loading and unloading that fast.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that happens on high time acceleration, because of rapid orbiting, then why potentially destroy vessels as soon as timewarp is not exactly 1?
