You typically end up with all readable text collected into a single structured document and that can greatly help with proof reading and maintaining it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf later you do choose to translate it you\u0027ve already got all the human specific stuff completely separate from the code and you can then get linguists in who have no understanding of the code to just translate the documents. As you say, I think Squad should out-source the translation to the community, but without i18n that becomes problematic as you have to bring more people under NDA and into the code base. Using i18n means the translators don\u0027t need to go anywhere near the code so out-sourcing to the community is simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehowever, the discussion about translation (as interesting as it is) is kinda off topic for this thread. Complete text translation is something worth considering, but initially its just the presentation of different numerical formats that I feel needs addressing. i18n is a possible solution to that and implementing it for numerical formats would start paving the way for further i18n implementation later (but that is a whole other can-o-worms!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/edit]\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-04T10:54:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2014 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T16:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like it should be pointed out that this is a Mexican PR company making this video game.
