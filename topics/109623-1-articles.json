But this is not the only place where you will run into this. also when doing getting science from part testing you always get whole numbers. which has effect that 100% (normal) you would get 9 sciences this means that in 10% play you get nothing.\n\nI get the feel that this is an overlooked effect of working with integers although science itself is stored in (ad least) one decimal"}]}
