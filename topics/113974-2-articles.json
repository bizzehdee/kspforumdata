They really weren\u0027t bad if you just knew how to cook them. Bit stringy though. She had prepared it with some wild onions and fresh kelp. The kelp was a nice surprise, she\u0027d never had it before. Its salty fishiness complemented the mosquitoiness of the mosquito. Her pressure suit and flight clothes were hung up to dry next to the fire, and she could feel the chill in the air as the frost crept in. She didn\u0027t mind, the cold never bothered her anyway. You didn\u0027t last long in Kerberia if you didn\u0027t tolerate the cold.\n\nKerberia. Could she really be home? Well, not *home* home. That must be hundreds of kilometers to the east still. She wondered if it was even there anymore. It would have been abandoned and empty for years now. Ever since she left to join the Air Force. The cold crept in a little more.\n\nSo did something in the underbrush behind her. She tossed it a bit of mosquito. It chittered happily and scurried off. Until something else found it, chittered happily, and scurried off. Until something else found *it*, garrumphed loudly, and crashed off back into the forest. Such was life in the taiga. Eat or be eaten. Do what you must to survive, and never make noise. Her *deda* had always been emphatic about that.\n\nValentina sighed softly, and looked up at the stars spread out overhead. In the taiga, it always seemed that the colder it was, the clearer it was. Unless it was snowing. Or freezing fog. Or freezing rain. Or a blizzard. It was on nights like this back when she was just a kerbling, that she would sit with her *deda* on the sod roof of their little cabin, wrapped in layers of warm fur and his wiry, old arms, his perpetual old-kerb stubble scratching at her cheek, and he would name the stars for her.\n\n*\u0022...that one is Harry, and that\u0027s Dave, and Bob, and that blinky one is Jeb...\u0022*\n\nHe could be a little senile at times. They would sit like that, sometimes for hours, until long after their faces had gone numb and that old scar over his eye had turned as white as the snow. She missed him now.\n\n*Never make noise noise,* that\u0027s what he\u0027d always said. Well, she had made plenty of noise today. The first of her people in space. However briefly. And it had been a disaster. Kerbin, from space, was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. She\u0027d never felt closer to home, like she *belonged*. She had to get back up there, she *had* to. And yet...\n\nValentina looked up at the pale, bright disc of the M\u00FCn. It seemed to be silently mocking her. Why had it terrified her so? Like a child. A child, afraid of the dark. She wasn\u0027t one to give in to such childishness. But for that one awful moment, she could have sworn that the M\u00FCn was... looking at her.\n\nLike the creatures in the forest were looking at her now.\n\nOn cue, some unpleasant hairy thing with huge teeth and tiny eyes crept out of the underbrush towards her. It gnashed its terrible teeth and rolled its beady eyes and showed its terrible claws. Valentina gave it a look. It quickly retreated back towards the underbrush. Until some other unpleasant hairy thing with smaller teeth but bigger eyes found it.\n\nThe M\u00FCn. She supposed that would be the new goal, now that the Foreigners\u0027 lead had been narrowed. Today\u0027s flight *was* a major accomplishment, after all. Just had a minor mechanical defect, that\u0027s all. The *Strannik* series was the Union\u0027s most reliable launch vehicle, this must have been just a fluke. Dibella wouldn\u0027t be in any real danger... would she? The scaffolding Valentina saw the night before the launch must have knocked something loose. Just a simple mistake, nothing to be concerned about. In fact--\n\nShe blinked.\n\nShe was doing it again. She closed her tired eyes and rubbed the wide, flat spot between them. Fatigue? Exhaustion? Nerves? No. It was like there were competing whispers in her head, all vying for attention at once. And at the back of it all, formless and indistinct just below the murky surface, was a memory she couldn\u0027t grasp.\n\nValentina sighed again, and laid down on a pile of fresh spruce boughs nestled between the fire and the log. It blocked her view of the M\u00FCn, thankfully. She stared up at the stars. Growing up in the taiga, you learned to see the things just out of sight, hear the things just beyond hearing. To recognize the patterns. She could sense... something. But couldn\u0027t focus on it. That wasn\u0027t like her, and that, she realized, terrified her.\n\n*Never make noise*, her *d* *eda* had always said, *do what you must to survive. And never, ever take sides.*\n\nHe would never talk about it. Only a word here or there when groggy with tea and asked just so. But over the years, she\u0027d pieced enough of it together. Her parents had done something awful. And one day Kerbs from the Imperium had come and taken them away.\n\nWith that thought lingering, Valentina drifted off into a troubled and restless sleep beneath the light of the full M\u00FCn. Occasionally through the night, strange furry things crept out out of the forest, but none of them dared come near.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nShe was awoken by a familiar low, rumbling whine in the distance. She quickly stoked the smoldering fire and threw some fresh spruce branches on, sending a thin pall of grey smoke into the clear morning sky. It wasn\u0027t long before the drone began getting louder. Ki-24 VTOL transports, called \u0022Converters\u0022 for their unparalleled ability to convert fuel into noise. Sounded like half a dozen, standard search pattern. The hellacious noise sound grew and grew, drowning out the morning cacophony of the taiga and sending waves of terrified furry things scurrying and leaping, occasionally right into the mouth of some other furry thing, which was quite a surprise for both. Whoever the pilot was, he was flying extremely low.\n\nFinally the airborne leviathan lumbered into sight over the treetops and then out over the water, perhaps a hundred meters up the beach from where Valentina was standing. Its wide tandem wings and stout, bumpy form gave it a bizarrely organic look that was unique among typically utilitarian Ussari aircraft. She waved. A red flare fired from a dorsal turret indicated she\u0027d been spotted. The aircraft continued to circle, the others joining up one by one or flying low passes over the beach. Until yesterday the noise would have been staggering, but now Valentina thought nothing *(sound)* could compare to *(the world became sound)* that rocket blast.\n\nThe lead aircraft broke off, rounded back towards the beach, and then grew even *louder* as its weight transferred from the wings to its straining engines. In a bold maneuver, the pilot nosed in directly at the tree line, deftly setting down on the narrow strip of beach between the trees and surf while avoiding the scattered driftwood. Before the engines had even spooled down several figures were running towards her. The largest one quickly outpaced the others and in an instant Igor had scooped her up and was turning her over roughly in his huge hands.\n\n\u0022Are you well are you hurt where is wound I bring bandage have you eaten I bring food--?\u0022\n\n\u0022Igor! Igor,\u0022 Valentina protested, \u0022I am fine! Put me down.\u0022 He gently set her on he ground, looking slightly abashed. She smiled, \u0022there is leftover mosquito by the fire.\u0022 Igor\u0027s eyes lit up as he set off. She had only a moment\u0027s respite, though.\n\n\u0022TIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\u0022 Dibella glomped into her, nearly knocking her down, the dangling oxium mask from the other\u0027s pilot helmet smacking her in the face and offering a teasing promise of breath as her lungs were squeezed, \u0022I knew you were ok! IknewitIknewitIknewit!\u0022 Dibella bounced up and down to a percussive symphony of popping joints. Just when Valentina thought she would black out *again*, Tercella showed up and peeled the other Kerbal off.\n\n\u0022You scared the P\u0426TI\u0419 out of us,\u0022 (\u0022Language!\u0022) she said, her own hug enthusiastic but without the messy dislocations and crushed vertebrae, \u0022when we lost the telemetry feed, we feared the worst.\u0022\n\n\u0022How did you find me so soon?\u0022 Valentina asked.\n\n\u0022Emergency beacon in the pod,\u0022 said Dibella, \u0022when we lost *that* signal too, the panic really started.\u0022\n\n\u0022Valentina.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419.*\n\n\u0022Sergei.\u0022\n\nHe wore his typical smug look, \u0022so it seems you have survived after all.\u0022 He looked around at the simple campsite and once-deserted beach, now swarming with more and more security and recovery crews fast-roping down from the other hovering Converters.\n\nShockingly, he held out his left hand, \u0022nicely done.\u0022 Valentina shook it awkwardly, the other one did indeed look like an eggplant.\n\n\u0022Comrade Pilot!\u0022 The four turned and quickly saluted the Political Officer, \u0022or shall I say, Comrade *Kerbonaut*,\u0022 then *he* held out a hand with a vice-like grip, \u0022the Kommissar sends his regrets that he could not be here personally, but he is a busy Kerb. Yet it is a wondrous day! A glorious day! You have reclaimed our pride by being the first Ussari in space!\u0022\n\n\u0022So... I did make it to space, then?\u0022\n\nHe grinned widely beneath his huge mustache, \u0022Indeed! You were tracked on radar to an altitude of just over 140 kilometers. Of course, we weren\u0027t sure at the time if you were actually alive or not or which track was you, but since you are here now, you must have survived, D\u0414?\u0022\n\n\u0022Now, where is the pod?\u0022 He asked, scanning around the area. Valentina sheepishly pointed to the sea. His grin faded, \u0022oh... well, then... I shall have to modify my report...\u0022 he scratched his chin and mumbled to himself. Then he noticed the others staring at him, and clapped Valentina roughly on the shoulders. \u0022This is a great day, a Great day!\u0022 He leaned in and whispered to her, \u0022never speak of it again.\u0022\n\n\u0022AIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!\u0022 A security Kerb suddenly burst from the tree line nearby with his arms flailing wildly. Something that looked rather like a hairpiece with feet was making little barking noises and trying with surprising success to eat his rucksack, \u0022get it off me, get it off meeeeeee!\u0022 Dibella took a step closer to Valentina, eyes wide.\n\nThe Political Officer sighed and put a hand to his face, \u0022ah, a Political Officer\u0027s work is never done. Tonight, we celebrate, Comrades! Glory to Arstotzka\u0022 and he set off towards the screams.\n\nThe four Kerbals stared.\n\n\u0022Why does he say that?\u0022 Asked Valentina.\n\n\u0022You there, furry thing, papers, please!\u0022\n\n\u0022I haven\u0027t the slightest...\u0022 Said Dibella.\n\n\u0022I can feel it chewing! Aaaaaaahhhhh!\u0022\n\n\u0022What is an Arzotska anyway?\u0022 Asked Tercella.\n\n\u0022Quite the grip it has!\u0022\n\n\u0022Perhaps a kind of cheese, D\u0414?\u0022 Said Sergei.\n\n\u0022No that\u0027s *my* hair!\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414, definitely some sort of cheese.\u0022\n\nRustling in the brush drew their attention. They watched, silently, as a headless mosquito blundered past, feeling its way along the ground. Dibella edged closer still.\n\n\u0022Such strange things here...\u0022 Mused Sergei. Chittering drew his attention the other way, and there, sitting on the end of a branch, was yet another small, furry thing. This one was tiny, covered in fur that looked luxuriously soft, with a long, bushy tail, oversized, bright, beady eyes, short, floppy ears, puffy cheeks, and long whiskers that gave it a perpetual welcoming smile. It circled the end of the branch one way, then the other, then chittered some more and waved its whiskers at Sergei. He approached.\n\n\u0022Ah, Sergei...\u0022\n\n\u0022What an endearing little creature...\u0022 He poked a stubby finger at it. It stretched its nose out at him.\n\n\u0022I would not do that if I were you...\u0022\n\n\u0022Pfft,\u0022 he turned to Valentina, \u0022you can\u0027t possibly expect me to believe this adorable little thing is dangerous.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, no, not really *him*,\u0022 she said, looking up, \u0022but his kin on the branches above you could strip you to the bone in less than a minute.\u0022 Dibella hid behind her. Sergei looked up into dozens of pairs of bright, beady eyes. One of them chittered.\n\n\u0022I... think... I\u0027llbegoingnow--\u0022 he bolted for the nearest Converter, going up the dangling rope with impressive speed considering he had to climb over the two Kerbals climbing down.\n\n\u0022Is... is that true?\u0022 Said Dibella from behind Valentina, \u0022to the bone?\u0022\n\nValentina rolled her eyes, \u0022well, they mostly hunt at night. Mostly.\u0022 Dibella\u0027s huge eyes darted nervously back and forth.\n\nTercella wrapped her arms around both their necks, \u0022bah, enough with the scary-scary! Let\u0027s go home, before I actually start to miss the smell of yak.\u0022 She led them off towards the waiting Converter.\n\nValentina noticed she *was* actually starting to feel normal again. Had all this craziness really been less than twenty-four hours? She knew there would be days of debriefings and questions and interrogations ahead, but such was the way of things. She was beginning to look forward to that dinner with Director Kermanev.\n\nYet in the back of her mind, something still whispered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T20:21:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T19:00:00Z","Content":"Judging by the numerous types of furry yet terrifying critters you managed to get on a single beach, I would definitely see myself volunteering to sit atop a few hundred tonnes of rocket fuel and would consider it a safe option !!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T11:32:34Z","Content":"**Chapter 9: Reclining at Table**\n\n\u0022...And so she says... she says... she says...\u0022 Director Kermanev fought through bales of laughter, then shifted his deep voice up a few octaves, \u0022but honey, this one\u0027s eating my *golubtsy*!\u0022 Valentina joined in now, the pair of them howling with laughter across the small table. Director Kermanev slapped his hand on the table, making the half-empty plates clink and knocking over the empty bottle in the middle.\n\n\u0022But seriously,\u0022 he said, coughing and chortling, \u0022vile, vile creatures. If ever you find yourself there, never sleep by water. They say the taste lingers for days.\u0022 More laughter erupted.\n\n\u0022Days?\u0022 Valentina asked, wiping away a tear.\n\n\u0022So I am told. And speaking of taste, you really must try the *okroshka*, the chef has truly outdone himself this time.\u0022 The chef chose this moment to appear with fresh plates and a full bottle. The look on his face seemed like he took the compliment as a personal insult. He roughly exchanged plates then returned to the kitchen.\n\n\u0022Oh, no, thank you,\u0022 Valentina said, still giggling, \u0022I never did gain the taste for soured milk. In Kerberia, milk never sours, it just freezes.\u0022\n\nAll expression suddenly left the Director\u0027s face. \u0022D\u0414,\u0022 he said, staring intently at something very far away, \u0022D\u0414.\u0022\n\nSensing the awkwardness, Valentina took a mouthful from another plate, \u0022but the humidity is excellent, and so early in the season, too.\u0022\n\nDirector Kermanev shook himself, \u0022er, yes, from a collective farm outside Kermangrad. They\u0027re expecting a bumper crop so I was able to pull some strings. Hard to come by this time of year.\u0022\n\nThe dinner had been quite pleasant so far. The Director\u0027s residence was typical of buildings on the facility: simple, stout, and hastily constructed. He had few decorations, but good, solid wood furniture that showed the scars of years of use. As one of the Four, Valentina always ate well, but this had been a veritable feast! *Borscht*, of course, and *shchi*, and *pelmeni* and *pirogi*. Black bread, and stuffed roasted this-and-that, with plenty of *kvass* to wash it all down, and of course, being Kerbals, the two knew how to eat.\n\nIt was all a welcome relief. As she had expected, it had been days of debriefings and reports and questioning. The Imperium, the Academy of Sciences, the design bureaus, even the Ministry of the Interior, who weren\u0027t happy about several kilos of hydrazine dumped in a critical fishery. The pair of officers from the NKOTB were actually the most agreeable. The Director, as it turned out, was wonderful company was filled with amusing stories that sent them roaring with laughter until he broke into another coughing fit.\n\nHe sighed and sat back for a moment, \u0022it is a great thing you have done. You\u0027ve single-handedly saved the crewed space program. If you\u0027d wound up like that Foreigner- what was his name, Edmund?\u0022 he shook his head, \u0022the Imperium wouldn\u0027t tolerate a propaganda loss like that. Even the Academy couldn\u0027t turn that around.\u0022\n\n\u0022I almost didn\u0027t,\u0022 she said with a touch of irritation, \u0022if I hadn\u0027t got past the control lockout--\u0022\n\n\u0022Hah-haah!\u0022 The Director clapped his hands and shook a finger at her with a smile, \u0022I *knew* you would figure it out!\u0022 Valentina blinked, then took a long quaff of *kvass*.\n\n\u0022The Kommissar insisted that there be a code, but he didn\u0027t say it had to be a good one! So I picked something simple, easily guessed. The same one I use on my luggage, and-- my dear, are you quite all right?\u0022\n\nValentina was gagging and choking on inhaled *kvass*.\n\n\u0022--Fine,\u0022 she croaked. \u0022Swallowed wrong,\u0022 she coughed.\n\nThe Director pinched his eye... bulges, \u0022oh... well... At any rate, that formality has been done away with. There will be no control lock on Dibella\u0027s flight. The abort system has been configured to automatically trigger if gee-force exceeds expected levels as well.\u0022\n\nValentina was still choking, \u0022the flight is going ahead? After what happened?\u0022\n\n\u0022It is. The Kommissar was quite insistent. Learn what we can from failures but keep forging ahead,\u0022 he glanced around the room, then lowered his voice, \u0022someone in the Imperium is breathing down his neck. They\u0027re anxious to use this... lull... to gain parity with the Foreigners.\u0022\n\nPolitics again. She brushed it aside, \u0022but Dibella... sir, what *happened?*\u0022\n\nHe sighed again, and put his hands on the table, \u0022I wish I knew. Right away, I had the upper stage from her rocket pulled and test fired, the next three in storage too.\u0022 He paused, and lurched into another bout of dry, hacking coughs.\n\n\u0022*Izvinitye, izvinitye*, too many years breathing rocket fumes,\u0022 he thumped a fist against his chest, then shook his head slowly, \u0022every firing was perfect. Exactly on the numbers. Zero anomalies. I\u0027ve read your report, it just doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u0022\n\nHe raised a hand before she could protest, \u0022I believe every word of it. I just don\u0027t understand.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... what could cause something like that?\u0022 Asked Valentina.\n\n\u0022The only thing I could surmise would be a flaw in the engine casing,\u0022 he absently twirled a hand in the air as he spoke, \u0022the flaw allows the casing to buckle and balloon, the expanded casing allows more propellant to be exposed to the flame front, more burning propellant raises the internal pressure and thrust and the casing balloons *more*, exposing *more* propellant to the flame front... and so on until the motor either burns out or ruptures.\u0022 Another round of coughing.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s possible I suppose, but the RT-10 is one of our oldest and most reliable engines, and I\u0027ve personally inspected every one that comes in and never found a defect. It\u0027s very simple to manufacture.\u0022\n\n\u0022So there\u0027s no way to know?\u0022 She asked.\n\nHe gave her a pained look, \u0022not unless more debris is recovered. I have teams out searching but it\u0027s spread over a wide area, most of it taiga, so any debris that survived reentry will be difficult to find, if it hasn\u0027t already been eaten by something.\u0022\n\nHe cough-sighed, \u0022so without something more concrete, Dibella\u0027s flight goes forward. But I don\u0027t think you should be worried. This *is* rocket science, after all. Failure is how we learn, and I *did* learn from this incident, and made what corrections I can.\u0022\n\n\u0022You are sure?\u0022 Valentina asked.\n\n\u0022As sure as I can be. Listen, many things are about to change. I can\u0027t go into much detail, but... very shortly any problems with the *Strannik* series will become irrelevant. We march ever onward. But there are still two unassigned orbiters left. Flight-worthy test articles, leftovers. Since we have them anyway, I\u0027m going to lobby the Academy for two more long-duration orbital flights before the close of the series. You and Dibella will each get your time in orbit. I just don\u0027t know how your rocket could have malfunctioned in that way unless something was tam--\u0022 he stopped, wide eyed, and looked furtively around the room again.\n\nValentina blinked, many questions in her eyes.\n\nDirector Kermanev laughed. It sounded forced.\n\n\u0022But, that\u0027s just the paranoid ramblings of an old man! Whatever happened on your launch was surely just a fluke.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, I suppose you are right,\u0022 Valentina said uneasily, \u0022if there *was* a defect, that inspection the night before would have caught it.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022Sir?\u0022\n\n\u0022What did you just say?\u0022\n\n\u0022The prelaunch inspection... I saw a scaffolding around the upper stage the night before the launch. I assumed it was another inspection.\u0022\n\n\u0022I did not authorize...\u0022 he said, mostly to himself, \u0022are you sure?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, no, it had been a long day and I was very tired and--\u0022\n\n\u0022Are you *sure*?\u0022 He looked at her with an intensity she had not seen in him before.\n\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\n\u0022Troubling... *most* troubling,\u0022 he said to the table, and coughed, eyes wandering this way and that, then produced a little black book and thumbed through the pages, \u0022no, no work was authorized on the rocket. The area should have been secured, sealed off. This means...\u0022 He looked around the room again, laughing awkwardly.\n\n\u0022But, there I go rambling again! Just a misunderstanding I\u0027m sure, perhaps I did not get the memo. Certainly some simple explanation.\u0022\n\nHe rose, \u0022I am very sorry to cut our evening short, my dear, but I really must speak to the Kommissar at--\u0022\n\nHe coughed. But the timbre... something was different. He coughed again, and again, followed by horrible gurgling sounds.\n\n\u0022Comrade?\u0022 Valentina said, \u0022are you all right?\u0022\n\nThe Director coughed and retched, bending low over the table. Something black and unpleasant splattered on a half-finished plate. The tablecloth bunched in his balled fists.\n\n\u0022Comrade?!\u0022\n\nHe coughed, and coughed, hideous, wet, ripping sounds, his entire body convulsing. Then gasping for breath he looked up and his *eyes*, what\u0027s happened to his eyes?!\n\nIn the distance, she heard horrible screaming.\n\nHis *eyes!*\n\nHe took a long, rasping breath, dark veins standing out on his face.\n\nThe screaming drew nearer.\n\n\u0022*D\u0027yavol*,\u0022 he said in a rasp, then fell to the table with a clattering of plates, and was still.\n\nValentina stared, uncomprehending, and realized the screaming was coming from her own mouth.\n\n\u0022Help,\u0022 she said weakly. Where was that damn cook?! \u0022Someone please help.\u0022\n\nBut she knew it was pointless. Director Kermanev\u0027s last word hung in the air like smoke from a pyre.\n\n*D\u0027yavol*\n\nThe devil.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-31T05:34:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2016 05:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T05:44:47Z","Content":"**Chapter 10: Changes**\n\nIt had been another long day of questions, but this time surprisingly few. Director Kermanev was already on a train heading west, where he would receive a State funeral as a national hero, and be interred in the wall of the Fort with heroes past. This went unquestioned by Valentina, Dibella, and Tercella, as they sat around the simple wooden table in the small kitchen of their barracks, contemplating their untouched supper. Valentina stared at it vacantly. Dibella looked at her, concerned. Tercella just looked angry. -Er than usual.\n\nValentina stirred her food listlessly back and forth, not really seeing it. Seeing. Had she really seen... anything? Stress could do funny things to a person\u0027s mind, she knew that. And there had been the bottle too, a particularly *good* one, she had thought. Maybe she imagined it.\n\n*Or maybe you have the madness they warned you about*, something whispered in her mind.\n\nSpace madness. It sounded patently ridiculous... and she knew it was.\n\n*The mind is an incredible thing...* Her *Deda\u0027s* voice drifted up, *it can show you what you cannot see, and hide what you can.* \n\nShe remembered him saying that. Long, so long ago, they had come upon a scene deep in the taiga so horrible that she hated to think of it even now.\n\n*Look*, he had said, in his steady, comforting voice as she clung to his leg, *look. And see it for what it is. See it in all its awfulness. See, and know.* \n\nShe had seen, and been sick there at his feet while he patiently held her.\n\n*The mind is an incredible thing*, he had said, wiping the corners of her mouth with a rag, *it can show you what you cannot see, and hide what you can. It does this latter to protect its self, but like a seed under a rock, a mind forever sheltered cannot grow. So see this horrible sight before you. See it until you know it. Do not be numb, know it for the horror its is. Be sick, if you must, for growing is sometimes unpleasant.* \n\nThen he had looked down into her tiny, wet eyes, *you will see awfulness in life. Know, when your mind does this thing. Know that what is really there may be far worse than what you see. Only when you know this, can you face it. And then, you will be stronger than it.* \n\n*And, my Tinka, you are already so strong.*\n\nSo together they had looked, for a long time.\n\nIt was that thought that so unsettled her now. What if what had really been there was far, far worse?\n\n\u0022Tia?\u0022 Dibella said, putting a comforting hand on her arm, \u0022are you all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022I am all right,\u0022 Valentina said absently, \u0022thinking...\u0022\n\n\u0022I cannot believe he is gone,\u0022 Tercella said to the table, \u0022just like that.\u0022\n\n\u0022They say it was a heart attack,\u0022 said Dibella, \u0022chronic exposure to rocket fumes.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bah!\u0022 Tercella snapped, \u0022a load of P\u0426TI\u0418S\u041A\u0423 that is! You know where he *really* came from.\u0022\n\nDibella glowered, \u0022you should not speak of such things.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Pfft*, I want to *punch* something,\u0022 Tercella crossed her arms, \u0022speaking of Sergei, where is he anyway? I have not seen him all day.\u0022\n\nSergei, of course, chose this very moment to burst through the door, eyes wide, \u0022have you heard the news?\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027re being relocated!\u0022\n\n\u0022^W^\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E^h^\u003Csub\u003Eh\u003C/sub\u003E^a^\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E^t^\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E^?^\u003Csub\u003E?\u003C/sub\u003E^!^\u003Csub\u003E!\u003C/sub\u003E\u0022\n\n\u0022Where?!\u0022\n\n\u0022To a new cosmodrome, near Kermangrad.\u0022\n\nValentina finally looked up, \u0022the Capitol?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027re going home!\u0022 Dibella squealed.\n\n\u0022Yes... Home...\u0022 Tercella studied the table.\n\n\u0022Yes, back to civilization!\u0022 Sergei said triumphantly, taking a seat at the table, \u0022and not a moment too soon. Everyone here smells of yak.\u0022\n\n\u0022What an awful thing to say,\u0022 Dibella snapped at him, \u0022the people here have never been anything but kind and welcoming to us, and after we were just dumped on them too!\u0022\n\n\u0022Well they still smell of yak,\u0022 he countered.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s how they live! They can\u0027t help it.\u0022\n\n\u0022They could bathe.\u0022\n\n\u0022They *do* bathe!\u0022\n\n\u0022The people I mean, not the yaks.\u0022\n\nDibella opened her mouth, then closed it again.\n\n\u0022You know, he does have a point,\u0022 Tercella said matter-of-factly.\n\n\u0022Why?\u0022 Valentina said, looking down again, \u0022why are we being moved?\u0022\n\n\u0022I suppose the Imperium thinks all the secrecy is no longer necessary, what with the Foreigners having *been* here and all. Having the entire space program on *Ussari* soil would solve certain... internal problems too.\u0022\n\n\u0022How soon?\u0022 Tercella asked.\n\n\u0022Immediately,\u0022 Sergei said, \u0022the trains to begin deconstruction have already arrived, I would imagine we\u0027ll be on the first one that leaves, in a day or so.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... the launch manifest... this will delay everything. A new launch facility will take months to build, at least!\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s finished. Mostly.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?!\u0022\n\n\u0022There have been a number of launches of the new ethanol-powered rocket already.\u0022\n\n\u0022^W^w\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E^h^h\u003Csub\u003Eh\u003C/sub\u003E^a^a\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E^t^t\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E^?^?\u003Csub\u003E?\u003C/sub\u003E^!^!\u003Csub\u003E!\u003C/sub\u003E\u0022\n\nDibella slumped back in her chair, incredulous, \u0022how do you know all this? How did we *not* know?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027re stuck in a hidden valley surrounded by impassible mountains and empty yak pasture,\u0022 Tercella said flatly, \u0022we\u0027re probably the *easiest* people in the Union to keep secrets from. Another reason they put us here.\u0022 Dibella gave her a look.\n\nSergei sat back and smiled with the smugness of a know-it-all who, for one horrible moment, actually does.\n\n\u0022And one more thing--\u0022 he began, but then Igor came through the other door, his face ashen.\n\nDibella looked at him with concern, \u0022what? What\u0027s wrong?\u0022\n\nHe was looking directly at Valentina. He opened his mouth, then closed it again, and looked at the floor. He opened his mouth again, raised a finger, then reconsidered and studied the floor. He opened his mouth *again* trying weakly to smile, spread his hands, then returned to watching the floor. Finally, with obvious difficulty, he met Valentina\u0027s confused gaze.\n\n\u0022I see Kommissar,\u0022 he said grimly, \u0022he say... he say... you no fly again.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?!\u0022 Shouted Dibella.\n\n\u0022It wasn\u0027t her fault!\u0022 Screamed Tercella, \u0022she had no control, she couldn\u0027t--\u0022\n\nIgor raised a hand, \u0022Kommissar say, you too valuable now, to risk. You remain in training and support role.\u0022 He looked as if he wanted to say more, but no more came out.\n\nFor a moment, all eyes turned to Valentina. Then, without a word, she fled out the door.\n\n\u0022Tia!\u0022 Dibella yelled, but she was already gone.\n\nSergei\u0027s smile nearly encircled his cylindrical head.\n\n\u0022You knew,\u0022 Tercella turned to him, \u0022all this time... you knew!\u0022\n\nSergei now opened his mouth to say something, then closed it rapidly as Dibella began rhythmically driving the point of her knife into the table.\n\n*Thock. Thock. Thock.*\n\nHe turned to Tercella and opened it again, then closed it as she drew her fork across the table, the tines gouging deep grooves in the wood and pulling up furrows of splinters.\n\n*Screeeeeeeeeeee*.\n\nHe then looked at Igor, turned very pale, and quickly fled out the opposite door.\n\nDibella and Tercella looked at each other.\n\n\u0022Should... should we follow?\u0022 Tercella asked.\n\nDibella thought for a moment, \u0022no. No, let\u0027s give her some time.\u0022\n\n\u0022I meant Sergei.\u0022\n\nDibella returned a smile as cold as a Kerberian winter, \u0022yes, let\u0027s.\u0022\n\nThey rose.\n\nIgor cleared his throat. Loudly.\n\nThey sat.\n\nAnd watched the door as the day\u0027s last light faded in the windows.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nValentina Kerman sat on a rusting rocket stage, still embedded in the ground where it had fallen months ago. Around her, a herd of yaks lowed complacently. She hugged her knees and looked up at the stars in the satin sky, her eyes watering from the odor.\n\nThat\u0027s what she kept telling herself.\n\nNot far away, concealed in the shadows and prudently upwind, Igor kept silent vigil. He had a job to do, and like always he would see it done.\n\nBut he didn\u0027t have to like it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-31T05:38:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2016 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T20:20:24Z","Content":"I bet Igor is about ready to bite the head off a mosquito and spit the pointy end at somebody.\n\nAnd that final paragraph...Yeah, just like that.\n\nGreat work and shaping up to be a more than worthy prequel to *Shadows*."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T17:08:55Z","Content":"Thanks.

Not like the days of endless pasture and steppe, and occasional errant yak, crossing Nusad and Abvonovichatkaderivokistan on the way to the new Cosmodrome. Then, not far from the border with Ussari, as they had passed out of the rain shadow of the mountains to the east, the terrain had suddenly changed. The sparse steppe gave way to patches of forest divided by swamps and marsh, each fighting for dominance over the land with only the humidity winning. Director Kermanev had been right, it was looking like a bumper crop this year.\n\nThe Director. Valentina tried not to think about him as she stared out the window, watching the world go by. Once they had arrived at the Cosmodrome, it had been days more of briefings, debriefings, orientations, questionings, and... politics. News reporters from Gytep and Dachland had come to interview Sergei, and even taken a few words from Dibella and Tercella. They\u0027d shown no interest in Valentina, and she just felt... nothing. No irritation at the politics and procedure, no resentment *or* relief at being ignored, just... nothing. Numb. And she knew enough to realize that was a troubling sign. She just felt such--\n\n\u0022...Distraction,\u0022 Dibella had said, \u0022and a welcome one at that. The Kommissar has given most of the relocated personnel a day of leave before the countdown officially resumes, so come with me to Kermangrad. I will show you the sights. We could all use just such a distraction.\u0022\n\nValentina had listlessly agreed. Tercella had gruffly refused. And Sergei had, fortunately, been nowhere to be found. Oddly, neither was Igor. So now she found herself on another train, this time in a very comfortable private booth, making its way through a thick forest towards Kermangrad. The trees, at least, reminded her of home, although they were subtly different this far east. The needles were longer, the branches lighter, and, at least as far as she could tell, they didn\u0027t try to kill you. Or maybe they just found trains unpalatable. The forest eventually gave way to open farmland that went on and on, until it abruptly stopped and became the ring of smoke-belching factories encircling the city. They deboarded at the the next station, and Dibella hired a cab to take them into the heart of the sprawling metropolis.\n\nIt felt strange, being out of uniform, Valentina thought as the cab wound through a confusing maze of streets. She watched the crowds of people going about their business in their various attire. She *liked* her uniform. It was snappy and required little thought. Plus the shoes and hat added a few welcome centimeters to her stature. She really couldn\u0027t remember the last time she\u0027d been out of uniform and out on leave like this, in her simple, sturdy, slightly ragged and mostly hand-made clothes from home. Dibella, on the other hand, was dressed very smartly, or what at least what Valentina thought passed for smartly. She really had little knowledge of such things. But she could recognize clothes that were well made, probably tailored too. Between Dibella and the city-dwellers with their city clothes, Valentina was feeling just a bit out of place. Dibella seemed to pick up on this, and the fact that Valentina still wasn\u0027t much for conversation. But, as Valentina would still appreciate later, she never pushed or pried, just let her friend process in her own way while playing the plucky tour guide.\n\nKermangrad was, after all, a strikingly beautiful city, and certainly worth seeing. It sat on the border with Abvonovichatkaderivokistan, separated by the Never River from its much smaller sister city Falafelbad, which was unfortunate because the falafel there was actually quite good. The Never River was the tarnished brown jewel of the city, so named because you *never* wanted to be anywhere near it unless you absolutely had to. From its headwaters at the polar ice cap far to the north, the Never began its long journey already slow and heavy with pale blue glacial silt. By the time it reached Palace Square in the city center it had roughly attained the color and consistency of peanut butter, and likewise, could be found smooth or chunky. You could catch all sorts of things in the river, most of which were fatal. If you were lucky.\n\nIt was spanned by the Seven Glorious Bridges, incredibly graceful and airy structures, crafted with a talent rarely seen in the generations since their construction. Valentina mused that they didn\u0027t even look able to support their own weight. In truth, they didn\u0027t have to, as the threat of falling into the Never was quite enough motivation to keep them up on their own, although they were bolted down securely at either end to keep them from running off.\n\nValentina and Dibella walked across the Square, which took its name from the famous Summer Palace, once the seat of the old Ussari Empire. It was here that had begun what became the Glorious Octember Revolution. Which actually happened in Septober. It now stood as a testament to those turbulent days, meticulously maintained by special order of the Imperium, every char mark and shell hole carefully preserved. The Square was surrounded by a veritable wall of buildings several stories high, built in ornate style with tall columns and graceful, flowing trim. Here and there, the Banner of the Crimson Star flew from rooftops or hung from windows.\n\nThe pair turned, and began making their way down the Boulevard of Heroes opposite the Palace. All down the center median of this impossibly wide, tree-lined street stood towering bronze statues of Heroes of the Revolution and of the Union. The upper surfaces of the statues were caked and streaked with the opinions of the local pigeons, who did not seem to be much impressed. Valentina walked past the imposing figures in a mental fog that came and went in waves. It wasn\u0027t like her to feel this disconnection, this... otherness. As if she were standing still and all this scenery that should have impressed her was just drifting by. She *knew* this, she recognized the danger, yet she powerless.\n\nAn odd sight drew her back for a moment. The crowds moving back and forth wore mostly the drab, functional, officially approved garb of Ussaris or the flattened conical hats and colorful ponchos of Abvonovichatkaderivokistan, but scattered within the crowds were dark blue trousers that stood out in an unusual way. They appeared to be made of heavy canvas or sailcloth, garnished with metal rivets.\n\n\u0022I noticed that too,\u0022 Dibella said when Valentina pointed it out, \u0022those are Eastern-style pants, from Omork and Kleptogart, usually very difficult to come by. I do not recall seeing them around in such large numbers before.\u0022\n\nValentina watched as they walked down the Boulevard, past statue after statue, \u0022an odd color, certainly, but they do look very durabluuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh.....\u0022\n\nDibella looked at her, confused, then followed her gaze across the wide street. Her mouth dropped open.\n\n\u0022\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0418\u042DV\u0027S SH\u0424\u0417!\u0022 She swore.\n\nThere, on the other side of the Boulevard, hanging from a tall, ornate building and just opposite an empty plinth, was a three-story-tall poster of Sergei. The two merely stood, slack jawed, unable to comprehend.\n\n*Glory to the Hero!* proclaimed the words along the top, as Giant-Sergei puffed out his now substantial chest and pointed to the future, *Glory to the Union!*\n\nAnd as if on cue, a distant low rumble broke over the din of the city. They looked in the direction the Glorious Hero was pointing. At the end of the Boulevard, the legendary Crimson Square opened. At the far end of that was, of course, the Fortress,and looming over that like a storm cloud was the enormous Dome of the Imperium, and rising over *that* on a column of white smoke, was a rocket, ascending from the distant Cosmodrome. It was like an Approved Motivational Painting by an artist just a *bit* too full of himself had just come to life.\n\nBy the time either one of them moved again the trail of smoke was slowly drifting off with the wind and the disinterested crowd had adjusted to flow past them like the Never its self, slowly and grudgingly while making rude sounds.\n\n\u0022Inconceivable,\u0022 Dibella said distantly, \u0022the *last* launch was only the day after we arrived!\u0022\n\nValentina said nothing. In her mind, something began to unhinge. The left side of her upper lip quivered slightly as above her, Hero Sergei continued to point.\n\nDibella noticed.\n\n\u0022Come,\u0022 she said, taking Valentina\u0027s arm, \u0022we should get some food,\u0022 and gently led her toward Crimson Square.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-31T05:44:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2016 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T01:51:33Z","Content":"**Chapter 12: Crimson Square**\n\nCrimson Square had always been the beating heart of the city, having earned its name long before even the Empire existed, and for exactly the unfortunate reasons one might think. It was shaped somewhat like a T, with the Boulevard of Heroes leading down off the stem toward the Summer Palace. Not so long ago, following his arrest there, the old Emperor and the rest of the royal family had been led down that same street in chains, across this very Square, to imprisonment in the Fortress.\n\nNo one quite knew why it was *the* Fortress. There were lots of fortresses in Ussari, in practically every major city. Yet this one had always been *the*. It was an immense compound, surrounded by its equally famous Wall and Towers. It was still the residence of the current Empress, although in moderately more comfortable accommodations than her predecessor. In the Wall that faced the end of the Boulevard and Palace beyond, was the Mausoleum, a grid of solid marble capstones covering the face of the wall. Most of the Heroes whose likenesses graced the Boulevard were in there, whether they wanted to be or not.\n\n*So is the Director*, Valentina thought as they stared from the far side of the square.\n\nYet as imposing as the Fortress was, it was simply dwarfed by the impossibly huge structure looming behind it. The Dome of the Imperium. The focus of the entire Union. Unquestionably the largest building in the world, it was said that the dome its self was so tall that inside it had its own weather patterns and occasionally rained, and every so often pigeons who tried to roost near the ceiling dropped dead from hypoxia. It was often called the People\u0027s Hall, which was somewhat ironic as only those people specifically vetted by the Imperium, and the Imperium its self, ever went inside. Now, seeing it with her own eyes for the first time, even Valentina was taken aback. She thought it looked patently ridiculous.\n\nTo the left of the Square was the storied St. Cilantro\u0027s Cathedral with its bright, colorful, garlic-shaped domes, and to the right was the largest GUM store in the Union. Here, those with the proper documentation could stand in long lines to acquire anything their hearts desired as long as it was approved by the Gosplan. Except, regrettably, gum. Everywhere there were signs of construction. Tall cranes towered over the city beyond the square, and even within, many buildings were covered with scaffolds and surrounded by construction workers smoking rattails and not working.\n\nBut of course, being Kerbals, the pair headed straight for the collection of snack vendors set up in front of the GUM. Here, at last, was something Valentina thought she could fully appreciate. *Blini* and *shashlik*, *piroshki*, *shawarma*, sausages, big barrels of *kvass*, a rather unsavory looking fellow selling suspicious-looking meat pies, and of course, the always popular borscht-onna-stick. They walked along the rows of vendors, trying to make up their minds, and were about to settle on \u0022one of everything,\u0022 when suddenly it was Dibella\u0027s turn to stare and make an undignified noise.\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 Valentina said, then looked that way. In the corner of the GUM building, a new shop was under construction. Still only half finished, a pair of pale yellow oblong semicircles graced the entrance. She squinted at the sign nearby, what is a McKerbal\u0027s?\u0022\n\nDibella continued to stare, \u0022it\u0027s a restaurant... an Eastern one... there are dozens of them, all over Gednalna, Dachland, Gytep... but how is there one *here*?!\u0022\n\nValentina looked at it again, confused, \u0022oh... I went to one of those, once...\u0022\n\n\u0022*McKerbals?!*\u0022\n\n\u0022No, a restaurant. When I was in flight training in Kernobyl. As I recall, it was something like a mess hall, but you *paid* them to be rude and serve bad food. I am afraid I do not understand the concept.\u0022\n\nDibella laughed and clapped the other Kerbal on the back, \u0022a treat, then. Come, I shall take you to the best Dachlandish restaurant in Kermangrad!\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\nValentina stared out the window at the darkness, as the train plowed on through the night. She had a full belly and a fuzzy head. Across the booth from her, Dibella was sprawled out on the plush seat, her head lolled back, a rivulet of drool coming from the corner of her mouth, snoring loudly. It was a sound like wet fabric ripping. Valentina thought it almost endearing, in a revolting sort of way. She went back to looking out the window with heavy eyelids.\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\nThe rhythmic *click-clack* of the train was starting to make her eyelids droopy. Dibella had certainly been right, the food had been *incredible*. She had no idea there were so many kinds of cheese. Or such small portions. But Dibella had kept the feast flowing, ordering deftly in a language that sounded like poetry. And like the language, the dishes had been poetry made food. Valentina had eaten ravenously, not really knowing what was on the plate, or caring much.\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\nExcept the snails. No amount of butter and garlic and pleasant names could make a snail not a snail. Well, maybe just one, when Dibella hadn\u0027t been looking. The servers had been had been just as rude as she remembered, except for one strange young Kerb who spoke rapidly and *constantly* as he cleared away their plates. They had finished the meal with ice cream, set on fire, of all things!\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\nAfterwords, as they were leaving the restaurant laughing and giggling, they found a street performer out front in white face paint and a striped shirt. He seemed to believe he was trapped in an invisible box or some such. Valentina couldn\u0027t explain it, but she\u0027d had the oddest urge to punch him as hard as she could. Judging by the other faces in the crowd, so did they.\n\nPerhaps it was the snail. Nothing good could come from eating gastropods. Even with lots and lots of butter. And garlic.\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\nHer eyelids were getting heavy now. But, in truth, she *was* feeling better. Valentina Kerman was a survivor after all, and even this was survivable. A solution would present its self. Things *would* get better, just as soon as she killed Sergei.\n\nShe gasped aloud, nearly screamed, and sat bolt upright. Across from her, Dibella snorted loudly, smacked her lips, and went from ripping fabric to sawing wood. Valentina sat back and hugged herself, now wide awake. Where had *that* thought come from? Sure, Sergei was a P\u0426TI\u0418S\u041AI but... It disturbed her how easily and organically that thought had flowed from her mind. She turned back towards the window, and returned to staring at the darkness. She had the discomforting feeling that the darkness was staring back into her.\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\n*Click-clack*\n\nShe knew she shouldn\u0027t have eaten that snail.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIgor stood in a dark alley outside the Dachlandish restaurant, ignoring the delectable smells and whatever was chewing on his foot. He watched Valentina and Dibella leave. His orders had been as explicit as they were simple, yet explained in detail so as to leave no room for interpretation. Even written down on a slip of paper. Just two short lines. Yet, for one of the few times in his life, he doubted. There had to be some sort of mistake, there *had* to be. Yet his Superior did not make mistakes. For the three-dozenth time, he looked at the piece of paper in his hands.\n\n*Follow Valentina.*\n\nHe looked up, and gritted his teeth, then looked again at the second line.\n\n*Kill*\n\nThis was wrong. He knew it was. Every bone in his substantial body told him it was. Yet it was not his to question, it was his to do as he was told. His orders were very clear.\n\n*Follow Valentina.*\n\n*Do not kill mime.* \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-31T05:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2016 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T03:05:48Z","Content":"**Chapter 13: Crimson Dawn**\n\nValentina awoke the next morning feeling very groggy, with a headache *just* bad enough to make it hard to think. Eyes still puffy with sleep, she made her way from her small room in the new Kerbonaut\u0027s dormitory. With only four of them still, the building was deserted at this early hour. She walked past dozens of doors, all propped open to air out the new construction, their shadowed interiors gaping at her in the dim hall. She tried again to blink away the sleep from her foggy mind as she plodded along the icy floor.\n\n*This... isn\u0027t right,* she thought, *I should be wearing shoes,* but the thought wavered and dissipated like a M\u00FCn shadow.\n\nShe walked down the stairs, then across the expansive, darkened mess hall and its rows of stainless steel tables that reflected the low light in strange ways. One day, it would be filled with excited young Kerbonauts twittering about going to space.\n\n*But I won\u0027t be among them,* thought Valentina, *and it\u0027s all because of Sergei.*\n\nBut... that wasn\u0027t right, was it? So hard to think...\n\nThrough the shadowed kitchen, and into the little room the four had been given to take their meals. Here, the lights were on, Valentina blinked against the glare. Their scarred old table from the old launch site was here, but... where was everyone? A single pace setting occupied the table. Steak and eggs, more decadent Eastern food. Tercella had taken a particular liking to it over the last few days. She looked around, feeling the cold floor under her feet.\n\n\u0022Valentina.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419!* She started and spun.\n\n\u0022Sergei.\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027re still here.\u0022 Why was he wearing his flightsuit?\n\n\u0022Of course I am, you twit!\u0022\n\nHe chuckled darkly, \u0022then you do not know?\u0022\n\n\u0022Know what? Where is everyone else?\u0022\n\n\u0022They have been reassigned. Dibella and Tercella have been granted additional missions and had to leave for training. Igor has... moved on too.\u0022\n\n\u0022What are you talking about?\u0022 That smug grin was maddening.\n\n\u0022I have been assigned to the first operational flight of the next-generation space craft. Perhaps I shall make one of them my copilot, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022What...?\u0022 So hard to think.\n\n\u0022You, on the other hand,\u0022 his grin became a sneer, with teeth. Lots and lots of teeth, \u0022your services will no longer be required.\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t...\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027re being returned to Kernobyl for remedial training,\u0022 his eyes burned with hate, \u0022or perhaps someplace else, yes? Perhaps the *other* Kerberia.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, I... I didn\u0027t... this isn\u0027t...\u0022\n\n\u0022Come now, Valentina, you didn\u0027t really think this was for you, did you?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, wait...\u0022\n\n\u0022A bumpkin... a *hick*... going into space...\u0022\n\n\u0022Stop...\u0022\n\n\u0022A silly backwoods peasant girl...\u0022\n\n\u0022Stop!\u0022\n\n\u0022And of course, let us not forget...\u0022 he smiled an icy smile with teeth... so many teeth...\n\n\u0022Sergei *stop!*\u0022\n\n\u0022...the progeny of traitors.\u0022\n\nIn an instant, the serrated steak knife was in her hand, in an instant, she swung it with all the power in her small frame, and jammed into the side of his neck.\n\n\u0022Glub,\u0022 said Sergei, as life ran out in a crimson gush over his lips. He stumbled, tried to pull back, but Valentina held him close, twisted the knife, then sliced it forward, tearing his throat open as wide as his former grin. Blood sprayed forth in a torrent.\n\nValentina stared into his wide, panicked eyes. He fell against her, scrabbling, warm wetness soaking them. Her veins burned like fire. His mouth opened and closed helplessly.\n\n*Just like a fish, when you cut its throat.*\n\nBlood, so much blood.\n\nFinally he fell back, his terrified eyes staring up at her. He raised a pleading hand.\n\nBlood everywhere.\n\nThe hand dropped, and his eyes stared the stare of the dead. The room was silent, save for a distant sound...\n\n*Plip... plip... plip...*\n\nShe stared at his corpse, her heart pounding, her veins burning. This, this at last...\n\n*Plip... plip... plip...*\n\nThis is what she had been craving all her life...\n\nSo much blood...\n\nThis was *power*...\n\n*Plip... plip... plip...*\n\nSuch power!\n\nShe down looked at her stained, dripping hands.\n\nSuch *power!*\n\nShe looked at Sergei again... only Sergei was gone.\n\nThe fire in her veins turned to ice.\n\n*No...*\n\nIt was a girl... some girl she\u0027d never met, her green dress soaked and stained.\n\n*No...!*\n\nOn a chain around her ruined neck was a small, gray, sparkly rock.\n\n*I didn\u0027t... I didn\u0027t...*\n\nShe turned to look at Valentina with dry, white, dead eyes.\n\nPower... there was no power here...\n\nShe raised an accusing finger...\n\nOnly fear.\n\nThe dead girl opened her lips.\n\n\u0022*D\u0027yavol*.\u0022\n\nValentina bolted awake, panting, soaked in sweat, heart slamming in her chest.\n\n*Light!*\n\nPanicked, she fumbled with the lamp. The bulb flashed for a moment then popped.\n\n*Wall switch!*\n\nShe threw herself out of bed, and immediately her feet went out from under her and she landed hard on the slick floor, in a puddle of sticky wetness. She raised trembling hands before her, the dark stain visible in the sickly pale light of the M\u00FCn.\n\n*Blood, blood everywhere.*\n\nShe tried getting up again and fell right back down, staring straight into the face of Sergei\u0027s corpseless head.\n\n*No...*\n\nIt turned to look at her.\n\n*His eyes...!*\n\n\u0022Do you see?\u0022\n\nValentina awoke, screaming and flailing. She knocked the lamp from the nightstand with a crash, smeared wetness across the wall.\n\n*Blood, blood everywhere!*\n\n*So much blood...*\n\nThe door flew open and Igor flicked on the light.\n\n*No, he\u0027ll see!*\n\n*So much blood...*\n\n\u0022Where is he?! I pull head off!\u0022 He said as he looked around the room.\n\n*Blood, blood everywhere!*\n\nValentina looked at her pale, shaking, sweaty hands, \u0022a dream... just a dream...\u0022\n\nIgor continued to look around suspiciously, \u0022so... is no intruder?\u0022\n\nValentina looked out the window by the bed, her breath ragged.

There was no scaffold this time, Valentina was seeing to that. She had been watching from the window of her simple room ever since night fall, with a set of \u0022requisitioned\u0022 binoculars.\n\nHer room was spartan even by Ussari standards, she\u0027d had little to bring from the old facility. A basic, sturdy bed, a nightstand and lamp, a real closet here filled mostly with uniforms. And of course, the Pictures, required to be displayed in every home by edict of the Imperium. Over the door was Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra II, Regent of the Union, First of Ussari and Nihacima, Lady High Vizier of the City of Kerman, and Doge of Erakonia. Valentina always thought she looked very stately with her golden Globe and Scepter and hair, but somehow, always sad. In a semi-circle above her, always looking down, were the eight glowering members of the Union Imperium. If they ruled the Union, Valentina thought (privately) they could have at least picked better pictures.\n\nShe yawned, and went back to watching Dibella\u0027s rocket. She hadn\u0027t slept well at all lately, not since... the dream. Her nights were always restless, her dreams always bad. Running or falling, lights that refused to light in the shadows, or the M\u00FCn. She shuddered. She hated that one most of all. Suffocating, desiccating, her fingers burning or freezing or whatever it was M\u00FCnar soil did to you. And something... something was there. Something she could never remember. Besides the dead girl. She was always there, always at the end.\n\nValentina yawned again. The M\u00FCn. *Pfft*. The rocket she and Dibella had seen launch from Kermangrad had sent a probe past it, M\u00FCna-1, the first of its kind. It had sent back a grainy, haunting picture of the entire planet Kerbin over the limb of the M\u00FCn. The next day it was on the front page of every newspaper in the world. People found it oddly moving, and for one brief moment, there was talk of not just coexistence but cooperation, even collaboration. A joint mission with the Foreigners, a handshake in space.\n\nThen the probe left Kerbin\u0027s influence and all contact was lost. The Imperium publicly blamed the Foreigners, accusing them of tampering and espionage. Now the talk was of a *new* race, a race to put the first Kerbal on the M\u00FCn. Valentina was glad it wouldn\u0027t be her.\n\n\u0022Sergei, let *him* go,\u0022 she grumbled softly, \u0022let him *stay*.\u0022\n\n*Tinka!*\n\nShe jumped at her *Deda\u0027s* voice in her head, *you were not raised to be so spiteful.*\n\nShe closed her bulging eyes, and rubbed the wide flat spot between them. She could feel another headache brewing just behind it. No, no she had not been raised to be resentful. Could Sergei *really* have had anything to do with her being grounded? He certainly gloated about it, but he had no real power. His father sat on the Imperium Council on Heavy Industry, but that had no connection to the space program.\n\n*But of course*, something *else* whispered in the dark part of her mind, *he surely knows someone... who knows someone...*\n\nValentina sat back, and switched to rubbing her red eyes. Oh, how she *despised* politics. Sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation could do funny things to a person. Maybe she should talk to the flight surgeon. She\u0027d heard there was a big blue pill now that could bring you sleep. Sleep, without dreams.\n\nShe sighed, and returned to keeping watch. She soon fell asleep where she sat, and dreamt of the M\u00FCn.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nValentina felt like a wreck the next morning at the breakfast table. Tercella was going through her steak and eggs like a thing possessed. Valentina wasn\u0027t even sure she was bothering to chew. Dibella seemed oddly quiet, and just a bit green. Er. The launch was in only a few hours.\n\nSergei slammed through the door, also looking drained. Valentina didn\u0027t look up.\n\n\u0022Wha appen oo you?\u0022 Tercella said around a mouthful of steak. Or maybe eggs. Or both, \u0022wha were oo etherthay?\u0022\n\nSergei groaned, \u0022oh, it was exhausting! The Political Officer is a slave driver. I had an all day photography session with the Empress, and--\u0022\n\n\u0022The *Empress*?!\u0022 Dibella said, agog.\n\n\u0022Not *the* Empress, *my* Empress.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 Tercella swallowed and set down her fork and knife, \u0022your space ship.\u0022\n\n\u0022A ship needs a name, yes?\u0022 Sergei puffed out his narrow chest, \u0022the *Empress Alexandra I*, what better name for such a historic vessel?\n\n\u0022Besides,\u0022 he glanced at Valentina, \u0022it\u0027s better than *Pine Tree*.\u0022\n\nValentina still didn\u0027t move, but her fist clenched.\n\n\u0022Haven\u0027t they taken enough photos of that thing already?\u0022 Said Tercella.\n\nSergei twirled his hand idly, \u0022it was part of some information request from another space program, but then--\u0022\n\n\u0022From who?\u0022 Asked Dibella.\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 Sergei rolled his eyes, \u0022some fellow with a big mustache, I did not speak with him. But--\u0022\n\n\u0022Which space agency has mustaches?\u0022 Tercella asked Dibella, \u0022is it Dachland?\u0022\n\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\n\u0022No, they don\u0027t like mustaches, Kruenia perhaps?\u0022 Dibella pondered.\n\n\u0022Er...\u0022\n\n\u0022No, I do not think so, they only like the little square ones. Nefcarkaland?\u0022 Tercella offered.\n\n\u0022If...\u0022\n\n\u0022But I thought they signed on with the KSA?\u0022 Dibella again.\n\n\u0022Excuse--\u0022\n\n\u0022You may be right. Ryemnarg!\u0022 Tercella exclaimed, \u0022lots of facial hair in Ryemnarg.\u0022\n\n\u0022But--\u0022\n\n\u0022No, no I think they do beards there,\u0022 Dibella rubbed her chin.\n\nSergei cleared his throat loudly. The two looked at him.\n\n\u0022I have been trying to say,\u0022 he said with exasperation, \u0022I spent all night going over the mockup of the new two-Kerb pod. The Kommissar has taken full control of the space program now, and he named me as commander of the new ship\u0027s first flight!\u0022\n\nValentina didn\u0027t move, but the knuckles in her fist cracked softly.\n\n\u0022^W^\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E^h^\u003Csub\u003Eh\u003C/sub\u003E^a^\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E^t^\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E^?^\u003Csub\u003E?\u003C/sub\u003E^!^\u003Csub\u003E!\u003C/sub\u003E\u0022\n\n\u0022But he\u0027s not an engineer, how could he...\u0022 Dibella trailed off.\n\n\u0022So soon?! The prototype won\u0027t even be complete for months, why name any crew now?\u0022 asked Tercella incredulously.\n\n\u0022The program has been advanced,\u0022 Sergei puffed out his thin chest even more, \u0022perhaps one of you girls will be my copilot, yes?\u0022\n\nValentina hand moved toward the serrated knife.\n\n\u0022Since when does--\u0022 Dibella began, \u0022Tia? You don\u0027t look well...\u0022 She put a hand on Valentina\u0027s arm.\n\nValentina snapped back, and blinked, \u0022wha--? I... um... I am just tired. Have not been sleeping. You do not look well either.\u0022\n\nDibella smiled weakly, \u0022just nervous. I am not brave like you, I will be ok once the routine starts.\u0022\n\nValentina looked concerned, \u0022you know, you do not have to do this...\u0022\n\n\u0022*Have* to?\u0022 Dibella said with surprise, \u0022this is a great opportunity, I could not pass it up over nerves! To be among the first Kerbonauts... that is something special, something historic. I am humbled even by the opportunity.\u0022\n\nSergei looked annoyed. No one else seemed to notice.\n\nDibella looked at Valentina, \u0022I told you, this is only the beginning. Your part is not yet done. Trust, even if understanding eludes you, yes?\u0022\n\nValentina saw the solace in her friend\u0027s face, and found some comfort. But it did little to assuage the rising feeling that she was just waiting for something awful to happen.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-31T09:53:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2016 09:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T06:13:36Z","Content":"**Chapter 15: *Krazniyy Oktyabr***\n\nThe Mission Control center was now a flurry of activity. Rows of technicians and engineers sat at their consoles, busily running the final checklists. On the launchpad beyond the massive multi-paned window, *Krazniyy Oktyabr* stood ready to launch. Dibella had named it for the Glorious Octember Revolution. Which actually happened in Septober.\n\nAnd in the middle of it all, Valentina Kerman stood, with a huge headset on her head and a mug of thick, black coffee in her hands. It nearly matched the shade of the bags under her bloodshot eyes. It was now her turn to assume the role of capsule communicator, and with the Director gone and the Kommissar, as always, sequestered in his office atop the vertical assembly building, she had become a mission coordinator of sorts as well.\n\nShe took a sip of coffee and grimaced. It still tasted awful, but less so now. Weakening it with milk and honey didn\u0027t help, it needed to be *stronger*, that was the secret. She\u0027d made it as strong as the funny little machine had allowed. Someone had told her the Kerblish name plate said \u0022Mr. Koffee.\u0022 What a ridiculous thing to call a machine! She took another sip. Stronger, that was the key. Tercella was really on to something there. Speaking of whom...\n\nValentina keyed her microphone, \u0022Recovery-1, what\u0027s your status?\u0022\n\nTercella\u0027s voice was barely audible above the familiar drone, \u0022exactly the same as when you asked three minutes ago! I have enough Converters out here so that I could walk from Bylia to Gytep, to the ice cap without ever touching the ground! Relax.

She rubbed at her temples, she could feel another doozy of a headache brewing. She shouldn\u0027t have snapped at the fellow like that, that wasn\u0027t like her.\n\nShe keyed up the alternate channel, \u0022 *Krazniyy Oktyabr*, final clearance has been received, ten minutes to launch.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that,\u0022 came Dibella\u0027s confident voice, \u0022ready as I\u0027ll ever be!\u0022\n\n\u0022Nearly there, check your systems over once more.\u0022\n\n\u0022Um... copy control.\u0022\n\nValentina walked down the rows of flickering monitors and flashing lights, searching for anything out of place, anything that might have been missed. Everyone seemed to be discreetly avoiding eye contact. It vaguely registered to her that she was scowling, but she pushed it away. Now was not a time for pleasantries. Just routine. She finished this latest of many rounds and returned to staring out the window. Just follow the routine, and hope nothing goes wrong.\n\n\u0022 *Krazniyy Oktyabr*, control, five minute to launch, terminal countdown has commenced.\u0022\n\n\u0022 *Krazniyy Oktyabr* copies, final gyro synch complete, all my systems check out.

They were all watching her, plotting, waiting for the moment to--\n\nShe blinked, sighed, and took another sip. *Just follow the routine.*\n\n\u0022*Krazniyy Oktyabr* now on internal power, umbilicals clear,\u0022 said an engineer, \u0022ignition heaters beginning sequence. The key...\u0022\n\nValentina stepped to the console, took the key from around her neck, and inserted it into the panel. She took a breath, and turned it. The ignition clock began counting down.\n\n\u0022One minute, *Krazniyy Oktyabr* key in, all systems go.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy, one minute.

Great billowing clouds of it poured forth and descended upon the building like the wrath of a fallen star.\n\nShe was about to reach for the remote abort handle when an engineer called out, \u0022 *Krazniyy Oktyabr* has cleared the towers, all lights green!\u0022 Cheers erupted from the other controllers.\n\n\u0022*Holey yak!*\u0022 Dibella crackled over the radio, \u0022that *was* quite a kick. All my gauges read good. Can barely hear myself think.\u0022\n\n\u0022Rocket is stabilizing. Course looks good,\u0022 a technician confirmed.\n\nValentina watched the display, watched the gee force quickly rising. Through the window, the rocket climbed higher and higher on an arcing pillar of smoke. Soon it was little more than a speck in the distance. She switched to the telephoto monitor.\n\n\u0022Getting bumpy up here...\u0022 came Dibella\u0027s call, \u0022can\u0027t see the panel anymore. The physical strain in her voice was evident. Valentina saw the gee climb past five.\n\n\u0022Her heart rate\u0027s really rising,\u0022 said the flight surgeon from his station.\n\n\u0022Tracking, status?\u0022 Valentina said.\n\n\u0022Course is spot on,\u0022 said an engineer, \u0022never seen a *Strannik* fly so straight before.\u0022\n\n*Then shut up before you jinx it*, Valentina thought. This early in the flight, the massive rocket was still uncontrolled. Only careful design and aerodynamics kept it going the right way. If it went just a little off-balance... She clenched her hand to keep from reaching for the abort handle again. Why was it so stuffy in here?!\n\n\u0022*Krazniyy Oktyabr*, how are you doing?\u0022 She said into the mic.\n\nNothing but muffled breathing returned.\n\n\u0022Heart rate is spiking,\u0022 the flight surgeon said.\n\nSeven gees... eight...\n\n\u0022Five seconds to booster burn-out!\u0022\n\nValentina watched the dwindling camera feed, feeling helpless. The rocket was nearly imperceptible behind its plume of flame and smoke.\n\n*\u0022Tree... dva... od\u00E9en...\u0022*\n\n*Something* happened in the monitor. Valentina was sure her heart stopped for a moment... then the plume cleared, she could see the five spent boosters tumbling away trailing smoke... and *Krazniyy Oktyabr* accelerating onward on a new pillar of flame.\n\n\u0022We have booster separation,\u0022 said a technician, \u0022core stage ignition good, course is good.\u0022\n\n\u0022Whoo, that was intense!\u0022 Dibella nearly squealed from the radio, \u0022think I blacked out for a moment... core stage is much smoother, all systems read green.\u0022\n\n\u0022Heart rate coming back down. Vitals are stabilizing.\u0022\n\nOn the monitor, the rocket disappeared into a mere point of light. Valentina realized she\u0027d been holding her breath. Someone really needed to open a window. She began pacing up and down the rows of consoles again, unable to shake the feeling that something was *wrong*, despite everything going right. She watched the burn timer count down, saw the RCS guidance light illuminate exactly on time, the pre-stage indicators run through their sequence.\n\n\u0022Ten seconds to core burnout, *Krazniyy Oktyabr*\u0022\n\n\u0022I am ready! Gee-force still tolerable, course is stable.\u0022\n\nThe rocket was gone, now, from the monitors. Valentina could only stare at the panels of lights and gauges that represented the telemetry. This was it. This was where her own flight had gone so horribly wrong. She watched banks of lights swap between green and red. A drop of sweat dripped into her eye. Why weren\u0027t the air handlers working with so many people in here?!\n\n\u0022Staging is good, what is your status, *Krazniyy Oktyabr*?\u0022\n\n\u0022Nominal. This stage is very gentle. I read guidance on point.\u0022\n\nThe gee meter climbed, but slowly, very slowly. Something... something was...\n\nNo, everything was exactly right. Perfectly on the numbers. The flight couldn\u0027t possibly be going *better*. Valentina wiped more sweat from her face. The knot between her shoulders tensed.\n\n\u0022Stage burnout coming up... *tree... dva... od\u00E9en...*\u0022\n\n\u0022I have stage shutdown, control. Capsule is-*-oof!*\u0022\n\n\u0022*Krazniyy Oktyabr*, what just happened? *Krazniyy Oktyabr*, do you copy?!\u0022 Valentina could feel her heart pounding in her chest. It matched the cadence of the throbbing in her head.\n\n\u0022Final separation light,\u0022 said an engineer.\n\n\u0022*Krazniyy Oktyabr*, please respond!\u0022\n\n\u0022I...\u0022 The radio crackled.\n\n\u0022Dibella...?\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m in space...!\u0022\n\nValentina let out a huff and rubbed her temples again. She moved to take a sip of coffee and realized her other hand was empty. Who took her mug?\n\n\u0022That was quite the jolt again,\u0022 Dibella said, \u0022post launch checks good, ready to fire kick motor.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. A technician cleared his throat loudly and nodded toward the checklist on the console.\n\nShe picked it up. It seemed very heavy.\n\n\u0022Ah, um, yes, you are go for kick motor fire, *Krazniyy Oktyabr*\u0022\n\nThe small solid rocket motor on the back of the craft fired, this time boosting it faster along its sub-orbital path. The same engine would eventually be used to return Sergei\u0027s capsule from orbit.\n\nValentina flipped through the coast checklist. Now was a series of observations, activation of a scientific payload, tests of the craft\u0027s manual attitude controls, and *P\u0426TI\u0418\u0027S \u0417\u0414\u042FS* why was it so *ST\u0414LI\u0418L\u0423* hot in here?! She went through the procedures, each breath seeming to take more effort. She was going to have to have a talk with the maintenance supervisor, this was unacceptable.\n\n\u0022Um, lieutenant, ma\u0027am,\u0022 a nervous looking engineer tapped her on the shoulder, \u0022maybe you should--\u0022\n\n\u0022What?!\u0022 She snapped at him, \u0022now is *not* the time, we\u0027re in the middle of a flight!\u0022 He made a warding gesture and backed away hurriedly. Honestly, the pod would be hitting the atmosphere at any moment, why would he pester her at a time like this? Go pester the facilities guy, turn a fan on, open a window, *something!* Her vision was getting blurry, must be sweat in the eyes again.\n\nWith difficulty, she watched the panel, watched the gauges climb, said a few things to Dibella but it was all indistinct, distant. Getting hard to think. Something wrong, but... but... what? What was...? Something about parachutes airbags... what did...\n\n\u0022*Augh!*\u0022 Grunted Dibella.\n\nValentina snapped back from wherever she had gone, \u0022*Krazniyy Oktyabr*, did not copy, what happened?\u0022 Of course, now, *now!* She let her concentration slip and *now* the disaster would come! She feverishly scanned the instruments but nothing made sense.\n\n\u0022Aack!\u0022\n\n\u0022Dibella, what--\u0022\n\n\u0022Oof! Landed on--ow! hill. Rolling down to--ugh! Deflated airbags too--gah! Ouch...! Ow...! Augh...! Thatsgonnaleavea--aargh...!\u0022\n\nSilence. Valentina\u0027s head was swimming. She should be doing something... but what? The thought kept drifting away.\n\nThen a loud noise in her headset, a burst of static... then nothing.\n\nThe silence stretched out. The room began to sway.\n\nA new voice buzzed over the radio, \u0022this is Recovery-15, we have the pod in sight... the pilot is outside, she\u0027s ok! She\u0027s waving. She\u0027s in the mud near the river, we\u0027ll circle around and try to land.\u0022\n\n\u0022Fifteen, this is Thirteen, we\u0027re at your three o\u0027clock, moving in to assist.\u0022\n\n\u0022Recovery-7, we copy too, changing course.\u0022\n\nOh, good. That sounded good. It was good. Everything was good, now. But why did the wall look like the ceiling and--\n\n*Thud*.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-31T09:57:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2016 09:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T13:47:31Z","Content":"Strannik really isn\u0027t a gentle accent is it?

An ominous creaking rocked the small cabin, before all sound died away.\n\n\u0022I\u0027ll find you,\u0022 he said softly. For an instant the cabin filled with fog, and he was gone. Valentina looked out through the jagged hole into the inky, empty darkness of space. That darkness then *shifted*, and began pouring into the capsule like black ichor. It swirled around the floor and filled it, thick and sticky. She could smell its stink, feel the fumes in her lungs\n\nDARKNESS, it *spoke*, YOU CANNOT ESCAPE DARKNESS. YOU CAN ONLY EMBRACE IT.\n\nIt swirled around her feet, still rising. Icy fingers gripped her arms, pulling her down.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s too late for him,\u0022 Dibella said. Valentina turned right, and looked into the white, desiccated eyes of a corpse.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s too late for any of us,\u0022 she turned left, and saw the Dead Girl.\n\nThey *pulled*, and Valentina slipped down into darkness\u0027 embrace.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nShe shot up in her bed, panting and sweating. For some time, she stayed just like that, her face buried in her hands, trying to get catch her breath as late afternoon sunlight streamed in through the window.\n\n*Where...?*\n\n*How did...?*\n\nDisoriented, Valentina looked around her small room, not remembering how she got there. On the nightstand was a small glass bottle taped with a doctor\u0027s seal. She looked at the label. Darnitol, 75mg. Large, translucent blue pills.\n\nSleep. Sleep without dreams.\n\nThe easy way out.\n\nShe set it back down, sighed, then winced at the knot in her back. She thought she must have been asleep for hours to be so stiff. She changed, and headed down past dim corridors flanked by yawning doors, and empty rooms of gleaming steel. Valentina found the other three in their kitchen, apparently just finishing dinner.\n\n\u0022TIIAAAAA!\u0022 Dibella glomped into her, \u0022we were getting so worried!\u0022\n\n\u0022You have been out for nearly eighteen hours,\u0022 Tercella said. Sergei just sat at the table, looking annoyed.\n\n\u0022What... happened?\u0022 Valentina asked groggily.\n\n\u0022They say you fainted,\u0022 said Tercella, \u0022Igor had to carry you back to your room.\u0022\n\n\u0022The flight surgeon said it was stress and chronic sleep deprivation,\u0022 Dibella offered, \u0022he left you a prescription and said to just let you rest for now.\u0022\n\nValentina rubbed at her eyes, \u0022what have I missed?\u0022\n\n\u0022One incredible party!\u0022 Tercella said with a smirk.\n\nDibella rolled her eyes, \u0022it wasn\u0027t anything special, and no fun without you. Besides, I had to spend the entire time giving interviews with Sergei.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, you handle yourself quite well for the cameras,\u0022 said Sergei, rising, \u0022perhaps I shall take you as my copilot.\u0022\n\nDibella glared at him, \u0022I would sooner go into space with a yak!\u0022\n\n\u0022I can arrange that!\u0022 He shot back.\n\n\u0022Both of you, enough,\u0022 Tercella turned back to Valentina, \u0022come, eat, you look pale.\u0022\n\nSergei crossed his arms, \u0022why is *she* still here, anyway? Are her services even required any more?\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s fist clenched.\n\n\u0022That is uncalled for, she has had a difficult time.\u0022 Said Tercella.\n\n\u0022Of course she\u0027s had a difficult time, she brings doom everywhere she goes.\u0022\n\n\u0022Stop it, Sergei,\u0022 Valentina said flatly.\n\n*Darkness...*\n\n\u0022It\u0027s like a cloud, following you. You didn\u0027t really think this was for you, did you?\u0022\n\n*You cannot escape...*\n\n\u0022Stop!\u0022 Dibella snapped.\n\nSergei drew up to his full, limited height, \u0022a bumpkin, a hick--\u0022\n\n\u0022Stop it, you *P\u0426TI\u0418S\u041A\u0423!*\u0022 Tercella growled.\n\n*Cannot escape...*\n\n\u0022A silly backwoods peasant girl...\u0022\n\n*Cannot escape...*\n\n\u0022And let us not forget--\u0022\n\n*You cannot escape...*\n\n\u0022Sergei, stop!\u0022\n\n*Darkness...*\n\nSergei smiled his smug smile, \u0022the progeny of traitors.\u0022\n\n*Only embrace it.*\n\nIn an instant, the knife was in her hand. In an instant, she swung it with all the power in her small frame...\n\nAnd buried it up to the handle through Igor\u0027s wrist.\n\nTercella gasped. Dibella put her hands to her mouth. Igor was instantly between the other two, his arm before Sergei\u0027s neck. The tip of the knife drew a single drop of blood from Sergei\u0027s throat. No one moved. No one made a sound. Save for the drops of Igor\u0027s blood falling to the floor.\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\nValentina and Sergei both stumbled back. Igor looked to Dibella and Tercella, then nodded at Valentina. The two half led, half carried her away.\n\n\u0022Did... did you see that?!\u0022 Sergei clapped a hand to his neck, \u0022s... she assaulted me!\u0022\n\n\u0022I saw,\u0022 Igor stepped to him, and loomed over him like a thunderhead. He seemed to rumble softly, too.\n\n\u0022I think, you talk very big, little man. I think, maybe one day, I not be here to save hide. I think, maybe one day, she break you,\u0022 he looked off in the direction the others had gone, \u0022I be sad for her that day.\u0022\n\nThen he returned his focus to Sergei, with an intensity that made the smaller Kerbal shrink even more, \u0022if day come, best for you, if she kill you.\u0022\n\nIgor lowered his face till their bulging eyes nearly touched.\n\n\u0022Or. I. Will.\u0022\n\nSergei made a soft noise in the back of his throat, and felt a familiar warmth run down his leg.\n\n\u0022Now, go,\u0022 Igor said, \u0022you make puddle on floor.\u0022\n\nSergei skittered in panic, slipped in said puddle, and nearly fell several times before disappearing through the door. Igor watched him go with narrowed eyes. He plucked the knife from his arm as one might a splinter, and tossed it in the sink. He thought for a moment, then went back and washed it off. Something... something must be done. He grunted in annoyance, and went off to see the Kommissar, leaving the room in darkness.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T06:46:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 06:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T11:04:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Igor watched him go with narrowed eyes.

Then, more nervously, \u0022we are not supposed to be up here.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, and now everybody within half a kilometer probably knows about it!\u0022 Tercella said from below.\n\n\u0022I told you, it is slippery,\u0022 Valentina retorted, \u0022and... gooey.\u0022\n\n\u0022Guano.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022It is guano. The bats, they like to roost in here.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bats?\u0022 Valentina moved to wipe her hand on her slacks, then thought the better of it and wiped it on a... thing, instead.\n\n\u0022Give me the light, I cannot see a thing up here!\u0022 She said.\n\nShe grunted as the beam hit her right in the eyes.\n\n\u0022Ow!

Thought it was the other way around.\u0022\n\nValentina groped the flashlight from the other Kerbal and scanned it around the roof, trying to blink away the spots in her vision. Apparently the pigeons took over for the bats up here.\n\n\u0022Ew,\u0022 she shook her hand, \u0022do you have a rag or something?\u0022\n\nThat, too, hit her square in the face.\n\n\u0022Now quit whining, and take the bag,\u0022 Tercella said below, passing it up, \u0022oh, and do mind the guano.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ugh, you do *not* have to remind me.\u0022\n\n\u0022There are blankets to sit on,\u0022 said Tercella as she climbed through the narrow hatch, \u0022and snacks. Careful you do not spill the borscht.\u0022\n\nThey found a bare-ish spot between roof machinery that had a good view of the launch pad, and spread out the blankets. On the ground below, pockets of pale yellow light revealed the more official gatherings to watch the launch. A loudspeaker voice drifted among them, soft and indistinct from this height. The two Kerbals sat, Tercella handing Valentina a thermos.\n\n\u0022Here, try this, it is a new formula,\u0022 she said.\n\nValentina cautiously sniffed at it, \u0022it is not laced with rocket fuel again, is it?\u0022\n\n\u0022No,\u0022 Tercella laughed, then somewhat more uncomfortably, \u0022er... no... I will admit, that did not work well.\u0022\n\nIn the darkness, Valentina raised an eye... bulge, \u0022they had to pull poor Vladimir from the rafters...\u0022\n\n\u0022But he has no memory of it!

Not *good*, certainly, but an improvement.\u0022\n\nShe passed the thermos back to Tercella, who took a swig, \u0022I am getting closer. I ground the beans as finely as I could, but now the water does not want to flow through. I need some way to force it through, under pressure.\u0022\n\nShe scanned over the patches of lights below, \u0022it is a pity Dibella is still stuck down there.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 agreed Valentina, \u0022giving more interviews and playing emcee with... Sergei.\u0022 Amplified over the loudspeakers, their voices could just be made out in the darkness below.\n\n\u0022Well, you have to admit, the cameras *do* love her,\u0022 Tercella said thoughtfully, \u0022I really do not know if she is cut out to be a Kerbonaut, but the way she handles herself under *that* kind of stress... she will surely do something even greater.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed...\u0022 Valentina stared off into the distance.\n\n\u0022And what about you, hmm?\u0022 Tercella suddenly asked.\n\n\u0022What *about* me?\u0022\n\n\u0022Do not think we have not noticed you moping about these past weeks. As the foreigners say, what is chewing upon you?\u0022\n\nValentina laughed, \u0022chewing upon me?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well *ST\u0414LI\u0419S ST\u0414CH\u0417* that *is* what they say... or so they say.\u0022\n\nValentina thought for a minute, \u0022a rather small mosquito.\u0022 There was a crunch and squeak, and she reached for the rag again.\n\nTercella\u0027s bright eyes narrowed, \u0022do not make me hurt you.\u0022\n\nValentina sighed, and looked out toward the rocket waiting on the pad, \u0022I just feel like I am loosing my mind.\u0022\n\n\u0022You? Loose *your* mind?\u0022 Said Tercella incredulously, \u0022and what foolish army would dare try to pull it from your thick skull?\u0022\n\n\u0022I tried to kill Sergei.\u0022\n\n\u0022No one could blame you for that.\u0022\n\nValentina wondered if Tercella could feel her glare in the darkness.\n\n\u0022Besides,\u0022 Tercella continued, \u0022the *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI* was completely out of line. Saying something like that to the wrong person will likely get you stabbed even in Kermangrad.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... he is right...\u0022\n\n\u0022Is he? *Do* you know what happened so long ago?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, no... but whatever it was, Igor came with the assignment to the space program.\u0022\n\n\u0022That could be worse. He is the most devoted *nablyudatel* I have ever seen. Most of them are far less... cordial. And besides, you *were* still selected.\u0022\n\n\u0022But what is there here for me, *now*?\u0022 Valentina sighed again, \u0022maybe I should just quit the program.\u0022\n\nTercella punched her in the arm.\n\n\u0022Ow! What was that for?!\u0022\n\n\u0022For saying foolish things. Do you know what my papa told me about giving up like that?\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022Nothing. By the time he came home most nights he had left his powers of speech by the roadside, along with a boot and his hat. And not always for the same reason. But his new bruises, the old scars, they taught me much.\u0022\n\nTercella flicked the light back on, and held it below her face, giving her grin a sinister cast, \u0022you do not *let* the *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AIS* and *ST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041A\u0414S*  and *\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DV\u0424VITCH\u0417S* of the world win.\u0022\n\n\u0022Has anyone ever told you you curse like sailor?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, a *ST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041A\u0414* of a sailor did once, why?\u0022\n\n\u0022No reason.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, the point is, you fight, even if you loose. Even if just to spite them. You do not disrespect another Kerb\u0027s family, and you never give up on your own.\u0022\n\n\u0022I do not know,\u0022 Valentina said, hugging her knees, \u0022but I feel so alone, now.\u0022\n\nTercella punched her *hard*, this time.\n\n\u0022Ow! What was *that* for?!\u0022\n\n\u0022For saying foolish things again.\u0022\n\nThen Tercella punched her so hard her whole arm went numb.\n\n\u0022Augh, that is going to bruise!\u0022\n\n\u0022Good, let it remind you,\u0022 Tercella said, still grinning fiercely.\n\n\u0022It has gone all tingly now, gah!\u0022 Valentina flexed her hand, \u0022remind me of *what?*\u0022\n\n\u0022That you are not alone. You have us. And you are not to let the likes of Sergei Kermanski get the best of you, *vy ponimayete?*\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414! P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS*, that *stings!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Then you will remember,\u0022 Tercella genuinely smiled now, \u0022we do not give up on family.\u0022\n\nValentina kept rubbing her arm, \u0022and since when did you get to be so strong?\u0022\n\n\u0022Daily strength training regimen,\u0022 Tercella\u0027s flexing might have been more impressive had the night not been pitch black, \u0022I am strong like bull, no?\u0022\n\n\u0022No... I mean, yes! I mean... do not hurt me. But... why?\u0022\n\n\u0022The flight surgeon wants me to be able to bench press a yak. He thinks I will need all my strength for the EVA on my flight.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, yes... your flight...\u0022 Valentina said sadly.\n\n\u0022Do not start with that again!\u0022\n\nShe put her hands up in defense. Tercella just glared at her.\n\n\u0022You *will* go to space again,\u0022 Tercella shook a finger, \u0022if I have to stuff you in a storage bin.\u0022\n\nValentina finally smiled.\n\n\u0022Though I may have to charge extra for those bags under your eyes. They are well over the carry on limit.\u0022\n\nValentina laughed and gave her a playful shove. Tercella shoved back. Valentina shoved *her* back, then *she* shoved so hard Valentina toppled off of whatever it was they were sitting on and fell to the roof with a crash, scaring the life out of a rat that had come within a whisker of making off with their entire bag of snacks. It ran off, squeaking angrily.\n\n\u0022Oops...\u0022\n\nValentina retrieved the bag and pulled herself back up onto the blanket, trying to ignore how unsettlingly crunchy the roof surface was.\n\n\u0022Can we just watch the rocket launch now? Without any more bodily harm?\u0022 She said.\n\n\u0022You started it.\u0022 Tercella said gruffly.\n\nThe other Kerbal huffed and rolled her eyes on the darkness, \u0022do yo really think it will work? Putting a probe on the M\u00FCn?\u0022\n\nTercella stared out at the waiting rocket, \u0022it will have to work sooner or later.\u0022\n\n\u0022But did not the Foreigners do so already?\u0022\n\n\u0022They tried. You can see the crater through the Observatory telescope. It is quite impressive. We have a much better track record with such things.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, M\u00FCna 3 and 4, but..,\u0022 Valentina mused, \u0022what do you suppose happened to M\u00FCna 2 and 3?\u0022\n\n\u0022*This*, we do not speak of.\u0022\n\nThe two Kerbals yelped and spun around.\n\n\u0022Greetings, Comrades!\u0022 The Political Officer held his pen light below his face in a way that, with his bushy mustache, looked *truly* disturbing, \u0022Papers, please! Yes, yes, good, good, thank you. As expected, all is in order. It is a *Glorious* night for a rocket launch, D\u0414?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414 Comrade! very Glorious, Comrade! Lovely evening, Comrade!\u0022\n\n\u0022And especially from so unorthodox a vantage!\u0022\n\nThe pair could only stammer.\n\nThe Political Officer grinned ferociously over his pen light, \u0022but do not fret, Comrades! Surely one cannot blame our Great Union\u0027s most fearless pilots for venturing where they ought not be just to get a better view of yet another magnificent and historic space launch!\u0022\n\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\nHe grabbed their shoulders, spun them around towards the launch pad, and stuck his head between theirs, \u0022after all, brave Comrades, today we go to the M\u00FCn! Surely this is an auspicious day! Perhaps one of you will one day be the first to set foot there, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022Er...\u0022\n\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\n\u0022So perhaps under the circumstances,\u0022 he squeezed their shoulders, \u0022exceptions can be made...\u0022\n\n\u0022They... they can?\u0022\n\n\u0022But mind that you do not stay out too late, brave Comrades, for when the bats return from their long night they are... cranky.\u0022\n\n\u0022B... bats...?\u0022\n\n\u0022C... cranky...?\n\nSomewhere high overhead, a rhythmic, staccato squeak echoed in the cool night air.\n\n\u0022Children of the night, what music they make, yes?\u0022 He clapped the two roughly on the shoulders.\n\n\u0022But fear not, brave Comrades! Our brilliant doctors and cutting edge medicine can even cure the scourge of rabies! But I understand the treatment is...\u0022\n\nHe let the word draw out in the still night.\n\n\u0022...*un*pleasant.\u0022\n\nHe spun them around again, and stepped back, \u0022have a *pleasant* evening, Comrades... Glory to Arstotzka!\u0022\n\nAnd then he was gone.\n\n\u0022How does he *do* that?\u0022\n\n\u0022Did... he have a cape on?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, it is just a bit chilly out...\u0022\n\n\u0022Bah! P\u0426TI\u0419 on him!\u0022\n\n\u0022I *heard* that.\u0022\n\n\u0022We came here to watch a rocket launch and that is what we are going to do. Sit.\u0022\n\nIn the darkness down below, there was a flourish in the voice from the loudspeakers, and a round of dim applause.\n\n\u0022Quickly now, it is almost time.\u0022\n\nAnd so the two friends sat, eating borscht onna stick, which is *every* bit as difficult as it sounds, and watched, as for a brief moment night became day over the Cosmodrome, and M\u00FCna 6 rose on a river of fire and smoke like Prometheus unbound. Talking with Tercella had helped, Valentina did feel a little better. Well, except for her arm. She didn\u0027t think it could take another blow, so she hadn\u0027t mentioned the voice whispering in her head. Or that it was slowly beginning to make sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T06:53:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T22:21:36Z","Content":"Hmm, slice the beets coarsely and thread them on the sticks before cooking.
