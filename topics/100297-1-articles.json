Not actually intended as a proof, but it serves as one.\n\nI also have a proof of pi itself floating around somewhere. Not exactly the same way it was done originally, but it does work. I\u0027ll see if I can find it.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So here\u0027s how we skin this cat:\n\u003E \n\u003E We start with a simple right diamond.\n\u003E \n\u003E The vertices have a length of 1, so the hypotenuse has a length of sqrt(2). The perimeter of that shape (carried around the center) is 4\\*sqrt 2. \n\u003E \n\u003E  Now bisect that angle. We have now defined a new right triangle. the adjacent sides are sqrt(2)/2 and the vertex is 1.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Supposing we wanted to create 1/4 of an octagon. We would simply project our bisector to 1. The length of this new segment is 1-(sqrt(2)/2), or (2-sqrt(2)/2).\n\u003E \n\u003E  This defines a new right triangle, whose hypotenuse is sqrt((sqrt(2)/2)^2-(2-sqrt(2)2)^2).\n\u003E \n\u003E  Throwing some algebra at it, it simplifies down to sqrt(2-(sqrt(2)). Since we have doubled the number of sides of our octagon, we would multiply this by 8 (or 2^3) to find our perimeter.\n\u003E \n\u003E  We repeat the process. Bisect that angle, extend the bisector out to 1, and solve for the new right triangle.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The hypotenuse is sqrt(2-(sqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(2)) and the perimeter is this same value multiplied by 2^4)\n\u003E \n\u003E Rinse and repeat. perimeter of a 32 sided shape: 2^5 (sqrt(2-sqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(2)))).\n\u003E \n\u003E And again. Perimeter of a 64 sided shape:( 2^6) (sqrt(2-sqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(2)))))\n\u003E \n\u003E This process repeats indefinitely. As we double the number of sides, the ratio of the perimeter to the radius approaches 2 pi, and we can define a calculable value for pi:\n\u003E \n\u003E lim n-\u003E(1/0) [sqrt(2-sqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(2\u002Bsqrt(...(2\u002Bsqrt(2n-1\u002Bsqrt(2n))))...)n-1)n)]\n\u003E \n\u003E This is a process that can be carried put with an ink pen and parchment, or an abacus.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Simply find the square root of 2 to however many digits. Add 2. Increment a counter. Find the square root. Add 2. Increment the counter. Find the square root. Add 2. Increment the counter.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Continue this process until the last step, then \\*subtract\\* 2, increment the counter, and find the square root.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Multiply this number by 2^(counter) and \\*poof\\*: pi. And since our resultant value is, by definition, closer to pi than it is to the previous iteration, it can be proven that our result will differ from pi by less than f(n)-f(n-1). Once those 2 values differ by less than our desired margin, we can say that our result equals pi within the margin. \n\u003E \n\u003E  And since we have already proven that the square root of 2 is an irrational number, we can conclude that the sum of any irrational number and a rational number is necessarily irrational. Likewise, the square root of any irrational number is irrational.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Therefore, we have proven that pi will never repeat, no matter how many digits it\u0027s carried out to.\n\n Posted on my FB page back in the day when I first sorted it out. I was pretty jazzed about it (I\u0027m easily entertained)\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T14:30:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:41:40Z","Content":"![Circles4.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hWXRpAx5vOI/VOiZBQ56NzI/AAAAAAAAA4w/VJZb3PB95qI/w1037-h360-no/Circles4.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T14:50:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hWXRpAx5vOI/VOiZBQ56NzI/AAAAAAAAA4w/VJZb3PB95qI/w1037-h360-no/Circles4.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hWXRpAx5vOI/VOiZBQ56NzI/AAAAAAAAA4w/VJZb3PB95qI/w1037-h360-no/Circles4.png)\n\nAye... but you\u0027ve merely restated what you\u0027ve already posted.\n\nHow do you know that an unwrapped circle makes a triangle?
