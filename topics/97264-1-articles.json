Considering the probability of us obtaining the means to travel FTL is estimated at .01-.1% which may seem stupidly unlikely. It was considered impossible in the past, and so assuming future advancements make it possible, Human colonization of the galaxy is inevitable. So how would the nations of the world decide things such as ownership of colonies? Would each nation be allowed exoplanet territory on a planetary basis? Would these habitable planets be divided by region? Would humanity found a global governing body that allows equal access to every nation in the name of the human race?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more short term scale, proposed lunar and Martian colonies could pose a similar issue. Should nations be allowed to found colonies on planetary bodies without ownership? Should private corporations be the only ones allowed to colonize other planets, and if so would that eventually lead to the most powerful corporations becoming nations in their own right? This is not only an interesting topic to think about, these are very real questions about our future in the stars. Personally I feel that nationalistic, regional and cultural divides be abolished. China, Russia, Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan, basically every nation must put down their arms, join together under a single body that governs not nations but the planet, and work together towards a brighter and more survivable future for humanity. This way, their are no private entities vying for control of the resources available on other planets, nor for the scientific advantage this research gives their nation. Instead, this is used to advance Planet earth as a whole, humanity as a species.

Technologies that enable the individual to be free of corporate and government control are the same technologies that will allow humanity to survive amongst the stars. This will create a conflict between individuals and entities that seek to control people, be it directly or indirectly, as individuals will no longer be dependent (and in fact must not be dependent on) those same entities in order to thrive. That outcome of that battle will be what determines whether or not humanity continues to thrive, or if we collapse in a cycle of violence and expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, of course, brings up some uncomfortable ideas: the right to self-determination; the right to own what one builds; the right to self-defense; the right to travel freely.
