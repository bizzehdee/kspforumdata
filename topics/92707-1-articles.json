The Mun just isn\u0027t big enough.

Eve and Kerbin are both very massive bodies and with correct flying you just about anywhere by ping-ponging off them. Jool is even bigger and can fling your ship around like crazy. Duna is a bit weak but can be useful, I made two Duna assists to match planes with Dres for example. Moho is generally only useful to help you get to Moho (you can reduce your capture burn by making some flybys first), and Dres and Eeloo are too small to be much help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T13:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGravity assists can be extremely useful, you can make very significant savings on delta-V using a string of well-constructed trajectory-modifying burns.

To get the most from a gravity assist from Eve, for example, you need to time your departure from Kerbin so that you\u0027ll meet Eve at 180* around the sun from where you left. In practice, Kerbin and Eve are rarely aligned suitable to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, it\u0027s not hard to design rockets with an excess of delta-V for the intended mission and \u0027Kerbal\u0027 your way thru it rather than having a carefully calculated NASA-style plan that you stick to rigidly.
