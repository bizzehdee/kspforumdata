The Poodle is a vaccuum engine, so it has terrible atmospheric Isp, and therefore very low thrust. It cannot be used as a first stage engine anymore, you\u0027d be better using a Skipper or LV-T30 or T45 for atmospheric use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T22:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222589586\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463608391\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022red.five\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, red.five said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi!
