It also happens most of the time if I alt\u002Btab out of KSP.\n\nThis problem also affects another game that I play, Take on Mars, but on a much more severe scale.\n\nI run Windows 8.1, my computer has an AMD fx 8120 8-core CPU, 8 GBs of RAM, and an Nvidia Geforce GT 640 graphics card.\n\nI run KSP on Steam."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T19:49:17Z","Content":"Check your system event logs.

Looks like the problem was inefficient cooling because of dust buildup. Thanks a lot for the tip!"}]}
