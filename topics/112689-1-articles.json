It also happens most of the time if I alt\u002Btab out of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem also affects another game that I play, Take on Mars, but on a much more severe scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run Windows 8.1, my computer has an AMD fx 8120 8-core CPU, 8 GBs of RAM, and an Nvidia Geforce GT 640 graphics card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run KSP on Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T19:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your system event logs.
