If you want to orbit at an exact altitude above the surface, look up Kerbin\u0027s radius, add that to the altitude you want, and enter that as the SMA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, if you just want to get into orbit quickly, \u003Cstrong\u003Eset SMA to a ridiculously low number like \u00221\u0022. KSP will warn you that it\u0027s too low and automatically adjust it to the minimum safe altitude. Keep all the other numbers at zero and you\u0027ll have a circular orbit above the equator.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet inclination to 90 degrees for a polar rather than equatorial orbit. As to why your satellite flew away from orbit, you may have entered an eccentricity \u0026gt;= 1.0. That will create a flyby rather than an orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptional reading at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Orbit\u003C/a\u003E.
