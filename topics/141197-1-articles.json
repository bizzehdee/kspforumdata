The sim is therefore higly accurate in terms of how ship systems interaction with each other in case of failure during combat or deterioration. Of course full Newtonian physics are implemented and every system is physically modeled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sim is on Steam Early acces so even if it only has a few (some of them quite challenging) missions and a sandbox to test your abilities a full dynamical campaign is on the line, I\u00B4ve been following this sim for 2 years and the developer has never failed to acomplish his goals. Some closer installments are EVAs and inflight repairs. Right now a utility ship is implemented, 3 more combat ships are on the line.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EjTgQREcwk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELots of people have asked for Automation of processes (less button clicking) and VR, this are both on the line but those buttons and procedures will still be needed when your computer gets damaged, Track Ir is already working and there are plans for Oculus, Vive...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0If interested have a look at the Steam page or official forums \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/app/366000\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/366000\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://isiforums.net/f/forumdisplay.php/166\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://isiforums.net/f/forumdisplay.php/166\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your time \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turf","CreatedById":161356,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-05T15:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis.
