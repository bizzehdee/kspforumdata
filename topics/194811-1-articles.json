I love realism in games, often over entertainment, but I abandoned real solar system after first Moon trip because maneuvers were too long. Ascent took 10 minutes and was guessing how to steer rocket. In KSP you can fly however you want and get to orbit, but real ascent is more complicated and depends on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of stages. Typically first stage or solid boosters have high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and they throw ship to high arc. Upper stage has much lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than typical KSP rockets (about 0.5) and need time to accelerate to orbital speed before falling down. For example Mechjeb\u0027s ascent autopilot can not handle it properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like very much real solar system if there were proper tools to plan and execute maneuvers with high enough time acceleration. But without proper tools it is too tedious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also problems with limited accuracy of doubles (internal floating point numbers). If you model Solar system up to Pluto resolution of place is on the order of millimeters. It is significant problem for example if you try to dock with very slow speed. There is ways to overcome it by math (which is certainly used in KSP if it still uses 32 bit float numbers) but it takes time to program and time to execute code and add possibility of errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acid_Burn9","CreatedById":192392,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-18T11:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223804569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194811\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221592390362\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205510\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wouter1981\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/17/2020 at 1:39 PM, Wouter1981 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhello everybody,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been playing KSP for almost 1000 hours and been experimenting with a lot of mods but the mod I liked the most by far was the \u0022real solarsystem\u0022 mod.
