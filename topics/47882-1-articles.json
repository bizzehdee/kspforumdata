Added a control module, thruster pack, and parachutes to the orbital booster. That allows me to take command, use fuel left or the thruster pack to deorbit, land, and recover the booster. The Rocomax big orange fuel can can also be recovered once empty by deorbiting with the thruster pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA variation of the design will being the fuel can to Mun orbit. A small amount of fuel from the big can is needed to fine tune Mun orbit. The empty can is crashed into Mun using thrusters. Some SRBs on the launcher may give enough added boost that the can can reach the desired orbit before running out of fuel.
