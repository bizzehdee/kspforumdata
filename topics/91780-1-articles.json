I always find it disappointing that they didn\u0027t.

In kindergarten, they say \u0022Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, but Earth is juuust right.\u0022 As with anything in kinder, it\u0027s not the whole story. MARS IS IN THE HABITABLE ZONE. It just had a number of other factors going against it, mainly size, that made Mars so inhospitable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the Earth has the perfect amount of water, not necessarily for life to evolve, but more so for the development of civilization. Civilization underwater would be impossible because it would not have agriculture, and tiny islands would be too mountainous for agriculture. However, not enough water would lead to, like you said, massive deserts. Here on earth we have enough land to form massive continents with flat lands good for agriculture and still enough water in oceans to maintain a healthy hydrologic cycle and to keep worldwide climates relatively mild through heat exchange. Also, simple geography substantially aided human development. The Mediterranean Sea was a massive boost to worldwide trade in early history. The continents (Americas, Australia, Afro-Eurasia) are also just barely so connected that the ecosystem of one would not totally collapse due to the introduction of completely unrelated species and also separated enough so that biodiversity would give us more variety in resources (Corn vs. Rice). Even Antarctica plays a huge role in shaping oceanic currents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually think that intelligent life around a Yellow Dwarf is, in most cases, impossible. Life wouldn\u0027t have enough time. I think that Earth lucked out and had a huge moon that created tide pools that accelerated early evolution. If the moon was too large, Earth would be tidally locked to it and tides would be static. Taking that into account, humans might just be one of the first intelligent species to appear in the universe. Life might take tens of billions of years to reach this point for all we know. But simply thinking about the fact that habitable stars may exist for trillions of years and we just happen to appear withing the first few billion years that habitable stars could exist is pretty mindblowing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T10:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEarth has unnecessarily much water, pacific especially is too large add some small continents in it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEurasia is too large too, split it up \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehigher temprature would be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.worlddreambank.org/P/PLANETS.HTM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.worlddreambank.org/P/PLANETS.HTM\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehas a lot of cool templates with some interesting results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple planets with life would be good, not only would they exchange simple life but it would also give spaceflight an very huge boost after industrialization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you have the infrastructure to travel between planets regularly astroid mining and other large scale space industries will be far easier than for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe colonizes also create an backup if something goes very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T11:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, the best case would be a white dwarf star in a relatively empty part of a galaxy, with a few rocky planets and 2 or 3 gas giants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe planet in case would be at about 1 astronomical unit from its primary, which would be about 4-5 billion years old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh wait, that\u0027s earth...

To avoid extensive snowball episodes, it would have to be larger and heavier than earth, so it can retain more atmosphere, and have stronger volcanism and plate tectonics, nice effect would be, that such a planet will retain its internal heat for much longer. And the star should be smaller, to add planet lifetime. Of course there is an upper limit on mass because too high gravity might place too strict limits on the evolution of complex lifeforms, and too thick atmosphere would prevent photosynthesis. land/ocean ratio should no be much different from earth. Similarly, there is a lower limit on the star mass to avoid tidal lock or stripping the planet from its moon by tidal forces. (and of course, red dwarf flares, and the issue with too little high energy light to drive photosynthesis ) The planet should have a large moon, preferably mars sized (the planet itself is bigger), to stabilize its axis, and, if a civilization is to develop there on its own, to tempt it to come over and terraform it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T19:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Euracil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Euracil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the Earth has the perfect amount of water, not necessarily for life to evolve, but more so for the development of civilization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, drier, Dune like planets should have a wider stellar habitable zone (HZ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the inner, hotter hz boundary, drier worlds will be more resistant to a runaway greenhouse effect, because their tropics will be able to radiate more heat away compared to an atmosphere saturated with water vapor, but still should be somewhat opaque to infrared, keeping the poles from freezing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the outer, cooler hz boundary, lower humidity should mitigate the formation of clouds and snowfall thus lowering the albedo (reflectivity), so the world will absorb more solar radiation and make it less likely to have a runaway snowball effect.

Earth is supposedly only two billion years away from the end of plate tectonics, even if were to somehow retain its oceans for the next two billion years. This is because the planet is cooling, and radioactive decay in the core- which helps to maintain the planet\u0027s heat- is dropping. Heck, the planet used to support natural fission reactors when uranium got concentrated enough by natural processes in one area. All that is done with. With plate tectonics ending, supposedly that does really bad things to the carbon cycle, because crust, and the carbon it contains, no longer gets subducted back into the mantle. It could also cause the remaining heat to build up under the crust until it busts through in devastating episodes of volcanic eruptions, like Venus appears to undergo. The brightening Sun is supposed to do in Earth\u0027s biosphere before plate tectonics shuts down, and the loss of water may make plate tectonics shut down before the 2 billion year mark is reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem with planets that maintain life for very long periods is atmospheric- the atmosphere is slowly being lost to space.

You have the extreme stellar flares problem and the problem of tidal locking. The long life of red dwarf stars is not a benefit for habitable worlds, as habitability has its own, independent timescale.

For example, much of our planet is subject to freezing winters that we cannot survive without technologies such as clothing, shelter, and control of fire. We feed our populations through farming, which involves modifying the land and the use of domesticated plants and animals. We use technology to adapt to new environments, but we also modify our environment to better suit our needs. Living things have been modifying their environment to their benefit long before humans came along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want to settle a new world, we don\u0027t have to wait for fantastical warp drive spaceships to be invented to fly to a distant solar system with a ready made Earth for us to live on. We can settle Mars with our existing technology. We can then modify the environment there over time to make it more suitable for our needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well as being a destination for colonisation in itself, Mars is within easy reach of the main Asteroid Belt, allowing supplies sent from Mars to mining bases there. It has been suggested that a \u0022triangle trade\u0022 could be set up, with high tech goods and colonists going to Mars, supplies going from Mars to the Asteroid Belt, and precious metals going from the asteroids to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next question would be how best to settle the outer solar system in order to exploit the rich supplies of Helium 3 fuel present in the atmospheres of the gas giants. Titan has been suggested as an ideal base location to support this (Jupiter\u0027s high gravity and nasty Van Allen radiation belts make it less attractive than Saturn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelium 3 is not only an excellent fuel for fusion reactors, it is also an excellent fuel for fusion rockets, which can be used to reach speeds that are adequate for interstellar flight. If we can master the resources of our own solar system, the next step is to begin expanding into new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth bearing in mind that the Earth has only been \u0022Earth-like\u0022 since the relatively recent Cambrian period. Before that, it had no multicellular life and no oxygen atmosphere. Post-Cambrian earths might be rare, but pre-Cambrian earths might be more common. Mars had such conditions in its early geological history and could well have been a home to simple life just as the Earth was. There could be many planets that never develop the right conditions to become a post-Cambrian earth on their own, but would nonetheless be easy for us to settle and terraform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe discovery of a post-Cambrian Earth-like world with complex life would of course be of immense scientific interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T06:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Earth-like planets in Solar System have total surface area about 1.5 Earth surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 1.0 of these 1.5 are on Venus, which is a little bit hard place to leave.
