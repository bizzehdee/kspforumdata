KSP has been particularly bad when i try playing in OSX especially with mods in the game. I\u0027ve tried pasting the output log here from the windows crash but couldn\u0027t as there is too many characters within the crash log. Help greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Michelle\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
