Can we please, \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etoggle an option for fine throttle control without modifiers in the Radial preset\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E? Radial is much more intuitive than Cursor in many aspects, but not being able to properly land a ship, to\u00A0fly a plane or even to drive/taxi\u00A0planes (as I don\u0027t have the science for building proper rovers yet) around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with precise throttle controls because \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003Eevery time you press LB/L1 to move the throttle the craft also trims automatically if you happen to be moving a control surface\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0is a seriously huge bummer!\u00A0I wonder why nobody talks about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, can we have some proper functional trimming?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two problems with the current trim system:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Unlike in the pc version\u00A0where you can move each movement axis (yaw, roll, pitch) trims separately if I\u0027m not mistaken, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003Ein the console version you can only\u003C/span\u003E lazely \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003Eset all trim tabs at once\u003C/span\u003E. So I can\u0027t fix my plane which is\u00A0pitching up by it\u0027s own first, and then later try to fix it\u0027s slow roll to the right since I\u0027ll mess with the first pitch trim by\u00A0trying to trim it again for the roll..... This is really annoying when you\u0027re doing long distance atmospheric flights while trying to use time acceleration because you can never trim the aircraft properly and every small correction you try doing while at 4x accelartion will cause a huge flight path change, overstressing and possible death of kerbals. This then opens up to the 2nd problem:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf I try setting half a pitch up trim (the 4th horizontal line in the pitch indicator, right beside the H from pitch) starting from a no trim situation, I can simply push the joystick halfway forwards\u00A0while\u00A0using the orange arrow as a reference,\u00A0and press the trim button once this arrow is over the line. But then let\u0027s say I still need a little bit more trim for the craft to stop pitching up\u00A0on it\u0027s own, about a\u00A0single line up in\u00A0the indicator,\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003E\u00A0I won\u0027t be able to\u00A0use the\u00A0orange pitch arrow indicator as a reference for the trim anymore!\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIf I push up\u00A0enough so my orange pitch\u00A0arrow indicator is one line over\u00A0the current trim pink arrow (right where I want my new trim to be) and then I press the trim button, \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003Eit won\u0027t set the trim where the orange arrow was\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E, but way above it, because the game still seems to take\u00A0in account how much I\u0027m pulling the physical joystick stick\u00A0instead of the position of the orange arrow. I mostly end up having to reset trim and then watching my Dihedral high wing plane pitching up wildly at over 200m/s.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also have the rather annoying trim button conflicting with multiple other functions. You can\u0027t fine tune throttle while turning because you\u0027ll end up trimming the craft. You can\u0027t time accelerate while turning because you\u0027ll end up trimming the craft. You cannot quickly open the map while flying and maintaining a slight pressure on the craft because you\u0027ll end up trimming the craft - or then you can try opening\u00A0the map through the radial and it will end up cancelling your stick pressure because the radial also happens to use\u00A0the same left stick you use for controlling the craft to\u00A0select the options, instead of using the right camera controlling stick. Lovely!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking about, what I\u0027d suggest was having the LB \u002B View/Select (Xbox/PS4) combination for getting into \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2ecc71;\u0022\u003Etrim mode\u003C/span\u003E. Now in trim mode\u00A0(with a green message on top of the screen telling you are in this mode) every \u0022camera movement\u0022 you do\u00A0with the right stick would actually create a cumulative effect on trimming. For example, pulling\u00A0the right stick a tiny bit out of it\u0027s deadzone would cause the craft to slowly start trimming up until letting go of the stick. The more you\u0027d pull it, the faster it would trim down, until it gets to -100% of trim or you\u00A0let go of the stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, I would not have to stop actually flying the craft to trim it,\u00A0since I\u0027d\u00A0would have fingers on both sticks at the same time.\u00A0With proper coordination, one could notice that\u00A0for the longer he pulls the right stick,\u00A0the more he\u0027d\u00A0release the pressure on the left stick, until the craft is\u00A0slowly and accurately trimmed - not to mention that this would also fix the unintentional trimming, as you\u0027d only get into trimming mode if you really wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the yaw/roll, both would be done with the right stick X-axis. You could switch between the two by pressing RB \u002B Y, similarly to how you switch Roll \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Yaw when flying with the cursor preset by\u00A0pressing\u00A0LB \u002B Y (L1 \u002B \u25B3 on PS4)\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you read it to the end, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d really like to know what other people think of this, checking if more people are also being annoyed by the same problems, and I\u0027d also like really to see what Devs think of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-18T23:37:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2018 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arch3rAc3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMisspell\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T00:44:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS4, Enhanced Edition, 1.01, default controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with this completely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leopard","CreatedById":167666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T19:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWent with \u0022cursor\u0022 mode specifically because of this sort of not terribly well thought through issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arch3rAc3","CreatedById":128094,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-27T02:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo months and a couple of days later.
