I went ahead and included it because that is part of the plan. Although I\u0027m not sure how much science you\u0027ll get out of it, I think there\u0027s only 2 biomes the sub could reach. But, before I get into that though, I wanted to see how everyone reacts to just the basic sub parts. I have some other ideas (where have you heard that before) that I\u0027d like to incorporate, like a different bow with a raked or bulbous nose and \u0027personal watercraft\u0027 but that\u0027s all down the road a bit. Any launching will be other watercraft. I also have an working theory about launching that will mesh with sails, should I ever get those going, whereby the sub could be used to deploy buoys around the ocean to monitor wind directions (and possibly ocean currents???). As for things like missiles, that\u0027ll take a lot of coding that I\u0027m not quite up to yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF... you want to get into modding parts to work with the sub, you\u0027re of course, free to do so. My advice would be to look at the .cfg for the floodlight. You\u0027ll see the MODULE for Firespitter\u0027s Buoyancy code in there. Copy that module and paste it into any part you want to put on the sub. Depending on where you put it, you may need to change the buoyancy setting. 50 is max buoyancy and all of the hull parts are set to that. The Conning Tower is set to 50 as well because it\u0027s on the top of the sub. That\u0027s so that when you\u0027re submerged, the Conning Tower tends to keep the sub upright. Parts like the dive planes are set to 10 so that when you\u0027re on the surface, they help keep the sub from rolling over. Any other part, like the lights, will have a very small value for buoyancy. If you\u0027re unsure, you can set the debug to = true and when you launch, you can manually adjust the buoyancy of that part (yes, manually tweaking each part\u0027s buoyancy along with ballast is what it took to finally work it all out).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, it\u0027s simple *cough*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-21T00:07:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatttheCzar","CreatedById":135304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T00:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thatdude253\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thatdude253\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre those legit?
