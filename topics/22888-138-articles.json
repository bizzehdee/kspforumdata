It has enough thrust to carry a Large Silver or White Titan tank isolated from engines into orbit with my stations, it costs less to launch and less is therefor lost after all recoverable parts are recovered (even if you fully recover all parts from a Saturn II, it still would LOOSE more credits than would be expended on a completely lost launch of my Titan IV tanker. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs, SRB decouplers, SRB seperation rockets nosecones = 2x cost (4 vice 2 identical SRBs) I think you can see how this is already going\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have toyed with a Saturn II INT-18 sans the SRBs but the core package does not have enough fuel/thrust2weight to hurl a Big G system WITH RETURN capabilities into LKO.
