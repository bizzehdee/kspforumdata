Impractical, yes. Fun? Very.

I haven\u0027t been able to do T4, but T5, Aerodynamics, Landing Systems, Fuel Systems and Propulsion Systems. Well, I still need to land. I think the key is drag and thrust management, until I replaced the AV-T1 tail with a basic fin I was just shy of orbit. Blasting full thrust on rocket stage leaves me short. 4 Junos take me to Mach 1 @ 8500m, kick in the 2 Sparks and 1 terrier and lift to 15deg. Jets flame out at about 18km, mach 2.2. Keep the sparks on until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is about 1.65 then cut them. Keep the terrier at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1-1.2 by reducing throttle and follow prograde.
