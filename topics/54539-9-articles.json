We will not launch a toy bus. We will launch... an INFLATABLE bus. Lightweight and small item, but capable of expanding to the size of a real bus through the use of a small tank of compressed air sent up with it. It can be a very small tank too, you don\u0027t need very high pressure in the inflato-bus when outside is a vacuum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it will serve as a good test for materials some groups are considering for using to build inflatable space stations, if done correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it would be small and light-weight, it may be viable to attach some instrument or another to it too for scientific value of some other sort. Also, we need a small solar panel attached to a battery, camera, and small antennae, all attached to something that projects a little bit away from the inflato-bus (maybe a hood \u0022antennae\u0022 so we can get a head-on picture of the \u0022bus\u0022). Aside from taking a picture, it will also let us know how long the inflation holds up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since it IS inflatable, there is pretty much no concern whatsoever if it does end up falling into the atmosphere. Something lightweight with the surface area it has, even if it deflates and shrinks a little, is extremely unlikely to endanger anything to say the least. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you have it. A full-sized bus-like object, that can be launched into space at low cost, and which can even further spacecraft design a bit (well, space station, but still) by acting as a proof of concept prototype.

And then, after it\u0027s stayed in orbit for a few days, taking some photos with an automated GoPro and possibly carrying some experiments, we bring it back. Intact.
