Please let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers were happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo a saner mind, this would have been a warning sign. Few engineers are willing to clamber aboard their machines and learn about their individual quirks, especially if the machine in question is preparing to shove a Kerbal faster than any Kerbal had a right to go. That special level of crazy required a test pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah looked up at the engineers\\\u0027 latest creation and grinned. The only reaction of the gleaming tower was to click, hiss, and moan as refrigerants evaporated and valves opened to vent them. \u0027How fast?\u0027 he asked in measured tones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Escape velocity, at least,\u0027 came Myrtle\\\u0027s reply. She glanced at her clipboard. \u0027Three and a half kilometers per second, give or take. You\\\u0027ll need to have that much push to get all the way to Minmus and back. Bottom line, though: There\\\u0027s enough oomph in this baby to leave our planet behind forever. You\\\u0027ll be the first Kerbin to pilot a machine with this much power.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Sweet, holy Meander.\u0027 Jeb donned his favorite sunglasses, never removing his gaze from the tiny capsule perched on top of the monster. It was a while before he spoke, though his grin showed no sign of fading. \u0027I\\\u0027ll need to collect my crew. Get ready to push the Big Red Button.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But is it safe?\u0027 Bob demanded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\\\u0027ve seen the Ker-Sproing Alpha I myself. Up-close and personal. It\\\u0027s a thing of beauty,\u0027 Jeb replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But. Is. It. Safe?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb sighed. \u0027It\\\u0027s a stinking \u003Cem\u003Erocket\u003C/em\u003E, Bob. It\\\u0027s not supposed to be \u003Cem\u003Esafe\u003C/em\u003E. You should have learned that after our flight of the Gassy Guppy III last year.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob remembered. The engineers had underestimated how much thrust they would need in the second stage. Less than fifteen kilometers up, he couldn\\\u0027t take his eyes off the altimeter as the rocket slowed, stopped, and began falling back to Kerbal -- backwards, the engines still roaring under full thrust. The last thing he remembered was watching rocket exhaust fly up past the capsule windows. According to the post-flight briefing, Jeb had kept his cool and pitched the rocket over, allowing them to jettison the capsule and parachute back down safely right next to the water tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Bob hadn\\\u0027t passed out from terror, he probably would have learned a lot about rocket flight. As it was, the only thing that really stuck with him was the lesson that bleaching urine stains out of a flight suit was harder than he had first expected. Space-age fabrics might look good on camera, but they stain all too easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Say what you will,\u0027 Jeb said, interrupting unpleasant memories about a long hour spent in the space center\\\u0027s laundry room. \u0027That thing may not have flown well, but she gave a smooth ride.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Comfort all the way to the crater,\u0027 Bob muttered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What was that?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Have you trained?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Enough to keep your little green butt safe. I always do. Don\\\u0027t worry. I\\\u0027ve got your back.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob sighed. \u0027All right. I\\\u0027m in.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Why Minmus?\u0027 Bill pressed. \u0027Why not Mun first?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Because Minmus is further away. That\\\u0027s automatically cooler.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Take off your sunglasses,\u0027 Bill said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb complied. \u0027Look,\u0027 he said. \u0027Minmus offers us the opportunity to figure out how to land tail-first in a safer, low-gravity environment. Sure, it takes longer to get there, but it\\\u0027s better than finding out as we plummet towards a heavier body that the rearview mirrors don\\\u0027t work right. \\\u0027Objects In Mirror May Be Closer Than They Appear\\\u0027 and all that.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill snorted -- a tricky sound to make when one has no nose. \u0027Fine. But wouldn\\\u0027t it be easier to wait until the scientists figure out docking first? We wouldn\\\u0027t have to worry about planting something down gently that was \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E big enough to bring us all the way home again. Just saying. It would give me time to go on a vacation with Sylvia.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You can wait if you want,\u0027 Jeb answered. \u0027But Minmus has these enormous ice fields. Your figure-skating girlfriend would be impressed. She\\\u0027d probably even find it romantic.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill opened his mouth to protest, then closed it again. \u0027Fine,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027Let\\\u0027s land on Minmus.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiery-red Kerbol was just beginning to rise over the Kerbal Space Center when the main engines ignited under the Ker-Sproing Alpha I. A compression wave rippled up the length of the rocket and snapped out the top. Before Bob could even open his mouth to scream, the beast lurched off the pad and began sliding towards the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost before they\\\u0027d cleared the tower, the rocket began to sway -- rocking to and fro as the SAS attempted to compensate for fluctuations in heading by slamming the winglets from one extreme to the other. The oscillation was enough to shove the poor Kerbals from side to side in their seats in spite of the harnesses. Jeb swore and put his hand on the abort handle. \u0027Could be a short flight,\u0027 he observed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor his part, Bill was frantically stabbing out alarm lights as the computer complained about guidance. \u0027I think this will damp out once we get out of the lower atmosphere,\u0027 he said without looking away from the instrument panel. \u0027Our radar can\\\u0027t keep a constant fix on the ground, but I can still see figures every once in a while, and our trajectory looks right on the money.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob started freaking out, loudly. Jeb swore again and apologized to Bill. \u0027I planned ahead, really I did. I was hoping this would be a quieter flight. Unfortunately, I left the sedatives in my duffel bag.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Where\\\u0027s your duffel bag?\u0027 Bill asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027In the White Room, next to my locker,\u0027 Jeb replied. \u0027I guess that means that if this rocking keeps up, I may need to borrow your comb in a bit. It\\\u0027s messing up my hair.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few tense moments, Bill\\\u0027s prediction turned out to be right; the rocking slowly began to dissipate. Jeb released the abort handle and started to steer towards the east. \u0027We should be in orbit shortly,\u0027 he reported. \u0027I\\\u0027ll be following the path on your display, if I can.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bang rattled the capsule as the first stage separated. A second bang signalled the ignition of the second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Muuuuuch smoother,\u0027 Bill said appreciatively. \u0027It\\\u0027s like I always say: One engine is better than six.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Speak for yourself,\u0027 Jeb responded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven after orbit and MECO, Bill looked concerned. \u0027I can\\\u0027t get a good status on the \\\u0027chutes,\u0027 he confessed. \u0027I think they might have been damaged during ascent -- but it could just be a faulty sensor.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb thought about this. \u0027Well, if the parachutes are shot, we\\\u0027ll be dead if we go home. And that\\\u0027s true whether we go to Minmus or not.\u0027 He grinned at Bob, who had gone hoarse from shouting and was now emitting little squeaks. \u0027Just try not to think about it, okay, Bob?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was several days\\\u0027 cruise to Minmus. Jeb ended up steering the craft into a highly elliptical orbit inclined to Minmus\\\u0027 equator by more than forty-five degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\\\u0027m going to try dropping straight in from periapsis,\u0027 Jeb announced, \u0027with periodic bursts meant to keep us from picking up too much speed.\u0027 He locked in the capsule\\\u0027s heading so that he would be able to fire against the rocket\\\u0027s direction of travel when they got down to that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Wow,\u0027 Bill exclaimed. He leaned over Bob to look out the window. \u0027It\\\u0027s... it\\\u0027s amazingly weird, isn\\\u0027t it? I\\\u0027d have expected sharper peaks on something without erosion. Why do you think all those features are rounded off?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no reply. Bob continued to squeak. \u0027Why do we take him along, anyway?\u0027 Bill pressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb shrugged. \u0027Space is quiet. I don\\\u0027t like it when it\\\u0027s too quiet for too long. Besides, he reminds me of my parakeet.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe minutes to periapsis passed quickly. It wasn\\\u0027t long before the kerbonauts felt the familiar kick in their seats associated with a rocket firing. The altimeter quickly started to tick off the meters as the vessel sank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs promised, Jeb only fired the engine every few hundred meters to slow their descent. Before long, it became clear that the rocket would set down in one of the enormous ice lakes on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill leaned over Bob again. He looked at the nav ball to verify that they were headed straight down. \u0027Um, maybe it\\\u0027s a trick of the mirror, or maybe the rotation is faster than we\\\u0027d thought,\u0027 he said, \u0027but we seem to be moving \u003Cem\u003Esideways\u003C/em\u003E a lot faster than I expected.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Don\\\u0027t worry about it,\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027The gravity here is pretty light. We may skid or bounce a little, but we\\\u0027ll be fine.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs if to punctuate his remark, the landing legs smacked into the hard surface. Unfortunately, they were moving sideways so fast that one of the legs snapped clean off as the capsule slowly bounced back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb sighed. He had \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E to react as the craft traveled a slow arc and began to head back toward the surface. \u0027No landing this time, I guess,\u0027 he said flatly, and rammed the throttle back up to full, punching the trio back into the void.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral days later, the parachute worked perfectly. And Bob was finally awake and quiet at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the capsule drifted towards the water, Jeb started a mental checklist of things to ask the engineers to add. Maybe another fuel tank in the second stage to increase their margin for error when they finally arrived at the small moon? Maybe that would work. A few other things would be needed before they flew the Ker-Sproing Alpha II, but the basic design seemed decent enough. It got them there, didn\\\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was trying to work out the wording he\\\u0027d need to apologize to Sylvia and minimize her \u0027angry time\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Bob was counting the change in his pocket and making sure he had enough for two washes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T20:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really liked this (though I\\\u0027m unconvinced by the logic of going for Minmus first).
