Is it possible to send several modules to Duna on the same transfer Window? Could I be able to control them properly throughout the flight when i launch like 5 modules in a row with ~1 Hour between them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How to chute-land them all on the same spot? (I wont use mechjeb) Landing several crafts on the mun on the same location is fairly easy because i can just kill my horizontal velocity at the same spot every time. But due to Atmospheric drag and the fact that duna is too big to kill horizontal velocity above the atmosphere(too much dV needed), how do i aim parachute landings properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How do you match the height of rovers and fuel modules so that you can refuel them easily?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you can give me some advice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Thank you and have fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-14T18:17:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2013 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jaedinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moach","CreatedById":9,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou should be just fine sending multiple missions over the same launch window, there\u0027s some give to it, and you can easily send out vessels even a couple of kerbin-days apart without sacrificing much on dV requirements....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estill, perhaps more efficient would be to just dock multiple vessels, then send them all together under the same engine (nuclear, at best) -- remember, once you\u0027re in orbit, there\u0027s no need to accelerate all that fast - so you\u0027ll get a more efficient ride out of assembling a larger vessel in a more homely orbit beforehand\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplus, then you won\u0027t need to juggle between a barrage of assorted vessels - you reduce your \u0022kerbal error\u0022 risks by a drastic amount this way\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eremember Murphy - it\u0027s the law! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azazael","CreatedById":68390,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI sent this to Duna (Vessel to right attached to my orbital station). with 4 Home modules attached and landed them simultaneously\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/900998117437045241/9CBF8175DFE24CC9E9BFE7A308E052D0100C2FAF/\u0022 alt=\u00229CBF8175DFE24CC9E9BFE7A308E052D0100C2FAF\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-14T18:20:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2013 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Azazael\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azazael","CreatedById":68390,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere they are landed on Duna.
