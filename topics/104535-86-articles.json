I also removed the front wings, they make it wobble terribly. The door parts seemed no to be attached between them, so I added a stock strucural part between the hinge and the door, and now the door parts act normally. But it still seems too heavy for that hinge... even if I set BreakingForce and BreakingTorque to 1000000 on the hinge. Now the door opens a bit, but as you can see, it can\u0027t reach 90\u00B0 at all...  \n  \n![lN8oM8l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lN8oM8l.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-22T18:59:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2017 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Knacky**"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-22T19:39:52Z","Content":"[@Knacky](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126354-knacky/) From what I can tell. You are attempting to lift a multi ton door with a single hinge. (The B9 HX parts you are using are, I believe full of fuel. Which is extremely heavy) To lift something that heavy is a more advanced procedure which can be very difficult to explain (but I will do my best)\n\nYou will need multiple hinges / IR components to move such a large door.\n\nYou will also need a way to secure the door when it is open or closed\n\nQuantum struts are a great tool for both of these problems.\n\nYou cannot actually \u0022attach\u0022 two IR components to a moving segment at the same time. But you can attach additional IR components to a moving segment using struts or a stronger connection is using a quantum strut. so simple example is attach 3 IR Pivitrons to a surface in a row. Set all 3 up to move in the same direction and alignment. Attach a beam or something to the center Pivitron. Then using Quantum struts / regular struts attach the outside Pivitrons to the beam, which is already attached to the center Pivitron. You now have a beam that moves as well as has additional support from additional outside 2 IR Pivitrons. You can also use this same technique with just about any other IR component. I was able to use this kind of design on my tower crane capable of lifting 40\u002B tons. I used 4 Rotatrons to support the heavy load of the boom it\u0027s 200 ton counterweights and a 40 ton payload.\n\nIn this picture is the Tower crane rotation bearing I designed using 3 uncontrolled IR Rotatrons and a single Controlled IR Bearing. All the uncontrolled Rotatrons are attached back to the structure of the support with 4 CMES struts each\n\n![screenshot19_zpsktpmwlv6.png~original](http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w475/v8jester1/Random%20KSP/screenshot19_zpsktpmwlv6.png~original)\n\nAnd here is a video to show it actually works ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xyQHRmL0Ss?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Cratzz","CreatedById":157974,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T15:31:49Z","Content":"Hello, using the dev-version (v2.0.10) with reworked parts and no parts work as intended.

I\u0027ve been wondering why it didn\u0027t work for days, I was convinced it was a KJR issue, but finally the problem came from the door weight. Some B9 HX parts kept their original mass (the HX1-UH Hollow Module, exactly) even if I modify it in the cfg file. So I took the tank part that looks the same and I could change it. I first tried to change the mass of the door parts to 0.0 but THIS IS NOT A THING TO DO : it made the door wobble a lot and explode every time. So I set the mass of each door part to 0.06. Now it\u0027s pretty stable and very light. Then I used your advice, Jester, and combined the power of 3 Pivotrons, without needing a beam. Finally, I used a Rotatron for the lower part of the nose that becomes a ramp.  \n\nLooking cool, isn\u0027t ? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n  \n![K6i2Ct6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/K6i2Ct6.jpg)\n\n![QvjEW6X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QvjEW6X.jpg)\n\n![cuMh0i1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cuMh0i1.jpg)\n\nThanks again for your help !"},{"CreatedByName":"Messeno","CreatedById":148030,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T10:48:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, Calvin\\_Maclure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What exactly do you mean by \u0027\u0027work\u0027\u0027?

I enabled infinit electricity and fuel (but it will indeed achieve orbit the way I showed in my video without cheats)\n\nSo your three best friends from this point on are going to be.\n\nTweakscale, Tweakable Everything and B9 Aerospace.\n\nGrab a B9 HX reaction wheel and scale it down to what you need. Then alt\u002Bclick a copy of the scaled reaction wheel. This copy will give you a small scale reaction wheel with full scale torque. (Something like 1700 torque) I used two of them tweaked down to what I needed to fly the Protolift as smoothly as possible just took some tweaking with tweakable everything to get the values right. Otherwise you will have way too much torque and it will look really funny trying to fly.\n\nIf you have any more questions jump over to my Advanced aircraft thread linked in my signature.\n\nedit\n\nWould have helped to watch the whole video.....\n\nSo the axis of one of the rotations became inverted after a time warp?
