I do have a couple of questions/suggestions/disscusion points for KSP 2 and would love to hear what you guys are thinking about them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. looking at the trailer footage, the new navball and flight U.I looks cool, but it does look quite cluttered and convoluted compared to the original. I\u0027m not sure if thats just an effect of the more digitised aesthetic it has but have you considered adding an option in settings to toggle the old navball if a player desires?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. KSP 1 doesn\u0027t cope well with flight controllers with a lot of buttons, particularly if you have multiple controllers connected at once (HOSAS, HOTAS if the throttle has its own USB connection, rudder pedals). it doesn\u0027t indicate which controller a button is from (it\u0027ll say \u0027button 5\u0027 rather than \u0027joy 1 button 5\u0027) and it\u0027s unclear whether the game itself is distinguishing between the different controllers, or just assigning something to button 5 of all the controllers. It also does not pick up all the buttons, axis, etc from the controllers (I have an x55 rhino HOTAS, half the buttons on the throttle quadrant don\u0027t get registered by ksp, and if I\u0027ve assigned something to the joysticks button 5, and something else to throttle button 5, if I press either of the buttons, both actions trigger. Are you aware of this/do you have plans to address this in KSP 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nother than that, the game footage looks beautiful, and so do the new features. you guys are amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-25T21:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6692491714\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/210240-the-new-ui-for-ksp2-improvements-and-regressions-from-previous-concepts/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=4190314\u0026amp;embedComment=4190314\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:297px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-25T23:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224190720\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666730772\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223464\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jeb2electricboogaloo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, jeb2electricboogaloo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you aware of this/do you have plans to address this in KSP 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nflight stick functionality was hinted at in Episode 4: Celestial Architecting, I think (or maybe Ep. 5?)

I especially hate the\u00A0 pressure meter. its not different colors its just different amount of pixels showing how much atmosphere there is and the indicator is so big you dont see where its pointing and its also much bigger and in the middle than ksp one. its way to in center and attention grabbing considering you barely look at it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope it is easily moddable because then i will probably make a mod making it look like an old airplane cockpit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
