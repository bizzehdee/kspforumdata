I want to start off by saying that I absolutely HATE them. I dont know why, but since 0.9 all my rockets seem nearly impossible to fly without SAS and the fact that only OCTO probes and pilots have SAS with no means to externally add it in majes for a very frustrating experience as getting into orbit is so TEDIOUS if not nearly impossible. Regardless of whether I have FAR or not i get craft that rotate or drift shortly after launch, and I have checked and re-checked to ensure proper symmetry and mass distribution etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForget about gravity turns. Its hard enough to keep it going straight up (heading of 0) , but pitching the rocket ever so *slightly* causes it to go completely out of control and tumble about all over the place. It is far worse if you try to use 2 boosters (180 degree symmetry). I have had to resort to modding all the probes to re-introduce SAS since this is now the only way to have SAS as the reaction wheels are no longer capable of SAS even if I mod the cfg file. I never enjoyed manual piloting and always depended on SAS for launch, but now it feels pretty much impossible to get anything done without SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second issue is the sheer cost of things vs how little you earn. Starting from scratch feels completely nerfed and it is just so tedious to have to amass massive amounts of credits to unlock the most basic of skills like collecting soil samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all those 2 issues are enough to severely limit my progress and the amount of fun I gain playing KSP.

Whether a good decision or not, you\u0027re not supposed to have that capability at the beginning. I get were you\u0027re coming from, it happened to me too, but it\u0027s not that hard. It\u0027s a pain sometimes yes, but overall I think you might be doing things wrong, because it doesn\u0027t seem that bad to me, ie: I can fly the things and point them where I want to (and keep hitting keys to keep them straight, yes) expect when I don\u0027t have the tech and thus not much control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe grind at the begging, yes, I agree it might be a little tedious, specially because what parts you can unlock don\u0027t make any sense IMO. But just keep flying, you\u0027ll get enough moolah sooner or later. I recommend hitting the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus over and over to, well, grind the science out of them.
