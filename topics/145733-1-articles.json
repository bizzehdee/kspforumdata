Now the question(s):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a nice, easy to read write-up on all the parameters, how they relate to one another, to the external environment, which figures matter more than others and why, etc etc? If there isn\u0027t, could one who has a good grasp on these things in physics give an easy to read explanation to what it all means? I do have some idea and a few are self explanatory but the others not so much and I am pretty much guessing on their meaning and significance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-10T20:28:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2016 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T05:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m assuming Hottest and Coolest are self explanatory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCritical part is the most vulnerable part to structural failure.\u00A0 This means, that part is currently the closest to being at risk.\u00A0 Critical Thermal Percentage tells you just how close, at 100% it\u0027s a gonner.\u00A0 Note: Just because a part shows up doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s close to death.\u00A0 Even on the launchpad the system picks a part to display, you have to compare to the percentage.\u00A0 You can also compare it to the actual temperature which is displayed in current/maximum format.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlux is the rate at which heat energy is transferred in specific methods.\u00A0 Internal Flux is the generation of heat by a part (engines/drills).
