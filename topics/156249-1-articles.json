Except: I can\u0027t find any class A asteroids. I\u0027ve got class E (huge) right down to Class C (Medium) but no class A asteroids. There are about 7 asteroids visible from the tracking station. Question: am I missing something? Do I need to send out a scanner, or just wait until a class A asteroid meanders into tracking station range? For info, I\u0027m playing career mode with kerbnet on and standard difficulty settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T14:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are doing nothing wrong.
