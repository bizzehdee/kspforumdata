I will put my output log and pictures of the problem and my gamedata folder at the end of this post. For some reason in my current game, the Mark 1-2 Command Pod does not have the correct resources. Something is not working with the RO_Squad_Command.cfg MM config file, specifically the ModuleFuelTanks config does not seem to be applying to the Mark 1-2 Command Pod. (see attached pictures for what is showing up).

The only time struts should ever be needed is for super bendy wings and strapon side boosters. Although They can be also useful for keeping those huge LH2 tanks for NTRs from wobbling on their fairings.
