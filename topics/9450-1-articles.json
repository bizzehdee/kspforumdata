Since the main issue with multiplayer is the time warp making trips practical, I have an idea for how to make that work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you that understand the reference, the idea is like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.startrek.com/legacy_media/images/200303/voy-233-voyager-gets-pulled-to/320x240.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022320x240.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpheres of influence: Once you\\\u0027re inside/outside a certain area, it really doesn\\\u0027t matter too much what\\\u0027s going on in another area. Since, primarily, what people are concerned with is Kerbin, Space Between, Mun, and Kerbin-Mun, then all you need is time warps for these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Player 1 (p1) and Player 2 (p2) both travel from Kerbin at different times. p1 reaches the space border first, and then gets set up to go to Mun. Orbit\\\u0027s locked in, Ap and Pe are all good, so they hit the time warp. Since p2 is still technically on Kerbin, p1 is able to time warp freely. p2 launches and gets to space, so p1 is pulled out of time warp. Since p1 and p2 are both in the same \u0027sphere of influence,\u0027 they have to vote for it (ideally with some form of configurable condition). The vote succeeds, time warp is set at the level desired until a player cancels it. p1 enters mun sphere of influence, but p2 is still in space. Time warp is now separate for p1 and p2. p1 slows down the time warp since they\\\u0027re getting ready to land, but p2 can continue their journey to get to the mun. If p2 accelerates, they see the p1/mun sphere of influence accelerate accordingly. p2 enters the mun\\\u0027s sphere of influence, so now they have to vote for it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the idea is that the players only use the same \u0027time acceleration\u0027 if they\\\u0027re in a similar area or condition. I.e. a player going for a low pass by the sun isn\\\u0027t really going to be too terribly concerned with the exact positioning of Mun and Kerbin. A player exploring Mun isn\\\u0027t going to be too terribly concerned with someone in low orbit around Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A host-dictator system, where whoever is host is in charge of the time warp (maybe with some time delay before switching to prepare players or allow a cancel), and all the clients are time warped simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A players-just-vote system, where all the players have to agree to a given time warp in order to do the time warp suggested by the voter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know multiplayer is going to be a logistics hairball. Honestly, I\\\u0027d be okay with tolerating ANY form of multiplayer. I\\\u0027d really like this, and if some form of rough-in gets implemented, players can test it and the finer points of it can be worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as a side note, some form of way to override the \u0027safeties\u0027 on each orbital height would be nice. I\\\u0027ve been switching to a ship I have sitting on the ground to be able to time lapse faster, but having a way to do it in-ship would be fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T16:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think that\\\u0027s there main problem with multiplayer, i think it\\\u0027s the actual network code that\\\u0027s the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could still play it with friends without time warp, \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T17:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegrim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aegrim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think that\\\u0027s there main problem with multiplayer, i think it\\\u0027s the actual network code that\\\u0027s the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could still play it with friends without time warp,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have time warp though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp-drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou warp in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neistridlar","CreatedById":20296,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T17:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer would indeed be awesome.

Since p2 is still technically on Kerbin, p1 is able to time warp freely. p2 launches and gets to space, so p1 is pulled out of time warp. Since p1 and p2 are both in the same \u0027sphere of influence,\u0027 they have to vote for it (ideally with some form of configurable condition). The vote succeeds, time warp is set at the level desired until a player cancels it. p1 enters mun sphere of influence, but p2 is still in space. Time warp is now separate for p1 and p2. p1 slows down the time warp since they\\\u0027re getting ready to land, but p2 can continue their journey to get to the mun. If p2 accelerates, they see the p1/mun sphere of influence accelerate accordingly. p2 enters the mun\\\u0027s sphere of influence, so now they have to vote for it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the idea is that the players only use the same \u0027time acceleration\u0027 if they\\\u0027re in a similar area or condition. I.e. a player going for a low pass by the sun isn\\\u0027t really going to be too terribly concerned with the exact positioning of Mun and Kerbin. A player exploring Mun isn\\\u0027t going to be too terribly concerned with someone in low orbit around Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A host-dictator system, where whoever is host is in charge of the time warp (maybe with some time delay before switching to prepare players or allow a cancel), and all the clients are time warped simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A players-just-vote system, where all the players have to agree to a given time warp in order to do the time warp suggested by the voter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know multiplayer is going to be a logistics hairball. Honestly, I\\\u0027d be okay with tolerating ANY form of multiplayer. I\\\u0027d really like this, and if some form of rough-in gets implemented, players can test it and the finer points of it can be worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as a side note, some form of way to override the \u0027safeties\u0027 on each orbital height would be nice. I\\\u0027ve been switching to a ship I have sitting on the ground to be able to time lapse faster, but having a way to do it in-ship would be fantastic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING: Off-Topic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That was the best episode of Star Trek: Voyager EVER!!!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool Idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T03:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I am one to always encourage enthusiasm for the game, I am going to say here and now to everyone to not get your hopes up of any sort of multiplayer in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs things are now, we already do have a strong multiplayer facet going, with the sharing of craft ideas, custom parts, and stories of our adventures we share with images and videos. I am actually satisfied with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is one way to actually implement multiplayer, it would be through coop in one mission. While the conception of a shared space where multiple missions take place is a nice idea, I would have to think that the server load would be pretty high. I doubt this is something you could just run off your older Dual Core PC sitting in your closet. And you could definitely kiss time warp goodbye. Say it was just localized to each world\\\u0027s SOI. That would include Kerbol\\\u0027s SOI as well. Think of how many interplanetary missions would be occuring, and you wanted to accelerate yours. Fine, pump up the time frame and suddenly your buddy\\\u0027s mission just took a dump into the biggest gas giant because he didn\\\u0027t have time to adjust the transition into planetary orbit. That is a recipe for griefers beyond belief.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a 2-3 player coop where you each take part in how a mission performs can be a much better platform. That would take away some of the stress of worrying about parts of the mission as well as can keep time warp in the equation when the mission is in transition with no need for adjustment in between. It would give you and your buddies a chance to get a feel of how it is to sit in an Apollo capsule with two others, as well as plenty of opportunity to keep everything kerbal, as well. It is one thing to cut a stage that is still burning yourself, but to see your buddy goof up and send those boosters off premature is recipe for a new kind of kerbal frustration. But to also successfully accomplish a mission as well between the two or three of you would be awesome, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxpower","CreatedById":16625,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T04:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not sure how the game handles time warp exactlly, but its possible that there would be no way to have different warp speeds for different areas.
