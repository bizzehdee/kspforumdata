Kids know and say worse but the MPAA is an ancient organization with leadership just as old, naive, and prude. They say that a pg-13 can only have 2 f-bombs. No frontal nudity but butts are ok. The book realistically is a pg-13 book even with all of the cursing. In this day an age I think the distinction should be drawn at nudity. Even though realistically as well kids see much worse too on the internet. However if we are going to have ratings swearing is the least of the MPAA concern. Over sexualization that is a problem also extreme violence. I\u0027m not talking about like die hard violence. I\u0027m talking the likes of the SAW series. I think long story short realistically there are things kids see and hear everyday. Swearing, the oversexualization of everything from Halloween costumes to bubble gum and fighting and violence in video games and on tv.

It lands on Mars and generates its own fuel from the Martian atmosphere, only bringing enough hydrogen to do so.

Whether the OMS was part of the capsule (possible, as the thrusters Martinez used to keep the MAV upright during the initial storm seemed to fire from the capsule itself) I do not know, but it seems that way by how it seperates in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also have no information on the means of the crew to return to Earth\u0027s surface. As Hermes will enter an orbit, it might be possible that a seperate vehicle is launched - although that would need a dedicated launcher, a waste in and of itself if you ask me. Maybe they use the same vehicle that brought them up at the beginning of their mission, maybe NASA has a new space station with an orbital shuttle to pick them up and return them with a resupply vehicle - the book says nothing about this.

However if the crewed part of the MAV only needs to dock with Hermes and then discarded in Martian orbit then the separation between the capsule and its upper stage seems a bit pointless - that would be like having a separation event between the Apollo LM and its ascent engine before docking with the CSM.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI figure if I was to design the mission then when Hermes return to earth after mission complete then there will be an exchange of crew with something like an Orion (or a smaller manned spacecraft, if Hermes actually returns to LEO) where the Ares III crew will hand the ship over to the Ares IV crew for refurbishment before their mission, and the Ares III crew will then ride the capsule back to earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nActually I just remembered something - at the very end of the movie it showed the Ares III crew looking at live TV coverage of a launch for Ares IV and it showed an Delta-IV Heavy launch, so the crew exchange could very well be done with something like an Orion. Seen as the Ares III crew is already on the ground, if the Delta-IV Heavy was carrying a manned spacecraft that would probably be an exchange of crew between Ares IV crew and caretaker crew that mans Hermes between Mars trips.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me started on MAV\u0027s OMS, if it\u0027s powerful enough to resist a storm that could topple the ship then surely it would be powerful enough to make up that 20m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway one thing I thought was really cool was that throw away line by the deputy head of CNSA who said something like\u00A0 \u0022I\u0027ve had our engineer run the numbers and our Taiyangshen boosters is powerful enough to boost their payload to Mars\u0022. I thought that was actually a very important thing that\u0027s probably not apparent to someone who\u0027s not familiar with orbital mechanics or play KSP - although Hermes and Iris docked above earth, the Iris probe was actually already on a course in the general direction of Mars after it separated from it\u0027s booster (plus any delta-V added by Iris\u0027s own engines). If Hermes shutdown its engine then Iris and Hermes will actually drift side by side for a very long time to near Mars orbit.
