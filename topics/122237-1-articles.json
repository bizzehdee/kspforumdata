Great...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried every single design possible but nothing works. While in orbit of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn the delta-v for a plain change is HUGE, and I can\u0027t for the love of cheese get a manneuver that adjusts my plain while in the SOI of kerbin... Any ideas? I would like to deliver at least 1/4 of an orange tank at a time. BTW this is career mode and I have not unlocked spaceplane tec, but I have all 2,5m parts. If you could post me some designs it would really help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xuixien","CreatedById":149208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T20:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest way to refuel would be to have a ship that land son the mun, mines, processes ore to fuel, and takes off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T20:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you can\u0027t practically change the plane from equatorial to polar in one burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you burn out to the edge of the Mun SOI, do the plane change there, and then burn back, you actually use *less* dV. About 600 m/s if I recall correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do a direkt KSC launch, you do the following\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Launch like you would go to the regular orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get an intercept, but one where the apoapsis of your trajectory crosses the muns trajectory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Halfway between Kerbin and the Mun, place a maneuver node\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Focus the Mun, but in such a way that both your trajectory and the maneuver node are visible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pull the maneuver node \u0022up\u0022, which would be the \u0022normal\u0022 direction until the trajectory is clearly above the pole\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Play with the Prograde and Radial component of the node to move your trajectory directly over the pole\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Over the pole, create a maneuver node that captures you in Mun Orbit. Do NOT circularize! The more elliptical your trajectory is (without leaving the Mun SOI), the better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do all the burns, arrive there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At the Apoapsis (which should be far out now), create a node for a plane change. Note that this doesn\u0027t change the Inclination, but the \u0022Longitude of Ascending Node\u0022 or whatever, but \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you set the fuelless station as target, you can now easily burn at the (relative) ascending or descending node, whichever is at the Apoapsis which is still far out. This should take super little dV (less than 30 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once you matched the plane, you can lower the apoapsis. If I were you, I\u0027d use the opportunity to find a rendez-vous, by placing the maneuver for the burn slightly *after* the Closest approach marker. This way, you should see the \u0022Target Position at Closest Approach\u0022 marker rotate around when you drag the retrograde maneuver vector. Use this to align the two markers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T03:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood explanation from Kobymaru. The summary is: Getting into a polar orbit around the Mun (from Kerbin) isn\u0027t really any more expensive in terms of dV than getting into an equatorial one. The key is that you aim for a polar orbit from the get-go. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDon\u0027t\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E go to the Mun in an equatorial orbit first and then try to change your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXuixien\u0027s strategy is also good, as long as you can land a miner on the Mun straight from Kerbin. From a surface-landed ship, it\u0027s as easy to sync up with a polar station as it is with an equatorial one-- you just have to wait until the Mun rotates your position so that it\u0027s under the station\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delta-Cheese","CreatedById":151414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T13:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kobymaru\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kobymaru\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pull the maneuver node \u0022up\u0022, which would be the \u0022normal\u0022 direction until the trajectory is clearly above the pole\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Play with the Prograde and Radial component of the node to move your trajectory directly over the pole\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I can\u0027t do, it never lines up with the pole.
