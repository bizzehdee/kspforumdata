So my poor little astronaut needed to stay on the moon for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime...I wanted to rescue the little guy. However, my command pod only had space for one astronaut. I thought I would just try if I could put a command seat on my rocket to bring him back (bringing a dead body back to Kerbin is better than no body!). Unfortunately I didn\u0027t take screenshots of the travel to the moon with that rocket. Nor the meeting (I did manage to land within 700m of the flag I planted...after about 20 quicksaves of crashy goodness).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way back, Bob wasn\u0027t entirely sure if everything would be alright with an astronaut on top of his rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f19/Minyalothiel/2013-06-16_00004_zpsec79e140.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-06-16_00004_zpsec79e140.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out they\u0027re fireproof\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f19/Minyalothiel/2013-06-16_00006_zpsef93da1a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-06-16_00006_zpsef93da1a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I was going through the atmosphere...I realised something awful...the chair I put the astronaut in...was on the part of the rocket that would be separated from the pod, which would ruin the entire idea of the mission. So I thought...either they both make it, or no-one makes it. I was basically hoping the parachute would hold the entire rocket and slow it down enough, instead of just the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccess!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s44.photobucket.com/user/Minyalothiel/media/2013-06-16_00011_zps48504a41.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026amp;o=3\u0022 alt=\u00222013-06-16_00011_zps48504a41.jpg.html?sort=3\u0026amp;o=3\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouchdown!
