In other words it buffs pilots and injects choice into career mode in a way that easily slides into the existing balance without massive overhauls of fundamentals, making pilots generate magic isp boosts, or become arbitrary requirements/roadblocks like other pilot buffing proposals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it can be expanded to pairing up other facility features to the kerbal skill system for example granting pilots fuel pumping to insure they can balance their COM in flight, or having Engineers of certain levels grant action groups or raise the mass part count and volume limits of the flights they launch on in the VAB or even letting a high enough level scientists grab surface samples or go on EVA before you upgrade facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt essentially turns skilled kerbals into useful shortcuts and substitutes for advanced infrastructure and technology just like in real life (see apollo program dockings and space shuttle landings which were all done with a pilot\u0027s hand on the stick whereas the automated soviet equivalents came later) and gives you more incentive to keep the little green guys alive than just the hit to your rep and wallet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T08:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just state that patchedconics and manuvere nodes are EXACTLY THIS SAME THING!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T08:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, they\u0027re not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they\u0027re not even unlocked by the same building. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T16:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPilots are already useful at the beginning of the game.

Following the path where you level up your kerbals instead of upgrading your facilities the probes would be without maneuver nodes and patched conics on their own making pilots and manned flight in general more appealing. It becomes a choice do you sink your money into your facilities or your crew and the vehicles to support them? one takes less start up capital the other has long term savings, and the beauty of this is the extent you stick to it is super flexible don\u0027t want to carry an engineer to use your action groups or launch more complex vehicles? then upgrade your vab. want to eva with people who are not scientists? then upgrade your astronaut complex. etc... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said this makes manned flight more viable by making it a shortcut to higher tier facility type abilities similar to how manned flights shortcuted around some otherwise needed automation technology in the space race (see apollo docking maneuvers).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
