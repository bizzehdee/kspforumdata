You would need to take into account what the T/W ratio is, as well as what the ascent profile is (where do you start your gravity turn, etc.). As one example, picture two identical spacecraft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 one with a T/W ratio of 2.0, and one with a T/W ratio of 0.9. The first will perhaps reach orbit, but the second would just sit on the ground\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 even infinite delta-v isn\u0027t going to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make some rough estimates\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 For example, picture a really poor way of doing it: one big impulsive kick from the launching pad, and then at the peak of the \u0022arc\u0022, one big impulsive kick sideways to acquire orbital velocity. If you want to use this to reach a circular orbit at, say, 100 km, it will take roughly a delta-v = sqrt( 2 g h ) = sqrt (2 g (100 km) ) to \u0022toss up\u0022 the spacecraft to that height, and then a kick sideways of delta-v = sort ( G M / a ). That\u0027s a lousy way of doing it (not efficient), but it\u0027s one estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second way would be to launch with a single impulsive kick right from the ground into a Hohmann transfer orbit that just \u0022kisses\u0022 the ground, and just \u0022kisses\u0022 the desired orbit. That\u0027s just a standard transfer orbit calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of these are \u0022right\u0022 - an actual gravity turn is different, and atmospheres play a significant role that\u0027s hard to calculate exactly (not only does atmospheric density matter, but so does scale height, which is different for each planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but, hey, at least the designers used a constant scale height instead of a temperature-varying one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 what are you trying to communicate in your video?
