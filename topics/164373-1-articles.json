Also, because I live on a farm, many chemicals are available (because they are used for put killing), but this doesn\u0027t necessarily mean they are perfect for using rocket fuel.

H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is problematic in that in storage and preignition flow it needs to be kept stable. Typically\u00A0H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is shipped at 68% relative to water or less, which would lower the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0 but also lower nozzle temperature and increase the overall work efficiency of the blast.\u00A0 If it is kept cool and hydrated you can consider it to be stable. 68% H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0\u003Csub\u003E2 \u003C/sub\u003Eis hard to get outside of an industrial or research setting. Hydrazine is also unstable in the anyhydrous form, so you also want to keep this in a stabilizing solution, although it does not need to be water, water makes mixing with H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E somewhat more convenient since it is like water and in water. And if you get this proper, igniting this without blowing yourself to high heaven is the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO I want to tell you a story. Once upon a time, in my old lab I had a researcher that claimed that the b-mercapto ethanol we was using was bad. So I took 10 ul of BME and 10 ul of a 30% solution of H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0\u003Csub\u003E2 \u003C/sub\u003Eand placed it in 1 ml of water. So both oxidizer and fuel are at a 1:50 ratio of what an actual mixture in a rocket would be. After about 20 seconds he began repeating, \u0022look its bad, see bad\u0022 at about 45 second it blew then entire contents of the liquid out of the test tube without leaving a trace of liquid. BME is not an ideal fuel and having a 50:1 ratio of deadwood did not stop the reaction, its only SLOWED it down. That demonstrates the potency of liquid redox reactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVinegar and Baking soda is an acid base reaction, its not\u00A0 a redox, when you think about reactions think acid base is to redox what redox is to nuclear, its intermediate in magnitude between those two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince obviously you cannot reach above 10km altitude you could, with modern lithium batteries use a series of fans just like on a gyrocopter to compress air, compressed air at very high levels is extremely explosive (you could theoretically ignite air, and that is the big risk of decapping pressurized Oxygen, but you would not be reaching those pressure). This is essentially a turbo jet but without the turbine. This is very old hat, Rudolf Diesel demonstrated this at the Chicago\u0027s worlds fair by compressing cotton in a glass tube and a plunger, causing the cotton to explode. Cotton is essentially a chain of sugar, therefore any starch or sugar water solution would suffice. The good thing about this system is that oxygen flow is powered, meaning that if the sensor wire is rapped around the pre-expansion chamber, a failure in preignition dislodges a solenoid and stops airflow the wires and terminated the reaction (to STP levels), all you have to do to lower risk is have good fuel containment. But what is the best fuel . . . .ethanol would be a suitably good liquid fuel for burning in a pressurized air system. On a compressed air system you want a closable aperture at the head of the rocket that controls air flow, this also would improve aerodynamics. You can potentially make the system safer by lowering the percentage of ethanol in water to 60% and use a tiny amount of something that autoignites well in pressurized oxygen to initiate the preignition. Something like HPLC tubing feeding the highest heat point of the compressed air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the risk of methanol and ethanol can be stated as such . . . .more dangerous than gasoline . . . . .gasoline has chemical impurities (benzene, toluenes, meta-xylenes) that are harder to burn and produce less heat than ethanol. Methanol can be easily stored in a relatively explosion resistant chambers but I have seen the following even occur twice, one resulting in injuries. The most dangerous situation for contained methanol or ethanol is not a full canister, its a canister that is almost empty, that gas air mixture flows out heavy (in the case of ethanol) and runs along a surface until it finds a flame, the flame travels into the cansister and where the container ignites and becomes its own rocket (much better than your 10 meter rocket). So you definitely don\u0027t want oxygen or air to be used to pressurize the methanol tank. However you could use a chemical resistant baffle that is spring tensioned to provide pressure.\u00A0 Methanol has the same molar mass as O2 so that it will flow out and mix with air more readily. Methane of course, I have seen two houses that were converted to match-sticks because of methane. If you can get it, methanol may be the best choice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course if your batteries are powerful enough you don\u0027t need methanol, just compress the air at very high pressure, and at its highest pressure heat it another 1000 degrees. Another way to do this is to preignite a very fuel rich mixture around the oxygen tube and spray that into a reaction chamber for ignition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are lots of ways to make\u00A0 a rocket, very few of them are safe, so its better to start very small and test your way toward better designs. You don\u0027t need to be in restricted airspace to test the designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-10T07:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/24798-pb43465/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002224798\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/24798-pb43465/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@pb43465\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0wow! thanks for the detailed information.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso do make real life rockets a lot? working with hydrazine or flammable gases sounds pretty darn dangerous to play with for an amateur rocket enthusiast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe idea with the jet engine is also very creative. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
