I\u0027ve confirmed that they are all present in 1.0.2, but the per-structure sub-biomes are not all there until the related building is fully upgraded. Your science rover needs to be touching the structure for the per-structure sub-biomes (drive gently into it, keep driving forward to keep it touching, click brake on, then collect results)."}]}
