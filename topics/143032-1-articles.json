Because there is an angle and it is not perfectly straight (in regards to which direction the rest of the plane is facing), I\u0027m forced to eyeball the angle when adjusting it with the roatation gizmo. This can be a little bit off if I don\u0027t do it perfect, resulting in catastrophic unplanned disassembly on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a part is facing the usual 90\u00B0 incriments and made of right angles (such as a cylindrical fuel tank or structural piece etc.) this isn\u0027t an issue and you can rotate with the \u0022angle snap\u0022 activated which always snaps it into the right position easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I stuck eyballing degree by degree if right angled parts aren\u0027t used or is there a better way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALSO: When I adjust their position with the \u0022move\u0022 gizmo, landing gear tends to act super crazy and floats to a new spot usually not attached to the craft, and I can\u0027t tweek it to go where I want, generally forcing me to leave it wherever I place it originally. I can still rotate them fine, but it\u0027s very troublesome if their exact position on the craft matters... Which of course it always does.

For instance, an I-beam will almost always have errors when attaching another part and using the move gizmo, but a fuel tank hasn\u0027t caused it once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
