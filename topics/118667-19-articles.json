And always remember, mod creators are people too. They have their own lives that don\u0027t revolve around KSP. Occasionally they\u0027ll need to take a break, or just put it down for a while, and that\u0027s fine, because a happy modder is a productive modder, and a sad modder is a sorry thing indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fatal_Gam3er","CreatedById":115908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T18:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuess who\u0027s back \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWITH MORE SUGGESTIONS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe you can try the AGM 154 JSOW? maybe after the major update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harpwner","CreatedById":30268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T23:24:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fatal_Gam3er\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fatal_Gam3er\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuess who\u0027s back \u003Cp\u003EWITH MORE SUGGESTIONS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe you can try the AGM 154 JSOW? maybe after the major update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econsidering the whole texture revamp going on, I can fit it in the schedule\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G.man","CreatedById":152295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T23:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, now i know ill check end of this week and next\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harpwner","CreatedById":30268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T10:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate on ETA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s not gonna end up releasing this weekend, what with halloween and now I have a massive school project\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect early November\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Combatsmithen","CreatedById":146407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T13:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of ammo does the AK230 take?

When a missile/rocket/bomb has multiple paint schemes in real life, I pick the one that, in harpwner\u0027s and my opinion, looks best. Most weapons don\u0027t have fancy colorful paint jobs, but the tomahawk had multiple. I based the tomahawk texture on the fist series of missiles flown by the U.S. Navy during the cold war. Here are some pictures: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wsmr-history.org/Photos/07-048-385s.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E1\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mvEl9Gus_d0/TZNTdQunMKI/AAAAAAAACAA/6Dau-3yLCwE/s320/tomahawk.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E2\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y192/foose4string/Quest-Tomahawk-missile.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOw and if you have an idea/suggestion for a paint scheme for one of the part in this mod, please tell me.
