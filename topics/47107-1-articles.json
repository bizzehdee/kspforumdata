Building a 1500 piece space station is really quite an achievement and I\u0027d love to see some screenshots of it. As for your problem I think no, there is not much you can do (perhaps try to find the dynamic timewarp mod). Good news though, Mu, one of the developers, shared with us that he will be bringing a lot of optimisations for the game in 0.22 which should help a lot with building bigger ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kildjan","CreatedById":83868,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T18:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere it is...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=183021814\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=183021814\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yuri Kargarin","CreatedById":44758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T20:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome fellow Kerbonaut!
