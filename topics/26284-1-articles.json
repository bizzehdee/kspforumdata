If no, build a rover that\u0027s tall enough to go over the egg and have the launch platform on the top of it, then when the launch vehicle picks it up you can launch and drop the rover like it was launch stability clamps.. Hovering on Minmus with rockets is a joke it\u0027s got such low gravity, so won\u0027t need the rover anymore just some landing legs oriented the correct way to land with.. This is assuming its not either a forum or personal challenge to do this all stock while hovering?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, with part clipping turned on I believe you Can connect decouplers or docking ports onto those nose cones,, don\u0027t quote me on that till you try it for sure tho lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just re-read your first post, and it all comes down to the very last thing you asked. You want that egg on Minmus. That\u0027s easy lol ill be home in 20 mins and double check on getting it to a connection point and ill put a basket of them up there haha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last edit; I see what your up to now. The name of the egg in the VAB gave it away. Do you have any mods installed or want it completely 100% stock?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-12T15:00:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2013 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T14:59:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you have to be \u0022hovering\u0022 to pick it up as some sort of challenge?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, it was just my first idea about how to get it on top of a rocket. Building a tall ramp and climbing with it on top of a short and thick rocket is of course another possibility. Or using airship and winch mods.
