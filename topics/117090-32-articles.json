The custom-fuel tanks, for example, could easily be re-used by others. Heck, you could make a custom-fuel tank part to merely combine the stock fuel-tank models into a single editor-part-per-size.

The Lander-Core tanks? (the only ones I can think of that are orange/lacking fuel switching). If yes, I will look into adding fuel-switching as an option; no guarantees though, as those parts have a -very- special setup due to the included module-switching (that handles the legs/solar panels/etc). If I remember right, they are limited to a single fuel-selection due to already using the fuel-switching capability to represent the different sized tanks. Given the current plugin limitations on those parts, this would require duplicating every mesh-switch-setup for every additional fuel type (not only tons of work, but less-than-optimal implementation wise as well; and might not even work given how the module-switching stuff is implemented). Been awhile since I\u0027ve looked at their configs/plugin code though, so it might be simpler than I\u0027m remembering... still no guarantees though.  \n\nSlanted nosecone - Won\u0027t say yes, but can\u0027t say no either. Maybe in the future if I have the time (time is really what keeps me from implementing most things). Already thinking of reworking the SRBs a bit, so perhaps will add this in as I am working on them. Thought they already had a slanted nosecone style though? (Honestly, I have not been able to use them in my career game yet, as it\u0027s SSTU version is like 3-months old and does not include any of that stuff..)  \n\nRetro/Jettison motors - I likely won\u0027t be integrating them into fuel tanks. However, I have done a small bit of concept work on an \u0027advanced decoupler\u0027 that would include some of this functionality -- retro-rockets on the decouple stage, as well as ullage engines attached to the \u0027live stage\u0027, with a third set of retro-rockets for decoupling the decoupler. Confused yet? So was I when I first saw the concept... but it is how it really worked for the Saturn-V parts (as far as I know).

No guarantees though as to when.  \n\nNosecones -- Ahh, that makes sense :) Will add that to the list of nosecones/mounts/adapters that I will be making. Who knows, might even see it with the next release. In the short term it should be possible to re-use the existing SRB-slanted nosecone on the fuel tanks; all their model stuff is config based, and it would just require adding an additional \u0027cap\u0027 entry with the proper scaling/offsets setup.

I mean.. the waste-gases are already sitting there ready to be burned (or, even just spin a turbine from the pressure/outgassing? idk). Fewer propellants to worry about, better use of existing tankage, and probably a very easy adaptation for the existing designs. o2/h2 fuel cells/power generation are fairly well tested and refined at this point, and wouldn\u0027t even be consuming any \u0027usable\u0027 propellant. Its like generating energy for throwing out the garbage :)   \n\nFor KSP purposes though, I\u0027m -mostly- settled on having a dedicated monopropellant reserve for both their RCS and fuel-cell use. Mostly I need to know what propellant to put into the configs for the RCS \u002B fuel cell modules; whatever propellant I put in there will need to have a dedicated reserve. And keeping it as monopropellant is still not too-far-off of the norm/real way of doing things (although, I\u0027m unsure about a monopropellant fuel cell... but we\u0027ll pretend that its a dedicated gaseous o2/h2 reserve). Sadly, this removes the ability for using main-tank fuel for the fuel-cell (unless the main tank is set to monopropellant)... but these things really aren\u0027t intended for super-long-duration-use anyhow (and if they are, solar or nuclear are probably both better options for power gen, and monopropellant would be the more realistic choice for fuel in that case anyhow).  \n\nIn short -- Upper stages will have fuel switching capability \u002B dedicated monopropellant reserve based on their current size/setup."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T17:20:26Z","Content":"Minor bug on engine group fairing (I think).
