The plasma generates radio noise. This radio noise will swamp out any radio signal being transmitted. The signal to noise ratio of a channel. The plasma raises the absolute amount of noise on all local radio channels. That leaves two options you can use clever encoding techniques that are tolerant of high levels of noise, or you can raise the amount of power used. At this point in time the need to have firm radio contact during that phase of decent hasn\u0027t been required. So clever encoding techniques haven\u0027t been develeoped. And the amount of raw power needed to burn through the radio noise... could be picked up clearly\u00A0by the fillings of the folks in Moscow when the guys were coming back over California. Or could flash cook an egg in the chicken at 50 miles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-03T06:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223109449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162806\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499042888\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165712\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DrLicor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, DrLicor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for the sake of realism, in real life crafts also loose signal during\u00A0re-entry.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t matter if the antenne is placed in the front or in the back, the plasma goes way further than the top of the craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was not true in the case of the STS.\u00A0 It\u0027s unique design allowed it to create a hole in the ionized gas.\u00A0 The antennas were placed in various location on the top of the orbiter, away from the ionization, and then the signal was sent up to a satellite and back down to mission control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-03T07:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompletely unrelated, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110959-alshain/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022110959\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110959-alshain/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Alshain\u003C/a\u003E.

The early shuttles suffered from a blackout because there was a lack of relay. \u0022The solution came about after NASA launched the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. The first satellite was launched in 1983, and the next two went into orbit in 1988 and 1989. (One TDRS satellite was lost in the 1986 Challenger accident.) The system was built to provide communications for all space flights, from launch to reentry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
