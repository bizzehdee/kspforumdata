Specially in missions where you need to recover parts from space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that it requires a very small angle range to catch the target. For big ships or asteroids, it is not hard, but for small parts, it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the part.cfg, I changed\u00A0captureMinFwdDot to zero. Now it works just fine for grabbing floating parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I suggest that this parameter should be lowered. Maybe it does not need to be zero to work, but it needs to be lowered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-19T07:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI support this. If it does not require hours of work to fix, and only needs a few\u00A0minutes to fix, i have absolutely nothing\u00A0against it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"insert_name","CreatedById":150339,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-20T02:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that in some cases you want a low angle, maybe make that value adjustable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal pancake","CreatedById":180002,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-20T05:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI third this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-20T12:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut it on a tweakable.
