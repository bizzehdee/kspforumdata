I understand that the game must be updated but obviously as my steam is set for auto update my game updates and I lose everything! The last update I was half way through the space shuttle missions and had also started building the ISS using the shuttle. I had a problem with the CSS release after an update the game would get to a certain point and stop loading. The guys that made the add released a fix for it but as im not great with computers couldnt figure it out. I did however find in the same mod post a link for the USA mod which had the shuttle with it. So I was using this shuttle although a bIt unstable once you got the hang of it, it was awesome. The cockpits and paint works were all changeable so I could use Atlantis or Endeavor etc and it was big enough to take the ISS parts, as i have used KSO and this is also an awesome mod but the shuttles are to small for the ISS community pieces. So ill get to the point, can anyone link me or point me in the direction of a fully working NASA shuttle that is ready built once installed and ready to fly? I would really appreciate it as Id like to restart my shuttle missions in career mode again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T11:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132975-space-shuttle-system-112/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
