The centers were WAY off, and they seem to have 128 points, not 256, which means that the band is only half as wide as the game is expecting. The calibration blocks let you set range, center, and deadband, and then you set sensitivity in KSP (I found that things were absurdly jittery if sensitivity was much higher than 60%.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Master Tao!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
