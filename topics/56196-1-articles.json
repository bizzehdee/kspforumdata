We bought the game on the promise of a 1.0; getting to play it in the meanwhile is a bonus. But, because we can play it, we can see where it is going and - as a group - pull the direction it heads.\u003Cp\u003EThe short of it is that by canning resources, by not being communicative with their current player base, they are breaking their end of the bargain. This style of purchase is much closer to a service than it is to a standard transaction. Imagine that they had started a kickstarter, with all their promises about resources and such in the advert blurb. People are buying their game based not on what\u0027s in it, but what they say will be in it, and the promise that their purchase now gets to help make that happen. Saying these things and not delivering them (EVEN FOR ALPHA CONSUMPTION) is at best dishonest and at worst fraudulent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...They have let us in on their game as they are developing it.

A handful of us raising a huge stink about the direction the game is going in tells them that their most vocal fans are upset, and they know this is not a good thing. But at the same time, they can\u0027t make split-second decisions that fundamentally alter the direction of the product just based upon that. That\u0027s how games get stuck into ever-tighter niches, and it\u0027s a trap that they very nearly fell into when resources were being implemented to begin with.
