I\\\u0027ve got more to learn buildings rockets such as more advanced techniques and optimizations. Though at building space planes, I\\\u0027m a complete noob. \n\n***Problem***\n\nSo I\\\u0027ve made my first space plane, made for atmospherical flights. The goal is to build a plane going up to 12km, detach a rocket/plane which gets me out into space and then get down from space and land. I started with the last stage, the landing part of the aircraft. I guess it should be smaller than what it actually is but before I can get into such a project I need to learn a few things. I made an aircraft which has a hard time lifting up at take off for some reason, it tilts down (top heavy I guess?) and the design might be inefficient. Also I would like to know a few things about basic aerodynamics such as what do delta wings do, should they be at front or rear? How wide should the aircraft be and how long? What are the difference between swept wing and delta wings?"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T10:59:25Z","Content":"You say it tilts down? That suggests an difference in position between the centre of mass and centre of lift (Eg move your wings forward or move the mass backwards).\n\nIn real life delta wings are used for super sonic craft whereas normal wings are used for subsonic craft (Drag alters a lot after Mach 1).\n\nCraft with delta wings generally have the wings back, but canards at the front. The position of the lift is pulled forwards by the lift from the canards.\n\nCraft with normal wings have their wings forward, but have stabilisers at the rear which pulls the center of lift back.\n\nHope this helps. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Olsson","CreatedById":20218,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T14:37:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You say it tilts down?

And this also means that if I have front heavy aircraft I should have delta wing? Also what are canards, are they the control surfaces such as \u0027advanced canards\u0027?"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T15:24:10Z","Content":"Canards are just small wings on the front of the plane.

When I hold S to lift off it bounces abit up and down and when I get a straight heading the nose starts tilting down. \n\nEDIT: It flyes and stuff and if I turn on SAS it flies straight but the thing is I want it to hold a straight course and be balanced without SAS if you get my point.\n\nEDIT2: It doesn\\\u0027t matter what I do, if I put more weight at the rear, make the aircraft longer/shorter, make it lighter in the front, move wings back and forth.

An airplane uses lift to turn. Yes, that is not a typo. \n\nIf you want to turn, roll (aka \u0027bank\u0027) in the direction you want, and then pull back to pitch in that direction. This doesn\\\u0027t change the direction of travel, but it does rotate the airplane. The increased angle causes your wing lift to change the actual direction of travel. \n\nIn short form, \u0027bank and yank\u0027."}]}
