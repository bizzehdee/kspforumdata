The goal is to build a plane going up to 12km, detach a rocket/plane which gets me out into space and then get down from space and land. I started with the last stage, the landing part of the aircraft. I guess it should be smaller than what it actually is but before I can get into such a project I need to learn a few things. I made an aircraft which has a hard time lifting up at take off for some reason, it tilts down (top heavy I guess?) and the design might be inefficient. Also I would like to know a few things about basic aerodynamics such as what do delta wings do, should they be at front or rear? How wide should the aircraft be and how long? What are the difference between swept wing and delta wings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T10:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou say it tilts down?
