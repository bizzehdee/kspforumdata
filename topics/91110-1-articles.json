This is getting very frustrating and happening to often. Just now it happened in the middle of a launch and I just closed the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell... I keep losing the ability to control my ships. I can\u0027t make corrections, I can\u0027t adjust velocity, nothing. No matter how many times I switch back into the program, tab around the star system or smash the keys on the keyboard, I can\u0027t get control of my ship back. Am I the only one with this problem? What could possibly be causing it? I never had this problem with the demo and as far as I know, I\u0027m NOT running x64 KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T02:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA screenshot of the craft would help, along with the other information detailed in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis sticky.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the information you\u0027ve given, this could be caused by a bug, or simply the craft running out of electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you lose control, try opening the alt-f12 debug menu and clicking \u0022show input lock stack\u0022, that should tell you what\u0027s causing the control loss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wolverine79936","CreatedById":129972,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T17:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, everyone, for you suggestions. Supernovy, thanks to you, I was able to figure it out. It turned out that my craft are running out of electrical charge.
