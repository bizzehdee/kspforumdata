I ask because that interstages top attach node is a decoupling node - if part clipping is activated, you might be attaching it to the node already being used by the engine and fuel tank (so when you decouple, it breaks the link between them). KWR engines ship with an extra attach node on top so you shouldn\u0027t need to enable clipping anyway..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MattQ012","CreatedById":117950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T16:19:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eive done it without clipping and it still does the same thing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T17:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MattQ012\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MattQ012\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt does it with default parts and modded parts too so no part will work!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you say it does it with default parts and modded parts too, do you mean that you can build a completely stock KSP rocket that behaves this way?
