That means that if one side was different from the other, say one side had thermal tiles and the other didn\u0027t, the wings would not have the same side facing the same way, so a directional heatshield would not work on one wing. What Nathan is suggesting is that if they have heatshields, they would have to be on both sides.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T12:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt.

In the SPH things flip the right way. You can test this by making a space plane with 1 central fuselage and 2 additonal side fuselages. Placing a mirrored cockpit on the side fuselages results in two correctly-placed cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T07:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edlrk: Heh, wish I\u0027d had a chance to play this game. :}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor spaceplanes in RSS, your best bet is to up the reflectivity of the heatshields that get added to body parts, and add similar reflectivity-based shields for the wings, just use direction = 0, 0, 0 rather than a set direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGavinZac: try a part where there\u0027s obviously an up, down, left, and right.
