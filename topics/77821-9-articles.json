It\u0027s funny because, at the start of the year I wanted to get into some KSP modding but had no idea what I wanted to create. Now I have about half a dozen really solid and unique ideas.

I\u0027m just tinkering with modding to relax and don\u0027t expect a project like this to even start getting off the ground this year. Hopefully someone else can use this idea.
