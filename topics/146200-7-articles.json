That being said, it does take a long time to do complete testing properly which we all know has been a bit wanting in the past in some regards ... I personally think that the Squad team are doing all that they can to fix the issues being experienced on console, however that really falls in the lap of FT since they are the ones doing the port. I\u0027m not trying to diminish the ultimate responsibility being Squads for heading down this road of a console port, but we need to recognize where we are at now and how things should move forward as well as the technical aspects/difficulties behind porting a PC game to console\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad needs to fix the bugs on the console version that is making the game unplayable - they are working on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing is that the closed systems that KSP has been ported to have extensive testing done by Sony and Microsoft which the Developer has to pay extravagant fee\u0027s for each time they even want to do a minor update (There are some developers who have paid upwards of $30 000.00 and even higher just to update their game)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe responsibility for the situation as it stands falls directly upon the lap of Squad, however they are doing all they can to rectify the matter.
