I tried to do my research this time, and I don\u0027t think this exist, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s on the \u0022already suggested\u0022 list. Please feel free to throw rotten food at this post if I\u0027m wrong (I assume no responsibility for damage incurred to your computer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to be able to dictate which fuel tanks drain first in my space-planes from the construction bay. First, I know I can already turn off fuel tanks, but that is a very clunky way of managing fuel in flight, especially since you can\u0027t toggle fuel tank\u0027s on and off using action groups. Second, I know I can use fuel lines as long as I separate my tanks with non-fuel-transferring parts, but that is relatively inconvenient. Third, I know I could fix this with a mod, but I\u0027d prefer to see this functionality added to the official game build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as implementation goes, I suggest a separate \u0022Fuel Staging\u0022 tab in the build bay (just like the \u0022parts\u0022, \u0022action groups\u0022, and \u0022crew\u0022 tabs). In this tab you could select an engine, and it would bring up a list of all the fuel tanks from which that engine is capable of drawing fuel. You would then be able to click and drag those tanks into stages (just like the staging for normal parts), such that the engine could draw fuel from more than one fuel tank at a time, but would completely drain the tanks in stage one before taking fuel from any of the tanks in stage two etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between fuel stages and part stages would be that fuel stages do not require manual switching between stages. The engine moves to the next stage as soon as it can no longer draw fuel from any of the tanks in the stage it is currently in (i.e. when the fuel tanks in that stage are all empty, have been manually turned off, or are no longer connected to the engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a slightly different but related note, it would be really cool to be able to change fuel staging (and action groups) in flight as well. This would be particularly useful when docking multiple ships to create one large vessel. Again...I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a mod for this (or an add-on rather), but it would be sweet in vanilla.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T09:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.
