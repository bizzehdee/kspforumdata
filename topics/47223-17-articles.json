I experienced some trouble with balancing my Mk4 spaceplane. The main trouble was the CoM being too far to the rear. Way I built it was Cockpit, 3x payload segment, LFO segment, tail segment. I think I\u0027ll agree with the need for the cockpit to be heavier as a ballast thing if nothing else. Also connected to this: maybe consider adding a modest fuel capacity to all segments? B9 does this in a very snazzy way, allowing you to select whether you want a structural fuselage, LFO, LF, or monoprop.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI increased the mass of the cockpit to 5.5t, not including the mass of the monoprop. All segments do have fuel capacity, except for the cargo bays. However I\u0027ll not do the fuel switcher, that would involve more plugin bundling. You\u0027ll have to be content with an LF and LFO fuselage (and a small monoprop slice eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne thing that I\u0027m digging about this fuselage system is the flat keel (is that the right term for the underside?), allowing me to very comfortably add landing gear. Adding rear landing gear\u0027s a bit of a problem with B9\u0027s 3.75m spaceplane fuselage, for example. A problem with the flat keel, however, could be clearance issues with the payload. I noticed that payloads which comfortably fit inside the bay doors on the top have a tendency of clipping through the fuselage on the bottom.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some instances where this is true, but I don\u0027t think they\u0027re any worse than for the Mk2 bits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Reblobic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Reblobic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Nertea,\u003Cp\u003ELove all your work around here, Near Future definitely is a must have for my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if you ever plan to add this solar panel from way back in this thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/panel_circular02.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/panel_circular02.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have three more solar panels that I\u0027d like to make before I consider NFSolar feature complete.

I would not be a fan of removing them and replacing them with specific shoulders, because then I need to make a single-use part to go there. I really don\u0027t like single-use parts, and that area is about 25% too small for a standard 1.25m node. The options are keeping it as-is, modifying it to accept 0.625m nodes (holes I guess), or integrating something different into the structure there. The design reference has air intakes at that location - adding integrated intakes to that area is not completely out of the question, but I\u0027m not sure... not yet, for sure, I need to step back from the part for a while before I come back to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E -The size and shape of the windows.

Essentially I\u0027m totally open to changing a part until I unwrap it, then I get really reluctant (even more so if it\u0027s textured). I textured the small LF fuselage today, later in the week I\u0027ll have time to texture the LFO version and the cargo bay (which is getting a number of model tweaks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a start on the other two adapters that I plan - a Mk4 -\u0026gt; 2x2.5m and a Mk4 -\u0026gt; 4x1.25m one.
