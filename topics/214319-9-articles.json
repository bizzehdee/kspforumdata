Now I must do my penance by explaining what it looks like from the other side!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure one of our producers could give you a more precise answer, but here\u0027s the general idea: every time we release an update, we essentially take a snapshot build of the game and then test it like crazy. That uses up a huge amount of QA bandwidth, and for a game like KSP2 it really is a non-trivial amount of work to test it in a way that approximates the range of activities that the entire community might get up to in the game. As they test that snapshot build, they sometimes discover bugs. Many of them (hopefully most of them) will be known bugs that are already tracked and that we\u0027re already working on. But some of these bugs might actually be new bugs that have emerged since the last update. Those point to unintended outcomes related to recent checkins -- i.e. by fixing one problem, we have created a new problem. We are trying very hard to hold ourselves to the standard of \u0022the game should get better with every update,\u0022 and that means that we take this sort of bug very seriously. This means that when such a bug arises, production and engineering go over these issues with a fine-tooth comb and figure out what broke, and then additional fixes are applied to the build until it\u0027s in a good state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as you may have noticed, getting a candidate build to a level of quality that it\u0027s safe to release involves a lot of coordinated activity among a lot of people who also need to be advancing other areas of the game (for example bringing about perf improvements or working on roadmap features). Our update cadence is therefore carefully balanced against our need to keep pushing the entire game forward toward 1.0.\u00A0 Of course I would love to drop an update every day like the update Easter Bunny, but the reality is that each update comes with a cost, and we want to have the bandwidth to work on cool stuff like Colonies and Interstellar too. With that in mind, and because we want each update to contain lots of meaningful improvements, we can\u0027t release rapid-fire updates. HarvesteR was amazing and deserves his godlike status in this community, and I remember hanging on to his every post back when he was updating KSP. But I suspect that he was also constrained by similar production realities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I think it\u0027s safe to say that our key focus today is to correct issues that affect the quality of gameplay, which means performance bugs, bugs that stop some players from being able to play the game at all, bugs that result in loss of vehicle, bugs that result in mission failure, bugs that result in the game crashing, and bugs that ruin campaign saves. When such fixes are complete, we do not intend to sit on them for a long time. One of life\u0027s great frustrations is to read a complaint about a bug online and know that it\u0027s been fixed internally. As long as the wait between updates may feel on the outside, let me assure you that it feels even longer on the inside!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163018-nestor/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163018\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163018-nestor/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nestor\u003C/a\u003Eis going to yell at me for speaking about this topic in a sloppy fashion, and I encourage him to join me in this thread if he\u0027d like to add more to my explanation.

The game as it is requires you to use copious amounts of struts without autostrut or some similar system in place. Almost every part when placed onto another part flops around like a fish, and even when strutted up, it still flops. The worst is boosters attached radially, they flop when you load the craft in, and pretty much fling into your rocket when they\u0027re activated. So I tried making a similar rocket without boosters, and wouldn\u0027t you know, as soon as I did my gravity turn the thing just disassembles itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI assure you, this is not a case of needing to have patience, and learn.

I can accept an early version having serious framerate issues in limited and particularly stressful situations. For example, another EA game I\u0027ve played (much more of), Planet Crafter, performs very badly in one specific area (my hardware gets about 15-20fps versus easily over 60 in most areas, player constructions notwithstanding). Big whoop. It\u0027s just one area; it will probably be optimized at some point, and that\u0027ll be the end of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2? Just building a conceptually simple rocket meant to go to Duna and back, using radial tanks (hello terrible crossfeed performance) but generally just an uncreative vertical stack.

Last stage approaching Duna was getting about 35fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if the end-game for KSP was to build this simple Duna rocket I wouldn\u0027t be worried, because these numbers will improve. But the goal isn\u0027t a Duna rocket. We\u0027re supposed to be scaling to space stations. Motherships. Mining outposts. Colonies. Interstellar. And multiplayer on top of all that. The Duna rocket is baby stuff. I don\u0027t need my game to run at 4k/120fps to enjoy it, but if we can\u0027t achieve solid performance at this tiny scale then what hope is there for the lofty goals that actually go beyond what\u0027s already in KSP1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRebuilding from a more stable and performant base seemed like KSP2\u0027s raison d\u0027\u00EAtre, yet it seems just as unstable (in all the same ways and more) and certainly not more performant.
