I\u0027ve landed on Duna twice manually and a third time with Mechjeb but all three times where different ships. I\u0027m trying to figure out which is the most fuel efficient way to descend to land. Mechjeb slows the ship down and then uses the engines almost the whole way down to keep speed at about 400\u002B. When I do it manually, I would get to about 15k (Duna atmosphere) and pound on the accelerator to bring me down from 800\u002B to a vertical decent as fast as possible. I\u0027m wondering if the full burn I do is more fuel efficient than the way Mechjeb does it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a second part to my question ...The only reason I wanted to try Mechjeb was because on Duna it is much harder to pin point a specific spot to land (i.e. save stranded Kerbals) than it is to do manually. (For my novice skill set that is) But not only do I think Mechjeb is less fuel efficient, it still ends up being at least 60-80 km away from the target which I can do manually anyways. I start with \u0022Land on target\u0022 from a 100km orbit. Do I need to have a higher or lower orbit to help Mechjeb hit the spot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that the landing code got a total rewrite between 1.9.X and 2.0.X. In 1.9.X, Mechjeb would do something very close to a suicide burn, and I could never come close to matching it. I haven\u0027t used 2.0 much for landing, but it seems to have backed off a bit and gone for something a bit more gradual, though still probably a bit better than I do (I\u0027m just not good at manual landings). Suicide burns are definitely more efficient, but are also more dangerous if you don\u0027t get them just right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T02:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t remember if this was exactly the case in MechJeb 1.9.x, but in MJ2 there\u0027s a substantial difference between \u0022Land at target\u0022 and \u0022Land anywhere.\u0022 The former maintains a controlled gradually decreasing speed as it goes down, and tends not to be full-throttle so will use a bit more fuel than a suicide burn would. Land anywhere is more aggressive, at least 80-90% throttle for most of its landing burn. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s leaving a bit of a safety factor, but I bet that factor could be made adjustable.

The newest MechJeb does suicide burns when landing, which is much more fuel efficient than a long burn. I don\u0027t think there are many people that could match it\u0027s accuracy in timing and location when it comes to landing, so I like to use it. Some rockets though, where the center of thrust might be very low because it\u0027s a tall rocket, MechJeb can easily flip it and loose control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T03:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not tried MJ2 for landing yet.

I\u0027ll give Mechjeb 2 a shot. Did a few more tests yesterday. I found that a mix of manual and Mechjeb worked out best.
