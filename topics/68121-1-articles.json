The \u0022torso\u0022 of a Kerbal is little more than a muscular foot featuring one or two pairs of tentacles. Kerbals possess no bones, and their bodies being adapted to a marine environment, they suffer negligible muscle degeneration from being in space and are able to survive extreme G-forces. As they live underwater, Kerbals have built very few structures on land - rather the majority of their cities are hidden deep in Kerbin\u0027s oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike crabs and several other marine invertebrates, Kerbals are able to survive and breathe on land as long as they keep themselves well-hydrated, but whenever they go outside it is necessary to wear protective suits to prevent drying out. A side effect of the suits is that they restrict movement, preventing the Kerbals from extending their tentacles freely but still allowing them to manipulate objects and operate machinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the space program only employs male Kerbals due to physical limitations: male Kerbals possess a second pair of tentacles, which originally developed for use during mating, similar to the claw on the back end of an earwig. Female Kerbals, on the other hand, only have two tentacles. In the water, unrestricted by gravity, this is no problem for them, but on land this prevents them from performing tasks such as carrying rocket parts, using a notepad, etc. Presumably work is being done to develop artificial limbs for female Kerbals so that someday soon they too can explore the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-15T01:48:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2014 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TerLoki","CreatedById":30301,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T01:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting idea, but it\u0027s kind of invalidated by all the little videos Squad has with Kerbals messing around at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9fvjKVuULQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-15T01:57:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2014 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TerLoki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T03:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay you do have a point there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe they\u0027re just not extending their tentacles all the way xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll think of a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
