However, due to my lack of experience, I am having issues getting stable VTOL flight. I should point out that this aircraft is huge, and I need around 8 basic jet engines to get it off the ground. However once it leaves the ground, it tends to tilt over to one side, causing me to loose control and forcing me to abort the flight. I suspect this is due to my engine placement, or lack of RCS, but instead of spending 4 hours on it, I figured I\u0027d toss it out there and let the community explain to me the proper way to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download.php?vubgt8epth9br50\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMediaFire\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xVfNsAb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xVfNsAb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur brave test pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GFt7gGc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GFt7gGc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines powering up.

Try to start with throttle at 85%, see if you achieve lift-off, and if you do, throttle down a touch to stop or slow the vertical speed and hover a few meters above the ground - eventually you will learn to predict and counteract the movements and keep a stable-ish hover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast point I wanted to make is that pretty much every vtol I ever made has a tendency to sway out of control if it\u0027s completely stationary. I do my best to line all the centers up, I even fine-tune the balance with landing gear and batteries but it can be hard keeping a craft in a stable hover over a fixed position. If you can try to inch forwards at 3-5m/s and see if the craft is any more manageable then. Avionics package helps too as it will actively try to negate yaw and roll whilst still giving you control over the craft in all axes and directions.
