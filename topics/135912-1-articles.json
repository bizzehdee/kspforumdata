So I got my Mk2 SSTO to LKO, released from the bay a Minmus sat. and once I have put the sat in Minmus orbit I switched back to SSTO and went back for KSC. Just 10km above KSC BUUUMMM. Left delta wing colided in VAB, lost control killed the crew. Try 2 from F9 again on approach got really close and again at around 5km up near KSC, again ambushed by Kraken, buuuum, left delta wing colided in VAB this time I also noticed explosion at KSC VAB. What is going on here? This SSTO is using all stock parts except two infernal robotics inside the bay for better position of solar panels and thats it. Used this design on multiple missions but on this one it seems I might not be able to land it at KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T10:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/86726-plane-parts-colliding-with-launchpad-when-flying-near-ksc/\u0022\u003EThis\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/121374-collided-with-launch-pad-while-in-orbit/\u0022\u003Eis\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/88587-colliding-into-building-3km-away/\u0022\u003Ea\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128317-what-the-what-parts-colliding-with-launch-pad-while-in-orbit/\u0022\u003Epretty\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87315-random-destruction-of-wings/\u0022\u003Eold\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90437-bust-parts-of-craft-crash-into-buildings-and-explode/\u0022\u003Ebug\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, there\u0027s no official fix, as it\u0027s been rather hard to pin down.
