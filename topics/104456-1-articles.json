Here, players from everywhere can show their hype for the official release of KSP. Join us this Saturday and Sunday (4/25, 4/26) for an event on KMC\u0027s official DMP multiplayer server where players can play, fly and get hyped!\n\nThere will be several planned activities for the server, for one- a 1.0 \u0022HypeStation\u0022 will be constructed and every player can help add to it! We will also have other activities- such as the most realistic Mars Landing (Duna Landing) craft(s)! As well as a stunt show! \n\nI will also be hosting a Flight School for new players who want to join- but don\u0027t know how to build or fly yet. I will be teaching players how to build aircrafts and rockets, as well as teach them how to fly them. My lessons will also include landing (aircraft and spacecraft) tutorials, and docking lessons. Crafts will be given to players needing help to get started. **Note: I will be teaching with Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR) mechanics enabled, due to the new aerodynamics being added in 1.0!!**\n\nAny streamers, let\u0027s players, etc may join! In fact we would greatly appreciate any popular players to invite their viewers to our server! \n\nLastly- there will be a random drawing, where three members of the server will win one of these prizes!\n\n1st Place Winner: *[Top Secret]*\n\n2nd Place Winner: *Be the KMC\u0027s Commander in Chief for a day!*\n\n3rd Place Winner: A complete craft file set for every craft from Mercury to Apollo! \n\nWe will also sponsor any mods or YouTube channels that wish to have special mention in this event.
