If I launch too steep I use too much Dv to circularise and this is not ideal either.\n\nI would say your efforts would be better used finding the launch profile that is best for each of your craft rather than chasing terminal velocity (which will change depending on the AoA of your craft anyway)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T13:21:10Z","Content":"I\u0027m not an experienced FAR user, but it seems odd to me that there is no terminal velocity in it.

I realize that the terminal speed changes depending on the altitude, but how can you determine that you are approaching it\n\nDo you use KER? If so, look for a figure on one of the displays (I think it\u0027s Surface) labelled \u0022Atmospheric Efficiency\u0022. It should be a value expressed as a percentage. When your craft is travelling at the current terminal velocity for the altitude it\u0027s at, that value will be right at 100% (or close enough to it to spit). Much below 100% and you\u0027re losing delta-V to gravity; much above 100% and you\u0027re losing delta-V to drag.\n\nIf you\u0027re not using KER, well, it can be done by hand - the formula is: V = sqrt ((2Mg)/(rho\\*A\\*Cd)), where V is terminal velocity, M is the mass of the craft, g is the acceleration due to gravity, rho is the density of the atmosphere, A is the \u0022projected area\u0022 of the craft and Cd is the coefficient of drag. Trouble here is that g and rho are both dependent on altitude, and since you\u0027re in craft burning fuel, M is also time dependent. You\u0027d be looking at a really nasty differential equation. But it is an option."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T13:57:20Z","Content":"FAR has a terminal velocity - it\u0027s just higher than with stock air. I believe the current iterations have lowered it - I know I\u0027ve actually been past it on some occasions (if you\u0027re doing sub-orbital hops just to peek into space, you want to be at terminal velocity for maximum altitude with minimum rocket, since it\u0027s all gravity drag otherwise).\n\nThere\u0027s a button (\u0022Flt Data\u0022) that brings up the Flight Data panel - you can see terminal velocity there.\n\n![FAR-TerminalVelocity.jpg](http://alpha.renegrade.net/NEAR/images/FAR-TerminalVelocity.jpg)\n\nHere\u0027s a test flight specifically to push the terminal velocity. As you can see, I\u0027m past it already (Terminal V in the FAR Flight Data window).\n\nBased on my VOID data, my acceleration should be about 41.46 - instead, I\u0027m getting 28.48, or a difference of about 12.98 (slightly over 1g). I\u0027m losing more to aero drag now than gravity.\n\nIn stock, I\u0027d be WAY past terminal velocity in that shot (it\u0027s around 200-ish at that altitude) and experiencing enormously more drag.\n\nFor an optimal flight-to-orbit with FAR though, you don\u0027t want to be going quite so fast - remember the objective is to go east, not up. Pushing the terminal velocity isn\u0027t compatible with the curve you want to draw."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T14:09:11Z","Content":"Yup, just open the FAR flight data and it\u0027s there.\n\nKeep in mind that it depends on your rocket design and its orientation. For example a typical simple rocket will have a much higher terminal velocity when travelling nose first than when travelling engine first.\n\nGenerally speaking unless you either have crazy TWR or a very draggy build you won\u0027t get near terminal velocity in FAR on ascent anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T17:31:24Z","Content":"Thank you all for answering.
