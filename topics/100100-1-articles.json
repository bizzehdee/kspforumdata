If so, look for a figure on one of the displays (I think it\u0027s Surface) labelled \u0022Atmospheric Efficiency\u0022. It should be a value expressed as a percentage. When your craft is travelling at the current terminal velocity for the altitude it\u0027s at, that value will be right at 100% (or close enough to it to spit). Much below 100% and you\u0027re losing delta-V to gravity; much above 100% and you\u0027re losing delta-V to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not using KER, well, it can be done by hand - the formula is: V = sqrt ((2Mg)/(rho*A*Cd)), where V is terminal velocity, M is the mass of the craft, g is the acceleration due to gravity, rho is the density of the atmosphere, A is the \u0022projected area\u0022 of the craft and Cd is the coefficient of drag. Trouble here is that g and rho are both dependent on altitude, and since you\u0027re in craft burning fuel, M is also time dependent. You\u0027d be looking at a really nasty differential equation. But it is an option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T13:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR has a terminal velocity - it\u0027s just higher than with stock air. I believe the current iterations have lowered it - I know I\u0027ve actually been past it on some occasions (if you\u0027re doing sub-orbital hops just to peek into space, you want to be at terminal velocity for maximum altitude with minimum rocket, since it\u0027s all gravity drag otherwise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a button (\u0022Flt Data\u0022) that brings up the Flight Data panel - you can see terminal velocity there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://alpha.renegrade.net/NEAR/images/FAR-TerminalVelocity.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FAR-TerminalVelocity.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a test flight specifically to push the terminal velocity.
