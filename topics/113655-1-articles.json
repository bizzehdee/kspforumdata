I was wondering if there is any convenient way around my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core of the issue is that once something has been radial-attached to a part using radial symmetry, the core part \u0027remembers\u0027 what type/degree of radial symmetry was used and INSISTS that all other radial-attach parts be placed with the same symmetry. And sometimes that\u0027s not what I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypothetical example: Let\u0027s say I\u0027m building a lander. Lander can on top, fuel tank beneath that, engine on the bottom. Stick 3 landing legs on the fuel tank using 3-fold radial symmetry. There\u0027s the core of a very basic lander. Now for the other stuff we\u0027re going to need in order to make it a full-fledged useful spacecraft: pop some small science instruments around the hatch of the lander can, above the lander can I\u0027ll put a probe core, axial-attached battery, and a docking port. So far so good. Now a pair of deployable solar panels on the fuel tank, and...NOPE. Can\u0027t do it. The moment pointer drags the solar panel over to the fuel tank, POP! The twofold symmetry changes to threefold. It\u0027s THREE solar panels, or nothing. Dangit. Rearrange stuff on the lander can, move the solar arrays up there where it\u0027s still possible to define twofold symmetry. Okay, how about 4 RCS ports? NOPE. It\u0027s 3 or nothing. And COM balance DEMANDS that the RCS ports be placed on the fuel tank...so it\u0027s back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose in this particular instance I could fourfold symmetry and four landing legs (and associated otherwise-unnecessary mass) and this would let me put four RCS ports on the tank. Or twofold symmetry would let me put the solar arrays back on the fuel tank, and I can put four landing legs and four RCS ports via two pairs at right angles to each other. But the two pairs of landing legs (and the two pairs of RCS ports) are likely to be just slightly different in their attachments, possibly leading to a wobbles between two different versions of sitting on three legs. Or worse, the RCS isn\u0027t balanced right. Or I can take a lot of time being exceedingly persnickety in my part placement...but that hardly seems like it should be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some intrinsic reason, perhaps associated with the tree structure of the craft file, that it is NECESSARY for all radially-attached parts on a single part to share the same symmetry? And is there some workaround better than what I\u0027ve outlined above? I cannot be the only person who\u0027s ever wanted to put, say, 3 Thuds, 4 RCS ports, and 2 solar panels all on the same Big Orange Tank...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T04:02:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMark as Answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T01:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHrm.... shouldn\u0027t be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quite regularly attach different multiples (eg legs/solar panels/radial chutes) to the same part with different numbers in radial symmetry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn \u0022child\u0022 parts, yes. You can\u0027t place three fuel tanks around a central stack and then switch to four-way symmetry to stick some launch stabilisers on them, which makes perfect sense. However you should be able to put for example four fins in symmetry around the tail of a fuel tank, then switch to two-way symmetry to attach a couple of decouplers and boosters in the space between them on that same core stack. I do that sort of thing quite regularly, for exactly the sort of scenario you describe: lander legs, solar panels, parachutes, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T01:17:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou need to be careful - this change happens whenever you hover your cursor over the existing part, so when you place it you need to be careful to avoid hovering over your landing legs\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PKing Zombie Spy","CreatedById":144850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T01:38:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FancyMouse\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FancyMouse\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou need to be careful - this change happens whenever you hover your cursor over the existing part, so when you place it you need to be careful to avoid hovering over your landing legs\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very annoying certainly.
