If you use the KSP Interstellar mod, it does a pretty good job of representing many of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most basic one doesn\u0027t even need the fusion to produce more energy than you put into it - you just use a fission-electric powered z-pinch or laser inertial confinement system, get enough fusion to make a nice high exhaust velocity, and you\u0027re golden. You won\u0027t get much thrust at all since you\u0027re losing energy to the fusion reaction, but you\u0027ll get a respectable Isp since the individual fusion events will launch charged particles away from you at very high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you figure out how to actually achieve ignition with ICF, that system would work substantially better. You could make what essentially amounts to a miniature, constantly running Orion drive - toss the fuel pellets out the back, strike them with powerful lasers, and then funnel the high-speed fusion products into an exhaust beam with magnetic fields. According to our good friend \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Rho\u003C/a\u003E, the theoretical limits of that kind of engine are quite substantial! (See \u0022FUSE: IC-Fusion (MAX)\u0022 towards the bottom of the table).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest method for a tokamak-like design is probably a NERVA-like thermal rocket, pumping a hydrogen propellant through the hot part of the reactor. Deuterium-tritium fusion puts out a lot of neutron radiation which isn\u0027t too hard to thermalize with a nice big slab of tungsten, so you won\u0027t have much trouble designing an engine like that once you have a working reactor. A thermal rocket would give you a pretty respectable thrust and Isp, but nothing like the direct-drive external inertial-confinement system would when properly refined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also use the reactor to generate electricity through some type of heat engine or thermoelectric system and then use that electricity to run a plasma thruster, but that system is going to be inefficient since you\u0027re converting your energy so many times - today\u0027s Brayton-cycle thermal generators only get a few percent efficiency, and then you\u0027ll lose energy from your power distribution system, and then the plasma engines will make heat as they run too, and eventually the energy that actually shows up as useful work will be minuscule compared to what you made in the reactor, and you\u0027ll have to find a way of dissipating all the heat you lose, presumably with large and heavy radiators. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the foreseeable future, I\u0027m with UmbralRaptor and the fusion-heavy Orion concept. Sure, it\u0027s dirty and complex and involves a lot of wildly terrifying engineering, but it would get the job done - the theoretical maximum Isp would be around a million seconds. If you could figure out a good way of smoothing out the acceleration (the Medusa concept looks good), you\u0027d be pretty much golden.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-16T07:35:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2015 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T07:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so recently in order to avert boredom I\u0027ve been reading stuff about fusion and ideas on how we might create a reactor and I have a few questions.\u003Cp\u003E-How can we use energy created by a reactor? \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany ways to do this.

Your plasma is about 150 million degrees, if it hits the wall it\u0027ll cool instantly and stop fusing. So you need to contain the stuff with electromagnetic fields. A torus is a good shape for doing so because it also gives you a convenient loop that you can use to carry a current. A current produces an magnetic field that causes the charge carriers of the current to tend towards the center.

It works pretty much like Project Orion that keeps getting quoted here. It\u0027s a fusion pulse rocket that uses solar power to trigger magneto-inertial containment fusion events on fuel pellets that are released out the back one by one. The fusion products are expelled through a magnetic nozzle, also solar powered. The drive has an estimated, constant Isp of about 3000s, and a variable thrust that is limited more or less by how much solar power you can create (more power -\u0026gt; faster pulse frequency). It should produce noticably more thrust for the same power at the same Isp as current generation ion thrusters do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to Project Orion, however, this thing is actually safe, sane and consensual (\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ehyuk hyuk hyuk!\u003C/span\u003E) and under active development by an US company with grant money from NASA. In contrast to Project Orion, it does not require the establishment of factories dedicated to building weapons of mass destruction. In contrast to Project Orion, it uses low-radiation, pure aneutronic fusion explosions that eliminate the need for shielding the rest of the spacecraft and eliminate dangers to nearby objects (unless you point the nozzle at it.

lessons learned with polywells. the coils are of similar construction. cusps are closed up better. its inline configuration seems like it would make direct conversion easier (though it would need to

the toroid or jumping around wildly. then you look at a polywell and you have your plasma in a nice little ball of awesome. dpf is a different beast in that it really lets the plasma do its own thing
