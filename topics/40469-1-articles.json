I attempted to create a small needle nose adapter to dock with a clampotron junior docking port through a small gap, using 4 octagonal struts stacked, and managed the docking maneuver with the most delicate touch, coming in directly at less than 0.1m/s, only to have the joined structures whiplash around like on the end of an energised slinky. Quite a spectacular failure!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another experiment I had a clampotron Jr on either end of the 4 octagonal struts (attached to the nose via another docking port) and undocked that assembly to give it a push into the target port. It was practically a bullseye, but after wobbling around in the target port for a second the docking completed, once again the docked ship whiplashed around in another catastrophic failure, despite having almost all of the mass.
