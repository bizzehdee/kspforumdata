Furthermore, the spacecraft doesn\u0027t exist. You\u0027re talking 5~10 years planning and 20\u002B years of mission time; all the while Sedna moves further away from us (although its 11,400 year orbit means it\u0027s moving pretty slow).

Can you even drop your periapsis to 8 solar radii with a single Jupiter assist? That\u0027s a really crazy eccentricity that\u0027s required here, even for a craft that already has its periapsis at Earth. Remember, you can\u0027t run the ion drives out at Jupiter. They require so much power that they will be utterly useless outside Mercury\u0027s orbit, if solar panels are all there is to power them. All the RTGs ever launched to space by all nations combined won\u0027t run a single one at quarter thrust, much less all five at full. Carrying chemical propulsion assistance for the Jupiter maneuver will require more launch mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you\u0027re asking for a spacecraft to continually produce and process one and a quarter megawatts of power while in direct proximity to the sun, for a minimum of one full day, with at least the solar panels in full exposure at all times. That strikes me as pretty difficult to keep things cool. In fact, if I had to guess, such a heat load might simply melt the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, how much time does it take? Flying out to Jupiter is a 5-year trip, dropping back down to sun periapsis probably takes another 6 at minimum. So that\u0027s 11\u002B years just to begin the burn towards Sedna. Which is more than twice as far away as Pluto is. So even if the probe could get the same speed as New Horizons, the current record holder for fastest spacecraft ever, it would still take another ~10 years to pass Pluto\u0027s orbit... and the second half of the trip would take \u003Cem\u003Elonger\u003C/em\u003E. 35 to 40 years, all in all, probably. That\u0027s an insane amount of time to fly! The scientists who built the instruments will be retired by the time it arrives. To reduce the travel time, the question is: how much speed beyond New Horizons can the DS4G\u0027s impart on the craft while it recedes away from its source fo power, before their huge power draw makes them impossible to operate? And even then, getting below 25 years is probably unrealistic, considering the huge lead-up time to even reaching perihelion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, how to get the data back? New Horizons is already struggling with transmission speeds of less than 2 kB/s out at Pluto. And Sedna is over twice as far away, with an ultra-fast flyby only making it farther and farther by the minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, not entirely convinced by the technical feasibility, but I must admit that I was genuinely surprised how practical some of the less practical-looking parts turned out to be.
