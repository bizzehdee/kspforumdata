This is a case that I didn\u0027t cover in my tutorial (I was more interested in looking at what could be done from a pure gravity assist standpoint).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the way these missions work is like this: suppose I\u0027m in an orbit, where Moho marks my periapsis. I can use a flyby of Moho to drop my periapsis to inside Moho\u0027s orbit (simultaneously lowering my apoapsis). Then, on the next orbit, I can make a deep space maneuver at apoapsis to raise my periapsis back up to the level of Moho\u0027s orbit. By doing so, I will have lowered my effective closing velocity at my next Moho encounter by more (often much more) than the delta-V I spent during the deep space maneuver. With precision and timing, you can set things up so that, at each stage of this process, you end up in a resonant orbit and repeatedly encounter your target, slowly matching orbits with each pass; however, at some point, depending on the mass of the target body, the savings from the Oberth effect will outweigh the savings from the gravity assist process and you will be better off finishing the capture with a single burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis same process (in reverse) works going outwards, as well - I used this trick during the return phase of my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hCitr#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMoho SSTO mission\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T16:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answer, Stochasty. I gradually figured this out myself by sending a couple of ion probes to Kerbol and playing with gravity assists along the way. Setting up assists so that you end up in a resonant orbit afterwards is the trickiest part, because the game engine isn\u0027t precise enough to calculate post-encounter trajectories with consistency. Going through the encounter at various timewarp speeds will screw it up, for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach gravity assist also tends to have a small radial component to it. It twists the orbit slightly, either clockwise or counterclockwise. You\u0027ve gotta then correct that radial twist at your deep space maneuver to raise your periapsis back up to Moho. All this would be a lot clearer and easier to visualize if Conic Draw Mode= 0 displayed the encounter as it would appear during the actual encounter. Instead, the lines are hard to parse because Mode=0 doesn\u0027t approach reality until you get close to encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to get the probes to 1GM from Kerbol (my target) using a couple Eve and Moho gravity assists, but I\u0027m still kinda lost on HOW I did it. At least I know I can. It will take me a few more hours of thinking before I grasp it fully.

What they cannot change is your speed at a given altitude above the flyby planet. I use the speed at the moment you enter (or leave) the SOI of a planet as the reference speed, I call it the VSOI. In the Moho Challenge that Metaphor won with style you will find that his VSOI at the two Eve flybys was the same, he just changed the direction he was going relative to Kerbol. I was in that challenge, as I recall the first pass was to match the plane of Moho but not reach its periapsis, the 2nd flyby lowered the Kerbol periapsis to Moho\u0027s orbit. The reason that two passes were needed is that Eve does not have the gravitational chops to change your path all at once- you\u0027d have to flyby well below it\u0027s surface to do the plane change and periapsis change in one flyby.

Flying by 2 planets has the same effect (the 2nd planet flyby is like a deep-space maneuver), by going Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Eve you can build speed up to Kerbol escape velocity if you do it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know it\u0027s tooting my own horn but here is another extreme example of flybys, in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-Ultimate-Jool-5-Challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-mission/page192?p=1554632#post1554632\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJool-5 mission\u003C/a\u003E the carrier gets from LKO to a flyby of all 5 Jool moons and back to Kerbin on only 1415m/s by using 22 flybys.
