But with massive ships comes a problem, the launch tower. Countless times I\u0027ve had to abort missions because half of the rocket was clipping into the launch tower. However, recently I\u0027ve discovered a way to overcome these problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Build you ship as usual. (You can use older saves ships if you want)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Go into the KSP folder, find the folder named \u0022Ships\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Click \u0022VAB\u0022, and copy the .craft file of the ship you wish to use onto the clipboard (or whatever some computers call it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Go back the the \u0022Ships\u0022 folder, and click \u0022SPH\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: Paste the .craft file of the ship you wish to use here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Go to the spaceplane hanger (or runway) and launch that sucker!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Always back up .craft files. You cannot add anything to your craft when it is in the Space Plane Hanger. Well, you can but not the same way. Also don\u0027t try to move anything, it will mess up the orientation. Staging should be changeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESub-Warning: For some reason, canards seem to cause unbelievable amounts of lag when transferred between the VAB and SPH. Not sure why, so it\u0027s better to not use them.
