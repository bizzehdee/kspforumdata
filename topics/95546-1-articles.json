Now one of the mods I have is KSP Interstellar that was modded to work with 0.90. It\u0027s obviously not the only mod I run but I did make sure to check if everything I use is compatible and as far as I can tell it should be since all the resource based mods use CRM and Regolith for instance wich is supported by KSPI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow my problem here is with the ISRU from KSPI in that I can\u0027t seem to make it harvest anything but Uranium and Thorium. I\u0027d assume that the right click menu on the module should have buttons to turn on each individual resource and start mining them even if there is none present where you deployed it since it will simply give you a 0.000 per day return. All the other resources in the menu simply state that the ISRU is offline and don\u0027t have an option to switch it on in any way. The ISRU does have enough power so that\u0027s not the problem here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the options to mine these resources only appaear when they are actually present or is my ISRU broken?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere are you trying to use the ISRU? The KSPI one cares about where it is. You need to be sitting in water to harvest deuterium for example, or on the Mun for aluminium iirc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr-Drunk","CreatedById":132802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk so I geuss that means that the option to switch it on shouldn\u0027t be there when I\u0027m not near the resource?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for my question is that I can turn the ISRU on to mine for uranium right on the launch pad even though there is none there. It\u0027ll say it\u0027s active and mining but the intake is 0.000 per day. I figured that it should be possible to do the same with water. So I would effectively turn it on to mine water but I wouldn\u0027t be getting any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really what confuses me here. The fact I can turn it on to mine 2 resources that aren\u0027t there but the switch on button doesn\u0027t appear for the other resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway what I\u0027m aiming to do with this thing is set up an ISRU or 2 on Minmus to mine for water so they can make LFO as a kind of last stop refuelling point for my interplanetary missions. Will the mine for water option appear only if I\u0027m standing on the flats of Minmus for instance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry cant help but you should have put this in the interstellar thread where mod users and the developer could help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T21:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure on the details of where you can use the ISRU, sorry. I mainly used interstellar in sandbox (career was broken at the time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E) where it just wasn\u0027t necessary (plus no TAC and such).
