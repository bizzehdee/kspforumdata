You can have either you pe just under 70kms or both ap and pe. You get points on things like it total flight time and successful orbital rendezvous with it and other extras. Here are some rules for the challange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. No mods (when i say not mods, i mean NO MODS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Planet must be kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

(7000-pe alt/10)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.You can have both ap and pe start bellow 70kms and both can get you points at starting altitude.
