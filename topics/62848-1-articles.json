Here is the plan. Circuralize on keo altitude, deploy first sat. Lower orbit to gain velocity, move ahead first sat a bit and burn pograde so apoapsis woudl be in same altitude as 1st sat, but separated b around 90 deg, than circuralize and release 2nd sat. And repeat for 3rd and 4th.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion is what calculations do i have to use to calculate where shoudl i make my burns - how much angular separation shoudl i have from 1st sat during my burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-11T01:13:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2014 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by kiwiak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fortunateson1969","CreatedById":29798,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T02:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re probably overcomplicating things. I\u0027d only launch 3 satellites, with 120_deg separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027m about to do for the second time. First, you launch. You can directly burn to 2868.75km, or do an apoapsis burn. Depends on where you want your satellites to \u0022sit\u0022 (but I don\u0027t have much insight there...haven\u0027t done an AP burn, just the direct). Next, when you get to your new AP @ 2868.75km, you adjust your orbit so that your orbital period will resonate properly for what you\u0027re trying to do. I do four hours orbital period. Then, release your satellite and circularize it. Go back to your \u0022shuttle\u0022 vehicle and complete a 4 hour orbit, then when you reach your apoapsis, release and circularize. Another rotation, and lastly another satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS works well to get perfect Geo-sat maneuvers. I\u0027m not 100% on the math for 90_deg, and I worked on it a bit. (You might try an orbital period of 1:30:00? That seems to work in my pen-and-paper simulations. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s a proper orbit though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this isn\u0027t helpful.
