I fail to see how creating a long 2.5 meter fuel tank by welding short 2.5 meter fuel tanks already in the mod is any different from creating a long 2.5 meter fuel tank by upsizing a long 1.25 meter fuel tank already in the mod. Not everyone has that mod installed anyways- so not everyone has those parts- and as I said, no changes were made aside from upsizing the thing and changing mass and resource capacity directly to scale, and the joint strength to the same as the 2.5 meter fuel tank already in the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, my main focus at the moment has become my launch of the Eagle. The Advanced Spaceplane might be a good design- but it\u0027s too laggy on my weak computer without a part weld or two, and it\u0027s really not all that many parts (at 60-68 parts for the Mk3, depending on the fuel tanks allowed, it has less than the D\u0027OH did, for instance- and it\u0027s really not fair I can\u0027t launch a design as complex as yours was just because my computer is a lot slower)- I just have a terrible computer. So, that design has gone on the backburner for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, an update on the Eagle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XoDrEON.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XoDrEON.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I\u0027ve got coverage on this going on my Mission Reports thread too- so forgive me if I miss a detail or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I started off my trip to Duna on a bad foot. After getting to orbit, my lag was absolutely crippling- even though after dumping the damaged Eagle the remaining copy and transfer stage altogether only had 70 parts. So I decided to trust MechJeb to make my rendezvous with my fuel depot- which turned out be a huge mistake. When I got to orbit, the transfer stage had an amazing 5000\u002B Delta-V left (I\u0027m really not sure why I wanted to top it off at all). After quite a while of MechJeb putzing around with seemingly random burns for my transfer stage until I finally got angry, turned it off, and brought it into the depot myself- I only had about 2000 left... But, at least I did make it to the LFO depot (and drained the thing dry) to make up 800-1000 of that Delta-V or so... Here\u0027s a nice picture of the Eagle transfer stage approaching the depot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XOLNVC3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XOLNVC3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then moved into a high parking orbit (image below), and reduced my total flights-in-progress a bit by recycling some obsolete ships (with my Scrapper Ship- see my Mission Reports thread) to reduce lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5LL1PqX.png\u0022 alt=\u00225LL1PqX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after much delay, I started off my Duna transfer (a bit late- you\u0027ll see I missed the ideal transfer window by a good bit) the way I always do- with a Muna gravity assist:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/42I7D4w.png\u0022 alt=\u002242I7D4w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8H6AbyG.png\u0022 alt=\u00228H6AbyG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oPuziw1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oPuziw1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oPuziw1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oPuziw1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lwx4qnz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lwx4qnz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KSz83fw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSz83fw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ceoyn1m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ceoyn1m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the Eagle transfer stage is safely on an escape trajectory out of the Kerbin system...

Anyways, I highly recommend NovaPunch2 to anyone who\u0027s looking to reduce their part counts and simplify their heavy lifter stages- while also making them more realistic (no REAL space program would strap four 2.5 meter rockets together- they\u0027d just make a 5 meter rocket instead), or wants to try any of the million other great parts it offers...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T11:23:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T11:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBelow \u0022are\u0022 infinite flying...\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57283-Game-Bugs-Just-for-fun-Infiniglide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57283-Game-Bugs-Just-for-fun-Infiniglide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine craft...does not classified as infiniteglide...it glide and it can land.... and it thrust by ion engines, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand it can\u0027t fly without one.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I believe I still stick to the rule...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose ion engines are Not going to flyable at Dunar night.

This may sound counter-intuitive, but the really thick atmosphere and high gravity there rewards high-lift designs in terms of altitude ceiling and maneuverability a lot more than high-thrust designs: which Duna (with its low gravity and thin atmosphere) actually rewards more. This is one of the reasons I went with thermal turbojets for Duna, even though I knew propellers would be *slightly* lighter (not much after all the solar panels they need).

What this means in practice is that you don\u0027t need nearly enough generation capacity to run the engines constantly- you can easily store enough energy for a 28-minute burn if your generators can produce, say, half that each second... You can also attach two generators to each reactor (one on each end) for even more energy storage per ton- if you\u0027re not using the reactors for thermal rocket engines or turbojets... Combine this with a few capacitors if you need a tiny bit more juice (but it doesn\u0027t justify an entire additional reactor), and you\u0027ve got a vessel with MUCH less mass than what you\u0027ve got there- which means better TWR and more total Delta-V per fuel tank (which means you don\u0027t need as many of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, my Duna colonization effort is progressing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kEd8JfG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kEd8JfG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just finished launching the Crew Module (above), and now all I need to do is launch a second Science Module (the first one ran into a collision box error landing on the Mun, and lost both its radiators) and I\u0027ll be ready to send the whole flotilla to Duna... I\u0027ve got an estimated 21,000 Delta-V between the three vessels (some have more than others), all in their final stage- so I should have more than enough Delta-V to get to Duna *quickly* if I want, and have plenty left over for powered landers (though I might rely heavily on parachutes to save fuel) and return rockets...

The ports would be coming off again before any actual flying around would occur if I did this- so I wouldn\u0027t be \u0022adding to or subtracting from what will actually fly around on Duna\u0022. Skycraning also clearly falls under what is explicitly allowed under the rule after that- though it doesn\u0027t mention adding or removing temporary connector ports for skycraning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the craft only has one radial KAS port on the underside (for UF6 reprocessing and adding/removing LFO and Argon as cargo.) At least two widely spaced radial connector ports on the topside (one on the nose and one on the tail) would be needed to allow for a stable skycrane attachment that wouldn\u0027t wobble around during descent through the atmosphere... I can add these via EVA activity very easily- and once again, they would be coming back off before the craft does any flying around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as tying a harness around the plane using cables- like they do when loading an Apache for skycraning in real life.
