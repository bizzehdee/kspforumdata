I\u0027ve discovered a little quirk where it allows automation of craft within the physics area. So... multiple launcher, landings and dockings etc available. Basically, anything a craft can automate, can be automated with multiple craft and little CPU use hit. What does this mean? It means we could ahve AI controlled Kerbals driving Rovers, flying planes etc. Think of the possibilities! While MP would be a nightmare to code (out of sync errors galore), multiple AI controlled flights, in tandem, seem to already work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainly, it would allow for multiple deployments, as is already done with some rockets. Or allow for better skycrane control (crane and lander/rover separate but working in tandem) as the skycrane needs to move out of the way for landing! Also, you could fly 1 rocket, while an AI flies a refueling tanker and meets up with you. Or have a Kerbal drive a rover to collect some crew from a lander. I\u0027ll upload the MechJeb videos if it\u0027s of any interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T20:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, we will be having Kerbal controlled flights, although I don\u0027t know how complicated that will be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T20:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very real possibility, and several game mods already implement this functionality- allowing multiple vehicles to be controlled to streamline tasks like docking and transferring resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it relies on integrating a rather sophisticated automation structure into the game, which has long been made known as something that will not be included anytime soon if at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of that reliance though, this thread falls under the do not suggest category of autopilots and will be closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the full list of items not to suggest please see here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
