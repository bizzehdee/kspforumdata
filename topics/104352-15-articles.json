They are their own company, they set their own deadlines, so forth and so on (1.0 really seemed to have a deadline set many months back though), at the same time they want to be so open and listen to the community, and then they are kind of opaque and don\u0027t want to share because they want to change their plans.."},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralGuacamole","CreatedById":144627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:17:03Z","Content":"Honestly, I don\u0027t care that much about the fairings, if they work, they work."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:42:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Honestly, I don\u0027t care that much about the fairings, if they work, they work.\n\nThe fact is, they don\u0027t work.

The current fairings are unrealistic, but they work and compensate for other existing unrealistic things in the craft design (e.g. no concave part colliders on the easy).\n\nIf you want to deal with the space shrapnel issue just separate the fairing at 25000 m alt and drag deals with them.\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve found is that muliple fairings are needed fo complex payloads, you might want to have fixed close fairing points at the same factor as the fairing. This affords the attachment and down directed strut connectors to the outer regions of the fairing base for stabikity. You cannot strut upward from the base but the area just inside the fairing attach will accept the connector ends. This creats a small weight disadvantage post fairing payload separation.
