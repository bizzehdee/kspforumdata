As much as I love the non-competetive aspect of KSP, and as such it\u0027s maybe not something I would take too seriously myself, it would be nice at times to have an idea how \u0027good\u0027 a player you are compared to others. Some players on the other hand would really love this. Wirking out the scoring criteria and getting the right balance could prove tricky though. But worth thinking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
