So I thought I\u0027d make this account and thread for anyone who might not know. Mods please move this to the correct place if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been backing up my ksp save data on my ps4 to a usb stick ever so often. Today my career save was ate by the krakin, but was recovered with my usb backup save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy steps were to delete corrupt saves once prompted in game, started a new career, \u00A0then shut game down and overwrote my ksp save with the backup up from usb stick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps someone who might not have known this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second time my data was lost and I replaced with my backup and then during game I would get the data corrupted message every time it would try to quicksave. I could say no once asked to delete\u00A0and continue game play, but very annoying. To\u00A0fix this you must delete all of your in-game saves only leaving your persistent. This can only be done at the menu while at your complex. Then go back to the main menu and reload your career.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd note this has only been tested while having\u00A0one career mode save and no sandbox or science.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-15T00:03:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2017 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal-Willie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-13T22:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTHANK you!
