Also there is no shader with blending maps, or multiply/add maps so you can make multi-layered textures that look good both from far away and close up, just like it is used on KSP terrain. I have to chose between making giant textures, repeating textures, or small textures that cover everything but look terrible in the close-up\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazari1382","CreatedById":62013,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T19:58:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose all look really good so far though.

Still not perfect, and adds tiny bit to overall tris count...but better than streached or shmoooshed lookin textures imo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the bleeding here is what I do (and again im noob at all this, so probably much better way to do it). I use smart project to map every mesh at first. This lets you set a margin between the islands that are mapped. If you keep that 3-4 pixels gap between island it kills texture bleeds. And even if you go back to select certain faces to unwrap on a mesh, if ya do the smart project first it will still use setting from that when you reselect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T22:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is incredible.
