I also had one where i was 4k above water with 2 parachutes on a mk1 pod and science jr. put it on 4x speed went to map view and back blew up 1.5k in the air no real good reason. the landing was above the middle of a large ocean at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T23:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.
