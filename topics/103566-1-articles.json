If coming in with a capsule, keep a high PE -- 30km or so. At worst, you have to come around again. For spaceplanes, use your aerodynamics to your advantage. When high in the atmosphere, keep a high angle of attack by turning left and right. This creates a lot of drag and will slow you down. If you\u0027re heating up too much, pitch upwards to slow your rate of descent (and maybe even start going up again). Pitch back down to increase your descent speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T07:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeat shields \u002B shallow trajectory are your answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve survived a reentry with large mk3 beasts without losing anything to reentry heat by skimming the atmosphere multiple times and then gliding my way to safety.
