How is it even *possible* for a spaceplane to survive that, especially in real life?!

If coming in with a capsule, keep a high PE -- 30km or so. At worst, you have to come around again. For spaceplanes, use your aerodynamics to your advantage. When high in the atmosphere, keep a high angle of attack by turning left and right. This creates a lot of drag and will slow you down. If you\u0027re heating up too much, pitch upwards to slow your rate of descent (and maybe even start going up again). Pitch back down to increase your descent speed."},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T07:00:06Z","Content":"Heat shields \u002B shallow trajectory are your answer.\n\nI\u0027ve survived a reentry with large mk3 beasts without losing anything to reentry heat by skimming the atmosphere multiple times and then gliding my way to safety. Aim for 30-35 km periapsis on your first skim and you should be OK.\n\nAlso, I\u0027d recommend to set up a 100km orbit before you return, if you have a highly eccentric orbit you\u0027re probably going too fast.\n\nIf you have FAR and you like to overuse wings like me, pitching up is only a good idea when high in atmosphere. Once you get under 20 km don\u0027t even think about it unless you are going reasonably slow."},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T07:31:28Z","Content":"Here is how i worked this out:\n\nLower Periapsis to about 40km above KSP.\n\nAt 70.000km pitch down almost -90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, so that you use the wings to produce as much drag as possible.\n\nAt 47.000km pitch back to something like \u002B15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above horizon\n\nKeep the Point of touchdown (measured it by blue orbit line) bit before KSC by using S-Turns or by pitching up or down.\n\nAlso its really helpful to build in some airbreaks or at least spoilers on that planes\n\nHave fun, and as Scott Manley would say: \u0022Fly safe!\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T08:02:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StainX**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T16:44:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There has never been a spaceplane in real life.\n\u003E I\u0027ve tried DRE a few times but never found it added anything so I think it must just be that I use a very shallow approach anyway.

Also you will want air brakes or some kind of spoiler to create as much drag as possible to slow the craft down when coming down. \n\nYou can see in these pictures one of my craft from the last version of KSP on re-entry with FAR\u002BDRE.\n\n![BlNLS5W.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BlNLS5W.jpg)\n\n![njhciu2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/njhciu2.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T17:55:34Z","Content":"I\u0027ve not really tried bringing spaceplanes back in through DRE since I dont build them very often.\n\nBut heres my goal for a capsule: From 70km orbit I tend to aim around periapsis 35km.
