This mod is making models which ape historical spacecraft, without being replicas per se.  \n\nMaking patches for Salyut-style space station parts are easy - two seats in the station with a two person Soyuz capsule (four seats, including the orbital module) docked equals about 90 days hab time, which matches the historical figures without the need for any additional Kerbalmonths. Space for 3000 supplies (about 3 tons - approximately what you can transfer on a Progress vehicle) and no recycling (this is a low tech space station) makes this line up with the real world stuff nicely, without any further manipulation. This is great stuff.  \n\nWhat I\u0027m less sure about are hab multipliers. What they represent, or when they should be used instead of or in addition to just adding kerbalmonths. The cupola is clearly a dedicated \u0022quality of life\u0022 part (which makes sense to me), but I\u0027m not sure why large inflatables don\u0027t qualify for the same kind of bonuses. The Kerbitat-type parts are presumably supposed to be recyclers, but they already have a recycling function. The Karibou module combines both, presumably, but the multiplier seems huge by comparison. Since I\u0027m going to be thinking about more advanced station parts as well, I think it would be useful to have a deeper understanding here.  \n\nI\u0027m not entirely clear on what constitutes a \u0022multiplier\u0022, or what would justify it. Clearly it\u0027s important to be cautious about employing too many of them, as they can make the hab problem too easy to solve.   \n\nAs a related question - is Wear actually implemented at the moment?

It also has a water purifier (which to me is really a separate thing than a general recycler - the normal recyclers allow you to re-use what resources you have, the water purifier uses water to extend your resources), and might be a bit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

So if I have both on a ship, how do they affect the Kerbals on there?  Does one take precedence?\n\u003E \n\nThey actually do stack... sort of. Notice that every recycler has a certain efficiency (indicated by a percentage) and only affects a certain number of kerbals. The RT-500 affects one kerbal and has an efficiency of 60%. What this means is that it will reduce one kerbal\u0027s resource consumption rate by 60%. However, if you have 2 kerbals on board and only one RT-500, it will reduce the resource consumption of each by 30%. Adding extra RT-500s will not raise the efficiency above 60% UNLESS you have another recycler with a higher efficiency rating, in which case you CAN stack them to reach that efficiency level. So, for example, the MPL affects (or has a recycler capacity of) 5 kerbals and has an efficiency of 70%. If you have 6 kerbals, you could use one MPL plus 2 RT-500s to get 70% efficiency for all 6 kerbals. The two RT-500s \u0022stack\u0022 but are capped by the MPL\u0027s rating of 70%.\n\nEdit; Aaaand everyone explained that far more concisely than I did.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-31T19:27:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2016 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Merkov**\n  \nBeaten to the punch."},{"CreatedByName":"Sarxis","CreatedById":130923,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-31T21:46:15Z","Content":"Thanks for the clarifications everyone ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nThe other thing I\u0027m wondering about - RoverDude did you intend for the 25000 Inline to come so early in the tech tree?

Tell me if there\u0027s anything you think needs to be added to that page - I wrote it based on my understanding, and I tried to cover just about everything, but I was going from my experience...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My description on that page is partly based on my observation that the hab ring doesn\u0027t have a multiplier.  As I think of it, a multiplier is \u0027extras\u0027 (or luxuries) that make your stay more enjoyable - better food, a nice view, a place to play, stuff like that.  It\u0027s not the essentials - those add hab time directly.  Gravity is an essential - so the ring doesn\u0027t really add an \u0027extra\u0027 luxury, it should just be adding a base hab time.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Personally, for a rotating ring I might \u0027round high\u0027 on the hab time it adds - round up to the next whole month number or so, just to give it a bit more of a boost.  Still keep it close to the recommended values to keep it from being unbalanced, but just a bit more can be justified by the design.  But that\u0027s me saying that, not RoverDude.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As for the .cfg files: There are a couple of things you could do with them.  If the mod is still under active development, you can talk to the developer and see if they want to include them in the base pack.  Usually if you\u0027re polite about it (and do a good job with the files) they\u0027ll say thanks and include them.  Otherwise, it\u0027s not uncommon to have a \u0027mod\u0027 that\u0027s just a set of .cfg files to get things to work together.  Just make sure you document what you\u0027re doing, and don\u0027t claim to be officially part of either parent mod.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/7/2016 at 10:02 AM, Merkov said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I would tend to agree with [@DStaal](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/155685-dstaal/) on this. The way I tend to think about hab time vs hab multipliers is that a part with a high hab time can more or less stand on its own, while a hab multiplier shouldn\u0027t be a part you expect someone to live in, just one that makes life a little nicer. Another way to think of it, if something provides a comfort bonus to everyone on the station, it should have a multiplier, but if it is just really comfortable for those living in that specific part, it should have a high hab time. Let me try to explain my thinking here:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With that larger, sturdier ring, I don\u0027t think there is anything wrong with giving it a hab time of 80 months; that\u0027s basically saying that the structure is comfortable enough to allow a full compliment of crew to happily stay aboard for 6.5 years (which is not too shabby) without any outside amenities. Having said that, I don\u0027t think that ring would have any amenities meant to serve those who do not live aboard it. For example, when I lived and worked in oil field camps, each bunkhouse had living accommodations (with washrooms \u0026 showers), a laundry room, and utility rooms. Some bunkhouses had nicer rooms, (bigger beds, bigger TVs, maybe private bathrooms, etc.) but no bunkhouse was meant to provide any service for anyone living outside of it. That is, if I lived in one of the cheaper bunkhouses, the fact that one of the fancier bunkhouses had private washrooms, queen size beds, and big TVs would not make my living situation any better. That SXT ring makes me think of one of the VIP bunkhouses. Fantastic to live in, but if you are living in an OKS ring beside it, you\u0027re not going to really care that much.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On the other hand, buildings like the gym, more-upscale restaurants, and media centres are things that everyone living in a camp could use, and they make a huge difference to how long someone can stand to live there. Even if my living quarter wasn\u0027t great, having access to a gym to work out, a common room with TVs/computers/games etc, and a more comfortable dining option meant that I didn\u0027t have to rely on my room for comfort. More importantly, they were able to be used by everyone. Nobody lived in the gym or common room, but everybody benefited from their existence. This is how I imagine hab multipliers working. No matter what kind of hab module you are living in, anyone can take a stroll (or, uh, float) through the kerbitat, or watch the stars through the cupola.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I do agree with your desire to increase hab multipliers without just spamming cupolas, but I think the problem is that not a lot of parts packs (that I know of, anyway) focus on R\u0026R for your kerbals aboard space stations. To be honest, I don\u0027t know of any mods besides \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS (maybe Kerbalism?) that worry about how long your kerbals spend locked inside tin cans as long as they are fed and watered. If you know of any kerbal gyms, movie theatres, communication rooms, etc. then those would be PERFECT candidates for hab multipliers.\n\u003E \n\nI asked the same question in the MKS thread, and these answers might be helpful\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Domfluff said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a reason why the rotating UKS hab doesn\u0027t come with a multiplier?
