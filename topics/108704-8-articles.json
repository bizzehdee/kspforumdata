The highlight color will match the icon color; both the colors and the highlight function can be adjusted in the settings file (hoverHighlight; set to true by default). See pictures a few posts up for examples.\n\nThe highlight function can interact in weird ways with other highlighting functions in some cases (crew transfer for instance), but resetting the other highlight function always seems to clear up any problems.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T15:52:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T18:21:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/14/2016 at 7:29 AM, DMagic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How about this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![LoPyijb.png](http://i.imgur.com/LoPyijb.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Or this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![YeOgQ7g.png](http://i.imgur.com/YeOgQ7g.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Or both?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll have to look into the rescue Kerbal problem.\n\u003E \n\nthese are great!
