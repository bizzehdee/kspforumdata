graphics\u0022 class.\u00A0 Which in those days was writing a program (and beforehand, as a prelim, writing the necessary\u00A0drivers) to move the pen of a plotter,\u00A0or fire specific pins of a dot-matrix printer and move the platten back and forth, to draw a picture 1 pixel at a time on a piece of paper, which you only got to see and start to debug (in hex dump) 30 minutes after running the punch cards through the reader.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, our 1st real project (once we\u0027d written the drivers) was to draw a circle.\u00A0 The algorithm was\u00A0simple.\u00A0 Just increment radians as you draw and stop when (accumulated radians) \u0026gt;= 2*3.1416.\u00A0 But this guy in my class (no, it wasn\u0027t me, ISYN) left out the \u0022\u0026gt;\u0022 so this was effectively an infinite loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally, however, this would not have been a big problem\u00A0because the very 1st punch card in the stack of every job was the \u0022job card\u0022, which was basically about money.\u00A0 The university rented the Amdahl mainframe, got billed by CPU time, and passed this cost onto the students as \u0022lab fees\u0022.\u00A0 Thus, the job card\u00A0identified whose account to bill.\u00A0 It also specified a max allowed CPU time regardless of the state of execution.\u00A0 We were told always to put \u0022S1\u0022 in the requisite columns on the job\u00A0card, \u0022S\u0022 meaning seconds, so this meant that if the program would run more than 1 second, stop anyway.\u00A0 This was a safeguard against infinite loops bankrupting the student and/or university.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, this particular student, who was from a foreign land, misread the prof\u0027s \u0022S1\u0022 (written on an actual\u00A0chalkboard) as \u002251\u0022\u00A0 And the thing was, if the (EBCDIC, not ASCII) character in the applicable column of the job card was NOT an \u0022S\u0022, the time defaulted to MINUTES.\u00A0 Thus, this infinite loop wasn\u0027t going to stop for 51 minutes.\u00A0 So the plotter pen went round and round and round.\u00A0 It ate through the paper and started digging a groove in the table.\u00A0 Eventually, the smell of friction and the screeching of the machinery roused the student employee minding the output desk (where we waited 30 minutes to see how buggy our code was each run, so crowds building up there was\u00A0normal)\u00A0from his own studies, and he jumped up and pulled the plug on the plotter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this didn\u0027t stop the program from continuing to execute on\u00A0the mainframe, every second of which cost obscene amounts of even 1980s money.\u00A0 Stopping that\u00A0required rousing (at about 0100) the god-like being\u00A0with both the physical key to the locked room where the mainframe physically lived\u00A0and the knowledge of how to stop it mid-stride without destroying the entire university database (which lived on the then-whopping 32 MEGs of HD space in a separate room bigger than my current office).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sheet of plotter paper, with a nice hole in the middle about 4\u0022 wide where the pen cut the center away, cost about $20K to produce (including repairs) in 1980s\u00A0money.\u00A0 It was hanging in a frame in the lobby of the computer science building when I left the university.\u00A0 I wonder if it\u0027s still there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
