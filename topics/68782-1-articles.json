The closest landing objective that was worth points was the Mun, then Eve, then Ike, and I\u0027d say that only 20-25 people landed anything off of Kerbin. Still, everyone had fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the waters (been a while since I played a completely stock game of kerbal) with a 7 crew Munar lander and got them there with 90% lander fuel remaining, EVA\u0027d them and parked them there for 7 points \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I re-used the same lander for the Duna SOI trip and beefed up the launch vehicle a little, then sent it on its way. While that was in transit, I launched an identical ship to Eve, and a 23 crew ship to Laythe (5 cans and a 3-man pod). My Ike lander captured around duna with the luckiest gravity catch I\u0027ve ever pulled off - Ike snagged it into low Duna orbit, which aerobroke off a lot of speed, and I only needed a 20 m/s burn to reorient and reach Ike again with a 15k peri. Landed that crew for another 20.5 points. Eve crew messed up - I timed my transfer window way wrong. They\u0027re in orbit at 500km x 1.5Mkm and out of gas \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E My laythe lander ended up never reaching its target because we ran out of time.

Really tall, with loads of small fuel tanks, and little engines.
