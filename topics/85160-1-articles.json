It ends up being 5 stages so I can land/ascend from Tylo and still remain relatively small. I save it as a sub assembly and then start working on a new ship to take me all through the Jool system without needing to refuel at any point in the mission. This is another 5 or 6 stages. Grab the lander and stick it on the \u0022touring\u0022 stage and I should end up with 10 or 11 stages right? Of course not. It matches up stage 1 to 1, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, etc...and now I have an unholy mishmash of stages. So, I figure what the heck, I will add a bunch of empty stages (0-6) on the touring vehicle, and see what happens, when I glom on the sub assembly. Voila! It kept all the stages separate, so I have no intertwined stages. All my touring stages are 11--\u0026gt;6, and my lander stages are 5--\u0026gt;0.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T02:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EdFred\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T21:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoo!
