The challenge was to perform the closest aerobrake you could to Duna without hitting the surface or deorbiting. There were some great entries, coming sometimes only 7km above the surface. Then IstasPumaNevada submitted their entry which made a closest approach of 1861m ASL and a radar altitude of a mere 143.6m and Escaped again! Needless to say, he won. Upon giving some more thought to it, I figured, that if he could make an escape after a 143m shave, there just wasn\u0027t enough atmosphere for the challenge. Where better to go for a thicker atmosphere than Eve?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPECIFICS/RULES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Because you are attempting to prevent a deorbit, your apoapsis MUST end up above the atmosphere and you must exit the atmosphere thereafter (this would be the first step in an aerobrake, the foundation of the challenge, which would then be followed by a cirularization burn at apoapsis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There are no restrictions on entry speed, that\u0027s where your creativity comes in. (I won\u0027t specify the way IstasPumaNevada succeeded as I\u0027m hoping someone else will figure it out, and I\u0027m hoping that someone else will do better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You MAY use engine thrust to assist you in escaping the atmosphere after entry, HOWEVER, your score will be doubled if you don\u0027t use ANY thrust while in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As proof of your achievement, you have two possible ways of submitting your attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. As a video. This is by far the easiest way to submit an entry as I can see exactly what\u0027s going on for every second of the attempt. The video must begin shortly before entering the atmosphere, and end shortly after exiting again \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and upon exiting, you must show a quick view of the orbital map to prove that you have indeed escaped the atmosphere again. Be sure to have your UI visible so I can see your altitude as this is what your score will be judged by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. As an album of screencaps. This is harder to do, but better for people who don\u0027t have the software or the performance ability to do a video. All images must include the UI, particularly the resources dialogue, the Altimeter and the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Mission Elapsed Time (MET). The first picture must show your craft before entry. The last must show your craft after escaping the atmosphere again. Any pictures included in between will be used to judge your score. the picture that \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E has the lowest reading on the altimeter is what your score will be based off of, so take a handfull of pics as you approach periapsis. If you\u0027re attempting an un-powered aerobrake you must have the resources dialogue open at all times or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E else make it clear that there are no engines on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Landing isn\u0027t allowed. The goal is to aerobrake as low as possible. Dropping into the atmosphere with a 10,000m/s craft from above and then popping out again doesn\u0027t count either. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMust work as an effective aerobrake\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Wings and Winglets, or any aerodynamic Lifting Surface (including control Surfaces) are disallowed as one can abuse the infiniglide glitch to escape again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- One Kerbal must go along for the ride.

Then, if your craft has enough dV, at apoapsis you can burn to reverse the direction of the orbit, so you\u0027re orbiting the sun retrograde. Then not only could you get an extremely high velocity at your periapsis, but if you do encounter Eve you will be traveling in opposite directions, so the relative velocity would be... insane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T22:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022totalitor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022totalitor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave I understood correctly: If I dive let\u0027s say 1 m from sea level and I climb back to orbit using engines - that\u0027s ok?\u003Cp\u003EOr if I land and then climb back to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get within a meter of sea-level on Eve, your not getting back to orbit using rockets without a heck of a lot of staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T22:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about its bigger brother?
