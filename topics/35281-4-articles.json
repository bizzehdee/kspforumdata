Somewhere down the line of events starting from when the user clicks the Left Mouse Button (LMB) the game has to decide whether we\u0027re picking up a part off the vessel or from the parts list or a part hanging out in space, dropping a part out in space or in the trash or on the ship, etc. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ESo then SAM has to decide when to act on the right behavior. So first assuming that this detection can be done at all, if we have determined that we\u0027re between the point of knowing we\u0027re picking up a part and its NOT the root part, and the point of actually physically removing the part and its children from the ship, we have to take a catalog every single part in its \u0022attached state\u0022, denote a special name to it (Since putting the soon-to-be new structure could already be named something else), decide if it is a part that not only has a parent, but connects to another part somewhere else on the structure and REMEMBER that other parts new name if it has already been assigned one, and if the other part hasn\u0027t been named remember to come back and check for that new name when everything else has been cataloged, and THEN remember the entire state. *takes a deep breath after that run-on sentence*.... At this point, Unity can handle moving the parts we\u0027ve selected, and move them all around. If the user wants to save the ship, because, you know, the computer CAN\u0027T know that we want to save the structure when we pressed the LMB, so when the part is dragged to the save point, or, is released by joining to another part of the structure, or dragging to the trash, or whatever. If we\u0027re dragging to the save button, then draw the \u0022SAVE AS\u0022 dialogs as usual, save the in-memory cataloged parts to the .craft file.
