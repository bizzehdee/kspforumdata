vacuum Isp advantage closer to the atmosphere reduced thrust?

When you optimize an engine for space you cripple it for use within an atmosphere due to bell design.

At the very least, I generally have at least two or three choices for most situations. Poodle, Terrier, 48-7S cluster, or radial 24-77s for a medium lander? Twin-Boar, Mainsail with boosters, or T30/T45 cluster for a mid-game lifter?
