The only reason to pick one over the other is aesthetics.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Each engine has its own role, so for the best efficiency you should pick the best engine for that situation. You can still use any engine you want, but some won\u0027t work nearly as well as others in particular situations.\n\u003E \n\u003E Which is it that you are asking for? Or is it some \u0022C\u0022 choice that is yet again different?\n\nThe way I understand it, OP is indeed looking for \u0022Some \u0022C\u0022 choice that is yet again different\u0022\n\nSpecifically, there are not enough different engines.\n\nAdditionally, I disagree strongly with the \u0022but you\u0027re not prevented from doing that\u0022 counter-point. Of course the game doesn\u0027t have a an explicit \u0022You can\u0027t use that here\u0022 rule, as has been pointed out.\n\nInstead, the modeling of the atmosphere and the stats of the engines create an implicit rule that does in fact prevent certain designs from working, without outright preventing you from building them.\n\nIt\u0027s like saying it\u0027s not illegal to cut off your hand with a dull butter-knife. It\u0027s technically true, but it doesn\u0027t make a bit of difference if the rule exists or not!\n\nAs I stated above, the problem is not enough different engines. Specifically, many niches for rocket engines in the game have only one engine in that specific niche.\n\nExamples of the problem as I understand it:\n\n1.25m lower stage booster engine: LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 (no gimbal, higher thrust, lower ISP)\n\n1.25m lower stage core engine: LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022\n\n1.25m upper stage / lander engine: LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022\n\n2.5m lower stage booster engine: LFB KR-1x2 \u0022Twin-Boar\u0022\n\n2.5m lower stage core engine: RE-M3 \u0022Mainsail\u0022\n\n2.5m 2nd stage engine: RE-I5 \u0022Skipper\u0022\n\n2.5m upper stage / lander engine: RE-L10 \u0022Poodle\u0022\n\n3.75m lower stage engine: \n\n3.75m upper stage engine: \n\nMost of these engines impose mission-killing constraints when used outside of their intended niche (most, because swapping booster and core engines on a single-core or core\u002BSRBs launcher design usually doesn\u0027t change much unless operating very close to the margins).\n\nTHIS is why OP\u0027s problem is killing their creativity.\n\nAt least one alternative should be available for each one, IMO. By alternative, I mean an engine that has a markedly different look, as well as SLIGHTLY different thrust/mass/ISP, and likely a different length as well. This way you have at least SOME wiggle room for the sake of aesthetics, as well as more options to even further optimize a design for performance, if so desired.\n\nAlso, some diameters don\u0027t even have all the available niches filled. (larger versions of nuclear and ion engines, smaller launch and mid-stage engines, etc.)\n\nIn addition to the issue brought up by OP, I have a problem with the Vac. ISP nerf to all LFO fueled rocket engines and SRBs. Liquid fueled engines now top out at 350s instead of 390, and SRBs all have worse ISP, except for the Sepratron I, which was actually buffed.

Take a look at the FAR settings for pre-1.0 KIDS if you disagree, I think its \u0022balance for the thinner atmosphere only by tweaking atmospheric ISP\u0022 setting gave most engines an atmospheric ISP of about 85, if I remember correctly.\n\nThe problem with just nerfing the atmospheric ISP is that the vacuum ISP is more important for most of the ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:32:23Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s quite as limiting as it looks, the only major limitation I see is that a few engines don\u0027t work well in atmo, and are therefore not much use as lifters. \n\n For instance, The T30 and T45 are extremely versatile engines. I\u0027ve used them as 1.25-meter booster engines, of course, but also in clusters for 2.5- and 3.75-meter rockets, as sustainer engines on SSTO\u0027s, and as upper-stage engines on a variety of heavier ships where a Terrier would be too weak and a Poodle too heavy. \n\nOn landing craft, I often have a choice between the Terrier, 48-7S, 24-77, LV-1, and O-10 in various combinations, and I generally pick whichever is most convenient for the ship\u0027s configuration over which would be the most efficient--for example, if I use several radial 24-77\u0027s in place of a Terrier, I can do away with landing gear and have my ship land directly on its tail. I\u0027ve found uses for all of those engines in my current career save. \n\nI do think there are plenty of gaps to be filled--mostly a lack of larger jets, nukes, solids, etc.--but I don\u0027t feel like my creativity is being stifled.

Engine balance was so terrible pre 1.0.x that you simply never saw certain engines being used in the game. Now most engines have a solid niche they fit into and can almost always perform double-duty if you\u0027re willing to accept a compromise or two. Case in point, the KR-2L craft I posted earlier. I\u0027ve use an LV-T30 for a 2.5m Duna landing engine, worked very well for getting back into orbit. Engine diversity is much, much better in 1.0.x.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Most of these engines impose mission-killing constraints when used outside of their intended niche\n\nNot really. The problem is that people aren\u0027t willing to step outside the efficiency box that they feel constrained by and get creative. The game certainly isn\u0027t stifling *my* creativity...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E At least one alternative should be available for each one, IMO.\n\nI disagree. The last thing KSP needs is redundant parts, at least until the memory management has been improved dramatically. The great thing about KSP is the flexibility afforded you through the build system. Ring a Skipper with 6 LV-T30s on a 3.75m tank for an @1900Kn launcher, use multiple 1.25m engines to launch 2.5m parts early in career, etc...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In addition to the issue brought up by OP, I have a problem with the Vac.

Being able to instantly move across the board on a whim in Monopoly doesn\u0027t encourage creativity, it just breaks the game. That really has nothing to do with realism, and everything to do with needing to have meaningful constraints for a game to be interesting.\n\nAnd even in terms of toys, many of the real classics operate on constraints to make them more interesting. Take Lego for example. The shapes you can build are constrained by the pieces at your disposal and how they fit together. Regular blocks are far more free form, yet have nowhere close to the same level of popularity, and it\u0027s fairly natural for a child to \u0022graduate\u0022 from blocks to Lego at a certain stage of development, I think largely due to it creating a more interesting puzzle for their minds to ponder while they simultaneously express their creativity.\n\nReally, I think if that kind of entirely open creativity is what someone is after, they should probably learn some 3D modelling or CAD software so that they can properly express themselves with tools ideally suited to doing so, and stop expecting games to somehow provide them that same degree of freedom.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T02:38:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:40:53Z","Content":"No one is telling you which one to use.

I claim that you are not restricted to using engines only within their perceived regime and I have proven that by using what is clearly an upper stage engine as a sea-level lifting engine (works pretty well, too).\n\nBefore 1.0.x there were plenty of things preventing you from using \u0022any engine for any purpose\u0022.

If an engine has a 15% better Isp in space compared to other engines then shouldn\u0027t it\u0027s atmosphere thrust be reduced by ~15% and not 75%? \n\n[TABLE=width: 393]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LV-1R \u0022Spider\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1.79[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]10%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]24-77 \u0022Twitch\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]13.79[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]16.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]14%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Mk-55 \u0022Thud\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]108.20[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]120.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]10%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]O-10 \u0022Puff\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]9.60[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]20.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]52%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LV-1 \u0022Ant\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]0.54[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]73%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]48-7S \u0022Spark\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]16.20[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]18.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]10%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]14.78[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]60.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]75%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]200.67[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]215.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]7%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]168.75[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]200.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]16%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]CR-7 R.A.P.I.E.R.[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]162.30[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]180.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]10%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]T-1 Toroidal \u0022Aerospike\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]163.53[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]180.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]9%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]13.88[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]60.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]77%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Rockomax \u0022Poodle\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]60.71[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]250.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]76%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Rockomax \u0022Skipper\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]568.75[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]650.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]13%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Rockomax \u0022Mainsail\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1379.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1500.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]8%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]LFB KR-1x2 \u0022Twin-Boar\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1866.70[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2000.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]7%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Kerbodyne KR-2L\u002B \u0022Rhino\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]1000.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]2000.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]50%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]S3 KS-25x4 \u0022Mammoth\u0022[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]3746.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]4000.00[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]6%[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T23:46:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, wouldn\u0027t it make some sense to tie the vacuum Isp advantage closer to the atmosphere reduced thrust?

When you optimize an engine for space you cripple it for use within an atmosphere due to bell design.

If you don\u0027t know how to do that, there will never be a better time to learn. Editing text config files is probably the most valuable gaming skill one can learn in half an hour. I can\u0027t remember the last game where I didn\u0027t change something. And it\u0027s not just customizing parts; KSP initially didn\u0027t even support my screen resolution. Took all of 2 minutes to fix, because I know how to edit config files.\n\nThis, and the this that this talks about.\n\nSquad has made an amazing game and embraced modding. I\u0027ve barely started playing and I have career modes going in stock and with different mods. I love it, I can change each playthrough to whatever I want.\n\nThere\u0027s no way Squad will be able to perfectly please everybody 100% with stock, if I want something different, I\u0027ll find a way to change it. \n\nThat\u0027s what makes the add-on developers so awesome. They see something they wish was different in the game, so they make it happen, and share it with everybody.\n\nConsider asking for help on how to implement the changes you want, rather than just complaining about it. That way you, and anybody who wants the same changes, can have them. You can still share craft and create challenges, just like any other craft or challenge that is shared based on some change to the game.\n\nI\u0027d bet that very few of us are playing the exact same KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T04:09:28Z","Content":"Honestly, I find a lot of the engines almost interchangeable in a lot of situations. At the very least, I generally have at least two or three choices for most situations. Poodle, Terrier, 48-7S cluster, or radial 24-77s for a medium lander? Twin-Boar, Mainsail with boosters, or T30/T45 cluster for a mid-game lifter? Picking the most efficient option often gains me only a few dozen m/sec of delta-v on a ship with several hundred or thousand, so I often end up picking an engine based on other considerations--looks, TWR, configuration, cost, landing-gear clearance, whatever. \n\nThat said, I do think the current balancing could do with some tweaking for consistency. Why, for instance, does the Ant have 73% less ISP in atmo while the Spider--basically a radial Ant in other regards--has only 10% less?\n\nOut of curiosity, what actually IS realistic in this situation? I\u0027ve always thought of the Terrier as an analog for the Apollo LM engines--would those really have been 75% less efficient in atmo? I know some engines are optimized for atmo and some for vacuum, but is the difference really that big? I\u0027d have guessed more like 25%."}]}
