One non-tweak comment I\u0027d make is that I do wish we had non-debug menu ways to examine the heat of our craft. I mean, it\u0027d also be neat if I knew if larger surface areas touching ground would help bleed heat more efficiently without looking at the numbers - anyway we can get an animated convection/conduction/radiation diagram over the ship?
