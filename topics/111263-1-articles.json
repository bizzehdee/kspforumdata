Unfortunately the idiotic politicians killed the project deciding that their personal agendas were more important, there were only five that ever got produced. I\u0027m not sure of my facts and didn\u0027t take the time to check, but I think it\u0027s one of the very first planes to use a delta-shaped wing; perhaps the first.

I like the cambered wings and the slightly off-axis thrusters and nose section; flying it is kind of quirky with the offset axis of thrust, but manageable and very stable. It has lots of lift. I decided to make it an SSTO, hence the Rapiers and docking port, and though I could reach space with this it didn\u0027t have enough fuel to circularize the orbit since I had to leave some fuel tanks empty in order to reach the appropriate velocities. So I created a second version that has a third engine, allowing all the fuel tanks to be full, and sure enough it got to a ~80 km orbit with enough fuel left to get higher. Here\u0027s the MK2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/AvroArrow/Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-9.11.57-PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-9.11.57-PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/AvroArrow/Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-9.12.37-PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-05-26-at-9.12.37-PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ll turn the MK1 into a pure atmospheric version, and try to figure out how to make it a two-seater as the real version is.
