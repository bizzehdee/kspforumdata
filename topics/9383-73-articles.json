Even if it raised it, it\u0027s only going to raise it to whatever your actual physical memory memory is, minus whatever else is getting used. In my case, that\u0027s all of about 2gb (for a total of 6 the game could use). Anything past your physical memory would have to go into virtual memory, and if you thought loading was slow NOW...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, as you pointed out, textures. The way the game uses memory for textures is really piss-poor, and stuff I\u0027ve seen in local testing suggests it\u0027s probably not even USING most of it except during scene loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis includes Mapsat: My testing has indicated that the number 1 use of memory in Mapsat is, predictably, the map textures themselves, which are using about 600mb total, an amount that doesn\u0027t change with the mapped or unmapped status of the various planets. That last bit indicates that the memory usage involves uncompressed textures: if they were compressed it\u0027d vary. It\u0027s actually TOO HIGH for the textures to be getting loaded just once uncompressed: In fact it\u0027s more than double the size that all 30 map textures would need if decompressed. It is, in fact, consistent with two compressed and two uncompressed copies of the maps being loaded into memory. This suggests that all the intermediate steps in loading the PNG into the vidram are being cached in main system memory. On my setup I\u0027ve seen indications that the actual in-flight memory usage can be as low as 400-500mb, even with mapsat and multiple other mods running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis suggests it\u0027s a problem with the way the game is using memory for textures (which it shouldn\u0027t need main memory for once they\u0027ve been loaded into VRAM), which is consistent with the high memory usage of every other mod with lots of textures(or very high quality ones). The fact that people get out of memory errors from it implies that possibly the these cached items are being flagged as actually being in active use instead of being marked as cache that can be overwritten.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: It might be a problem with the game itself, not Mapsat. I don\u0027t know how to use the debug tools to find out, and so far everyone else seems more interested in blasting Mapsat for being a piece of crap and demanding something else that would most assuredly be better. Based on the evidence that I\u0027ve got, there\u0027s no indication that anything else would be any better because there\u0027s every indication it\u0027s a generic problem related to the fact that Mapsat has very large textures. But nobody but me is bothering to gather and consider evidence of what\u0027s actually going on, it seems like, which is a shame because I literally don\u0027t know how to go in and examine it in detail, and thus can never be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is hope though.
