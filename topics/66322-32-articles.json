When I hear game developers promising something to happen real soon now, I expect them to probably release something in a few months. A week is, after all, a really short time in software development. While you can often hack the main functionality together in a few hours, polishing the last 10% can easily take months. And even when you think you are only a couple of days away from release, some unexpected bugs can delay that release for weeks or even months.

I made it very clear in the post you incompletely cited that there is an expectation of a certain level of communication on the part of the developer. I refer to Minecraft here because they were important pioneers in how this \u0022pre-release\u0022 system works. A lot of people on these forums like to dump on Minecraft for whatever reason, but the fact is they wouldn\u0027t be playing KSP right now if Minecraft hadn\u0027t paved the way for pre-release. SQUAD is capitalizing their release model, but they\u0027re doing a poor job of dealing with the model\u0027s pitfalls. Before and after the commercial release, they\u0027ve been, IMO, very clear about the features they\u0027re working on and what to expect. They can effectively communicate with the community, but rarely give concrete release dates for patches. Features sometimes don\u0027t show up in the patches they were aiming for, \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ebut thats almost never a surprise when the patch launches.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Failure to actively communicate with the community leads to the problems we see in this thread. There may be no explicit guarantee, but I think it\u0027s ignorant to say there\u0027s not an expectation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, please note that \u003Cem\u003Eat no point\u003C/em\u003E have demanded, expected, or even asked for a release date. Simply, I\u0027d like to be told that there was misunderstanding between what they meant by \u0022soon\u0022 and what was obvious perceived by a substantial portion of community here. /shrug. That\u0027s it. And I acknowledge the CM has done that. I think it would have been better handled on Tuesday or Wednesday when the storm was brewing, but this is a situation where late is better than never. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m not expecting them to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what happened, and yes, they should want to avoid negative press. But it\u0027s their own fault hyping a product that wasn\u0027t ready for release and being vague with a timeline of \u0022soon\u0022. I\u0027m saying they failed to avoid negative community reactions and addressing it earlier would have avoided much of the frustration seen here in the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of this seems to be I think that they storm they created was foreseeable, and you draw a false dichotomy above saying they have to upset people wanting quality vs new toys now.
