I don\u0027t usually hear about indie games until they pop up on the steam store page, but I had no idea was Superhot was. So? I did a quick search up and found out about this.\n\n[**Here**](http://superhotgame.com/)\u0027s a link to the games website. I assume the majority of us on the forums are nerds of some sort, and the concept definitely satisfies my \u0027needs\u0027 for a matrix style game. \n\nThe game is a first person shooter (but wait for it), but has a concept that separates it from the rest. Time **only** moves when you do. This makes for some Matrix style scenes where you are dodging bullets and look cool doing it!\n\nThere is a playable prototype of the website from a Sept. 2013 game jam (7DFPS) that more than sparked my interest. It\u0027ll take up roughly 5-10mins of your time and I highly recommend you try it out! \n\nThe full game, which will be priced at roughly $15, is due to be released sometime in June of this year and the team are very interested in working with it for some time after the release.\n\nIt has had an appealing graphics recreation (with exploding crystal heads!) and lots of other upgrades. Here\u0027s a gif taken from the website:\n\n![superhot_gif3.gif](http://superhotgame.com/presskit_new/images/superhot_gif3.gif)\n\nI hope that I\u0027ve interested some of you!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T23:18:45Z","Content":"I saw this a while back.
