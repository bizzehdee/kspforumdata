I don\u0027t usually hear about indie games until they pop up on the steam store page, but I had no idea was Superhot was. So? I did a quick search up and found out about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://superhotgame.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s a link to the games website. I assume the majority of us on the forums are nerds of some sort, and the concept definitely satisfies my \u0027needs\u0027 for a matrix style game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is a first person shooter (but wait for it), but has a concept that separates it from the rest.

This makes for some Matrix style scenes where you are dodging bullets and look cool doing it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a playable prototype of the website from a Sept. 2013 game jam (7DFPS) that more than sparked my interest. It\u0027ll take up roughly 5-10mins of your time and I highly recommend you try it out! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full game, which will be priced at roughly $15, is due to be released sometime in June of this year and the team are very interested in working with it for some time after the release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has had an appealing graphics recreation (with exploding crystal heads!) and lots of other upgrades.
