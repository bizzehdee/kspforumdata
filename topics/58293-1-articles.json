Without needing any revert launches or loading from a quicksave. Most of the time my (and I\u0027m guessing the community in general) build process requires quite a bit of trial and error (or prayer) before it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, the one time the maiden attempt was successful was with my \u0022Faramir\u0022 probe, a Kerbal border explorer and negative gravioli detector. It entered orbit with both the Mun, Minmun, and circularized a Kerbal orbit outside of Minmun before returning home. The entire first attempt at launch went perfectly to plan. My deltaV calculations on the later stages had been spot on and I had about a third of a tank (my safety net) left over when I got back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/666830221538394608/2DD63EB98F0C8BE87C75639ED8FEE2AE6C0DD238/\u0022 alt=\u00222DD63EB98F0C8BE87C75639ED8FEE2AE6C0DD238\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest issue was that I had a lot more sensory equipment than was necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*It was more successful than this post which took multiple tries to get the picture included.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T20:07:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first rover delivery systems where way to much overengineerded, with the landing rocket in the way of the rover.

It took me a little bit of looking at the picture trying to follow fuel lines and figure out where everything was and went. That is definitely complicated. How far could you get that thing? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just built my second attempt at a rover depositor about five minutes ago, but I don\u0027t have time to test it because I have to go to work. My first attempt resulted in two rovers and the landing stage as debris in the Farside Crater (one of the Rovers did still mostly work but I realized the decoupler was still attached and was obstructing the piloting seat). I decided to scrap the design and start over entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat thing seriously worked? That\u0027s impressive.

I generally cant make top-down staging work even after a weekend in the VAB, balancing it and not ending up with an unflyable inverted pyramid is half the battle, think all my tries went to bits before 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy very first rocket went to minmus surface and back with a Kerbal. I immediately fell in love with the game and decided I was pro. Of course the following 50-odd designs failed hard until I learned some humility and started reading tooltips/doing sums. In my arrogance mk ii saved directly over the successful file and it was almost a realworld week before i hit 70km again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then plenty goes off without major hitch on the first launch.
