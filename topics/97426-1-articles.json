Many people have lots of fun designing by the numbers; even though I don\u0027t use procedural parts, I\u0027m generally one of them. But procedural parts confront someone with *mandatory* dealing with numbers, whereas fixed-size parts encourage playing around in a Lego-like manner. It\u0027s relatively simple to grasp tossing on another fuel tank, while procedural parts instead much more strongly encourage calculating the right value; it seems like Squad prefers having people snap together parts instead of having them calculate the correct value. Squad *normally* seems to prefer Lego-style; tweakables are numeric and would get you to modify an existing part instead of swapping it out or adding a new part, but other than that they seem to prefer swapping what parts you use over changing properties of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be nice from a strictly memory usage point of view would be to reuse textures more, or even implement parts as procedural under the hood while having fixed sizes that snap together. For instance, it\u0027d be neat to have normally fixed fuel tank sizes, which all reference the procedural tank but have fixed size. That way, they\u0027d only have the one model and texture, but would still have the Lego effect. They could also then put a modifiable procedural tank at the very end of the tech tree; that way, they\u0027d have the Lego style they seem to like, while not needing a ton of different parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T09:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s to reduce the learning courve.
