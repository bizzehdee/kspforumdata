Tweakscale drift issue is almost impossible to reproduce, so if you have a simple craft prone to it - post it here along with reproduction steps.\n\u003E \n\nSo I was able to reliably replicate the drifting of joints over several days of time warp with this stock, shoddily-put together rover with rotatrons and hinge.

There is a workaround for them to make it working. On one side of aircaft you can put bearing to 30 degree, while on the oposite side you can\u0027t put -30 degree, while it is posible to move it trough gui to that certain position, but you can\u0027t always be precise by clicking on arrow with mouse to move part.\n\nInstead to write down -30 degree, for any negative angle you should recalculate and write 360 - (desired oposite angle) as it is shown on this picture.\n\n![bD3Qcoy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bD3Qcoy.jpg)\n\nNote that pivatrons, on the other hand work in symetry as user expect - both have same value of 30 degree for rear pivatrons and 310 degree for front pivatrons.\n\nAlso, while I was working on that craft I encountered on several other issues, non of them are critical and please don\u0027t consider this as complain but rather as constructive criticism.\n\n- white color on parts, while it looks good, there moments in VAB/SPH that makes part difficult to use. If you hover mouse on part in IR GUI, it is hard to see which part is highlighted on craft due to white color. In combination with light in SPH, it also makes them too shiny. I have attached active strut target part somewhere inside bearing and after some rotation, repositioning in SPH, when I needed to move it, I could not see it inside bearing. I was forced to delete bearing, put new one and attach again strut target part. Leeson learned hard way.\n- I have bunch of free moving parts on that craft that have no need to be shown in flight. Maybe to have option to hide whole IR group on flight scene ? You can\u0027t see their values in flight, so it will help to make things more simple to use in flight. It s possible to put them in one group with active moving parts, but that make whole thing hard to customize in SPH editor. People create evenm more complicated things with IR that will appriciate such option\n- Maybe to add option to hide/reveal all parts in group in SPH GUI as it is in flight IR GUI ?\n- Many of other mods put their stuff in \u0022utility\u0022 section in group parts. There is only few parts from IR that are in utility section. in combination with other mods and stock parts it makes them difficult to find in that group. My personal opinion is that it will be better to put all things in IR group allong with other stuff or in another IR group, although there is no special need for another IR group, having all things on that one group will make editing craft easier.\n\nAlso, IR no longer cooperate well with blizzys toolbar, it gives some exceptions in log, probably because I tried to put icons on toolbar while I didn\u0027t have any IR part on craft. No big deal on it, stock toolbar does job well enough too.
