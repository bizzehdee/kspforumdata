I know, not very smart at all, but I never actually knew it existed until very recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not very good at KSP, so having a lander on Mun, and five satellites in orbit is a HUGE achievement and I really had a nice little set-up... for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had recently launched my fifth satellite, and was planning on moving a Kerbal from the lander can to the little chair on top of the satellite just for fun. I had EVA\u0027d before, but this time I got really disoriented and accidentally launched my smartest Kerbal into deep space. I could have just let him go, it wasn\u0027t that important but I wanted to get it right, so I googled the issue, and realized I could reload quicksaves. Right before the moment I sent my Kerbal into EVA, an autosave reminder had briefly flashed by the top right of my screen, so I reloaded quicksave... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight back to the first ship I ever tried to launch. All my ship builds are still there, but none of the Kerbals I hired exist, and none of the landers or probes were on the Mun or in orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis took quite a while, and it just kind of took the wind out of my sails to the point where I\u0027m planning on not continuing the game.

Supposedly you can reload autosaves by quitting and reloading but it brings me back to the quicksave at the start of my save.

It is very hard to get good at KSP, but that makes it all the more rewarding when you do finally achieve whatever your current goal may be. When I was learning the game I found it quite easy to get ships to Mun, but I crashed on every landing attempt for 4 straight days and began to wonder if I ever would figure it out. But I persisted, and now Mun landings are so easy that I test my new deep-space designs by landing them on Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Try something else for a while.

For all of us playing version 0.20, we lost everything with the release of 0.21. For me that included bases on Mun and Minmus, space stations around each, as well as a couple of space stations around Kerbin. Given that each of those took several launches to assemble, recreating them is going to be a lengthy business. But has it put me off the game, of course not. I just view it as an opportunity to make small improvements on the original designs as well as giving me reasons for launching several missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore trying to recreate your multiple satellite system, why not just create a \u0027Test\u0027 account and practise putting things in to orbit, as well as adjusting the orbit as necessary. Once you become comfortable doing that, launching several satellites in to orbit will become a piece of cake. Same goes with Mun landings. Start off with a simple lander with which to practise and as you become confident with your landings, you can move on to bigger things or maybe start learning how to land on a specific spot, essential if you ever want to put a base together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis feature should be better documented.
