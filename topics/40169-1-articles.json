I\u0027m Jose Aparicio and i have uploaded lots of stock cool craft in the spaceport. I even invented a new stock way of propulsion which is collision propelant you can check out my craft on the spaceport simply by searching josea74. My goal is to make as many cool stock craft to provide to the KSP community so they can share the same fun i have with my own craft. I consider myself a stock ksp aircraft designer lol.
