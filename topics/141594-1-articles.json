Fuel consumption is unchanged whether or not there is any storage for that electricity, and you can\u0027t turn the alternator off.

Considering the unavoidable losses that characterize this process, the result is that you would obtain electricity at the price of lower engine performances, and a lower burning time as well.

Some (or even most) of this waste heat can be converted for free into electricity with a simple heat engine. Alternately, some engines produce plasma, and that plasma must be kept away from the engine walls. The easiest way of doing that uses magnetic fields, and happens to produce a heck of a lot of electricity as a by-product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pretend that KSP uses the first method -- running waste heat from the refractory parts through a heat engine.

I agree with you, the SSME releases a huge amount of thermal power, and it is reasonable to think that the alternator removes an incredibly small fraction of this power in order to get electricity. But what happens if you move to smaller engines, and not necessarily rocket engines? I simply gave a theoretical explanation, and I suggest that, since KSP covers a large variety of engines, and since it allows users to make mods able to further expand it, the function to remove a small amount of thermal power and divert it to the alternator would be a nice one. If the developers are not interested in this, someone may create a plugin or something different, I don\u0027t know. Everyone is free to choose what to model and why. Of course, if you use only the F-1 engine for Saturn V rockets all this stuff is completely useless, but we are open-minded, and unfortunately our cars rely on smaller engines\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T03:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun fact: you can buy a camp stove called Biolite that burns twigs, and then uses the thermoelectric effect to generate electricity from that heat. \u00A0The electricity, in turn, runs a fan to intensify the fire. \u00A0It even generates a couple of surplus watts to charge a phone battery. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine the Kerbal engines work on vaguely similar technology - especially the Poodle, which (according to the in-game description)\u00A0doubles as a barbeque at low power. \u00A0Too bad we can\u0027t select twigs as a power source, but maybe that\u0027s what the \u0022solid fuel\u0022 is, anyway. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
