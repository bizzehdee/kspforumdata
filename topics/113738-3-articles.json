What does that bring to the table that couldn\u0027t have been achieved by just reducing the thermal mass of parts and calling the previous value surface temperature instead? Isn\u0027t this just going to further confuse players as to how the heat system is actually working when it was already fairly obtuse?\n\nSeems like a very strange thing for Squad to suddenly go realism crazy on given the number of abstractions present in the game in other areas, and without clear benefit to how the game plays. If anything, it seems like a step backwards that will make things less intuitive for players, and make the system more difficult to balance for Squad given the increased number of variables now involved.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T06:49:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 06:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"}]}
