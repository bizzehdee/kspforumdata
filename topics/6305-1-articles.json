That a zookeeper would be using a tranquiliser gun on a dinosaur, that a university conspiracy geek would invent a detection system and a means of locking the Anomalies, that a University professor would understand the complexities and behaviour of the Anomalies [temporal fault lines, flow of warm water creating steam, predicting the Anomalies, and of course, being the estranged husband of the show\\\u0027s antogonist (Helen Cutter)] all together made the show what it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you turn the entire thing into being professional - such as the majority of the ARC workers having military backgrounds, the computer operator with Hollywood-movie levels of unrealism with regards to how hacking works, making all the vehicles the same, and using a boring-looking building as a headquarters [unlike the old ARC, which actually looked iconic. I thought even the Home Office from Season 1 looked more in place.], it all becomes routine and monotonous, and you have to turn to more and more unrealistic or badly thought out plots to keep it vaguely interesting, which might appeal to some - just not those who really liked the first three seasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
