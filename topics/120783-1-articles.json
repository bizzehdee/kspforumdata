It\u0027s also doubtful the mods were the cause, as I see no way any of them could affect control input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was playing through a Jool-5 mission when I noticed my craft seemed to be spinning for no apparent reason. In an attempt to locate the source of the problem, I noticed that my power usage was a bit high, even after turning off SAS, so I wondered if the problem might be reaction wheels being wonky. Sure enough, after turning off all reaction wheels on the craft, my power usage went down and the spinning stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would appear my ship\u0027s getting yaw input for no apparent reason, even after turning off SAS.

I launched the Kerbal X to see if it was just that ship - sure enough, no phantom yaw. When I reverted the Kerbal X to the VAB, this is what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WdEem63.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WdEem63.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ... anyone have any idea what\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nope, quicksaving and quickloading doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: The VAB bug seems to work in mysterious ways. If the first save file I load is an infected one, it occurs and persists even after switching to clean save files, and if the first save file I load is a clean one, the VAB works fine and this persists even after switching to infected save files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 3: Ah yes.
