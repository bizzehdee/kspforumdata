Also having such a great range on the big scanners means you can start scanning sooner...not a big deal for kerbin orbit....but what about when your aerobraking Duna, Eve, or Lythe? Aerobraking can take a really long time to be done properly. Its nice to be able to be running the scanners during that period, even if you do cut out of range for a bit of the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMontgomery","CreatedById":68757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T03:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mihara\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mihara\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, I just had an idea.

The seismic shockwave that specially tuned explosion produces is used as an acoustic radar pulse, revealing in detail all the surface kethane deposits in something like 200-300km radius -- possibly with level of detail being reduced with distance. This permits one to map an entire planetary body in terms of kethane in just a few uses of the device, but on the other hand, requires sending much more complicated \u003Cem\u003E(and heavier, since that device would probably weigh a few tons)\u003C/em\u003E and non-reusable survey missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d be a nice mechanic to have for resource prospecting, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I can see where you\u0027re coming from on the wait for the time to scan, I recall suggestions that the scan mechanic make use of the persistent universe, and extrapolate mapping data based on the passage of time irrespective of whether the flight is active.
