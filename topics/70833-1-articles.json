Here I got a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I built a simple aircraft with twin engine, but once I reached about 23km, one engine started to lose trust power, but another engine continued to increase power, which caused the whole jet to spin like a gyroscope! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next time I tried to fly higher, when I reached 20km, I lowered the nose down, decreased the climb rate to around 20m/s, but the same thing happend, this time I see very clearly that engine 2 trust level power dropped directly around 10kN, then it began to lose power while engine no. 1 continued to increase power. I had to cut the trust level of both engine to idle, then easily increase both trust. After a while, engine No.2 stopped again and once more I did the same thing to regain control of the aircraft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I finally managed to reach 31km high, maintained stable altitude for several minutes, I still do not know why engine No.2 just keep losing power.

All I can recommend is more intake spam to boost up the total pool which will help the issue, but I normally have a single jet in the middle, then when the intake air gets too low I just kill my second and third engine and keep my middle engine running and since it now has the whole intake air pool to itself it can run for much longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_Black","CreatedById":103689,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T09:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I see..

One way, mentioned above, is to leave one jet engine along the thrust vector, and shutdown all other outboard jet engines, usually using action groups. (For fancy-pants multi-engine designs, you can shut off engines in pairs from outboard inward toward the center -- and like the suggesting party said above, with every engine shutdown [or flameout, as you\u0027ve discovered] the same \u0022pool\u0022 of IntakeAir becomes re-available to the still-running engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to address this is with onboard staging -- you can assign engines to various stages, and there even exists a \u0022stage\u0022 action group. (Just because it\u0027s a stage-activation doesn\u0027t mean you need a decoupler to decouple.) At high altitude, you can switch from jets to [other type of jets, perhaps ramjet, or to] rockets, for an SSTO ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo better understand the engine behavior, I recommend right clicking one or more of them at low altitude, and pay attention to all the complex-seeming numbers. None of those numbers is \u0022eye candy,\u0022 they ALL have an extremely specific purpose for being displayed. After a few test runs -- and one of the greatest things about .23.5, in my view, is that you can quicksave in atmosphere, allowing you to replay from the same point repeatedly -- you should be able to anticipate \u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E flameout becomes inevitable \u003Cem\u003Ejust before\u003C/em\u003E it actually occurs. Once you can identify it with the readouts, identifying it \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E the readouts will begin to become easier as well. Eventually, you\u0027ll be able to feel it happening just by the engine sound, throttle setting, and navball / altimeter readings. It is once you can do THAT, that \u0022designing around it\u0022 becomes the easiest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGod I love this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T16:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also use Mechjeb.

Whichever jet engine is placed last during building will be the first to flame out. When placing via symmetry, the mirrored part is considered \u0022last\u0022 and will flame out first. His tips about watching the aircraft nose are also good. In addition to watching the plane, you can also watch the trim indicators in the bottom left corner. When you see the yaw trim start to push out to one side, then it\u0027s time to throttle back some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb does have an auto throttle.
