Does it have to be something with out a probe core or control pod?\n\nIs there another way to bring smaller assemblies into a existing design.

I don\u0027t know what it was posted twice. Very odd.\n\n back to main topic: Armed with this knowledge I went on to redesign the probes and save them as sub-assemblies and then use then in dual, tri and quad adapter set ups (fore and aft) into various rockets. I think 4 will be the max for any one rocket.\n\nI am trying to keep things on the small side and perform multiple launches instead.\n\nThis success lead me to the next evolution in the probes. I reconfigured the nose of the probes to be a docking port Jr and added RCS. the idea being to be able to launch and recover the probes. \n\nAt first I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to mount a decoupler on the docking port jr so that the decoupler did not remain on the docking port after separation.

Then I moved on to using a low-power decoupler on the docking port end and that worked, but that means I have to put the return docking ports somewhere else.\n\nMy final evolution so far are long range LRP-type probes with extendable solar panels. My hope is to use them for initial exploration, etc. Plus I wanted to see just how much I could pack into a very small probe.\n\nMy biggest issue now is that octagonal struts are the essential back bone of the probes, so it is alt-F12 and turn of all heating in the physics tab and the ignore temp for none of my probes last for more than a few moments on the launch pad....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T22:40:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Major SNAFU**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T01:22:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This success lead me to the next evolution in the probes.

I can\u0027t imagine what you\u0027re doing incorrectly, so I\u0027m going to take a guess: Did you flip one of them around?

I never use them. I either use the Modular Girder pieces or the Cubic Octagonal Strut, or occasionally the I-beams.

You do not need a decoupler or separator, or even another docking port at all. You can affix the docking port on the subassebly straight to the bi-coupler. Then in space, right click the port and choose the decouple option.\n\n However, once decoupled, it can only re-couple with another docking port of equal size. Also, the engineering report will complain about it, ignore it.\n\nAs for attaching port to port in the VAB, it works, it\u0027s tricky.

I did have the docking ports in the correct orientation (facing each other) - so I will try the view-based approach suggested by Alshain.\n\n@5thhorseman re: octostruts - All I can report are the facts as they happen on my installations. I haven\u0027t had Kerbal that long (4 weeks), and there are other posts on the forum regarding sudden heating and explosions from far more experienced players than myself. What I have see is this: I have two careers going, one modded and one stock so I could compare them. I never had a \u0027random heating event\u0027 or \u0027sudden craft explosion\u0027 on a craft that had been in existence for a while until I progressed in both careers to the level where I had unlocked the octostruts and began to use them (to be fair, I also unlock other items at this same tech level at the same time). After that, in both careers, I began experiencing events where I would build a ship containing octostruts (because I had read how useful they are), would launch them and all would be well until you start using time acceleration - then I began loosing craft to explosions. (I posted in another thread with some details). In one instance, I have a probe 500 meters from the ground, chutes deployed, and it exploded within moments of going to 4X time acceleration. I reloaded many times and discovered that if I stayed at 3x or below, the probe never exploded. 4x, near instantaneous explosion. And in all of the cases I have had it, it was always an octostrut that had exploded. I happiness was taking a severe beating, so i searched toe forums and found many threads all on this topic. The more experienced people appeared to corroborate my findings, so I took the suggestion from one of the thread and activated ignore heat limit (or whatever it is called). However, I then found that if a craft overheated and I saved the game, then there was a good chance for an immediate explosion upon reload before I could turn off the heat stuff. So now, as soon as I load a save game, I turn on the ignore heat and also turn of the radiate, conduct, etc. heat in the physics tab. I would rather not - but I would rather play happy and without these than be frustrated with random explosions.\n\nIs it the octostrut? I honestly don\u0027t know. Read the other posts about exploding ships and see what you think. There is definitely something amiss, and it only appears (for me) once I unlock the octostruts and similar level tech nology. What I have tested thoroughly is building ships with only the lower tech levels after you unlock the higher ones and see if the problem exists there now where it didn\u0027t before.\n\nI can tell you that all of my mikro probes, which have multiple octostruts, will virtually all explode withing 30 seconds of my craft entering the launch pad. Nothing else explodes except the octostruts."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:54:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E Also, the engineering report will complain about it, ignore it.\n\nFrom personal experience; I\u0027ve found that to be a quick way to make an engineer *very* angry.
