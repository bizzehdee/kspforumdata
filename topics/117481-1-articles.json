It grows extremely fast in water, apparently it would only take about 6 liters of fluid per astronaut, in theory, to supply the opposite side of the Krebs cycle and keep the astronaut alive with food and oxygen. \n\nYour system would be simple. The urine and feces go into a tank where there is extremely high pressure, hot water that apparently will extremely rapidly break the waste down to the base molecules. (called supercritical water oxidation). The CO2 and minerals from that probably go through some ion traps to control levels of certain metals and then into the algae tank. \n\nThe algae tank is just a stainless steel tank full of water and bright grow lamp LEDs in the walls. The whole thing can be spun to stir the algae and remove it and keep an air-water interface. \n\nYou run the room air through a metal oxide bed, then heat up the metal oxide to release the CO2, which you also pump into the algae tank. You\u0027d probably do this in cycles, and once the CO2 concentration is low enough, you\u0027d spin the tank and suck the oxygen produced from the tank. Filter any residual CO2, then send that oxygen to storage bottles and ultimately back into the room. \n\nOk, so that\u0027s the basic system. Apparently the drawback of spirulina is that it produces too much nucleic acid. You would either genetically modify it to produce less by knocking out the genes. If that doesn\u0027t work (the nucleic acid may be a critical part of the cell biology for spirulina), you\u0027d dig up a biological enzyme that breaks down nucleic acid and produce it in a separate tank using e-coli. (you would separate the enzyme with centrifuges and add it to each batch of algae goop at harvest time)\n\nWhat about taste and nutrition balancing? This would be simple genetic engineering, stuff you could do in a hackerspace at the new DIY biology labs in LA. You insert genes behind a promoter for some key stage of the algae\u0027s growth cycle that code for some form of carbohydrate. You\u0027d insert genes for the amino acids you want to increase the concentrations of. You\u0027d insert genes for vitamin C. (or make it via e-coli in a separate tank)\n\nWhere it gets really cool is you could make several strains of the algae. One strain is carbohydrate heavy, another is lipid heavy (maybe make the same lipids that are in fish oil!), another is protein heavy, and another one is very sweet or has a certain flavor protein. You might actually have 10 or more separate flavoring strains, similar to those Coke machines at restaurants that can make any coke product by combining different base syrups and additives. \n\nThe whole system would be a machine about the size of 3 or so vending machines. It would have the 5-10 different strains in different tanks, each on a growth and harvest cycle. When it comes to harvesting, each tank would be spun enough to pump fluid out. The fluids from the tanks for the \u0022recipe\u0022 would go into a high speed centrifuge that would remove most of the water. The resulting goop would be pressed into molds, and probably heated to remove the remaining water and maybe bake it. You might add binding agents produced via some natural process to make the resulting algae bar \u0022stick\u0022 together. \n\nA crewmember would go up to the machine and press his or her thumb on the reader. (or the reader would read an RFID tag implanted in them) The machine would eject a custom algae bar for that particular crew member, using data such as their activity level, current weight and fat levels, gender, age, etc. It would also let you choose between various flavoring combos to mask the slimy taste of algae. Maybe orange or cherry or nut flavor, etc. \n\nSound possible? I think this is now possible with current tech, albeit it would require some significant funds to develop a reliable system. You\u0027d want to build dozens of these and test them on Earth. Maybe we\u0027ll see them installed in a university dorm somewhere...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T20:52:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T21:11:11Z","Content":"Interesting concept.

If you produce enough food, you produce enough oxygen. Supposedly it only takes 6 liters of fluid. \n\nWhat I like about it is that it\u0027s *light*. This has potential. You could really fit this into an interplanetary rocket on a long journey, one using a high ISP drive system where the propellant tanks and the drive itself are most of the mass.\n\nWith these kinds of engineering requirements, you\u0027d really be living in a tin can. This lightweight life support system. Carbon fibers and thin metal plates and spaced meteorite armor (whipple shielding). If the habitat were spinning, it would probably be 2 or 4 dumbbell shaped modules, spinning on a single access tunnel that is laced with carbon fibers (since the main structural stress would be tension along the access tunnel). The reason to have 4 modules instead of 2 is to make it so you can spin up and down by just counter rotating the 2 sets of modules. Since the net angular momentum of the spacecraft is still zero (2 sets of modules the same mass spinning opposite directions) you do not have to consume any propellant to do this, just electricity to run the motors to spin the modules. \n\nAll the computers would be ultrathin tablet screens, with the CPU hardware a tiny stick about the size of a thumb drive. Every bit of fixtures and furnishings would be the lightweight solution.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T21:17:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T21:26:14Z","Content":"6 liters per astronaut, that\u0027s great!

(2) It is small. (3) It is cheap. (4) It is light. (5) It can be built very quickly. (6) It is very flexible in purpose (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Comnibus reactor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2). (7) Very little development is required.

It is not being built now.*\n\n*On the other hand, a practical reactor plant can be distinguished by the following characteristics: (1) It is being built now. (2) It is behind schedule. (3) It is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items. Corrosion, in particular, is a problem. (4) It is very expensive. (5) It takes a long time to build because of the engineering development problems. (6) It is large. (7) It is heavy.

Nevertheless, this appears to be the form the solution should be in. I\u0027m not saying it would be easy - I honestly think the pricetag to get to a working, reliable system might be measured in billions - but a tank of fluid of minorly genetically modified algae sounds a lot easier to engineer into a closed system than a tray of terrestrial plants growing in hydroponics or real soil."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:14:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\u003E Ok, so that\u0027s the basic system.

Gout is caused by uric acid, which is already a breakdown product of nucleic acid and (in mammals) is actually the final breakdown product - uric acid (as you could probably guess from the name) is excreted in urine. You \\*could\\* add an enzyme to break it down to [allantoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allantoin) but I\u0027m not sure whether eating quantities of allantoin is a great idea either. Also culturing proteins in quantity is not a trivial task and I don\u0027t imagine it will be made any easier in zero-g.

Or I could be wrong, I\u0027m a roboticist, not a biologist.
