Looks more like a kite than a plane, which has somewhat of a deteriorating effect on the handling without a payload at high altitude, but with the payload she flies nicely up to almost 18K. Reasonable cruising altitude is between 14K and 15K at which height it goes about 650m/s so it takes a fairly long time to get to the peninsula as you can\u0027t warp this thing at all at risk of rapid unplanned disassembly and she needs continuous flightpath maintenance, so there\u0027s no doing something else, you gotta pay attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of the crappy flight caracteristics, she does perform a lot of jobs admirably, though destroying the VAB with this payload isn\u0027t going to happen.

Due to KSP crashing I didn\u0027t get around to filling 6 and only got to 4, but you get the picture when you review the album. Just drive the cart with payload under one of the many docking ports and raise the landing gears to atach it, drop the gear again and detach the cart, drive it back to the replacement payload and repeat.
