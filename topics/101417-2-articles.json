Looks more like a kite than a plane, which has somewhat of a deteriorating effect on the handling without a payload at high altitude, but with the payload she flies nicely up to almost 18K. Reasonable cruising altitude is between 14K and 15K at which height it goes about 650m/s so it takes a fairly long time to get to the peninsula as you can\u0027t warp this thing at all at risk of rapid unplanned disassembly and she needs continuous flightpath maintenance, so there\u0027s no doing something else, you gotta pay attention.\n\nRegardless of the crappy flight caracteristics, she does perform a lot of jobs admirably, though destroying the VAB with this payload isn\u0027t going to happen. Even kamikaze style direct hit flight didn\u0027t destroy the vab, but maybe that\u0027s because it\u0027s not career mode? I don\u0027t know, I recoded a full on direct hit of the entire payload and that didn\u0027t do it.\n\nBecause of the design it\u0027s possible to field-rearm the complete payload minus 2 bombs. (I didn\u0027t build the cart right, it might be possible to replace the frontmost 2 bombs, but this cart didn\u0027t do it.) Which is a whopping 30 bombs. Due to KSP crashing I didn\u0027t get around to filling 6 and only got to 4, but you get the picture when you review the album. Just drive the cart with payload under one of the many docking ports and raise the landing gears to atach it, drop the gear again and detach the cart, drive it back to the replacement payload and repeat. Works a charm, but having over 1000 parts in physics is not helpfull for KSP-stability.\n\nScoring:\n\nMore BOOM: (32 - 6) \\* 12 = 312 points\n\nSwift Payback: 103m/s \\* 0.1 = 10.3 points\n\nEngine maintenance: 8 turbojets \\* 4 = -32 points\n\nPart maintenance: 532 part \\* 0.02 = -10.64 points\n\nDestroy VAB: Fail\n\nCareer switch: Succes = 20 points\n\nService ceiling: 15K = 15 points\n\nField refueling: Succes = 10 points\n\nField rearming: Succes = 20 points\n\nOperational ability: 5 points\n\nTotal: 312 \u002B10.3 -32 -10.64 \u002B20 \u002B15 \u002B10 \u002B20 \u002B5 = 349.66 points (350 points rounded)\n\nFun Challenge!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
