So if you place 6 radial decouplers, they will stay as a group of six, you can split them between stages.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just a really nice QoL Update I would hope to see before we start getting large content packages.

As it stands, doing asparagus staging is highly manual (needing to pause when fuel in one set of radial engines runs out, then finding the correct decouplers, then decoupling them, then unpausing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
