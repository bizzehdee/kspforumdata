After first flyby you should end up with ~11mln km Pe and ~30mln km Ap. It\u0027s very easy to calculate if your orbital period is exactly 2x Kerbin orbital period: Time to Ap less Time to Pe should equal 213d, 1h. You can make 1 hour error. Second flyby will be enough to raise your Ap to Jool orbit. Of course you will need some tweaking between two flybys: first to set your flyby on the proper position of Kerbin (dark side, bright side) to increase your velocity instead of decreasing, second to set proper Kerbin Periapsis: 500-600km should be enough, litle less and you will set your Aphelium too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviosuly the arrival time of your first Kerbin flyby have to be exactly 213 days before the middle of launch window from Kerbin to Jool.

I know a guy who can calculate this on his own (Von Ziegendorf, he has an account on this forum) but I\u0027m using Flyby Finder. It\u0027s pretty useful tool to plan single flyby like Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin but unfortunately it has no abilities to calculate double flybys and deep space maneuvers (Cassini, Juno). Also there is no possibility to go efficiently to Jool/Jupiter using single Eve/Venus or Duna/Mars flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is full instruction how to use it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP-V0-60\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP-V0-60\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s assume that 512 day is good launch window to Jool. 512d - 213d, 1hour = 299d It means that your first Kerbin flyby have to be on 299 day. So go to the Flyby Finder and find Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin trajectory with Kerbin arrival on the 299 day. FF will show you Kerbin departure date, inclination of your parking orbit (yes, you will go into inclined orbit), prograde delta V of your transfer burn, Eve arrival date and closest encounter, then Kerbin arrival (it should be on 299 day)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elook, here is good example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pDaFoij.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pDaFoij.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh Vz mean that you will start from highly inclined orbit (18 degrees in this case)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see the second arrival is 299,01 day, you need to perform flyby to get orbital period 213d after it. So your second Kerbin flyby will be 299\u002B213 = 512 day. And the 512 day is launch window to Jool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how the full trajectory should look:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C6e34Wu.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/C6e34Wu.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PTq3fj8.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/PTq3fj8.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously your first burn will be never 100% accurate, so you need little tweaking to get accurate Eve encounter date and Eve Periapsis. It\u0027s best to set up the radial and prograde velocities while 180 degrees from the target and normal velocities while 90 degrees from your destination.
