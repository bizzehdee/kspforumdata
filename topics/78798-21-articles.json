On Earth we have liquid water, plate tectonics, and most importantly life. All of these combine to create a plethora of useful, chemically active, and easy to access resources that simply won\u0027t be easily available on other planets. While other planets will also have materials, they will be less diverse, and in general less useful. I\u0027m going to try to summarize below in overly simplified terms (any fellow astrophysicists, geologists, etc. please forgive me as I\u0027m going to knowingly cut certain corners in the interest of brevity..I\u0027m not going to delve into Chlorine isotope ratios in the Lunar regolith, and such!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Liquid water allows for the dilution of various minerals which wouldn\u0027t otherwise mix, creating useful compounds and molecules in abundance which otherwise would be much rarer and more difficult to access. Mixing different elements often yields more useful materials than the base constituents. For an example everyone is familiar with, Iron is great! It\u0027s the primary constituent of all the rocky planets. It\u0027s easy to work with and plenty useful (that\u0027s why we have a whole \u0022Age\u0022 named after it). But combine Iron with a touch of carbon and now you\u0027re got something truly impressive (Steel). Less water = less dilution and mixing = less useful materials. Another great example is salt. Without liquid water (primarily rain), all the salt would still be trapped in rock, and thus inaccessible to most forms of life. Dissolved in water, salt can interact with other materials to create a million and one useful compounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unlike Mars let\u0027s say, the Earth is still geologically active. Meaning that the crust is constantly being renewed, and mixed with the molten interior. This allows for not only continuous mixing (see previous point), but also for material to be brought up from big depths. For example, diamonds. They are very useful in industry. Mars, which was only briefly geologically active, is likely to have some diamonds, but the vast majority of it will be buried so deep that it\u0027s effectively inaccessible because there hasn\u0027t been any volcanoes, or tectonic plate motions to bring diamonds up to the surface in ~3.5 billion years. Earth has been churning up stuff from the depths for 4 billion years..Mars only did it for about an eighth of that time. Ditto for Gold, or silver. Highly useful industrially but so rare that without geological activity to concentrate them you\u0027d never locate them in sufficient abundance to be useful. You\u0027d probably have to dig up a city-sized crater on the moon to get a thimble of gold. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And most importantly LIFE. The key requirement of life is that it must be able to store and transform energy in various forms (hurray for mitochondria!!). For all its complexity, life essentially takes energy from the environment (mostly the sun), uses some of it, and leaves the rest behind when it dies in chemically active compounds. No life=no oil, coal, or PLASTICS, etc. Rock is just rock, until life gets a hold of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just because we have lots of useful materials on Earth, doesn\u0027t mean we should expect to find the same abundances easily accessible on other planets. It\u0027s not simply a matter of learning how to use native resources on other planets, we simply won\u0027t have the breadth of useful, easily accessible materials we have on Earth. This is one aspect of space exploration that is almost always overlooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think it is quite possible for a thousand human beings to exhaust one or more necessary resources on a planetary body to the point of inaccessibility. Especially if they\u0027re going to try building complex machines like rockets and Kerbitats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple example is water on the Moon. On Earth, water is embedded in the rock. Even in the magma. It was volcanism which allowed it to escape into the atmosphere. Now the moon was most likely formed through a collision with another body. It is essentially earth rock. However that rock was molten, shattered into a billion pieces (with vast surface area) and exposed to vacuum which resulted in all the water \u0022evaporating\u0022. As a result, the moon is bone dry. All the water has been lost to space. There\u0027s just tiny amounts leftover in crater walls at the poles (where sunlight never reaches it), and that is most likely just the condensation that is left over from the interaction between solar wind (which contains hydrogen) and the moon\u0027s surface regolith (which contains oxygen). In other words, it takes a very long time to produce even minute amounts of water that might actually stick to the surface and not simply be lost to space. The amount of water that we might eventually mine from the Moon\u0027s poles is quite paltry indeed. I really don\u0027t know the total numbers, I don\u0027t think anyone does. But it\u0027d be pretty hard for me to imagine us sustaining a permanent colony of more than a thousand people or so on the Moon with the water available there, even assuming perfect homeostatis. Especially if you want to set up industry on the Moon, as that water will be pretty much the only room temperature liquid you\u0027ll find up there and you\u0027ll probably end up using 95% of it in industrial processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr think about it another way. Let\u0027s take Neodymium..It\u0027s in everything from your head phones to your hard drive (both SSD, and the old-school spinners). On earth its abundance is only about 33 parts per million by weight, and it\u0027s actually one of the most common \u0022Rare\u0022 earth metals. It\u0027s about 10,000 times more common than gold, or about 10 times more common than Tin..On Earth. Like other rare earth metals, it only occurs at sufficiently high abundances to be profitable in Carbonatites which generally form where tectonic plates separate (thank you plate tectonics!). By contrast, Neodymium\u0027s solar system abundance is only about 3 parts per BILLION. Or, about 10,000 times less common than it is on Earth. And you can sure bet that without plate tectonics to concentrate it in Carbonatites it\u0027d be even more difficult to mine than on Earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the real question we gotta ask, is just how much of the Moon\u0027s surface would a thousand Kerbals have to dig up just to make sure each of them had an \u0022kphone\u0022??? Not even talking about building spacecraft on the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, I think that finite resources, and especially resources that are only available on certain planets is a perfectly reasonable state of affairs for KSP. A balance must be struck between fun and realism, but that balance is much further away from realism right now than most people realize with respect to mods like MKS, Kethane, or EL (all of which I use and love). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I really appreciate all the effort you guys go through to make these mods. And I have a feeling that with ORS you\u0027d have a hard time implementing finite resources because ORS is just not structured for it with those PNGs. But, if you happen to think of an easy way to implement something like that I know I would be very appreciative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I apologize again for my overly lengthy response. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I know that many people believe that the water on the Moon is from cometary impacts, but I think now-a-days most planetary scientists would agree that the solar wind theory fits the measurements better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nowater","CreatedById":115217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T05:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei dont find the 1,25m in techtree \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo u ever sleep?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mkrco","CreatedById":115706,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T05:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nismobg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nismobg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr maybe IN some cases as this mod is super modular , Just single type resources can be set for various planets.
