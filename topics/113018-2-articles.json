I\u0027ve fleshed out the resource system to come full circle using dust, ore, and virtual particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now introduced a ton of new parts including nuclear reactors, magnetic cooling units, various dust parts, and much much more! I specified reactors and magnetic coolers for a reason, they both increase or decrease their own and thermal levels, so now its possible for things beyond engines to overheat. So while reactors produce power and a lot of heat, magnetic coolers can chill themselves and adjacent parts effectively. All reactors have a built-in cooling system, but they\u0027re only meant as buffer while running. Another tip for using reactors is that they need electricity to start up, so no power means no reactor start up. The largest reactor is referred to as a Nuclear Forge because not only does it produce power, it can also forge virtual particles into dust for later use, also at the cost of a lot of power. Dust can now also be draw out of atmospheres using catalytic engines or the new dust accumulator that requires constant power to work. From there, dust can compressed into ore or even have xenon extracted from it. Of course there\u0027s a bunch of new tanks for all this stuff. Containment Tanks hold both dust and virtual particles, but they require constant power of else they\u0027ll leak virtual particles until empty. Spherical Tanks only hold dust, not much more about that. There\u0027s a handful of new engines too, radial versions of the Q thruster and Catalytic engine, and also a thermal compression jet. The radial Q thruster is a perfect efficiency engine that only needs electricity to run, though a lot of it. The radial Catalytic engine doesn\u0027t draw dust from the atmosphere, but instead is half liquid-electric rocket and half Q thruster. The thermal compression jet is a more conventional version of the fusion scramjet, so it can be used without oxygen and is useful and less than break-neck speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the parts have been reorganized in the tech node requirements along with various attachment node resizing to more appropriate.
