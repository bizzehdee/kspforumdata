That is how RTGs work IRL, after all... they look the way they do because they have cooling fins on them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, I suspect this has more to do with the fact that any generic part in KSP is far better at getting rid of heat than IRL spacecraft are. The Apollo spacecraft was coated in a mirror finish top to bottom to deflect the largest amount of sunlight possible, and it still required a few active radiators to maintain comfortable temperatures for all components. Meanwhile a huge wall of uncoated structural plates in KSP will still cool down below sea level temperature once in orbit, even in full direct sunlight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLarge tanks in KSP radiate so much heat energy away in space even at low body temperatures that making them receive all the heat of a RTG probably doesn\u0026#39;t even affect their overall temperature by more than 1 or 2 degrees.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T08:25:56Z","Content":"\nI have a space station with 16 RTG around Vall / Dres / Eeloo.

Such that they reach equilibrium just a bit above ambient. They don\u0026#39;t actually require any active cooling.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m not sure (and can\u0026#39;t check at the moment), but I think RTG CoreHeat might even be thermally isolated from radiators.
