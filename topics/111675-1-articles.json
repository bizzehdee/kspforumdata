Not even enough to keep the probe alive. Can someone confirm this? Eve is closer to the sun than Kerbin, so the panels should put out more power, not less, right?\n\nOr are panels now atmosphere-sensitive and Eve thicks atmo is blocking sunlight?\n\n![OkokT3c.png](http://i.imgur.com/OkokT3c.png)\n\n(Exposure: 0.87, Energy Flow: 0.02)\n\nWell, i guess i am not going to transmit all that precious sience ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T17:37:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SirJodelstein**\n  \nAnswered \u002B Exposure typo"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T22:57:18Z","Content":"I would guess Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere is preventing the panels from receiving very much solar energy, but I haven\u0027t tried an eve landing since 1.0 so I can\u0027t confirm.

I had the same thing happen, but I had slightly bigger panels, so I would slowly gain electricity. As I was transmitting, my electricity went down. When it reached 0, It started to build up again. Then, at a certain level of power, it got drained away from transmitting. The only reason I had the same thing happen on Duna is because Duna is further out."},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:36:41Z","Content":"Thanks for all the answers.
