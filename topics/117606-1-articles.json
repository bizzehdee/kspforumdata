Nevertheless:\n\nRefurbishing SRB is more complicated than just producing fuel (as already said by others), so this should be not simple doable. With a more complicated part than the ISRU unit this might be ok, but there is no reason for it, as SRB are worse in every aspect than fluid engines but for costs for initial launch. If one day mechanics is included to construct new parts on-site, SRB would be a good candidate for it, because constructing SRB is simpler than constructing other engines.
