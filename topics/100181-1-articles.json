Instead of overcoming regular boring obstacles, such as \u0022lack of fuel\u0022 and \u0022not enough wings for the too heavy aircraft\u0022, a brilliant Kerbal in the back of the room suggested, \u0022why not just carry another bomber?\u0022 Thus began the idea of craft-ception, putting one craft inside another craft.\n\nBUT WAIT! There\u0027s more! The engineers took this concept to the next level, developing a bomber small enough that could fit withing the Mk. 2 cargo bays, which in turn could be carried inside the Mk. 3 cargo bays!!!\n\nThus, I present to you, **a bomb carrying bomber within a bomber within a bomber**!!!\n\nThe large bomber taking off (rocket assisted):\n\n![JN8g9XG.png](http://i.imgur.com/JN8g9XG.png)\n\nThe large bomber releasing the medium bomber:\n\n![h3op5qG.png](http://i.imgur.com/h3op5qG.png)\n\nThe medium bomber in-flight:\n\n![7wBAZoW.png](http://i.imgur.com/7wBAZoW.png)\n\nThe medium bomber releasing the small bomber:\n\n![YOm754O.png](http://i.imgur.com/YOm754O.png)\n\nThe small bomber in-flight:\n\n![T7lHa7q.png](http://i.imgur.com/T7lHa7q.png)\n\nThe small bomber releasing the bomb (the bomb detached too fast for a pic):\n\n![1KZXj0X.png](http://i.imgur.com/1KZXj0X.png)\n\nThe small bomb in flight:\n\n![y8wo9Rc.png](http://i.imgur.com/y8wo9Rc.png)\n\nI am curious to see if/what others have done in this regard. (I think it would be awesome to fit something like this monstrosity within ANOTHER larger cargo bay from a mod!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T06:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 06:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpenSpaceCorp**"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T06:41:15Z","Content":"Cool!"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T06:48:29Z","Content":"Yeah, but that\u0027s not a bomb.\n\nIt\u0027s a missile!

The cargo bay gives a nice reference for lining everything up.
