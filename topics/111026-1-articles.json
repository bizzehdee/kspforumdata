My problem is when it comes to launching them.\n\nAs soon as the craft is loaded onto the tarmac, the screen goes black. I still have my HUD, and can move controls around. I can even activate my engines, adjust throttle ... etc. The problem is that the screen is pure black.\n\nIf I revert the launch to any previous stage, and re-launch the craft, I get a view of the galaxy, and I\u0027m in outer space. Can\u0027t do anything, other than look at that skybox of the galaxy. I can move the camera around, but that\u0027s about it.\n\nThe biggest problem with this bug is that it happens at launch. After the craft is loaded, and right before it hits the airstrip. I can\u0027t do anything about it, I can\u0027t even launch any missions this way.\n\nWould anyone, please, be able to help me figure out what\u0027s going on?\n\nMy processor is an i5 2.53 Ghz Intel\n\nMy graphics card is an NVIDIA NVS 3100M.\n\nI\u0027d be happy to supply any other information you guys might need.\n\nEDIT: \n\n![vN0F3H1.png](http://i.imgur.com/vN0F3H1.png)\n\nThat\u0027s what it looks like for me.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nafter much testing, and removing of mods. So far, it seems that Romfarer Lazor Systems is the one crashing MY set up. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the same for the rest of you, but I think there\u0027s a compatibility issue with either Lazor Systems, or Lazor weapons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T20:13:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by IraqiWalker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacedweller","CreatedById":116552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:33:11Z","Content":"I get the exactly same things.

In fact, I cycled through installing the game, adding a few mods at a time, getting it to crash, uninstalling, rinse repeat for almost a full day, until I vetted out my mods.It turns out that Romfarer Lazor Systems, and Lazor weapons is the one that does it for me.\n\nI thought it was clashing with BD armory, so I removed BD armory, and tried with just the Lazor mods. The game immediately went back to malfunctioning.
