As stated earlier in the thread, though, I\u0027m well aware of the math. Not to be a complete tw@t but I happen to have a degree in aerospace engineering with a minor in astrophysics. This was very clearly an homage to Mr. Lucas and not an exercise in optimal spacecraft design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do enjoy the prospect of a more aesthetically appealing 2.5m NERVA (not to mention the reduced part count). My desire to remain stock save the engineer mod stayed my hand, though.

I will admit I\u0027m no KSP master so the launch vehicles could have been better designed and are not the easiest to fly. I disable gimbles on the outer asparagus stages to prevent rotation and do a lot of manual spin and attitude correction. I throttle down to around 75% after the second set of boosters is dropped because the structural integrity is also lower with the loss of those stages and their support structure. Remember to start that gravity turn around 10km! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should have extra fuel. Mine ended up in about 200km orbit after circularizing.
