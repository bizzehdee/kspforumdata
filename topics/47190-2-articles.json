Some of your EVA work may already be done for you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually tried this exact same thing 2 days ago, and couldn\u0027t get it to work. It even looks like he did the exact same thing...the file screenshot looks exactly like mine, except I put all the shared assets into a \u0022common\u0022 folder and tried loading things from there. I\u0027ll dig out my own files and keep working on them that way also, but the two test models I looked at were both pretty borked, and I assumed what Greys said in that threat, that model is only a sub-function of PART. Somn demonstrated different though, and now I need to figure out why/how. I may have just coincidentally picked the two to test that he also said were borked. Between texture reduction and this method, the \u0022Spaces\u0022 folder could become very squished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027ll take those back out of my archive and mess with them. The texture re-makes are done, but I think I\u0027ll hold off until I can figure that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E===================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see where the memory thing happens, but using his pack just removes all my internal spaces entirely. Using dummy .mbm\u0027s like he does with my own config files just gives me blue parts instead of white parts. There was another guy that said that it would work on my own mod pre-release post, and he never got back to me afterwards to say if he could get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScratch the dead again comment...its now working again...until it doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-03T02:24:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2013 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T02:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBRILLIANT!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something Squad should have been doing for some time now.

Apparently Spaces need them while regular parts don\u0027t when you change the texture pointers with the \u0022Model\u0022 line command set. Going one space at a time now, and testing thoroughly. I should have another 200mb shaved off tomorrow or Friday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-03T19:08:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2013 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
