Borrowing against an appreciating asset is perfectly reasonable (house, education, etc.) but borrowing against a depreciating asset (car, etc.) is a terrible idea. Since KSC facilities allow you to run larger and longer missions that pay better, the facilities are potentially an appreciating asset (assuming you use them properly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reputation hit would come from failure to repay the loan, not that the loan is taken out in the first place. In fact, the only real way to increase your credit rating is to borrow and repay responsibly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interesting game dynamic in KSC is that you quite quickly move from missions that take no more than a few days to ones that take a year or more. Borrowing to get to Mun or Minmus is almost a no-brainer, but borrowing to get to Duna will likely bankrupt you fairly quickly if you use the warp button because the mission is going to take a year to complete (though it does provide a new incentive to transmit science data back home rather than wait months to deliver it.) OTOH, if you borrow to initiate your Duna mission, you may need to use the time in transit to run shorter-duration missions to keep cash-flow going until that one pays off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut short, the warp button demonstrates how unrealistic the in-game payment system is. Nobody would take a contract for 100K that takes a year to execute when you can take one for 50K that takes a day to execute. But the contract system alleviates the need for most borrowing after the first few days as the contract advances can fill that gap if you\u0027re careful about what you take. Before I took my first Mun mission I grabbed two contracts that paid 600K\u002B and gave 100K\u002B advances. That allowed me to upgrade launchpad and unlock parts to initiate the missions, and then enough payoff on completion to upgrade tracking station, astronaut complex, and some other buildings to make the Mun mission pretty easy (unlock EVA, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem you need to consider is the late game impact of payroll. How much cash will you need to have to launch a Jool mission and make payroll, or will you never be able to warp because you need to keep running other missions (and will there be enough short-term missions to do that?). Not sure how the contract system works late game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for that scenario, you might want to look at Kerbal Alarm Clock to to stop warp when you\u0027re about to run out of money or some such. Slipping and hitting 10k warp instead of 100k could be a game-ending error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Musuko42","CreatedById":130405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T00:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJohnsonwax, as you say: you\u0027d need to run shorter missions whilst waiting for the long ones to complete, which is my hope for this mod. It means that long missions ARE long, in gameplay terms...rather than just exactly the same as short missions, but with more fast forwarding. You wouldn\u0027t be able to just fast-forward and get the instant science payoff.
