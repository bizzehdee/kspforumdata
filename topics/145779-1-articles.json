I\u0027ve pieced together a small research outpost on Minmus (already heavily modded, the outpost mostly uses \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E colonization\u00A0parts) which first only jumped a small bit upon loading. I didn\u0027t think too much about it initially, because I misplaced two Gypsum drills s.t. they lift up one part of the outpost anyway, but over time, the jumping got worse, and the last time I loaded the outpost, it completely flipped over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tabbed out of the game and closed it forcefully because building the outpost was unexpectedly difficult (yeah... I suck at outpost building...) und I don\u0027t want to lose it to a glitch. Anyway, does somebody know a mod which can prevent this behavior?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDestroyer111","CreatedById":160216,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T16:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you mean Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (KJR)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceK","CreatedById":147100,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T16:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it would only reinforce joints for some reason, but the description looks good.
