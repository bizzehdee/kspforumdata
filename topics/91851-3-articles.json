Once again, SQUAD proposes something, we rip it apart and then they propose something better. This shows the system works and SQUAD are doing a good job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060d like it if they made the stat affect how *quickly* the kerbal turned the ship toward the desired marker, or rather how much force (or percentage of available force) they used trying to do that. Maybe it could start at 75% and work to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would mean that, yes a kerbal with a low stat would still be able to face prograde and in most circumstances there would not be a noticable difference but if say in the atmosphere and your craft is trying to be turned away from the desired node by the air, a pilot with more skill could combat that force a little more than a pilot with low skill, even if they can both face prograde. If your craft is not symmetrical then a pilot with a higher stat could control the craft at a slightly higher thrust before wandering off prograde and so forth. Nothing too dramatic but a difference based on the stat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea that different probe cores would have different pilot skills. This is a must IMHO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always said there was place in the stock game for parts of MechJeb and now they have started appearing.
