That mods DR. Under that condition, I found with DR 6.1 and 6.2 I couldn\u0027t fly a Kerbin polar orbit mission as they always burned up. The 6.3 beta fixed that, but then it allowed the 1.25m heatshield to survive a 3500m/s Mun return reentry. Until FlowerChild, the author of BTSM, has another look at BTSM and DR when he gets to doing a KSP 0.90 version, with BTSM in KSP 0.25 I\u0027m using DR 6.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T19:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kvakosavrus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kvakosavrus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t work either.

How high an orbit or how fast were you going on reentry? Are you saying you expected it to be hotter than 1100 or that you expected things to start blowing up at 1100? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, DRE caps the highest maxTemp at 1250, so things wouldn\u0027t burn up at 1100 anyway.

Perhaps another mod os interfering? Try those settings with just FAR and DRE and see if you get the heating. Also post your output_log file so Starwaster can help you out a little more.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt probably is worth mentioning that not operating with FAR, NEAR or SDF would definitely cause a more deceleration.

DRE doesn\u0027t know or care if stock aerodynamics are in play or not....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as log files, that really only is useful if there are errors being generated that prevent DRE from working. Knowing things like velocity, what sort of build, what DRE settings is more helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow then, I\u0027ve found a problem in that code that prevents the temperature cap from being fully applied to the entire parts database. This means that some parts will have maxTemps higher than 1250 (even up to or past 3000). I\u0027m going to post a temporary hotfix shortly as a replacement dll drop-in until I can do a better fix.
