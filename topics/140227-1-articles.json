Clarke talks about experimenting with all sorts of ammonium nitrates in his (out of print) book \u0022Ignition!\u0022, which you can find as a free PDF download around the web. He examined them for use as a monopropellant, and found them to be good candidates energy-wise, but sadly possessing unfortunately limited temperature tolerances that nobody would buy (they freeze way too easily in space).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the idea is at least 40 years old, I\u0027m not sure what AF-M315E does differently today. Maybe they have found or synthesized a new additive that drops the freezing point way down, which was not available to Mr. Clarke. Or maybe he just never looked at the hydroxyl variant; he never mentions it by name anywhere. Though it is unlikely, considering that he reports testing a wide variety, and repeatedly expounds how reliably a trained propellant chemist can guesstimate the usefulness of a substance as a propellant just from one glance at its structural formula. Or maybe the propellant was discarded for yet different reasons, such as there being no suitable catalyst for it, or it being too aggressive to the engine, which modern science has managed to fix. Or maybe the poor temperature tolerance was simply no longer a problem - perhaps the tanks have simply gained heating elements.

To counter this you would need a larger bell and including the problem of reactive disintegration of the fuel. You would need further isolation of the fuel lowering the heat and pressure. One reason to use hydrogen is that it deionizes it very inefficiently degrades the metals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen those\u00A0hyperglolic\u00A0passes by the radioisotope which has a peak temp of 4000k it will not be in its final form. First it becomes :C: H H: H. O: .N:, and all sorts of variants therof, bi-\u00A0and triatomic\u00A0species. As these species accelarate the lose their energy of ionization and they combine. The total mass of the hyperglolic doesn\u0027t matter, howver the bell shape and reaction chamber will matter. That is a benefit with hydrogen, it only has 2 electrons in its molecular orbital and one in its atomic natural outer shell, when you spilt there are only a few species of known mass. This gives you a better means of optimizing design. But ISP on an NTR is due to heat transfer oer unit time to fuel mass, total. So that whatever fuel you have, if you provide the contact area to heat, ionize that fuel so that it ultimately accelerates you can achieve that exhaust velocity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA third issue is the absorption\u00A0emmision frequencies of hydrogen, being fewer in the fact that you can accelerate hydrogen with rf. The means that if your vessel has solar panels, you can add rf to that systems and control in the\u00A0ions much more easily than if you have alot spectrum to control. The problem with all of this is that NTRs are already extremely massive relative to their thrust. If you are going some place like the asteroid belt this comes in handy is that you always need more panel at your\u00A0destination than you need when transferring. So\u00A0\u00A0extra solar\u00A0\u00A0panels and batteries for deeper space can be exploited for use in a hydrogen NTR.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a 1500 ISP NTR is plausible using hydrogen, the problem is doing that with the right mass/thrust ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never\u00A0use NERVA in the game, the tanks are not designed for it, its not H2, there is no cryogenic recyler in the game, the engine is so heavy, and frankly if you are using gravity-well burns to perk your v, you really want\u00A0an\u00A0engine with a high TWR. Almost entirely i use mods with modern TWR and isp. This is not to say that there maybe a useful NTR in the future that is useful, but if you add up all the costs, in the game and rl, its not worth it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T16:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222595700\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463928050\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess on KSP and more on propellant choices...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Wikipedia article says that HAN can be used as a bipropellant, but it doesn\u0027t say how, and I can\u0027t figure out how that would work.

In an NTR with ammonia you get a specific impulse significantly above the best possible hydrolox engines with a TWR that is much\u00A0better than standard nuclear rockets. Ammonia decomposes endothermically with catalysis, making it a superb coolant for an expander cycle NTR, and it is just cryogenic enough to be self-pressurizing without requiring insulation or particularly careful handling. Finally, it would be extremely amenable to either LOX-afterburning or a supercharged ramrocket cycle, which could mitigate its TWR disadvantage.

Eg. Wheesley, Juno, Goliath. \u00A0Intake, Compression, Combustion, Turbine stage to drive the compressor, nozzle. \u00A0 \u00A0Fuel economy is great but power is bottlenecked by the first stage of the turbine blades, which can only withstand a certain temperature without melting. \u00A0 The world record, I believe , is 1600K and that\u0027s in a gas turbine power station with ceramic blades, airplane engines use metals to better survive in case of FOD. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Because of this, you can only inject enough fuel into the combustor to utilise about half the available oxygen, any more than that , things get too hot. \u00A0 \u00A0Note you can replace the combustor with a nuclear reactor and this makes a \u003Cstrong\u003Enuclear turbojet.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second picture indicates a jet engine with Reheat. \u00A0Eg. Panther. \u00A0 Once we\u0027re past the turbine stage there is no temperature limitation, so we can inject fuel to use up the available oxygen. \u00A0However because the gases have already expanded some, combustion is taking place at a lower pressure and this means less of the heat is converted to mechanical energy. \u00A0 Note you could do something similar with a nuclear turbojet. \u00A0At low altitude, there is likely more air available than the reactor will be capable of heating. \u00A0Higher up however, we can start to run into temperature limitations on the turbine (1600K) before we hit those of the reactor (3000k on modern pebble bed), also the air will have cooled some after expanding through the turbine section, that is after all how power is extracted to drive the compressor. \u00A0 \u00A0So, we can have a reheat stage in our nuclear turbojet analgous to the jet engine \u0022afterburner\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third picture indicates compressor bypass like we have on the Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney J58. \u00A0As we get very high up, ambient air temps start to rise again. \u00A0Since we\u0027ll be doing mach 3\u002B at these altitudes, we\u0027ll be getting substantial ram air effect compressing the air in the intake before it even gets to the engine. \u00A0In a \u00A0lot of ways that\u0027s a good thing, it helps to offset the very rarefied air at such altitudes. \u00A0But , when you compress a gas its temperature goes up, which can drive our turbomachinery over its thermal limits. \u00A0 In such situations the J58 bypasses some of the compression stages to keep temperatures in check. \u00A0 The \u0022Whiplash\u0022 emulates this in game, but i see no reason why a nuclear turbojet couldn\u0027t also do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SABRE (Rapier) engine takes a different approach, it uses the incoming LH2 fuel stream to cool the intake air allowing continued operation up to mach 5. \u00A0So, surely our nuclear turbojet could use increasing amounts of LH2 as a final measure to extend its operating envelope.\u00A0After cooling the intake stream, the LH2 could be fed into the tailpipe to combust with the superheated air stream as an \u0022after burner\u0022, increasing the exhaust temperature beyond the 3000k limit of the reactor core materials. \u00A0I forgot to indicate that you should probably heat the LH2 to 3000k with the reactor first before feeding it into the afterburner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow , I think there\u0027s an upper limit to combustion temperature - breaking O2 and H2 molecules apart takes energy, it\u0027s actually the formation of H20 from these radicals that releases it. \u00A0And there is a temperature at which H20 cannot form , dissociating into free radicals. \u00A0But, I understand this is actually a goal of NTR designers, meaning they can get a lot more ISP from water propellant, since the molecular mass of all these radicals is much lower than molecular water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the spaceplane continues to climb more an more of the reactor heat is just going into the hydrogen stream , till eventually it\u0027s operating as a conventional nuclear thermal rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownsides -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith reactors , you got two choices. \u00A0You can shield it on all sides, like a conventional ground based or naval power plant. \u00A0This is extremely heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr \u00A0you can just use a \u0022shadow shield\u0022, and only shield the side of the reactor that faces the crew compartment. \u00A0 Anyone directly under it\u0027s flight path will get a nasty dose of gamma rays when the engine is in operation, since they\u0027re not protected by the shield. \u00A0Not sure the range on those - a mile or two?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, \u00A0re-usable spacecraft are extraordinarly maintenance intensive. \u00A0After landing, the technicians are going to need to crawl over every component with a fine toothcomb, they\u0027re going to end up glowing green, which is only OK if you\u0027re a Kerbal. \u00A0 Maybe some automated piece of equipment could come up to the plane and lower lead plates around the reactor core before sending the techs in, \u00A0but i\u0027 m reaching a bit here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T16:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222596756\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463979210\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022117163\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jovus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Jovus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint of order: At least for NTRs that have actually been built and tested (i.e. solid core NTRs in Project Rover ) the core temperature is actually lower than that afforded by hydrogen combustion in, say, an RL10.
