I send them to orbit and land on planets to send science back. They say you don\u0027t get as much back if you broadcast, but if you can fill the tree with all of the science without sending kerbals up (after unlocking probes) why not do it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Start With a satellite that has 2 science cans for a body, and 2-4 goo cans on the outside. Hook up some solar panels and batteries, lander legs ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I send it out to lets say Minmus and start in a high orbit. I spam transmit until I get 0 science back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I descend to a lower orbit, and spam transmit again until i get 0 science back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I then land on the planet, and spam transmit again until I get 0 science back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I destroy probe and start on a new planet or moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I do that I look at sending kerbals to those planets for crew reports, EVA, and surface samples. That way you don\u0027t have to have the bulky science mods on your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace stations on the other-hand I agree, and i have a thread up about that already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
