So for example, if you have a 2-kerbal ship with a pilot, engineer, and no probe core, and then you transfer the pilot to another ship, the engineer can still fly the craft... but it will be hard to control because you won\u0027t have any SAS. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T20:23:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
