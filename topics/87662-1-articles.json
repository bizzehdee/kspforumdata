Now what exactly is the relationship between the Euler Angles used to construct the quaternion for the SAS heading and the actual position on the navball ? Are they relative to world space or to the body my vessel is orbiting ? What\u0027s the most elegant way to use the three values of an euler angle to set the pitch (x), yaw(y) and roll(z) relative to the object I am orbiting ? Is there maybe some \u0022navball quaternion\u0022 which I could use to rotate my constructed quat to the correct orientation ?
