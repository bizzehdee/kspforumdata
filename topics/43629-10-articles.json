You\u0027re not going to make orbit with 3000dV and a TWR of 1.4 or less. You need 1.8 minimum but try not to go over 2.0 until out of the lower atmosphere. Also turning below 10 to 12km (the thickest atmosphere) with large or wobbly rockets which don\u0027t have much reaction authority also goes badly. From what I can see you have one little SAS way up top. For an 800t rocket, that\u0027s diddly squat - MJ will not hold that against drag.\u003Cp\u003EIf you want MJ to do it, edit the ascent to start at 12km and see what happens\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELook at all the pictures, not just the ones where he\u0027s been editing stuff.

Often, it does a de-orbit burn that looks spot on and the info box says it\u0027s within about 200m. But then for no apparent reason the ship switches ends and starts burning prograde until the orbit no longer touches the ground and keeps getting higher and higher, pointlessly wasting gobs of fuel. This doesn\u0027t happen on airless planets, just those with atmospheres.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this seems to happen only when you tell MJ to land at a spot that\u0027s too close ahead of where your ship currently is. MJ appears to need somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 an orbit. So, the best way to avoid or at least minimize this behavior is to start the process with as much of an orbit to go as possible, like right after you\u0027ve passed over the target so you get it the next time around. USUALLY this will prevent the spurious \u0022wrong way\u0022 burning. However, what often happens instead is that the rocket will now burn at idle speed pretty much all the way down, saying it\u0027s doing a coarse correction of like 0.1m/s, but this number never changes and the landing error never decreases, so it\u0027s just a pointless waste of fuel again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, I have the best luck with not only engaging the landing autopilot a full orbit in advance, but also then disengaging the autopilot immediately after the de-orbit/plane-change burn when the error is about 200m. Then I fly it myself the rest of the way down, including opening any parachutes (which MJ doesn\u0027t do very well, either). Once the chutes are open, I tell it to \u0022land somewhere\u0022 and it goes down just fine from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply, I\u0027ll give the full orbit burn a try.
