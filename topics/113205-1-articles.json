The one in the screenshot looks good, but I can\u0027t see where the others are pointed.\n\nSomething you could try as a test is to switch it back to monopropellant and see if it works properly. I have a sneaking suspicion that they may have hardcoded something such that LFO used as RCS fuel might only look for the first (or last) thrust transform. I wouldn\u0027t put it past them. Theoretically it shouldn\u0027t matter."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:32:53Z","Content":"Green arrows are pointed correctly, yet only 1 port is working.

I have a few fuel\u002Boxy RCS units, one of which has green transforms for RCS AND blue for moduleEngine.\n\nApart from thrust values etc, my config is almost exactly the same. As the transform seems to be the issue, and I can\u0027t think of anything else, try a longer transform name. It might have issues with only three letters (yes, grasping at straws)."}]}
