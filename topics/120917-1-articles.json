Between the KSP slideshow because of high parts count, large ships, memory leaks, etc, I\u0027ve given up on RO for now.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvening everyone. I\u0027m currently running in science mode, trying to get my first crewed orbit after working with probe-only launches. No problems with the probes, but while in space and flying prograde, everything shuts off and it says I have no connection. I reverted after the first time and added extra batteries and an antenna, but no fix. I\u0027ve never had this problem before, and I\u0027m hoping somebody has experienced this and it\u0027s an easy fix. Thank you in advance.
