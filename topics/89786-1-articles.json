Interplanetary colonisation is not a remotely practical thing at present, and is not going to be so any time in the near future.

Centuries, at an absolute minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does us no good to have a handful of people in a space station or Moonbase if they\u0027re all going to die a week after their resupply ship fails to arrive. And, if rather than burning all of those resources on keeping a handful of people temporarily alive off-Earth, we\u0027d instead spent our effort on telescope monitoring and impactor diversion tech (i.e. send up a robotic spacecraft and give that comet a nudge; it\u0027s actually not that hard to do.

The reason the world population way back was able to survive was because they had basically always lived under the conditions existent at that time, everybody KNEW how to forage and whatnot as was necessary. The vast majority of people in developed nations would have no idea how to survive without readily available supplies. Rather, they do know one method, to take by force what others have gained themselves. While I agree if several million spread across the world survived, we as a species would survive, the more important thing is that we WOULD lose at least the last 500 years of tech generally speaking. Sure if conditions were good the survivors can salvage bits and bobs of tech in order to do certain things, but in general the understanding of how to MAKE those things would be lost. Oh sure, the concept an electric motor requiring a magnet and a coil of wire and few other odds and ends would probably survive. But the mathematics behind the interaction between number of coils, strength of the magnets, etc will be lost. Quite frankly our scientific knowledge surviving is more important to humanity than any given civilization\u0027s survival. Civilizations come and go all the time, this can happen with a minimum of problems assuming the tech base survives. Once a tech base drops out (fall of Rome) things get bad, fast, and long.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T17:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe pyramids are big piles of rock with almost no internal space, and the great wall of china is a series of perfectly normal medieval boundary walls that happen to be really long.

They assume you are not shooting at them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main point about the super-shelters that can save millions though. Sure, you could spend ridiculous amounts of money burying the facility far enough underground that nukes cant reach it (which frankly reaches near space-travel costs pretty quickly actually, ESPECIALLY since you are nuke-proofing it. It isn\u0027t just the immediate problems of the explosion, its the shockwave after all), but are you going to actually have people living in them 24/7? Not really likely. A full active city instead of an emergency survival city requires even more space and much more cost. You wouldn\u0027t be able to charge anyone extra for living there otherwise it would be far too expensive. Plus if you have people living their, your maintenance costs are going to be exhorbitant. It is quite easy to pay for keeping an empty facility ready for use instead of constantly replacing the broken/in use widgets. But again though, if you have a facility that you brag is nuke-proof that holds millions of people, your enemy WILL find a way to take it out, perhaps by sneaking nukes in? All sorts of ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose ground penetrators by the way, they penetrate the ground only hundreds of feet, but that\u0027s just the projectile itself, which nobody cares about. Once it is inside the ground, when it detonates so that the maximum amount of shockwave is transmitted through the ground instead of losing energy transferred from the air/ground barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most secure facilities on the planet, Cheyenne Mountain was designed to be able to survive a single 30 megaton airburst attack at a distance of 1 mile. That is pretty impressive, and yet if that same blast happened a couple hundred feet inside the mass of the mountain, it would be quite easily destroyed. Besides, if you really cared about taking out a location like Cheyenne mountain, you\u0027d have preprogrammed in two patterns just to be sure. One is a series of staggered blasts going off one after the other in say 5 minute intervals (easily done with multiple launches), this constant hammering weakens the rock and makes it easier for subsequent blasts to reach deeper. The other is a series of simultaneous impacts slightly more spread out attempting to create a shockwave as powerful as roughly that of a detonation equal to the sum of the various yields involved (difficult to get perfect, but easily done with a single MIRVing shot). Plus if you wanted, devote three MIRVing missiles to this task and you are guarenteed a kill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the reasons (though the main was, surprise surprise, upkeep cost!) provided for changing NORADs location from there to its current less secured location was that our main opponents have nukes accurate enough to hit the mountain anyway, so on the nuclear side the risk isn\u0027t really being increased by moving it to a non-hardened facility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T23:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think people overestimate the damage nuclear war would cause.

The issue is not the immediate dust thrown into the atmosphere from the airbursts of nuclear weapons, as you say this is negligable really). The big problem is that you can assume that almost every nuke used will cause a city to burn to the ground. Cities are FILLED with petrochemicals that when burned release LOADS and LOADS of ash into the air. There was a study done that assumed a \u0022limited\u0022 nuclear engagement between India and Pakistan where only 100 cities burned. The increased ash in the atmosphere from just the burning of the cities post-detonation decreased the global temperature by 5 degrees F. That is just 100 cities.

Now, how much would it cost to bomb it? No matter how much it costs to send the stuff there, the mass of one bomb will always be less than the mass of the colony, the mass of the people alone is 10 tons, and for example Fat Man was 5 tons. Now, how much does the bomb itself cost to make? Well to be fair it\u0027s hard to say, but the USA has spent 5 trillion on nuclear warfare and has made about 10000 nukes in the process, so we can say that the average nuke costs half a billion dollars. So if you\u0027re base minus those five tons of stuff costs more than half a billion, destroying the base will cost less than it took to build it.

Without cheap transport to/from Earth, there is nothing the enemy Mars colony can do to threaten you. Sure it might threaten YOUR Mars colony, but that is why you gave them a few guns. Besides, you are busy trying to rebuild your country. So, the colony has the perception of being harmless. Second, assuming widescale warfare broke out, any missile launched from Earth will take at least 6 months to reach Mars. It would be a truly herculean effort considering the resources at your disposal, but it is quite possible to move enough of the colony gear in that time (tear it down, move it, build it up). This particular argument is somewhat weak because it relies on very many conditionals. What sort of tools do they have? How many space suits? How many Mars Buggies and what sort of capacity do they have? Plus then you can get into arguments about how the enemy developed their anti-Mars weapon. Maybe it automatically enters orbit, retargets and then descends. Really one of the bigger issues is that even today the things we send to Mars need a connection back to Earth for position verification and course control (just about every Mars probe I\u0027ve heard of required mid-course burns to correct their path). So there exists an extreme possibility that it would miss simply because the systems it would use to try and correct its path might not exist any longer and doing a purely ballistic path is unlikely to hit.
