Every single battery from the Z-100 all the way upto the Z-4K is identical mass to storage, there\u0027s no increase in effiency for pushing your power technology any further.... except better generation.

All stock batteries have a 20k EC to 1 mass ratio, if my math serves right (total EC / mass). The NFE batteries also have a 20k EC:1 mass ratio, they just happen to have vastly higher EC storage for similar volume occupation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T05:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you might just pick a battery and edit the cfg or make you a cfg patch for it for what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T05:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENFE has those capacitators that has very high density stored charge, which can be rapidly discharged into EC to be used for other things. It just have the draw back of storing charge very slowly.

Currently you need to manually discharge though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T05:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas wondering that about the capacitors.
