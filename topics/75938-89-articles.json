From what I\u0027ve figured out, the wheel collision part (for the stock module only) is just to differentiate between the parameter for what sound to play. In my recompile I just let the KF wheels use their impact sound effect (defined in the CollisionFX config) but remapped the sound file to one more appropriate (the tire skid sound, I think) and it worked pretty good for impacting with the ground. Actual skidding is a little hard to achieve in KSP due to the way the wheels never really tend to lock while allowing the craft to slide. Instead it either flips or the wheel continues to turn slightly. The only thing I managed to do was stop the sparks from showing. That\u0027s it. My only idea now is that somehow the dust relies on the spark configuration to display properly, otherwise I see no reason why it wouldn\u0027t function. There is, however, another problem I had in where the plugin determines if the part is allowed to slide, or whatnot. I didn\u0027t see how that function actually did anything other than toggle whether or not the sound effect \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be played, if defined, but I can\u0027t help wondering if somehow the sound is related to the particle and, if stopped, the particles will also refuse to emit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is all very confusing though.

I\u0027ve been steadily finding all of those checks and adding another check for my parameter I added for adding \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E the dust and nothing more.

All I managed to do is somehow make the sounds work, but none of the effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: alright, so I decided it was getting too complicated to filter between scrapeSparks and dustEffects. So, I created a new field that I called \u0022effectsOn\u0022 which defaults to true. \u0022scrapeSparks\u0022 and \u0022dustEffects\u0022 both default to true as well. This way, if you want \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E turned on, you only have to define the module name and any sound effects that are needed. Maybe I\u0027ll try and default the sounds if I ever get this other stuff working so you only need to define them to override the default. As I have it now, instead of if/then checks against either/or (all variations of them, really annoying to set up) the two effect types, now it only checks initially for \u0022effectsOn\u0022 to determine if it should allow collisions on that part to be handled by this mod or not. Only then does it check for the other two.

I got the dust to spawn, \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E the sparks or the scraping noises. \u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E, I also got spammed with NullRefs due to, as far as I can tell, the definition for the \u0022scapeSound\u0022 being null. I may have fixed that, will check later. If not, I also have an empty audio file on standby that I can define as the scape sound for the wheels. Next up will be trying to make it work on wheels that do not use the KF module type, but I may just leave that up to the original author of the mod to figure out in his own time. I only use KF wheels now anyway. All of this comes with no \u0022index out of range\u0022 issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still curious as to how you did it and why you were getting that error, but that\u0027s less urgent now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Scumbag\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Space Scumbag\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI made the video, have fun:\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgjRPzKbMK0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow \u003Cem\u003ETHAT\u003C/em\u003E was epic. I was so glad when you showed off the action groups and the water repulsor parts. I was also impressed by the quality of the video. That\u0027s a rare thing, even with the higher-profile video posters. It really felt like it was right here on my monitor. Better, actually, since I cannot use shadows while still being able to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe good news is that the sparks should be fixed soon, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E I can get the null refs under control. This is all assuming we can do a re-release of the mod, or package the edited version with KF... that stuff is all foreign to me. What I\u0027d love to do, however, is find a way to keep the sparks for certain situations such as really hard impacts and/or the screw-drive when on hard surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContrary to the original mod, I also switched out the water spray effect (just a different color for the dust when on the water) from the desert-dust to the arctic dust. I have yet to test this out at all, but I think it might look a bit better. I\u0027ve also done an experimental definition for dust on Duna, using the desert dust preset, since the original mod had no settings for dust on non-Kerbin surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood stuff coming in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T12:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s brilliant, Space Scumbag!
