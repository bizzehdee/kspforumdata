I\u0027ve seen people get pretty creative with stock parts to make both interior and exterior sets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering, though, is it possible to control gestures or expressions of Kerbals? I\u0027ve been googling, but haven\u0027t found anything definitive saying it can or can\u0027t be done.
