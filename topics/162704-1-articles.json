you can go anywhere quickly, but to be able to stay there requires finesse. \u00A0Imagine, for example, beginning in Kerbin\u0027s orbit and then going to Jool--but when Jool is on the opposite side of the sun from Kerbin. \u00A0Kerbin is moving with an orbital velocity of about 9.2 km/s, and Jool is going to be moving at 13 km/s relative to that. \u00A0So far as Alcubierre warp fields are concerned, the overall effect is essentially the same as popping from Kerbin to Jool via teleportation, which means that you will get to Jool\u0027s system and then stay there\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0briefly as you fly out of it at 13 km/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo cope with\u00A0that\u00A0velocity, you have to essentially split the magnitude from the direction and manage them separately. \u00A0For the example, Jool is going at a slower speed (because it is farther from the sun) but in the opposite direction (because it\u0027s on the other side of the sun from Kerbin): \u00A0if you went directly there, you\u0027d need to stop for 9.2 km/s, turn around, and accelerate by the 4 km/s you\u0027d need to match. \u00A0You can do this much cheaper and faster if you only need\u00A0to shed 5.2 km/s and can\u00A0change direction. \u00A0The warp drive\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0do that--its essential function is to separate the vessel from the normal rules\u00A0of spacetime--so that means you will need to use a combination of normal flight with superluminal flight to achieve your goal. \u00A0However, warp drive \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E change location very easily--this is, in fact, its \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0selling point--so if you can use a gravity well to alter your trajectory, you\u0027ll get where you need to go so long as you go to the gravity well first. \u00A0More gravity makes a quicker change, so that means going to the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake a note of Kerbin\u0027s\u00A0tangential velocity direction with respect to the sun and warp to a point above the sun\u0027s surface (not too close, of course) where that velocity vector points straight radial out with respect to the sun. \u00A0This is going to be a line that crosses Kerbin\u0027s orbit around a quarter of an orbit ahead. \u00A0The idea is that if you warp to a place where your velocity carries you directly out from the sun, then the sun\u0027s gravity will slow you down without changing your direction. \u00A0Since gravity drops with the square of the distance, you may want to keep warping back down in order to get the quickest deceleration rather than let your speed drop in one long coast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve lost 5.2 km/s, warp to a point near (again, not too near) the sun such that you are directly between it and Kerbin. \u00A0Now your velocity is no longer pointing straight radial out; instead, you want it pointing prograde. \u00A0Orbit the sun until your direction is parallel to Jool\u0027s direction, then\u00A0warp to Jool. \u00A0Now you will have matched both direction and velocity with Jool, and any further corrections should be fairly simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to change direction first instead of magnitude; you\u0027ll have to try it for yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo return to Kerbin, the situation is reversed; warp to a point high above the sun, but falling directly radial in; you\u0027ll pick up speed as you do. \u00A0Keep warping back out before you broil yourself until you\u0027ve built up the needed speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI leave the matter of inclination changes as an exercise for the student.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may note that a typical Hohmann transfer accomplishes this effect by combining the direction change and the speed\u00A0reduction over the course of one very long flight, and for roughly the same amount of speed change (an ideal Hohmann to Jool is about 5 km/s).\u00A0 Since the warp drive won\u0027t allow that, you have to get creative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-30T21:56:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2017 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ErevanGaming","CreatedById":167045,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-02T06:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhi\u00A0Zhetaan,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWoah, thanks for your awesome reply.
