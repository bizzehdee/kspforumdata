Also dont even think about trying to get it back into space after that, you would need an INSANE amount of delta v left, but I doubt you ever expected you could do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T08:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to ever say never, but in this case...without a heat shield that covers the entire width of the craft I don\u0027t think it\u0027s gonna happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T08:59:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T17:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t been to Eve with a spaceplane, but I\u0027ve been to Jool.
