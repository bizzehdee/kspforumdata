A jumbo-64 tank transfers fuel much more quickly than the little bit of mono-propellant in a command capsule. Unfortunately, it seems that the slower rate always trumps in the current version (0.23). As both tanks can pull or push fuel, different transfer rates could be used, depending on the initiating fuel tank. Transferring fuel from a jumbo-64 to a t100 tank might be fast, while initiating the transfer from the t100 would be slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the excellent game,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekdonfede\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T21:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d personally like to see is a clamped fuel transfer rate. That is, all fuel transfers at a set rate rather than it being determined by the smallest tank size. To increase the rate, one would add fuel lines. Also, have the flow rate be tweakable for better management of smaller tanks. This doesn\u0027t have to affect engine performance because some of the (ridiculous) stock engine mass can be assumed to be the pumps required for the engine to function; transfer rate would only affect tank to tank transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kruleworld","CreatedById":69697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T22:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo increase the rate, one would add fuel lines. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat makes a lot of sense. i can see my rocket now, with a nasty network of pipes everywhere!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T22:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m totally for the a) option, with another option to bind LF and oxidizer levels so I end up with appropriate amounts of each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding fuel transfer, it apparently always depends on size of destination tank.
