out of fuel I flipped and could never get back to tail first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put some struts between the boosters to see if that would help the wobbles.\u00A0 If anything it was

bad turn.\u00A0 I ended up with my apoapsis over 400km but the contract only says \u0022orbit\u0022, it worked.\u00A0 This time I jettisoned the engine at a higher altitude (and speed--I wasted even more fuel this time) and only had the capsule during the worst of the reentry.\u00A0 I was able to keep it tail first.\u00A0 It also helped that I came down over water instead of a mountain.\u00A0 All in all I earned about 4x what the rocket cost, around 100 science and 200 prestige.\u00A0 No comments from my tourists about getting more than they paid for.\u00A0 (The tourists were only asking for suborbital.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could haul tourists around without such a long reentry capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds

by the time they burn out, you\u0027re already pitched over at 45 degrees or more, and the relatively low TWR of the Swivel stage won\u0027t matter as much.\u00A0 Just remember to enable the tanks on that stage as the bottom one drains, so you can keep continuous power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Actually, you could give the SRBs a bit more legs by setting up the four radial boosters in two pairs.\u00A0 Instead of setting all four of them\u00A0 to 70%, you can set one pair to 85% and the other pair to 55%, so that the hi-power pair ditches runs out of fuel and ditches first.\u00A0 Sort of a poor man\u0027s asparagus.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, just a thought.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T04:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222414265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132216\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455683469\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Loren Pechtel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Loren Pechtel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the cure for a wobbly rocket like that one was?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, one option is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50911-105-kerbal-joint-reinforcement-v314-62215/#comment-727019\u0022\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement mod\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0It takes the stock joint reinforcement that happened in 0.23.5 and pushes it even further, making all your joints between parts even more rigid. \u00A0Now, there are some very well respected users on the forum that would say that KJR is more of a crutch, and that if you need it to function, then it\u0027s really a sign that your basic rocket design needs improvement. \u00A0I\u0027m not refuting that opinion, just pointing out that differences between players exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is careful, strategic use of connector struts. \u00A0The main thing to keep in mind when using struts is that they add a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of drag, so use as few as you can get away with while still making your rocket more stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last option is perhaps the least attractive. \u00A0Basically redesign your rocket from top to bottom, keeping in mind the whole time that it should look and behave like a real life rocket. \u00A0This is fairly difficult, and at times counter-intuitive. \u00A0If you have a design that you\u0027re mostly happy with, but is still wobbly, you can upload the .craft file somewhere (dropbox, google drive, kerbalx.com) and let myself or other players try it out, and modify it if necessary, to give you some ideas on what works and what doesn\u0027t. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, useful screenshots and very descriptive problems usually get the most useful advice.
