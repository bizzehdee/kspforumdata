Other things that can stop a model turning up are missplaced commas in the node configs or brackets out of place. As to the invisible sections, you may have the faces inside out. It is not obvious in blender unless you turn \u0022Face Orientation\u0022 on to get the blue outside, red inside. If you are inside out you will need to flip the normals in editing mode for that section. That is under the Mesh dropdown, find Normals, then inside that Flip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstructions for finding face orientation are in the thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the missing textures. That depends on how you have set up your Materials. Like have you got the parts of the model that use the other textures on a different material set up that looks for those texture pics. I usually put everything on same texture pic in different areas. You can have multiple Material set ups that use the same pic but have different effects. I believe I can do half the possible shaders on a total of 3 pics. A main texture, An Emissive/Specular and a bump map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow.
