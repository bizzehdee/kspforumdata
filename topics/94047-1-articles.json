But to use these burns, you need to find the angles between planets to be able to find out if you will be able to reach your destination with your math. Having some button you can either click/press could show up angles betweens 2 planets and the sun. Maybe this could be built in with the new SAS? If something like this already exists I\u0027m sorry for wasting your time. Otherwise, please consider what I am saying. An hopefully this can make [my] planetary transfers with a lot less guesswork.
