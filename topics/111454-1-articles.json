It will reduce the amount of ram that is required, but the main problem is with the numerous memory leaks that are present in the latest version. Basically, the RAM available to KSP will slowly decrease until it gets below a certain point, at which point it crashes. ATM reduces the \u0022point\u0022 so it will (theoretically) be longer before a crash happens."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T04:53:16Z","Content":"Also, turn off the temperature thermometers via F10. It\u0027s actually the PFFX that leaks, so if you want thermometers, turn off PPFX (if it\u0027s not off already).\n\nAside from that, tuning down graphics provides the biggest reduction in memory consumption (without mods). Revert as few times as necessary, and if you notice lag with one of the tweakables open, make your changes and close it as soon as able.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
