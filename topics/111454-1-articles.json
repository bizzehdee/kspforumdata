It will reduce the amount of ram that is required, but the main problem is with the numerous memory leaks that are present in the latest version. Basically, the RAM available to KSP will slowly decrease until it gets below a certain point, at which point it crashes. ATM reduces the \u0022point\u0022 so it will (theoretically) be longer before a crash happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T04:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, turn off the temperature thermometers via F10.
