It looks fantastic, I have put in alot of work, but so what. A base is for kerbals to live in, so lets get us some kerbals...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EYea, that is where the problem comes in... see kerbonauts cost funds, and if you have something like an ISS-deravative, that it doesn\u0027t only costs funds, but it also costs a lot of funds. This is because hiring new kerbals gets exponentially higher. So if I play in career, I won\u0027t be able to crew the base unless I put all other missions to a stop (so all the availeble kerbals can live inside the base). ANd lets be honest, the fact that the kerbals are there, inside your craft, going on your missions, is a thing that makes a lot of missions (possible the entire game) a lot more interesting to do. Just the simple fact that they exist, taht you can interact with them and so forth, is very valueable.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETourists would not have the problem of becoming exponentially more expensive, hell, you get money for using them on your missions. But you have to be lucky to get kerbals that wanna go where your base is, and they gotta go home at some point. And besides, if there are tourists, and when you eventually can built self sustaining bases, then there is that next logical step..\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Ecolonist kerbals. These kerbals are basicly tourists that want to stay places permanently. You do not have to hire these kerbals, as you get them via contracts, and you don\u0027t have to bring them back home. So everything is good as long as you give them their snacks (if you have those kinds of mods). They however could learn more sills as they level up, like extending solar panels, beiing able to go on EVA or eventually use a jetpack. This is so you can have them perform the most basic base-maintaining tasks.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAnd I all here you screaming: doesn\u0027t civillian poulation do this? Yes, yes it does. But as I said earlier, this game would be a lot less interesting if it weren\u0027t for the kerbals that go along with your journeys, that explore what you explore, and they do that by visually existing inside your craft. The colonists of civillan population do not do that, they\u0027re... well.. they are a list of numbers, basically. They are there, maybe, but they don\u0027\u0027t live in your base, but in their own special parts and you never get to see them. In short the system is very abstract and far from the player. (No offence to the maker of civillian population.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESo this is a stock suggestion AND a mod request: make Kerbal colonists a class.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E...
