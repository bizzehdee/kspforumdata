Frame Rate- You have a lot of high triangle count, multi-material/texture objects that are hurting frame rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile polygons can be rendered quickly, draw calls multiply that number. A Draw Call is each time an object is drawn from the graphics card in the scene. Every triangle has at least one pass for every material, light and shadow cast on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have an object with lots of triangles ,lots of materials and there are lots of those objects they all get multiplied together. The time it takes to render each object slows down your system as more of those multi-material objects are added. This is why it is important for each object to have as few materials as possible. The best number being just one material per object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8000 - triangles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - materials\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E90 - objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - lights (one sun and 3 spotlights, this number doubles to 8 if you have shadows on) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8000 x 4 x 90 x 8 = 23,040,000 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We cant do anything about the object count or lights since that\u0027s up to the user. We can however reduce the material count to 1, and clean up the triangle count some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7000 x 1 x 90 x 8 = 5,040,000 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- That\u0027s a 78% reduction in draw calls and almost 0 reduction in quality! Even if you didn\u0027t touch the triangle count you would get a 75% reduction in draw calls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can also see from this example that the triangle count has much less of an effect on draw calls than the number of objects, lights and most importantly materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. If you do the action groups and then save them with the craft they get saved to the craft file. You cant save action groups with individual parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
