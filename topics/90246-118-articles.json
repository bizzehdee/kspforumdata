seem to be waiting out this update storm and are holding until Squad gets to a stable version before they bother doing updates.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leaves me to either drop CKAN or stop playing KSP.\u00A0 And that\u0027s sad because other than this one issue, CKAN is an awesome utility that greatly simplifies the whole mod management hairball.\u00A0 But because of that issue, I literally have not been able to play my favorite game for 2 weeks.\u00A0 Doing this manually is going to kind of suck.\u00A0 But at least I can actually play my game then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m considering writing my own CKAN-like utility because of this.\u00A0 And that\u0027s really stupid.\u00A0 Seriously stupid.\u00A0 It\u0027s going to basically be CKAN except with one little added feature.\u00A0 That\u0027s got to be one of the most trivial and unnecessary applications of all time.\u00A0 Yet I\u0027m considering it because

authors chose to disable their mods in 64-bit windows (e.g. FAR) or to disable running in a version of KSP it wasn\u0027t specifically built for (e.g. Kopernicus), I completely understand CKAN being very careful/strict about what they allow users to do or install. The simple fact of the matter is that many users mess things up or think they know better and then come and blame mod authors and ask for support when they failed to follow installation instructions. Just yesterday I was reading some USI mod thread where a user had deleted USI Tools because he thought it was just for developers and he wasn\u0027t interested in it. I agree in principle with the points made regarding allowing users the freedom to do what they will and own the responsibility for it, but the reality is that many users will not own the responsibility for it. They come and complain and ask for support, and usually the first stop is not the CKAN thread, but the mod authors.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe purpose of CKAN is to reduce the overhead associated with maintaining mods. That is sometimes broken in the versioning and metadata which doesn\u0027t reflect the actual state or prerequisites of the mod. Sometimes this is the mod author\u0027s fault, sometimes not. Issues have been exacerbated by the recent KSP updates, and they\u0027ll settle down.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor what it\u0027s worth, I am opposed to having CKAN become more flexible in letting you break your game on your own (that\u0027s what manual installation is for, and all my mods are manually installed at the moment), but it would be worthwhile to have more safeguards in place on the metadata. Perhaps we need more transparency about who maintains the NetKAN file, and have CKAN have obvious links for mod entries about where to get support for CKAN installed mods, and require that to be included before a mod is included/indexed on CKAN.\u00A0There are a lot of middle men in this process of trying to make it easier for users, but most users are unaware of the middle men,\u00A0aiming straight for the mod author when something goes wrong. Then it\u0027s a lot more fingers being pointed than problems being solved. Even if we can\u0027t eliminate needless confusion, we can reduce it.
