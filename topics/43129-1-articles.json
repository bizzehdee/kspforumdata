Sometimes the tailfin is counted as a wing so it creates sideways-lift. You can counterract this by using pairs of tailfins. The symmetry means their sideways lift is exactly opposite of each other, keeping you straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sometimes you can slightly tilt the wings up or down. This adds slight sideways lift in equal amounts, left and right. Sort of like having slight toe-in on an automobile. The slight offset gives better straight-line stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratoroc","CreatedById":73987,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T22:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso I added struts to the wings and the problem all but went away, probably wing flex as Syhrus said. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear is straight as far as angle snapping allows, I suspect even snapped it\u0027s possible to tilt the landing gear ever so slightly depending on which part of the part mesh it\u0027s attached to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: could the jet engines clipping into the wings be causing odd engine wash effects as the wings flex?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are pics of the thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/BOBxLrH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BOBxLrH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BOBxLrH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/q9k5V9D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q9k5V9D.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q9k5V9D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T22:36:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stratoroc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
