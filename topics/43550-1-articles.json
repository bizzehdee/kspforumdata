I\u0027ve taken some inspiration from it but had to put other points from it aside (more on that later).

Multi-launch/in-orbit assembly, space stations and large surface bases are off the table for me for the time being\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Specifics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Land a crack team of brave Kerbals on the surface of Duna and return them safely to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Single launch from the KSC using a heavy launch platform\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No nuclear engines, all chemical baby!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Aerobraking will be used extensively (4 times in total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some mods will be used for navigation and timing (see mods section)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Acceleration restricted to 20 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E during the first two stages of take off, to save fuel and also to keep the launcher in one piece. During a trial run, when the external tanks were nearly empty, the launcher was pushing 4.5G\u002B and would result in something breaking, followed by a big explosion (cool to watch but doesn\u0027t get Kerbals to Duna)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mechjeb 2.09 (did most of the work if I am honest)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Alarm Clock (set the pace of the mission)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sub Assembly Loader (for the launch vehicle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have liked to have used elements from the Mars Direct plan such as in-situ fuel production and while mods exist for such things, they aren\u0027t quite what I was looking for. Mostly their models were too bulky for the craft size I had in mind and I didn\u0027t know if they would work on Duna. Maybe something to look into in the future (Duna Direct Enhanced?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, while Mechjeb is a wonderful tool, somewhere between KSP 0.21 and the newest version of the mod it can\u0027t land at specified target on Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks fine on the Mun and Minmus but goes crazy when attempting to \u0022land at target\u0022 on the big red-one. First time I tried it, the craft ended up burning most of its fuel putting itself in a very wide orbit. However the \u0022land anywhere\u0022 option works so it landed but in a near-random spot. Luckily, Mechjeb managed to put the craft down on a relatively flat area (which was nice).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** if anyone has had more luck with targeted landing using Mechjeb on Duna, please let me know! ***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two elements together (in-situ and target landing using Mechjeb) would allow me to do a two part mission closer to the Mars Direct plan - return craft lands, refuels using in-situ then the crew turn up later in the lander/hab and transfer over to the return craft when its time to go home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I didn\u0027t include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In-situ fuel production (see above)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A seperate habitat/lander (see above)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Deployable surface structures (need to do some research on what is out there)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orbital comms satellite (not essential but would have been nice)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A rover for the crew (maybe next time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More interesting things for the crew to do once they land (rover might have helped with that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo find below the photo album of the mission for your enjoyment.
