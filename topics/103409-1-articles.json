The craft is quite simple, actually. It\u0027s a mk1 lander can, with 4 large rockomax x200-16 tanks attached radially. I have a science jr on top with a docking port on top of that. I have a circular under slung battery pack, two stratus v roundeified RCS tanks, landing stRuts outboard, 2 goo cans and miscellaneous other utility fittings such as nose cones, RCS ports, thermometers, etc. the engines are 4 rockomax R55s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the only control authority aboard is the lander can and the engine gimbals. The engines are not situated perfectly radially, so maybe that\u0027s it? Either way, the thing shouldn\u0027t be convulsing and snapping its own back. I\u0027m playing science mode, so I\u0027m not sure if the \u0022SAS abilities\u0022 you mention are active in science mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have your ship pointing retrograde with the SAS options, if your ship stops descending and starts going up the ship will try to flip too. It won\u0027t do it smartly, so it will just start flipping around until it points exactly there or breaks apart in atmo. If you are using these options, I\u0027d recommend to use it just for the initial breaking burn. When you get close to 10m/s change to normal stability assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is not your case, some picture would help pinpointing your problem.
