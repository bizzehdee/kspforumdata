However I\u0027ve since discovered that the Goliath is insanely buoyant - so much so that the engines barely dip into the water even with a sizeable Mk2 hull attached above.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo thoughts immediately struck me:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Goliath engines are almost perfect for boats - huge buoyancy, excessive thrust, and exceptionally high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. The only real downside is their sheer size.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Goliath engines are also excellent for submarines - mount on vertical axis, naturally float, increase thrust to dive, trim thrust to maintain depth, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWondering if anybody else has experiences to share about using the Goliath (or other jet engines) in or on water?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T15:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCruising at 40m/s with a nearly full 10000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tank. 2 extra engines got me to 100m/s but I had stability issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ms4uSpq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ms4uSpq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T16:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm...maybe this is what the Goliath was for all along?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
