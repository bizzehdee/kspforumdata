He\u0027s currently running high-altitude gravioli readings; he got about six before the close of business. Meanwhile, my Midas 7 refinery lander finally arrived at Minmus and I began the process of putting it down at the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat 7\u003C/em\u003E drilling site. The precision landing went well - a little too well, actually. I wound up landing one one of the \u003Cem\u003EMosquito 7\u003C/em\u003E drilling rig\u0027s large solar panels and tipping it over halfway. I had to wriggle the \u003Cem\u003EMosquito\u003C/em\u003E free but was able to do so and then upright it on pod torque.

The \u003Cem\u003EMidas\u003C/em\u003E is converting ore into fuel as it\u0027s being drilled from the ground.

AA Armament is four goalkeeper CIWS, an oerlikon millennium, 14-16 30 mm chainguns, and 11-13 dual fifty cal turrets. powerplant is a nuclear reactor from the Mk II expansion, plus 4 fuel cell arrays, but since the maritime pack clipper hulls don\u0027t have oxidizer, I didn\u0027t realize until it was too late that they wouldn\u0027t work. it has four Mole RBI tracks for movement, which can get it up to at least 10 m/s, maybe more since I have yet to test its speed. It has a crew of two kerbals in a mk-2 lander can on the top. much better ship than my other landships, although I just realized I didn\u0027t add any radiators which I need to do so it has regenerating armor. hopefull I can upgrade the main armament once I have a BDA plugin installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draconiator","CreatedById":133772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T18:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI COMPLETELY impressed myself with rocket building skills by using the lifting vehicle I built to go to (URLUM, in OPM)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.gyazo.com/ebb8287304c1e0315447b2dc1fe9262b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ebb8287304c1e0315447b2dc1fe9262b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, the green circle is Jool\u0027s orbit, the orangeish one used to be Eeloo, but in OPM ir\u0027s a moon of a gas giant named Sarnus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlue line in the foreground is Urlum.
