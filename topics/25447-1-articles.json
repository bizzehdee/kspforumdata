So far I\u0027ve assembled a mobile mining platform, and a mobile liquid fuel/oxidizer platform, but I\u0027m not quite satisfied. I\u0027d like to set up an mono-propellant converter, and a xenon converter, as well as storage towers for all of them. So here\u0027s what I\u0027m wondering: do monoprop/xenon tanks connect and flow to each other? That is, if I have a stack of monoprop tanks with a converter linked to the top-most tank, will all the rest get filled as well? And if not, can I connect fuel lines to link them, or do fuel lines only transfer liquid fuel and oxidizer?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T19:41:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EXenon and Monopropellant are vessel-wide resources, I haven\u0027t actually tried filling them but It should work the opposite way to draining them - all tanks will be filled wherever they are on the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Payload","CreatedById":4540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T20:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have first hand experience with this and you are in luck. You do not need to worry about the placement of Mono tanks. Some of my refineries don\u0027t even have a mono tank. I just run the converter when the transport vehicle is attached to it. Specifically, LFO tanks are the only ones that need special care in a refinery rig.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malachai","CreatedById":61407,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T21:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETasty.
