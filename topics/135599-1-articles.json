Right around the center of the stick, it seems to be super sensitive, and then loses sensitivity the longer away from the center you pull the stick. And I mean so sensitive that you can\u0027t really even control anything around the center. For example on the throttle, one minuscule movement at the center of the throttle axis translates into a 1/4 jump of throttle in the game, and the joystick behaves the same way with pitch yaw and rotate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas there some additional calibration I should have done first or is that just not very well supported and I shouldn\u0027t expect anything better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso how come the move from VB to IPB?
