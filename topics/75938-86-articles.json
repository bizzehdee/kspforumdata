Going to make them aim-able, so once configured, you fire them to create a solid joint between themselves and whatever they\u0027re aimed at within a configurable distance. So you can drive a rover onto a ramp of a cargo plane, fire up several tie-downs and fly the plane away with the rover solidly fixed in place, just like in RL. No messing with fiddly docking port alignment, everything stays as a separate vessel and the rover won\u0027t fall out. Lots of unknowns like vessel and scene switching, how the on rails part is handled and stuff like that to work through, but that\u0027s the plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots to do with the hitch before I even release it to you guys, and still a lot of unknowns there. Switching between tractor and trailer is fine - the joint stays intact - but it will need rebuilding every time focus is swapped away out of physics range, which could be a problem. Needs rebuilding before and physics kicks in too, or things will go out of alignment before the joint is rebuilt. I think KAS and IR can probably point me the way. One cool thing about this method, is that as tractor and trailer are still separate vessels, they actually collide with each other rather than folding into themselves! I\u0027m going to try and create some limits to swivel range of the hitch anyway, but this might be tricky dealing with the orientation not being perfect when hitching. I\u0027d also like to give the option to activate the drive and brakes on the trailer, so maybe I\u0027ll have to look at Burn Together or similar. Maybe I can hack around with some of the auto pilot functions.. Oh, and I need to make some nice hitch and coupling models...
