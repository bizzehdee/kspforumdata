I rescued a Kerbal from his derelict ship! And it was fantastic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t easy though. After trying the Docking Training mission about 50 times, I had had it. I hate that training mission. When I try to make adjustments after doing what Gene says, the \u0022Next\u0022 button turns from lit to grey, thereby halting progression. Or, I would blow all my fuel getting the two red arrows to line up, which sucked. I HATE that mission. Like I said, I tried and tried and finally just said screw it, I\u0027ll do it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I loaded up my campaign which had 3 Kerbals needing rescue. Two were in a low orbit (80K) and other was a lot further out. So, I said, well this will be easy, all I have to do is go into a miniscule orbit and get this guy. Well, I get up there, picked a guy to rescue, then find out that I can\u0027t get to him, his orbit is very symmetrical and so is mine, plus we are both very close to falling out of orbit, so I can\u0027t retrograde much. In the training mission, this part was easier because the rescuee is further out. Well, I played with the maneuver node for about 10 minutes and finally figured out what to do. I had to place my orbit so that it crossed the other guy\u0027s orbit altitude-wise. Then I could intersect him with a maneuver. I\u0027m constantly learning something with this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyway, I haven\u0027t even gotten to the best part. I had never put RCS on my ships before, so this was all new. I finally get to within a kilometer of him and then had to play with the thrust to get closer. We passed each other a few times, but finally I get really close. I had never messed with the RCS controls, or even knew they existed. The only thing I knew was H for forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other day, when trying the docking training for the 34th time, I had gotten close to the ship, but could not for the life of me stop spinning around the other ship. I was going crazy, only to find out later that there are other controls besides H. LOL No wonder! You idiot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I start messing with the RCS controls tonight and they are really quite responsive. =) You can actually move behind the other ship and stop spinning all over the place! LOL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I get to within 5 meters of the other ship. I can\u0027t believe it. This is great! I\u0027ve never been so close! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally, I thought I\u0027d have to dock, but then just realized I needed to EVA the guy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I switch ships and EVA the guy. I\u0027d never used the EVA controls before either. They really make you go fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had put 3 ladders on my pod, but discovered he cannot reach the entry hatch unless he is using the ladder right under it. So, I made him grab that one and brought him inside. I couldn\u0027t believe I had actually done it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few minutes later we landed in the water. Mission complete!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this without reverting except when I had to reload after taking Gene\u0027s advice to retrograde at 60K. That was a mistake. I reloaded and just used my best judgement about when to slow down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably my greatest accomplishment so far in this game, next to figuring out how to get 2 attached hitchhiker pods back to Kerbin safely without one smacking the ground too hard and blowing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELot\u0027s of fun!

After installing FAR Froude, I went ahead and removed the forward canards from the Ballista 7 and launched the plane to orbit. It got plenty hot but nothing broke (for once), and I was ultimately able to deploy its payload successfully. I went ahead and cold-soaked the plane before attempting to land and that helped matters when it came to the de-orbit; I was able to fly the plane to the KSC Runway, quicksaving at 12 klicks out. I then proceeded to crash the plane a dozen times; the final time, the plane bounced twice before I ripped the v-tail off - but nothing else broke and I was annoyed, so I declared victory and moved on.

I also topped off the Raven 7 that Jeb had used to bring up some tourists to the New Horizons station and then sent Jeb and a batch of tourists from there on to Munport 7, and from there I sent down Jeb and a batch of tourists to the Northwest Crater. Jeb did a crew report, an EVA report and collected a surface sample, and then headed back to Munport. Job done, Jeb and the tourists headed back to Kerbin, re-rendezvousing with New Horizons as several of the tourists also had Minmus on their travel itineraries. At this point, New Horizons needs some more fuel brought up from Kerbin to refuel the Raven; I began working on a fuel plane late in the evening on Sunday.
