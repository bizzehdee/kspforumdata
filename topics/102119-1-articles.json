This was a few years ago. I, one day remembered that I owned the game. And i re-downloaded the game. I think it was V.20. I was amazed at the things they had accomplished, and got myself invested in the game that I couldn\u0027t enjoy much all those years ago. I am proud to own this game, and i\u0027m am glad the way things turned out with this game, and I hope that all Squad\u0027s projects will turn out as well as Kerbal Space Program did!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also live in Australia, South Australia, Adelaide. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Good luck in everything Squad, and I am glad to be a part of this community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coffeeman","CreatedById":69966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:09:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, welcome officially. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBelated welcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T14:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(Belated) Welcome!
