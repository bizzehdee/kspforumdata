I\u0027ve got KAS, so the winches are no problem, and I have MechJeb, so that I can attempt to hover over the part to be retrieved... It\u0027s just that there\u0027s no way that MechJeb\u0027s altitude hold can handle the slow spool-up time of the air-breathing engines I\u0027m using.\n\nDoes anyone know of a better way to maintain a given altitude with air-breathing engines?"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T19:04:42Z","Content":"Maybe look at the Mechjeb/KER TWR readout and get it to read 1.0, and then use rcs to adjust altitude after that, or try one of the other vtol control mods."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:20:25Z","Content":"Take a look at Cupcake\u0027s thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27424-Cupcake-s-Dropship-Dealership?p=691402\u0026viewfull=1#post691402](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27424-Cupcake-s-Dropship-Dealership?p=691402\u0026viewfull=1#post691402)\n\nHe builds very responsive VTOLs by supplementing the jets with small bursts from rockets.\n\nIf you go with strict air-breathing, you\u0027ll just have to fly very carefully, and always be thinking 30-60 seconds in advance. That can actually be a fun challenge.\n\nEDITED link above to his retired craft: Looks like he quit doing airbreathers because 1.x is not fun. ;-) However, the low-altitude performance is still similar.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:26:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FleshJeb**"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T23:23:52Z","Content":"Can\u0027t you adjust the number and thrust limiter of air breathing engines so your twr is 1?

Put a cargo bay facing downwards with a KAS winch in there and pull the part in, dock it, and close your bay back up again before taking off and heading back to base.\n\nI haven\u0027t mucked with the options lately, I know they mucked with the stock part buoyancy recently.. Used to be you could use the radial mount intakes as floats, but I\u0027ve heard they changed that. Not sure about the girder segments and/or octo struts though. Waaaaayyy back I built a command-pod recovery VSTOL all stock with a little crane gantry thing based around landing gear rolling along straight wing segments with docking ports to lock it in and the radial rockets to move it along.\n\nOtherwise, yeah.. jets and a slow and steady hand, and RCS can help with the fine tuning rather than trying to spool up and down laggy turbines."},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:36:06Z","Content":"As far as I can tell the situation with stock seaplanes is this:\n\n-Floaty radial intakes have lost their floaty. \n\n-Everything else is now way less floaty.\n\n-The best floats seem to be structural fuselages, they have 70m/s impact tolerance so water landings of planes are reasonably easy. \n\n-Wing parts are also good, but still break easily.\n\nThis is the best 1.0.2 seaplane I have, it weighs about 10 tonnes and even with lots of floats barely clears the water:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
