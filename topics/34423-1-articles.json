Additionally, some of the lunar samples were taken not for science, but to be used to expose lab mice to them (rocks and dust) for the same quarantine duration; if the mice got sick, the quarantine would be extended. If the mice *died* and we couldn\u0027t confirm it was due to some earthly cause, the quarantine would likely become permanent (and yes, they had contingency plans for keeping the crews in quarantine for the remainder of their lives, if necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, it wasn\u0027t just the crew that were in quarantine. Two other people (a doctor and a nurse, both volunteers) were quarantined with them--and, in fact, didn\u0027t get to leave on the same day as the crew, as the quarantine period starts at the moment of first possible exposure. (During Apollo 11\u0027s quarantine period, an additional person got put into quarantine, a scientist who accidentally got exposed to a lunar sample.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quarantine period and detail decreased with each mission. Apollo 12 was only in quarantine for 30 days, and Apollo 14 (which got the planned quarantine period for 13) was a 14-day quarantine with the crew only being required to wear what were essentially gas masks between the time they were recovered and the time they went into the Mobile Quarantine Facility, instead of the full biohazard suits that were used on 11 and 12. NASA has stated that while they will put the quarantine procedure into effect again for Mars landing crews, they expect it to be rather less of an issue, since even the shortest possible Mars mission would see the quarantine period expire before they get back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what they did while in quarantine? Paperwork. According to Mike Collins, the quarantine period was pretty much the perfect amount of time for them to be isolated from the press so that they could get all their mission reports written and post-mission debriefings completed without being too distracted. (The LRL also had a well-stocked bar and a television, plus a decent library, a ping-pong table, and a few other recreation options to help pass the time once your eyes glazed over from doing too much paperwork for one day...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
