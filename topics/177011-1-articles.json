All the 3d printed variety require is a different animation (if anyone even cares about the animation). You\u0027d have a pull down for colors, where they are pegged to planet surfaces.

Why? Well we\u0027ve had mods for virtually everything Squad has implemented as stock/dlc recently. We had multiple mods for communication networks, mods for Apollo parts, mods for Soyuz parts, mods for particle FX and mods for texture swapping.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI especially find it somewhat annoying when someone is suggesting something that would help fix a stock game issue i.e. contracts for building bases but no base specific parts and no way of building bases that isn\u0027t horrifically messy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
