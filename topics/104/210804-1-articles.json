I\u0027ve got no idea how to go about dumping random stuff ripped out of other projects into this specific version of Unity. I don\u0027t know whats in the original download, so I don\u0027t know what would be missing so trying to reconstruct the zip based on random DLL files left in random git repos seems like... a less than ideal way to get things setup. Hoping someone just has the original file and can either post an upload, or list all the files so I could try to reconstruct the content of the download in such a way that the package manager knows what to do with it and the original instructions still work, just with my reconstructed zip file instead of the original download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos113","CreatedById":210475,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-12T20:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchive found of text mesh pro\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://archive.org/details/text-mesh-pro-release-1.0.56.2017.3.0b-2-dll-only\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://archive.org/details/text-mesh-pro-release-1.0.56.2017.3.0b-2-dll-only\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-13T02:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was me, thanks for spreading the news!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechDragon","CreatedById":188807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T07:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you guys so much for this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HB Stratos","CreatedById":187428,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-26T20:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much for this archive link!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
