When you zoom in on a display to read it more clearly or adjust the display settings it cuts off most of the bottom of lower screens if not the entire screen itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to change the cameras\u00A0vertical view angle range to be able to look down more but can\u0027t find anything in the parts files for those cockpits that relates to max view angle. I know I did it in the past for older versions of KSP but its either been so long I\u0027ve forgotten or how those settings are handled has been removed, moved or changed in the part cfg.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know of how to do this? And if so could you tell me what to add/change and where. I have a feeling it\u0027s just a case of adding a vertical view angle variable somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
