Also, I saw the same issue in a 1.7.0 install with a different copy of the most recent trajectories mod from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E. Also, please tell me if I am wrong about it being compatible with ro and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E though I did see a youtuber use it in ro/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E, I think he was called nessus.\u00A0 It was the falcon heavy moon landing video with rocket man music in the background. Though he was using 1.2.2 so I think things have changed since then. Also I am new to this forum thing so if I have posted this in the wrong place, sorry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
