I\u0027ve changed the passive antenna of the Sputnik core itself (from SXT) to have a transmit rate of 0.5625 Mits/sec and packet interval of 0.4. When I transmit data in-game I get a transmit rate of 1.41 Mits/sec! Can anyone explain why this happens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-26T01:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guessing that since 0.5625/0.4 = 1.40625 - which would round to 1.41 that 0.5625 Mits/sec is really Mits/packet. Units work out better that way too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
