A book by Andy Weir (author of \u0022The Martian\u0022) - \u003Cstrong\u003EProject Heil Mary\u003C/strong\u003E - has been released recently, and in there we are presented with (besides a friendly kerbal-eqsue space crab and a lot of other things) the concept of Spin-drives, which use the resourse known as \u0022Astrophage slurry\u0022 (long story short, it\u0027s an extremely\u00A0high energy density fuel). I likes the idea so much, and there were no KSP mods of them (obviously), so I decided to make one myself. There is just one problem: I don\u0027t know how. I know how to make basic models in Blender (with some REALLY basic useless texturing), and I know how to write .cfgs (could probably even try to make a Waterfall cfg for the engine), but I also know that to put a model in game you need to load it through Unity and stuff, and it also probably needs materials assighned, textures, bitmaps and other stuff waay out of my league.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBasically, \u0022made some shapes in Blender and am looking for someone who could\u00A0\u00A0use them to make a proper mod\u0022 lol.
