Beginner question here, I recently made my first custom part for ksp, an engine. While making the .cfg I noticed a field called \u0022ratio\u0022 in the propellant section. Only answer I\u0027ve found on google is from the documentation wiki which says it notes how much of a resource\u00A0is used in 1s. Although, all engine .cfgs I\u0027ve seen use 0.9 for the fuel and 1.1 for the oxidizer. So, what does that line do and how is it correlated to the overall workings of the part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-17T01:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the stock engines (0.9, 1.1) it\u0027s saying that for each 0.9 units of fuel used it will use 1.1 units of oxidizer. I\u0027m guessing that behind the scenes KSP adds up the ratios and then divides by the total to make it easy on us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
