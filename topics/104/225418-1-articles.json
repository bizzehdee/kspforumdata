I know that probably Textures Replacer Replaced to this already, but it\u0027s not compatible with my modset. Other projects I\u0027ve seen around may not work with the 1.12.x version of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m trying to figure out how to make a dedicated mod myself. There is a value in the .cfg files of the crewed parts that can be edited to allow Kerbals to wear helmet in IVA. My idea is to create a patch to allow changing this value in-flight. I can handle Module Manager quite well, but still on my first steps of understanding how to use B9 Part Switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the basic idea. I\u0027d appreciate a feedback on that and any advice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuture developments may also include auto switch for given situations (eg wearing helmet in suborbital situation), and/or allowing also suit switching in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
