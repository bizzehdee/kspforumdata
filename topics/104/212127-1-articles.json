I\u0027m wondering if someone could give me a brief guide on how to edit the visual pack to make it work. Of course, I can edit the config files, which I sort of understand, but is there a way to edit them mid-game so I don\u0027t have to keep reloading KSP? Also, what changes should I make besides simply scaling up the atmospheres by the appropriate sizes? How do I shift effects to different planets? Lastly, do I have to delete the Scatterer and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E configs that come with JNSQ to have it work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
