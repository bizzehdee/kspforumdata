So far I have two solutions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRelease two versions of the add-on\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRelease the add-on in two parts, a main file and a choice of two texture files\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first could be tedious to maintain updates, while the second seems overkill for such a small add-on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a standard approach to this? I\u0027ve been away from KSP for a few years so I\u0027ve missed a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve had a bit of a look around at what others are doing, and it appears that only a few other mods (all of which are much larger in scope than mine) offer a choice of texture resolutions. Should I just scale down the textures to 2k resolution and and not bother with 4k?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-23T09:38:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2020 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CiXwOw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated after further research\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
