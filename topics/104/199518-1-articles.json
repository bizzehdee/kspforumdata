With that in mind, could a mod that checks for various things which modify entryCost, and then returns a modified entryCost be made?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider two example engines, engine A and engine B. Engine B is a related descendant of engine A. The mod checks to see if engine A has been researched, and if it has it checks for a module called \u0022EntryCostMod\u0022 or something like that within engine B\u0027s .cfg. Inside \u0022EntryCostMod\u0022 it finds engine A = .45, and if engine A has been researched, it multiplies engine B\u0027s entryCost by the specified value (0.45). This would make an awful lot possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor bonus points, some way to handle contracts to buy a certain quantity of parts would be amazing, but difficult I think. Perhaps a reasonable surrogate for this would be to have a bit of code that keeps track of every time you buy a part, and to have a module in the part .cfg\u00A0 called \u0022QuantityDiscount\u0022 or something that looks at the running list of how many times you\u0027ve bought a part, and uses a simple formula to apply a discount to the cost of that part such that buying the part over and over again makes the cost asymptotically approach a specified portion of the original cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for taking a look. EDIT: Forgot to mention, but if the quantity discount bit is possible, would it also be possible to make it work for resources like fuel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-11T19:05:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2021 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Nnimrod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hemeac","CreatedById":59783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-14T01:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree, this would be great if one could distinguish this level of granularity.\u00A0 BDB does this to an extent with their engines insofar as some of the variants with the\u00A0 B9 part switch require an upgrade.\u00A0 I am trying to do this more cleanly within my update to my tech tree mod.\u00A0 Each engine will be first unlocked as a \u0022prototype\u0022 and then subsequent tiers will unlock the \u0022base specs\u0022 and then a follow up tier for an upgrade.\u00A0 Yet you are also describing something a bit more complex in that one could link engines by technology type.\u00A0 So if you have researched an expander cycle engine, all subsequent parts that are expander cycles would be relatively cheaper to unlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
