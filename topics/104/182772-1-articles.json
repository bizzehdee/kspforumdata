While I understand how to convert the resources of one mod into the resources of another at a 1 : 1 rate (i.e., convert 1 unit of Kerbalism O2 to 1 unit of RealFuels LOx), because of the way Kerbalism handles resources, a 1 : 1 conversion is not possible. Is there any way to convert one resource to another at a non-linear rate? Effectively, one unit of Kerbalism O2 becoming\u00A00.002 units of RealFuels LOx?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-09T18:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShouldn\u2019t a resource converter with O2 as the input (ratio 1) and LOx as the output (ratio 0.002) work for this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
