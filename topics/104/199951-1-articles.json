So at this point my abilities include being able to load a mod\u0027s source, fix the references, and recompile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an abandoned mod that\u0027s marked ARR that I really want to use to make some videos. The last release is on Github, and I was able to get it compiled and loaded into 1.10.1, however it still doesn\u0027t work. Invoking it causes lots of nullrefs in some code that I don\u0027t know how to fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s where I\u0027m bumping into the license question, even for my own personal use - because is it sketch to ask for code help in fixing an ARR mod for my own personal use? Pasting code in a forum message seems out of bounds, but anyone can look at the github and see the code at line 42 right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess I\u0027m asking how it\u0027s viewed culturally to ask for help getting an abandoned mod working for personal use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
