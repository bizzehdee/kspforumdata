It always moves along the global axis, in this case the X axis.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am attaching some images for clarity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would like to make the piece move along the red line and not along the yellow one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI realized the object on blender and used the\u00A0io_object_mu tool to export it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks a lot for the help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/oLGnyvw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/oLGnyvw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/NqFCCt4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/NqFCCt4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-15T01:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are you using to move the pieces? A robotics module? some modules have a set axis that they move parts on - you might consider flipping the model around so the part moves along the X axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
