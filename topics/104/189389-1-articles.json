Now I\u0027m trying to do a combination of things that I don\u0027t have a complete\u00A0analog for, and I\u0027m not entirely sure it is possible with just a config file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to use the SXT Mk2 Centrifuge in a space station with somewhat different behavior. I would like to make it only be habitable and consume power while it is rotating. I think I can do them separately. It uses FSanimateGeneric for the rotation, but I think I can remove that and use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E behavior of combining a ResourceConverter and AnimationGroup modules to make it consume power only while rotating (even though I\u0027ll lose the gradual spin up and down), and I found a reference to\u00A0deployableHabRestrictor, which I assume does exactly what it sounds like it does. My question is: is there is a way to make the game trigger both of those together?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been using these for reference:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_module_animation_group.html\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAnimationGroup\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_module_resource_converter.html\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EResourceConverter\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module#ModuleResourceConverter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOtherConverter\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112308-allow-moduleanimationgroup-to-consumegenerate-resources-when-used-on-its-own/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EOld Thread\u003C/a\u003E. Mostly those just showed me how much I don\u0027t understand about what I\u0027m doing and how incomplete the documentation is. Given that my ungodly number of mods (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and a pile more, on top of 1.2.2 still (I hope that doesn\u0027t screw me)) makes restarting KSP with changes take many minutes, I don\u0027t really want to fight this pure trial-and-error. Any input is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: After my first attempt at using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E behavior, it starts the animation and the power usage correctly, but when I turn it off, the power usage stops but the animation continues.
