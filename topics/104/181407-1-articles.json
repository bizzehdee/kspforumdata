The only major change to\u00A0the model was that it was scaled down in Blender to match KSPs\u0027 scale. I did a lot of reading and searching, and seem to have the vast majority of the work done. The part appears in game with the correct model, hitbox,\u00A0and test stats (cfg copied from the atmosphere sensor, currently unchanged). The only problem is, it doesn\u0027t texture properly at all. It renders just fine in Unity, but renders improperly in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ve somewhat figured out the problem; the model accepts four different texture files, which map to different sections of the model. I set all four of these properly in Unity, and it looks fine there. But in game, it seems to map the last defined texture in the list to the entire model! I replaced the last texture with \u0022none\u0022 to be certain, and sure enough, the entirely model was re-textured to an off white color in game. I tried looking for questions that related to this problem, but I didn\u0027t find anything helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes KSP support this, and I\u0027m just doing it wrong? Do I have to jump through loop holes to make it work? Or am I approaching this entirely wrong? Keep in mind, this is my first attempt at modding KSP. I apologize if I\u0027m not providing enough info; feel free to tell me exactly what you need to see and I\u0027ll look into adding it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-15T08:25:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2019 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pacca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded missing text\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-15T15:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi you can only\u00A0 have one material per mesh,\u00A0 theres no way( i know of ) to get more than one without having individual mesh objects each carrying their own material/shader\u00A0 and texture set .\u00A0 I\u0027d expect there to be a warning in the inspector that you have more materials than renderers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
