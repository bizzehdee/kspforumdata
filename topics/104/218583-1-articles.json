I\u0027ve been trying to modify an IVA space from a mod called \u0022Deck\u0027s Saturn V\u0022. To do this, I\u0027ve installed the Unity version specified in the original forum post, downloaded PartTools and imported them through the Assets menu. I\u0027ve successfully selected my GameData folder and the IVAs are appearing in the list, but when I spawn them they don\u0027t contain any props. I\u0027ve checked that the original cfg files do in fact have props listed, and the Props list shows the required props (I can also spawn them), but they are not spawning in with the model. I\u0027ve also noticed that other things like seats and WindowEyeTransforms are loading. Sometimes only 1 prop is loading, like in the Mk3 cockpit it loads a singular CargoBag in the 0,0,0 position. Does anyone know what the issue could be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-24T08:55:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2023 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 24\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by MirageDev\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MirageDev","CreatedById":229989,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-24T09:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems like it gives up on loading the props after the singular prop thing throws an error. The error says something about a failed parsing of a Vector3, that might be why the singular prop is in the 0 position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MirageDev","CreatedById":229989,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-24T11:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixed the issue.
