That gives you the liters of solid fuel that it will contain by using (circle area) x (length) which you may recall is PI * radius^2 * height. A cubic meter is of course 1000 liters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, when I search that link, I see the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is 1m diam and 9m long. That\u0027s 7068 liters (pi * 9 * 0.5^2). The gross mass is listed as 8425 kg and dry\u00A0as 1245 kg. That\u0027s 7180 kg of fuel. I\u0027m not sure what fuel it uses but common ones are PBAN\u00A0and HTPB. I used to pretend all my custom rockets used HTPB so I\u0027ll pretend it\u0027s that. There are various formulations of solid fuel (even of HTPB) but we need to pick one so I usually go\u00A0with 1.77 kg per liter. I think that\u00A0was the same value used by RealFuels too. Anyway, given that we can tell the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E has\u00A0about 4056 liters of fuel (7180\u00A0/ 1.77).\u00A0 Seems like it\u0027s 57.4% fuel to volume (which seems low but I \u003Cem\u003Ethink \u003C/em\u003EI did the math right).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow convert real life version into KSP by scaling it down and changing to the KSP mass of solid fuel (unless you\u0027re using a different fuel). KSP solid fuel is heavy as I recall. But anyway from here is takes needing to know the size of your part. You\u0027ll need to finish the math.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-04T01:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[MOD - Moved to\u00A0General Mod Development Help and Support\uFEFF subforums]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
