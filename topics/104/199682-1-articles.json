For balance reasons I don\u0027t want any parts there that I haven\u0027t put there, and for memory reasons I don\u0027t want the game loading any resources it won\u0027t be using. How should I handle mods that add many parts that I won\u0027t use, but which add some parts that I absolutely want? Like for instance BDB. The point being that I don\u0027t want to load a bunch of textures and models that I won\u0027t be using.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1. Don\u0027t use those mods, and instead redistribute only the assets required within my mod. The issue with this is that not all mod\u0027s licenses/authors allow for this. Although it definitely saves memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 2. Include a patch that deletes all parts except those from my mod. I make the other parts mods dependencies and I don\u0027t redistribute any art. This is maximally compatible, but is KSP going to waste memory loading resources for parts that aren\u0027t even being loaded?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps something could be done with Janitor\u0027s closet?
