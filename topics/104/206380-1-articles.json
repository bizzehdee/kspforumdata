Pretty much, my thinking is since the robotics drifting barely occurs in orbit due to the lack of external forces, the \u0022fix\u0022 for the issue should just be to reset all forces on a craft every time it saves part positions. Like, save the position/motion data of the root part for reloading the craft in the correct location, but then set gravity/acceleration/rotational force to zero for the craft, give a few seconds for the craft to settle, and then save part positions. I believe this could be accomplished with the \u0022OnSave\u0022 method and editing vehiclephysics.gravity but I don\u0027t know enough about this to have any clue if this is viable. Any assistance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-13T05:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTopic has been moved to Add on Development hell.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
