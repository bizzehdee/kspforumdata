You can to a small extent make things more likely to float or sink through the use of the parameter \u0022buoyancy =\u0022 . 0 for not buoyant and 1 and up for more buoyant. The config for the stock Mk1 pod has a good example. But it is the mass of the object vs it\u0027s Drag Cube that play the biggest part. The drag cube is determined by the visual model size, not by it\u0027s colliders. If you don\u0027t have a specified Drag Cube in your config file then the game auto calculates on loading up. If the mass doesn\u0027t overcome the Drag Cube then it floats. The simplest thing to do if you want something to sit lower or sink in the water is to go into the PartDatabase text file in the main Kerbal Space Program folder, find a part that has a smaller but similar drag cube and copy it\u0027s auto calculated drag cube into your config. The game will use the Drag Cube you have in the config and so there will be less surface area vs the mass of the object calculated and it will be more likely to sink or sit lower in the water. Best not done on wing parts as the Drag Cube also affects flight/lift characteristics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
