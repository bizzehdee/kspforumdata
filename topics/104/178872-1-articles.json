I don\u0027t know what a BIN file is, and when I open one I just get corrupted text. They are clearly important for something, but I don\u0027t know what. What is a bin file and how do I edit/create one to work with a planet pack I am making?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
