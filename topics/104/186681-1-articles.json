They are overwhelmingly the most modern iteration of a series of launch vehicles that go back to the 60s, with development started in the 50s. The reason for this is pretty much common knowledge in the KSP crowd, but KSP does not model this at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m looking for ways to accomplish this. When I started with my project I assumed I could do this with the inbuilt part upgrades module, but unfortunately that really does not seem to be the prince that was promised. I can modify mass and cost, and maybe more, but I can\u0027t say... modify the contents of a RESOURCE node, or add a new module. Or make a\u00A0ModuleEnginesFX use different propellants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say I want to make a redstone missile engine, first iteration, and put in in the 20 science level, and make an upgraded version in the 45 science node that has better Isp, thrust, and uses a different propellant. Upgrade nodes allow me to accomplish the thrust and Isp, but not the propellant change. So instead of upgrades, how about I just make a new part and have it\u0027s availability or entryCost depend on whether or not the first engine at the 20 science level was purchased? Is there a way for me to hide parts in the tech tree, and make them show up when the player pays the entryCost for a different part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal redstone engine was the NAA 75-110, and it started out as an ethanol75/lox engine, like the A-4 engine it was derived from, and as development continued they switched it over to Hydyne/lox, which resulted in improved Isp, about 10% more thrust, and hydyne is more dense than ethanol, so they got more fuel in the existing tanks. If they had never invested in NAA, and gotten them to develop the 75-110 engine, they would never have had access to the improved hydyne burning variant. Incidentally they ended up going back to ethanol for the mercury missions that used redstone/juno, but not for performance reasons, and KSP doesn\u0027t model hazardous materials either, so that\u0027s irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-24T21:55:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2019 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Nnimrod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nnimrod","CreatedById":152586,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T20:05:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose it\u0027s worth mentioning that one way of accomplishing this would be to rebuild the tech tree entirely, such that individual part lines have their own nodes/progressions of nodes.
