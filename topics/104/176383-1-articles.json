Yeah. I\u0027ve found the file that controls kerbals, it\u0027s in the Squad parts folder under \u0022Prebuilt\u0022 for those wondering, and I\u0027ve given them the \u0022ModuleResourceIntake\u0022 module and set it to \u0022EVA Propellant\u0027 instead of \u0022IntakeAir\u0022, using the \u0022miniIntake\u0022 .cfg\u00A0as a template. It hasn\u0027t worked. Could someone give me advice on how to actually give kerbals\u00A0air intakes? I also want to know how to use the\u00A0EVA pack with the parachute deployed, if that\u0027s even a thing that can be done without absurd levels of coding knowledge that I just don\u0027t have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-05T13:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be surprised if a Kerbal would be able to function like a vessel, executing partmodules. Instead, I would create some global process which simulates the desired effects by applying the forces fo the Kerbal body. That way you could effectively turn a kerbal into a kind of superman, zipping around the sky flying faster than a bullet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-05T13:39:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2018 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
