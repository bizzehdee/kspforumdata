I was wondering if there\u0027s a way I can add custom assets/models to a planet\u0027s surface in a specific area. A bit like how the monoliths and easter eggs are models placed on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso what about placing models in orbit.\u00A0 I wanted to make a cylindrical object in orbit, based of the Rama spacecraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone knows how to please let me know, or refer me to a youtube tutorial (as I can\u0027t find one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
