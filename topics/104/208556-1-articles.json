There is no animation. So look at a stock elevon config file, Then look at the model for that config file in a 3d program to see what relates to what. Normal elevons need to just be a separate piece all on their own. Canards are 2 but the module only pivots so you can\u0027t make a wing with built in flaps that way. I remember that there were some multistage flaps in, I Think, Airplane Plus. But I have never looked to see how they functioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume that if you are working on the part that you already have the set up for 3D modeling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-12T18:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi again. I remembered that of course rudders can act like a wing with a flap built in. I had a look and they use the \u0022ModuleControlSurface\u0022 module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Shuttle Rudder config has a good example. If you look at it\u0027s model in a 3D modeling program you will see that it is 2 pieces. The mesh that acts as the moving part of the rudder is the one named as the transform in the module. Take note of where it it\u0027s origin is placed, as this is the point the module rotates the mesh around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe multipart flaps in Airplane Plus use the \u0022ModuleAeroSurface\u0022 module. That is the module the Airbrakes use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to learn how these things work is to study stock configs and look at the models for them in Blender/BforArtists with .mu plugin to see what corresponds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood Luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
