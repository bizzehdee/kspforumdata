It currently works for stock Kerbin and Earth on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. On OPM everything in the mod works fine, except that there are no ground stations for Kerbin in OPM, which makes the mod unusable. Real Antennas has a PlanetPacks folder with config files for stock and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E which add the ground stations. I tried copying the config for stock and making it run for OPM to add the 3 Real Antennas ground stations to Kerbin, but it doesn\u0027t do anything. I don\u0027t know what to do, please help.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nConfig File I made for OPM:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@Kopernicus:FOR[RealAntennas]:NEEDS[Kopernicus,OPM]\n{\n    @Body[Kerbin]\n    {\n        @PQS\n        {\n            @Mods\n            {\n                City2\n                {\n                    name = DSNTrackingStation\n                    objectName = Kerbal Space Center\n                    isKSC = True\n                    lat = 0.09694\n                    lon = -74\n                    alt = 93.7\n                    enabled = True\n                }\n                City2\n                {\n                    name = DSNTrackingStation\n                    objectName = Charon Station\n                    isKSC = False\n                    lat = 0\n                    lon = 54\n                    alt = 299.9\n                    enabled = True\n                }\n                City2\n                {\n                    name = DSNTrackingStation\n                    objectName = Pluto Station\n                    isKSC = False\n                    lat = 0\n                    lon = 174\n                    alt = 3412.2\n                    enabled = True\n                }\n                @City2[*TrackingStation],*\n                {\n                    commnetStation = True\n                    snapToSurface = True\n                    snapHeightOffset = 0\n                    up = 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\n                    rotation = 0\n                    order = 100\n                }\n                @City2[*TrackingStation],*\n                {\n                    LOD\n                    {\n                        Value\n                        {\n                            visibleRange = 30000\n                            keepActive = False\n                            model = BUILTIN/Dish\n                            scale = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1\n                            delete = False\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe block inside @Kopernicus:FOR[RealAntennas]:NEEDS[Kopernicus,OPM] does run, but it doesn\u0027t add the ground stations to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s the source, if it would be of any help: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/DRVeyl/RealAntennas/tree/master/GameData/RealAntennas/PlanetPacks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/DRVeyl/RealAntennas/tree/master/GameData/RealAntennas/PlanetPacks\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
