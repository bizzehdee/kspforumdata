The idea is I can put it in orbit somewhere, brim the tanks, land it (powered or not depending on destination), collect science on the surface (4 goo, 4 materials, 1 temp, 1 pressure, 2 seismic and 2 gravity, plus the crew reports, surface samples and EVA reports), then return the whole lot to orbit, ready to offload the science to a lab, brim the tanks and reuse it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time I\u0027ve added batteries etc it\u0027s dV is down to 4.8km/s.

Going to orbit and back with just rocket fuel is HARD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing 48-7S engines (30 kn thrust, ISP 350 s vacuum, 0.1 t), to get a dV of 6 km/s (vac) 82.6% of your vehicle mass must be fuel. An additional 1/8th of the fuel mass must be tankage, so fuel \u002B tanks will equal 92.9% of your vehicle\u0027s mass. With a fully fueled TWR of 1.25, the engines must be 4.1% of the mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that everything but engines and fuel tanks on your vehicle must be only 3% of its mass. Your pod and scientific payloads add up to 5.4 tons, but that\u0027s not counting docking ports, RCS tanks/fuel/thrusters, parachutes, landing gear, solar panels, batteries, ladders, and anything else you need. For example, I see 8 parachutes on your vehicle. That\u0027s another 1.2 t. already. I\u0027ll assume your \u0022payload\u0022 ends up at around 8 tons. That means your vehicle must weigh 267 tons fully fueled (and need 109 Rockomas 48-7S engines). With aerospikes, it\u0027s even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, even allowing 5000 m/s to get into orbit and 500 m/s to dock, deorbit, and land, you only need 5.5 km/s of dV. That extra 500 m/s DOUBLES your payload fraction to 6%, but that still gives you a very fat, unwieldy vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d be much better off using jet engines, whether on a spaceplane or a VTOL. If you airhog, payload fractions can reach 30%, and that might be without counting the command pod and structural mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also want to consider not going all the way to orbit. I don\u0027t know how much dV you need to perform a suborbital hop between antipodal points on Kerbin, but it\u0027s possible that doing that twice is still easier than going to orbit. This is especially true for spaceplanes. A mach 5 circumnavigation would take about 40 minutes, but depending on the design it should be possible to pop up out of the atmosphere so you can use timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endolf","CreatedById":71701,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T07:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the feedback.
