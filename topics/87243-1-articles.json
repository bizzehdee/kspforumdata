Chain killing kerbals[upwards of 30-40 in a flight], but not actually, as it just lists the \u0022K.I.A\u0022 icon, but you can iva/eva and control just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a work around to this I was wondering if anyone knows a way to stop rep loss due to kerbal death? Neither of us are the kind who would suffer very much from that anyway[since no killing of kerbals], but I can\u0027t find anywhere in settings or configs that I can set to 0 rep loss on death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be great,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
