You\u0027ll be able to recover and refuel, but likely won\u0027t be able to add any parts to the vessel (so no new payloads). I haven\u0027t finalized anything on it though, so I may be able to come up with something that allows you to add parts as well. I had originally planned on making the EXACT vessel (plus fuel) be put out immediately, but I might be able to force you into the SPH/VAB to make any changes and forbid editing afterward.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting \u0022workaround\u0022 (well not really a workaround, more a gameplay extension to make it feel more fun to reuse spacecraft) that I\u0027ve been meaning to try is to literally re-use the same ship. Warning: I haven\u0027t actually done this in game yet (haven\u0027t had the time) but I have given it thought, and I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027ll work. There\u0027s a couple minor issues, but both have workarounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 0: Have KAS installed, build a fuel truck (at minimum a fuel tank and some wheels to move around), and build a crane truck (something to pick up payloads and move them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Spec out SSTO and have it and the payload built as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Launch and deploy payload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Land back at KSP, but instead of recovering the vessel simply park it off to the side of the hangar. If you need to recover science simply have your pilot hop out of the cockpit, grab the data and walk back to the astronaut center (or just hit recover once he\u0027s out of the vessel). DO NOT RECOVER THE SSTO, leave it sitting off to the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Design and build a new payload that will work with your current SSTO, start building it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: Before your new payload is complete have your fuel truck refuel your SSTO. Drive it over, and use KAS to link them and pump fuel across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Once payload is complete \u0022launch\u0022 it. Not with the SSTO, just the payload on it\u0027s own, stabilize it if necessary so it doesn\u0027t fall over and blow up. It\u0027ll just sit on the runway. Move your crane truck over, pick it up, drive back to your parked SSTO and lower it into the cargo bay, securing with either docking clamps or with KAS struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 7: Wheel your SSTO back out to to the runway and take off, deploying the next payload to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse and repeat from step 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the limitations are that you have to land at KSC, or develop an actual recovery process via rovers or boats (certainly a non-trivial task). In addition there\u0027s two \u0022issues\u0022 I foresee:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Refueling your fuel truck. The workaround for this would be to simply build a rocket that\u0027s just a fuel tank. That would take about 2 seconds to build, at which point you could move your truck up to it and suck the fuel out. Alternatively you could build a Karbonite based mining facility beside the KSC and refuel like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Getting a kerbal to man the SSTO after it has been parked (or a Kerbal to run the refueling via KAS). Obviously you don\u0027t want your pilot just sitting in the SSTO waiting for the next launch, so you\u0027ve recovered him and he\u0027s happily relaxing in the astronaut lounge. No matter how many candy bars you promise him, he just won\u0027t leave there unless you \u0022launch\u0022 a new vehicle for him to fly. The workaround for this would be to build a rocket that\u0027s just a command pod or a crew can. Super cheap, quick to build (even moreso if it\u0027s in inventory). Once it\u0027s done have Billybob Kermin hop out and walk to the SSTO. Recover the command pod/crew can for use in your next crew \u0022deployment\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m intending to do a video proof of concepting this when I get time. Hopefully later this week or early this weekend...although that also depends on getting the recording software up and running on my laptop which may prove non-trivial given my limited hard drive space at current. At the very least I\u0027ll get a series of screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpeaking of funds, with the next update there will be a radical change to how funds work (as a result of integration into the Scrapyard API/developing a common base with Kerbal 4X). You no longer will receive funds for recovering vessels but only pay once for a part. Once it\u0027s in the inventory you never have to pay for it again. You\u0027ll also be able to sell parts. Oh, this also includes Fuel and other resources. So basically we (SiriusSam and I) are rewriting how Stock does recovery.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t there also be a monetary cost to refurbish the parts for use again? (meaning beyond just build points). Surely at least some minor things needed to be replaced on an engine and not just polished with a rag and hit with some WD-40. Maybe something like 10% of the base cost of the item (excluding fuel) is required to refurbish a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition (more for long term plans), what about marking certain parts as single use only? Things like an ablative heat shield can\u0027t really just be slapped back on the bottom of a new rocket as if they weren\u0027t used before (unless the ablative \u0027resource\u0027 needs to be re bought, I can\u0027t exactly recall how DRE works with that, it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve used it in my saves). Single use only items would be recovered for funds like in the old model and multi-use items would be recovered into inventory to be refurbished (with cost and build points)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snoman314","CreatedById":106370,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T22:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d chip in and mention I had problems with this mod when I had Tarsier Space Tech installed as well.

If I get a chance I\u0027ll try to take a look, but my free time has diminished to nearly nothing recently and I don\u0027t expect that to change any time soon. I am planning on trying to get a 0.25 compatibility update out as soon as 0.25 hits, but It\u0027ll just be a compatibility update. It\u0027d be cool to integrate with the strategies system (build faster at higher costs, stuff like that) but I won\u0027t be doing that right away. Maybe not letting you build ships if the VAB/SPH are destroyed or unlock tech if R\u0026amp;D is destroyed. I\u0027m hoping for a quick update without too much to change though for the initial update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Nori: It should be that the reconditioning rate is the sum of all of the VAB rates. So when you upgrade any of the rates, or unlock new ones, the reconditioning time should decrease. The total BP is based on mass (and Overall Multiplier) so that won\u0027t change, but the rate should be. Reconditioning takes place as a secondary rate slot since repairing the launchpad would be independent of the warehouses building ships (but higher rates = better crew and better/more crew means faster repairs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, if I ever rewrote KCT I think I\u0027d take a similar approach to the whole thing. You\u0027d hire crew with funds or science that could build ships faster, maybe even have them earn experience for every ship built. And you could buy upgrades to your facilities to build mutliple ships or have reductions in costs. Basically, gameify it even more. Though I have no intention of rewriting KCT.

It\u0027s adds a great level of challenge and metric tons of depth to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was reading through this thread and found this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpeaking of funds, with the next update there will be a radical change to how funds work (as a result of integration into the Scrapyard API/developing a common base with Kerbal 4X). You no longer will receive funds for recovering vessels but only pay once for a part. Once it\u0027s in the inventory you never have to pay for it again. You\u0027ll also be able to sell parts. Oh, this also includes Fuel and other resources. So basically we (SiriusSam and I) are rewriting how Stock does recovery.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I get concerned about the idea that I could be using the same parts over and over throughout the whole game, and the affect this may have on build styles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if it would be possible to keep the current method of recovery (receive funds) as an option in future releases. Frankly, I prefer the abstraction of part reuse in funds recovered instead of specific parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, would it be possible to recover \u003Cem\u003Efractional \u003C/em\u003Eparts? Parts have a lifetime over which they naturally wear out, after which they would be unusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if we\u0027re recovering individual parts for re-use, is there an expense in funds to recover the parts based on their distance from KSP? In the game now, this is incorporated into the recovery rewards by reducing the value of parts further from KSP. In the system you\u0027re describing, I\u0027m not clear on what the penalty is for recovery of parts distant from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor context, my play-style focuses on small payloads put in orbit using small, efficient, disposable lifters. Re-usability isn\u0027t important for me because the value of what I would recover is marginal (e.g. the cost of adding parachutes to most of my stages for recovery results in a monetary \u003Cem\u003Eloss\u003C/em\u003E). In this context, I would really prefer the option to keep the current method of recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and keep up the great work.

I MAY be able to provide a way to keep the current system, but it wouldn\u0027t be as easy as adding a config option and a couple if statements like it would be if the code was internal to KCT. How it works is that when you recover some parts, KSP gives you the funds, and Scrapyard takes the total amount (before recovery modifiers, aka MORE than what you were given) back. When you launch a ship KSP takes your money and Scrapyard gives it back. That way parts in the inventory don\u0027t effectively cost anything, but you still have penalties for recovering far from KSC. You could then sell the parts for funds (at a reduced rate that we haven\u0027t determined, I like 95% personally).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T18:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll defo give that .dll a go. i\u0027m starting a new save for the purposes anyway so no fear.
