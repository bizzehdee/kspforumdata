This is the story of those missions. Names have been changed to protect the stupid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 1: The Lander\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent the Laythe mission first, with a pilot. He\u0027s the only pilot that\u0027s important here. So this ship included two main elements:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - the Laythe Lander. The only ship involved that can land back on Kerbin with The Pilot, because it\u0027s the only one with parachutes. Let\u0027s call her \u0022The Eagle\u0022, because she\u0027s a lander, and a plane.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - the Laythe Transfer Stage - the nuclear-engined vehicle to move the Laythe Lander to Laythe, and back. I\u0027ll call him \u0022Skimpy\u0022, because as it turns out, he had nowhere near enough fuel to get The Eagle\u00A0back to Kerbin. This happens to me a lot with Laythe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we have, basically, two vessels involved here. I get to Laythe, land, do the science, everything is fine. I return to orbit and redock with Skimpy, the transfer stage with basically no fuel left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do I do? I send an ISRU unit to Jool space, so I can make some new fuel, refuel Skimpy, and get The Eagle back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 2: The Refueler\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI send an ISRU unit, capable of extracting and refining fuels, to Vall. I like to use Vall as an ISRU base. Pretty low gravity, and pretty close to the middle of the Jool system. This ISRU mission, again, has two main vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - The ISRU Lander. Capable of landing, extracting, converting, and re-orbiting, with extra fuel and ore. It works great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - The ISRU Transfer Stage. I\u0027ll call this \u0022The Beater.\u0022 It\u0027s a fuel truck, and a transfer stage! It gets the ISRU to Vall in fine fashion, and should be useful after that as a fuel truck, to drive fuel around the system. But it\u0027s not really good for that,\u00A0you see, because the bonehead that designed it forgot a critical element: A standard docking port. See, Skimpy the Transfer Stage only has a regular-sized docking port, but sadly, The Beater only has a big Senior docking port. Kerbals can be stupid, you see, but not nearly so stupid as human players of Kerbal Space Program, who forget docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuckily, I\u0027m in a good position to send the Tylo lander to Jool space. \u0022Aha!\u0022 I think. \u0022I\u0027ll create a new fuel truck, with a standard docking port, and all will be fine.\u0022 I mean, I already meant to send a separate Tylo lander (Tylo is challenging, and requires a specialized lander). Also, I neglected to send a scanning orbiter with the ISRU unit, because I\u0027m kind of goofy like that (you\u0027ll notice a pattern by now). So I\u0027ll send the Tylo lander, a scanner to detect the ore, and a new, fancy Transfter Stage/Fuel Truck. On to Launch #3!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 3: The Tylo Lander and the New Fuel Truck\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I send this THIRD MISSION to Jool Space, having recovered nothing yet from the Laythe landing (The Eagle is still stuck in Laythe orbit, with Skimpy, the empty transfer stage). Again, having learned my lesson, this third mission also gets to Jool Space with fuel to spare. This mission includes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 - Stubby, the Tylo Lander. It has no pilot - I intend to transfer The Pilot from The Eagle and put him back when I\u0027m done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 - The Swiss Army Fuel Truck (\u0022Swiss Army\u0022, for short), which has so many docking ports on it that I can dock with things that haven\u0027t even been invented yet. These extra docking ports are stuck on the side of the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you know, I actually thought ahead for this one. I didn\u0027t want The Beater to be useless, so I also included another, small vehicle, which I call \u0022The Converter.\u0022 This is simply a senior docking port\u00A0on one end and a standard docking port on the other. It\u0027s an adapter, so I can convert The Beater into a transfer stage for The Eagle, or dock with a standard docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you confused yet? I don\u0027t blame you. I have 6 (almost 7) vehicles in Jool space now, and The Pilot is still floating around Laythe like a goofball, wondering what the heck is going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may post pictures later. I\u0027ll continue this in another post, because I\u0027m just about to go get The Pilot from The Eagle and land on Tylo. But it\u0027s not that simple, as you may have figured out. Also, this is your chance to bail on this whole thread if you\u0027re bored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T09:23:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spacebrick3","CreatedById":158990,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T08:11:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShouldn\u0027t this be in Mission Reports?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T08:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably.

In fact it\u0027s almost starting to feel like a thought experiment. I have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - The Eagle, the only vessel that can land on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - Skimpy, which can dock with The Eagle as a transfer stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - The ISRU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - The Beater, which cannot act as a transfer stage without The Converter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 - Stubby, the Tylo Lander, which, incredibly... you may find this hard to believe at this point, but it\u0027s true... has NO DOCKING PORTS. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d need them! But I never think I need them, and I ALWAYS need them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 - Swiss Army, the Transfer Stage That Can Dock With Anything, but... remember, it\u0027s regular docking port is on the side, so it cannot act as a transfer stage! You can\u0027t transfer things with big vessels stuck on the SIDE of your transfer stage, they have to be on the FRONT. The front of Swiss Army is a Senior docking port, but The Eagle has only a standard docking port.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m writing this down in stages, because it\u0027s so dang complicated, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll remember it all at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T08:30:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T08:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is the grand plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Grand Plan\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince we have all of the vehicles in Jool space, I\u0027ll just start from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Send The Beater to Stubby the Tylo Lander and Swiss Army. This will allow The Beater to pick up The Converter. Now Beater has a regular docking port, for the first time. Attach The Beater to Stubby, and send it to Laythe to pick up The Pilot, so he can land on Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENote: You may wonder why I didn\u0027t just send Stubby with his original transfer stage, Swiss Army, to Laythe to get The Pilot. Well, guess what? If you guessed \u0022the designer is an idiot\u0022, you are correct!\u00A0I designed my transfer stages with nuclear engines on the side, and the senior docking ports\u00A0can\u0027t actually re-dock with each other because the nuclear engines get in the way. I mean, it\u0027s really close, but it\u0027s just not workable. So, the ISRU cannot use its senior docking port to transfer fuel to any of the transfer stages because the nuclear engines get in the way. So the two transfer stages can only receive fuel from the ISRU using regular docking ports - which means\u00A0The Beater needs The Converter, thus allowing him to dock with the ISRU, which thank God has a regular docking port. Luckily, I never disconnected The Converter from Stubby, because as you know, Stubby cannot redock with anything, because it has no ports. I connected The Beater to The Converter while it was still attached to Stubby - probably the only smart thing I did in this mission.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Pick up The Pilot in Stubby, and go to Tylo, and land there, and PRAY TO GOD that the Delta-V chart I found online is accurate about Tylo D/V needs. I\u0027ve only ever landed there once before, and that took several tries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Send The Beater (after dropping off Stubby at Tylo) back to The Eagle to pick up The Eagle and take it to Tylo, because remember, Stubby the Tylo Lander has no docking ports, so It can\u0027t reconnect with a transfer stage. Once it gets back into Tylo Orbit, that\u0027s as far as it will ever go. I have to go get The Eagle, take it back to Tylo, and pick up The Pilot, who is almost certainly completely sick of all of this crap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T09:25:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T09:28:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T09:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Duna mission is turning out like that.
