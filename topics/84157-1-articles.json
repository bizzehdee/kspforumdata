Now for the next one a little tip: if you put a tank between those two big orange ones, and then pump fuel from \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u003C/em\u003E to the main engines, then the external tank\u0027s center of mass position won\u0027t change during flight, and the whole stack will see its CoM only move slightly towards the shuttle as it empties. In practical terms that means that if the stack is balanced thrust-wise on the pad, then by the end of the SRB burn it\u0027ll be trying to pitch \u0022up\u0022 (it\u0027ll tilt in the direction of the shuttle), but when you take out the SRBs huge thrust, wich is placed under the original CoM, things will again short of align themselves. That, and a few vernors on the tip of the ET, and you won\u0027t have to fiddle with thrust limiters during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Actually, just the vernors would do.
