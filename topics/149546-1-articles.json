Yesterday, my save file got corrupted by something (for the millionth time). My \u0022Resume Save\u0022 button was not working, so I decided to look online,\u00A0and decided to rename my most recent quicksave to \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022. The method worked, and I was able to fly the plane I was flying before I had exited the game. A small issue here was that the plane proceeded to crash, and I lost all my valuable science. (Luckily Jeb survived). I left the game, and re-entered, thinking I would start again where I left off last time. However, the game didn\u0027t load where it did previously. It loaded directly on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, which I found strange. I checked the tracking station, and saw that my destroyed plane was still destroyed, and the pilot was still alive. I recovered the parts, and went to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and designed a new launch vehicle to bring medium-light payloads into orbit. When I have Kerbal Construction Time installed, I need to build the rocket before flying it. However, this time it just directly brought me to the launch pad. I was too tired to install the mod then, so I launched my rocket, and brought it into a fly-by of the Mun, and collected some science. Once I had recovered the rocket, I went to the Research \u0026amp; Development building, and when I went to research \u0022Fuel systems\u0022, it again acted as if KCT was not installed. I then decided to save the game and exit. Today, I entered again and noticed that the \u0022outer planets mod\u0022 was not active either. So I went to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, uninstalled OPM/KCT, and re-installed them. This didn\u0027t work, it was all as it had been the day before. KWRocketry still worked, KerbalAlarmClock still worked, everything but these two mods was still working. I uninstalled them with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E again, and went to the KCT Forum and re-downloaded the mod, and installed it as per usual. This, again, didn\u0027t work. I was pretty annoyed at everything, so I went to play some Skyrim. And now we are here. If anybody has any insight, or solutions, please help me out, it would be very much appreciated. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I messed around a bit with my KSP exe\u0027s, I don\u0027t know which output log it is, I will link both of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP_DATA output log can be found\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/home/KSP_DATA%20Output?preview=output_log.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP(64x)_DATA output log can be found\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/home/KSP(64x)_Output?preview=output_log.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, thanks to everyone in advance, this is my 8th or 9th time restarting my game due to corrupt saves, I don\u0027t want to do it another time. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-01T16:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same problem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
