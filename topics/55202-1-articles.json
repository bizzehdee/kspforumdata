If you want to make one post images here and maybe a download link. I will post a more detailed tutorial when i have time (probably this weekend) if you are confused. With the real solar system mod you can move around and resize planets including sentar and all the planet factory planets. with universe replacer you can retexture the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clear things up, this does not involve redistributing modified mods, it is merely posting a .cfg file that works with the real solar system mod, it does not REQUIRE the planet factory mod, it just adds more planets to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not claim ownership of any of these mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-05T01:22:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2013 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T21:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a heads up to be careful with download links.
