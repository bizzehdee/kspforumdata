In this case I started the rocket with a 3-man-module and added another 1-man-module from the empty-modules-mod. My plan was to detach the small lander, land and then get back up to rondevouz with the 3-man-module again. Just like the Apollo-mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, most of you guessed it already - it didnt work. After separation the craft becomes Debris and couldnt be influenced any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have an old part of the Bace-pack, but even that didnt help. I do know that there is at least one mod around that adresses this, I cant remember its name, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone help me out? Does anyone know of a mod or how I can do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T12:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse MechJeb.
