Hopefully, without multiplayer getting monetized, there wouldn\u0027t be nearly as much of an incentive to create barriers. There are also limitations in tech. GTA runs on a proprietary engine, so there were a handful of people who knew how to build tools to work with said engine. With KSP2 running on Unity, a whole lot of tools are already out there and more will be made. So it\u0027s going to be very hard to stop modders. With any luck, that\u0027s enough reason for T2 to leave KSP2 alone.

Mods will be definetely a factor which will determine in future the success of KSP2. If they will proceed againist mods, not only they will not maintain their promise to allow mods for the game, but they will destroy really the entire game. Mods are something which has changed a lot KSP1 about improvements. For a complex game like KSP2 you can\u0027t proceed with a mentality which refuse any collaboration about game extensions made not from the official developers, but from videogamers. As you can see from my signature, I\u0027m an aviation enthusiast. I start to play with Flight Simulator in 2000 and after 20 years I still continue to play to that game. Why? If this feature was something which I had discovered only around 2006 with Flight Simulator X about the opportunity to add features which aren\u0027t official, this was an element which has determine the success of the microsoft series. Is a game where modders have definetely more influence than official developers, and just to explain how it was possible, I would focus about their last product, FS2020. CAUTION: IT COULD BE PRESENT \u0022TECHNICAL LANGUAGE\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they had announce FS2020, it was a great news, but few month later a lot of players was disappointed about the intention to release the game also on Xbox. With former FS2004 and FSX released in 2006, the flight control system about instruments was really accurate, the only thing which wasn\u0027t excellent was the start-up process for the most advanced planes such 737-800 and 747-400, while on small planes such Cessna 172 this process was more accurate, also if not so much deeply accurate like it happen with payware planes mods which was released for these games from 3rd parts. FS2020 has improved a lot of thing about graphics but a lot of control system was intially criticized due to their concept, which was more something which has reminded more an arcade videogame instead a simulation game. Also the promotion was a disappointment. Several players has tell that it was a bad choice make promotion with some influencers which has talked about mainstream videogames, but they haven\u0027t touched a flight simulator any time before, instead to allow the \u0022flight simulation influencer\u0022 to do their job. After one year however the situation was changed, a lot of players which haven\u0027t a real interest has leaved the game, we have in any case new members inside our community and also if there are some elements which must be improved, the success of this game was also determined from the intention from microsoft and asobo studio to allow third parts to cooperate with them.\u00A0 A news which has received a great positive feeback was the announce to support VATSIM (a multiplayer network which use realistic procedures and doesn\u0027t work only with FS2020 but also with Xplane Prepar3d and FSX) and other multiplayer networks since day 1. In addition also the opportunity to release freeware and payware add-on\u0027s was a key which has determine the success after 1 year, also if the start wasn\u0027t so excellent. And still today due to lack of mods it could be considered an uncomplete game, but in future the release of mods will definetely provide to improve game expericence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is definetely a complex game like FS2020. A developer must be concious that also when will be released, a game like this cannot be considered \u0022complete\u0022. There a lot of feature which could be added without problem, and that could improve the game experience. You can give some updates, but it will be necessary always the fantasy inside the mind of the videogamers which can give some improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sunnypunny","CreatedById":212559,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-13T23:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224063100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205894\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221638951009\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/8/2021 at 7:10 PM, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmy more examples of T2 blocking mods?

Of course, I would have told you exact same thing about Minecraft circa 2009-2010. It\u0027s hard to imagine exactly where community will go with this one, and maybe we\u0027ll have some serious community-run RP/competitive servers for KSP2 out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, these will inherently require mods. So disabling mods to prevent cheating in multiplayer that\u0027s only competitive because of mods would be totally pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in any case, I don\u0027t think there is any incentive to block mods because of multiplayer. The only reason T2 might create pressure to crack down on modding of KSP2 is if mods start cutting into DLC sales. Which isn\u0027t impossible, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s high risk right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
