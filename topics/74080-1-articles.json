However, there are no real restrictions for this, except don\u0027t cheat.

Now before I submit my entry, I\u0027d like to give you some suggestions to improve your scoring system. \u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a rundown of the scores that I believe need changing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is 5000 science the cap? I can easily get 5000 science points on a grand tour by only gathering surface samples, EVA reports and crew reports. My suggestion is to remove the cap. Also, increase the amount of science points per point. Perhaps 10-20 science points per point? Because, as it stands, science points earn you the majority of the points in the challenge. Therefore, people who do this challenge in sandbox mode are at a significant disadvantage to those who do it in career mode. Science should be a bonus, not a necessity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this considering the launch vehicle? If so, this is impossible. If not, this is also impossible. I don\u0027t see any conceivable way to keep the part count of this kind of mission that low whether considering the launch vehicle or not. I was trying to be as efficient as possible in my mission and I ended up using 424 parts with the launch vehicle (372 parts without). My suggestion is to remove this score entirely and replace it something that scores the weight of the ship without the launch vehicle. This way, you still reward the player with the smallest ship while removing the (IMHO) BS part restriction. Perhaps award the player if their ship weighs less than 60-100 tons?(for reference, my ship weighs in at 35.44 tons, which is a little less than a Jumbo 64 fuel tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3e3e3e;\u0022\u003ECan I stick 200 boosters on my launch vehicle and receive a free 200 points? This makes no sense. Either rethink it or remove it. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes exploding debris invalidate this score? Or do only explosions on your ship count? Either way, this score seems kinda unnecessary as your ship is unlikely to damaged during the mission(if you use quick-saves of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh c\u0027mon, this is easy!
