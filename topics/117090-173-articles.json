(and so much more)\n\nWith some manual config work, all of the plugins and (most of the) models exist exist to \u0027weld-your-own\u0027 fully functioning service module.  This could include the fuel tank, adapters, engine(s), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar, antenna, parachutes(?), light(s), reaction wheel, probe core, adjustable diameter fixed-length fairings, even decoupler(s) if you don\u0027t mind it being manually staged.  You can even use models from most any mod (or stock) if you felt like mix-and-matching some bits.\n\nIn the end that is all most of my \u0027modular parts\u0027 do, offering a limited selection of pre-welded models wrapped up with a UI for run-time switching of a couple things (and a bit of code to reposition/scale things properly).  However if you are up to manual config editing for single-purpose pre-welded parts... the potential part setups get pretty insane.
