I didn\u0027t feel like starting a new career game at present so I went into Sandbox and built some ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst pic is the Wraith SSTO. It can get into orbit ok it just needs more oxidiser. So the Mk 2 version is currently at the design stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I built the K.S.S Palomino which is a Kerbal rip off of the U.S.S Palomino from The Black Hole. I couldn\u0027t get it exactly how I wanted. This thing would cost at least 2 million so glad I was in sandbox mode. The lifter was monstrous and the ship itself steers like a drunk cow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/54358977669377860/5A21CDF459BDE5E0240D91EDA4526B5D193482EF/\u0022 alt=\u00225A21CDF459BDE5E0240D91EDA4526B5D193482EF\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/54358977669375436/C567C331350B7579CB51C2EC296F741E1075DA84/\u0022 alt=\u0022C567C331350B7579CB51C2EC296F741E1075DA84\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thorium","CreatedById":110282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T22:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last couple of days I\u0027ve been continuing my career mode, now updated to 0.24.
