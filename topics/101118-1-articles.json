People have suggested cutscenes (in the original thread) to fill in this space, but that would get boring fast and probably just extend the loading process. But what if we had an artistic, styled image displayed during loading scenes?\n\nWhen I say \u0022artistic\u0022, I just mean something like [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\u0026rct=j\u0026q=\u0026esrc=s\u0026source=images\u0026cd=\u0026cad=rja\u0026uact=8\u0026ved=0CAQQjBw\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Froom208.org%2Fbooru%2Fdata%2F382b88e9d34609b73cc9b930b89fd68f.jpg\u0026ei=quf0VJrVAtG0sASZu4KoAg\u0026psig=AFQjCNFtooSIbeDIRdUbHUoNpzT3OuPspg\u0026ust=1425422603716867) or [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\u0026rct=j\u0026q=\u0026esrc=s\u0026source=images\u0026cd=\u0026cad=rja\u0026uact=8\u0026ved=0CAQQjBw\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FbF2zmiW.jpg\u0026ei=xOf0VJPMCNLnsAT2vIGoCA\u0026psig=AFQjCNFtooSIbeDIRdUbHUoNpzT3OuPspg\u0026ust=1425422603716867) instead of a regular old screenshot.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\nbecause like I said, Nik loves nothing more than pointless speculation\n\nLoading the KSC from main menu shows a sunrise with the flag waving or something\n\nEntering the VAB shows Kerbals with clipboards and trucks walking/driving down a hallway toward the building area\n\nLaunching shows the VAB doors opening and trucks driving out with a tarp-covered rocket just barely visible under the door\n\nEntering the SPH shows something similar to the VAB entry\n\nLaunching from the SPH shows that good old ground-crew Kerbal eating his glowstick, as always\n\nReloading an active vessel shows the Tracking Station dishes pointing towards the sky\n\nTo clarify... none of these would be animated, they would be static pictures.\n\nIn fact, here\u0027s a good example I just found with the magical magic of Google Images:\n\n![chell\u002Bvs\u002Bglados.png](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nVUZIW1ZNOc/Tgne2EJbsUI/AAAAAAAAABA/LLXB6smiGpI/s1600/chell\u002Bvs\u002Bglados.png)\n\nBut with Kerbals. And GLaDOS would be a rocket, of course. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT: Also found this picture that would be a good fit for SPH loading. Remove the text, add in a \u0022loading...\u0022 banner, and you\u0027re set!\n\n![mqj6AIH.png](http://i.imgur.com/mqj6AIH.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T01:11:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 01:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nikola7007**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:54:51Z","Content":"I wholeheartedly endorse this product and/or service."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T01:11:37Z","Content":"Holy heck, how have we not known we needed this?!
