For me at the moment, it\u0027s just too much time commitment out of my limited time for KSP. But...if someone packed together a suite of VFX mods that are tested well to work together and look good (while of course honoring licenses, being courteous to the original modders, and supporting their own distribution), then I\u0027d be first in line to click download. To a large degree this is what some of the existing VFX suites already are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s me, who has been around creating, updating, and maintaining modded KSP installs for years and already know what I like. A modpack can lead to a very positive experience for people modding their game for the first time, as someone else has already curated the mod list and (hopefully) ensured that everything works together properly. There are a truly baffling number of mods available for KSP and the quality and utility of them varies greatly, this is a big barrier to entry for players wanting to mod their game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simple truth is that providing a well maintained, curated, and supported mod pack is providing a service to the community, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the conventional wisdom is that modpacks are bad because the potential exists for outdated versions to be circulating and generating support workload; in my experience just about every mod thread of consequence gets these anyway as not everyone is diligent about updating in the first place or are running old versions of KSP. For that matter people who install a modpack are as likely to report bugs in that thread first anyway, they might not even be aware of the dependencies or bundling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while I agree that the potential for trouble exists with mod packs, I am not sure that a blanket ban on the practice is an overall benefit to the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T23:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222975824\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157313\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488664666\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I\u0027ve mentioned reasons why this is bad for modders, old versions, unwanted support requests etc, this is also a real problem from a moderation standpoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith many repacks we\u0027re stuck with having to download the whole thing, and some can be really large, which we have to search through to find every packed mod, find its license or find its thread because the license was removed by the repacker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis takes a lot of time, hours in some cases, and we end up in arguments with the repacker over licensing, plus the trouble when they keep on doing it because hey, modpacks aren\u0027t banned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, that does sound like a tremendous pain.
