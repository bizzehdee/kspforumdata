This way you reduce a lot of lag, since the unity engine have in my findings trouble keeping stable and high fps in a 2000m/s orbit around kerbin.

It also has an extendable arm with an orbital construction pad, which is sealed throughout the ordeal from kerbin takeoff until in the desired position of construction. It is locked down since it would otherwise sway around heavily after you\u0027ve landed on Minmus, where you mine ore and construct the dockyard at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then lift from Minmus(after 5years with a 16man crew working onit) with all the weight of the dockyard allocated in the pad, which is 1000 tons. The ship itself weights around 250t dry and 400t wet. You lift slowly with VTOL engines and get the desired ascent inclination, then you slowly proceed to get a wide orbit around Minmus. Then you unlock the Orbital Pad, gently rotate it facing up, and Release the ship from the pad. After that you have a 4000 metal to convert to any other rocketparts you wish to use to build extendable parts to the dockyard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was tricky to balance an extra 1k tonne weight at the front of my ship, all rear VTOL engines had to be suspended while the front engines could push the ship upwards, then let the RCS position the ship, then hit main drives, this part is easy since the pad is aligned exactly at the center of the ship mass, so the extra 1k tons only affect the TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently discovered that, the slower a station or ship is orbiting a body, the better framerate you get!!
