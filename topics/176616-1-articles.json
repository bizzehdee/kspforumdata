I makes a change, but then again, Dracula sees more sunlight than me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery tuesday I get the house to myself (excluding cats and dogs) until 2030hrs. It is also the time of year when I stop working...20th July until my wife goes back to work in september. So, this tends to be the day I test out all of the awesome designs I have collected during the pervious seven days. No rushing. However, there is just me, so if I find a \u0027problem\u0027 i\u0027m doomed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is that \u0027we\u0027 could band together and show-off what we are testing, WIP, and any other geeky stuff related to KSPing. All you have to do is post a picture of what you are/have been testing, give a description of your experience, and feel free to add any other KSP goodness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also thought it would help with my designs too. I have been trying to design my own aircraft and will have to admit it is way harder than it looks. Strap some engines to some wings and off you go...or so I thought. My attempts have \u0022flown\u0022, but from the end of the runway straight into the sea. Here, anyone can swap ideas and problems could get solved. I hope! All of that to one side, it might just be fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andetch","CreatedById":173643,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-10T10:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223413255\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176616\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221531213701\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185178\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dr.phibes\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, dr.phibes said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also thought it would help with my designs too.

But even small wings give enough lift to fly if you are going fast enough, so check that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, but not too far. Also, make sure your speed is high enough that you don\u0027t suffer a stall after liftoff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phibes","CreatedById":185178,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-10T12:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve read all of that.
