In career mode I made a rover with the single truck wheels but they don\u0027t satisfy the requirement for the rover missions apparently. Is there somewhere I can change or add a parameter to fix this? In the meantime I made a rover with a set of regular rover wheels I can lower with IR when I need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease advise at your convenience.
