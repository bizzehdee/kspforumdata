The 2.5m engine caps at 200 GW. Which is a substantially large power network. If you can\u0027t provide that much power, you might be better off going smaller with a 1.25 engine which can cap at 25 GW. The different sized engines only vary is maximum power capacity. ISP and Thrust/MW all remain the same. They do get slightly better max TWR, but you have to maxxing power to see that happen. If you aren\u0027t providing atleast 150 GW to the 2.5, you\u0027d have better twr going with something more suitable to your networks power capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the power button, I don\u0027t know.

Trick is you have to be able to put ~1gigawatt on target at surface. That tends to translate to somewhere on the high side of 3GW in orbit...

Just make one big \u0022Rover\u0022 made up of tons of fission generators and deploy it from the SPH. can either leave it there or drive it west a few clicks so you dont have loading issues. Then the only \u0022Service\u0022 you need to do on the power supply is your yearly recover/redeploy. You could also split the difference. Have a few solars going for your every day amount of power needs and have a big power plant you deploy on the runway whenever you just need to melt some componants ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T08:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am considering starting a new game separately from my other save with this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any known mod incompatibilities I should be worrying about?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use mostly plugin mods, not others, but still wondering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T10:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tristavius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tristavius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn a station with multiple fission reactors and generators I have 3 reactors on shutdown and 1 active. Despite three being offline the transmitter is successfully drawing the full online power from all four, as long as the generator attached to each offline one remains on.

Sure, use all power satellites transmit only mode and launch few simple satellites with relay mode set transceiver, couple of solar panels and maybe a heat radiator. More stuff at orbit, yup. That\u0027s why i use ground power transmitter, especially when they run out of fuel, you either collect it and launch a new, or reprocess the fuel, something that i did for testing purpose, two 3.75m reactors, took 180h to fully reprocess 6000 actinides. Obviously one needs to remember add at least one fuel canister for depleted fuel. Oh, and i think 3.75m reactor will only stay up about 3 months at constant 100% power. Orbital powerstations are even more troublesome until you got a reprocessing ship in orbit as well. I don\u0027t recommend going faster than 1000x time warp while reprocessing or it will mess up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T22:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Makeone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Makeone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is one issue that we could consider: relay mode requires some electric charge to operate but as we already know, transmit mode eats everything from its source so nothing left for relay transceiver...\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could include a couple RTG\u0027s on the ship.
