I can\u0027t put it down.

First issue was How on earth do I align planes with the real moon, now that my home planet and the lunar plane are mis-aligned by so much? (23 degrees or something like that?) And I\u0027m now launching from Florida. I wanted to use an alignment burn. Uh uh. Too much delta-v needed. Then I tried and tried to figure out how to launch in the proper direction and how to know when I\u0027m in alignment before\u00A0I take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned (on my own) that the Kerbal Engineer\u0027s rendezvous \u00A0GUI shows the \u0022Relative Inclination\u0022 of the moon when it\u0027s the target. And the big learn was that the nav ball shows 90 degrees to launch into the pro-grade direction. So learned to watch the RI field go down close to zero by warping, then launching pure prograde during that time and it lines perfectly with the lunar plane. I watch some great YouTube tutorials (4 20-minute parts) to gain an understanding of how to use the nav ball. Still need to learn more on the nav ball from experience, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) During a manual ascent, if the time to reach\u00A0apoapsis\u00A0(?)\u00A0 is dropping and reaches 0 while I\u0027m trying to reach orbital velocity, then the launch will fail and become sub-orbital unless I correct it asap and should be able to get the time value to start going up again, instead of going down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Jan 18/2016. added one more thing)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve learned that my last comment is not correct.

First issue was How on earth do I align planes with the real moon, now that my home planet and the lunar plane are mis-aligned by so much? (23 degrees or something like that?) And I\u0027m now launching from Florida. I wanted to use an alignment burn. Uh uh. Too much delta-v needed. Then I tried and tried to figure out how to launch in the proper direction and how to know when I\u0027m in alignment before\u00A0I take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned (on my own) that the Kerbal Engineer\u0027s rendezvous \u00A0GUI shows the \u0022Relative Inclination\u0022 of the moon when it\u0027s the target. And the big learn was that the nav ball shows 90 degrees to launch into the pro-grade direction. So learned to watch the RI field go down close to zero by warping, then launching pure prograde during that time and it lines perfectly with the lunar plane. I watch some great YouTube tutorials (4 20-minute parts) to gain an understanding of how to use the nav ball. Still need to learn more on the nav ball from experience, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(snip)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sums up the controversy around MechJeb pretty much.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt helps by removing big part of gameplay - big area to experience, learn, big part of challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe question is - do you want this challenge?
