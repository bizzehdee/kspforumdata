Many concepts include a hab buried in regolith, and some include 3d printing as part of the technique. I wonder if you could have a BaseCore unit that looks like a COS part, but includes an \u0022inflate\u0022 option that is really a \u0022bury\u0022 option? Instead of \u0022rocket parts\u0022 it uses a new, \u0022regolith\u0022 resource (\u00A0name = Dirt is already in the community resources, so that is possible as well). When you get enough regolith, you can \u0022cover\u0022 the unit, and the model animates to something that looks rather like the first image. The color could be a pull-down (like picking a tank texture), and could use the actual planet texture, possibly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, we use the same regolith resource, but once you have enough, the hab gets covered with \u0022sandbags\u0022 which would presumably be easier to deal with (they\u0027l always be the same texture).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027d need a new part for gathering the regolith resource. My suggestion would be very simple: a front loader scoop. Stick it on a rover, and add an SSTU \u0022regolith\u0022 tank (configure tank). You need not do anything, the idea is that you have to land the thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLS mods that include radiation (kerbalism does, and I think I read that USILS is thinking about it) would then have the stats improved---usable without, better with the shielding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-25T20:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2016 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerfclasher","CreatedById":158707,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T19:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222861311\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479870314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138730\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn November 22, 2016 at 9:05 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon to return:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EXwuedt.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EXwuedt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EXwuedt.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow with working wheels!\u00A0 Non-sliding, non-jittering, stable and reliable.\u00A0 Steering, check.\u00A0 Brakes, check.\u00A0 Suspension...check.\u00A0 Spinning tires, yep they roll.\u00A0 Burnouts, umm, yeah... but not on this beast \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave made -very- substantial progress on the wheel-collider front in the past couple days.\u00A0 Enough that I don\u0027t feel bad about saying that the SC-E will be returning soon; I can\u0027t give exact timeframes, but its not far out (at least the wheels portion..).\u00A0 After the wheels, there are a few other things on the SC-E that I need to clean up; MOI and gui cleanup mostly.\u00A0 Probably should be able to include it for the next release along with the first round of general bugfixes/polish/balance updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Awesome to see these parts return but what is the time line\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T20:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time line is it happens when it happens. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0has stated that he\u0027s on a roughly bi-weekly schedule of updates at this point, so if it doesn\u0027t make it to the next one, then it\u0027ll be at least another couple weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T21:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shuttle is so 80s \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I\u0027m more looking forward to what mage is planning with the wheels/tracks.
