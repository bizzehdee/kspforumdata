So I have to rotate the landing gear model to work with the wing... and as such the wheel-colliders are now rotated 90\u0027 off from what they should be (e.g. instead of pointing towards the ground they point towards the rear of the craft... and as such do not function).

One of the KF tracks I was using for debug/testing/validation.\n\n![op9hQtb.png](http://i.imgur.com/op9hQtb.png)\n\nIn essence I\u0027ve brought back the ease of setup of the U4 wheel colliders (put them wherever, oriented however you want, and use as many as you want), and removed all of the silly limitations and hacky code from the U5 wheel colliders (no more forced rigidbody suspension alignment, no \u0027auto\u0027 spring/damper mangling, no strange jitters with jointed rigidbody setups).\n\nIn the shuttle image in the previous post, I just slapped on some surface-attached wheels for testing.  However the wheels are perfectly capable of being integrated back into the wings/fuselage parts, and will be done before I re-release that series of parts.\n\nWill likely be opening up a new forum thread shortly for the KSPWheel mod; it will include the plugin, a set of PartModules aimed at stock-replacement (intended use of one wheel per part), and a set of patches to re-work the stock wheels/legs/gear to use the new colliders.  For the time being though, I\u0027ll be posting dev info here and/or over at the KF thread.  When ready SSTU will include the KSPWheel mod as a packaged dependency; though I may remove the stock-wheel patches from the version that gets packed with SSTU.\n\nCurrently I\u0027m working on the feature set of the PartModules -- adding things like user-adjustable suspension parameters, doing what I can to mimic the config capabilities of the existing stock system.  After that I can look into enhancements; things the stock system cannot do, or doesn\u0027t handle very well.  Stuff like real traction control, steering curves, torque curves.  Won\u0027t be doing anything too crazy, but would like the system to be stable and usable by itself and at least give others a good starting point for further customization and enhancement.\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever spent as much time driving KSP vehicles as I have during the testing of these colliders.  I also never had as much fun with wheels under the old systems; mostly these colliders seem to \u0027just work\u0027, and give very pleasing results when setup properly for the vehicle."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T19:39:38Z","Content":"Oh cool, I remember you mentioned you would bring Kerbal Foundries back.

A couple new adapters, for example. One with an airlock on the bottom of a HAB or COS part (imagine the cylinder standing like a beer can, with a hatch near the ground on the side). The other with a hatch top or bottom such that it works with the HAB or COS part resting on its side (see the image below, and note the airlock):\n\n![16461325416_8e89b0fbdf_b.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7455/16461325416_8e89b0fbdf_b.jpg)\n\nHere is a diorama of inflatables on the Moon:\n\n![lunarbase.jpg](http://digitalvideo.8m.net/Bigelow/NEW/lunarbase.jpg)\n\nThey are apparently adding radiation shielding to the right unit. You can see the airlocks as the additional units with the ladders, but it could just as well be an adapter in SSTU, same functionality, fewer parts. Note that the tubes over the right hab are tubular sandbags, to be filled with regolith...\n\n![IsaacHH-Bigelow-Aerospace-3493.jpg](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get2/I00003ZtG20PE6rs/fit=1000x750/IsaacHH-Bigelow-Aerospace-3493.jpg)\n\nOK, now look at the first image... Many concepts include a hab buried in regolith, and some include 3d printing as part of the technique. I wonder if you could have a BaseCore unit that looks like a COS part, but includes an \u0022inflate\u0022 option that is really a \u0022bury\u0022 option? Instead of \u0022rocket parts\u0022 it uses a new, \u0022regolith\u0022 resource ( name = Dirt is already in the community resources, so that is possible as well). When you get enough regolith, you can \u0022cover\u0022 the unit, and the model animates to something that looks rather like the first image. The color could be a pull-down (like picking a tank texture), and could use the actual planet texture, possibly.\n\nAlternately, we use the same regolith resource, but once you have enough, the hab gets covered with \u0022sandbags\u0022 which would presumably be easier to deal with (they\u0027l always be the same texture).\n\nWe\u0027d need a new part for gathering the regolith resource. My suggestion would be very simple: a front loader scoop. Stick it on a rover, and add an SSTU \u0022regolith\u0022 tank (configure tank). You need not do anything, the idea is that you have to land the thing.\n\nLS mods that include radiation (kerbalism does, and I think I read that USILS is thinking about it) would then have the stats improved---usable without, better with the shielding.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-25T20:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2016 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerfclasher","CreatedById":158707,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T19:53:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On November 22, 2016 at 9:05 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Soon to return:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![EXwuedt.png](http://i.imgur.com/EXwuedt.png)](http://i.imgur.com/EXwuedt.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now with working wheels!

Holding up very well so far.  The wheels behave like wheels; landing gear like landing gear; and landing-legs just like they should.  There are a few edge cases with the wheel physics that I need to tackle, but I\u0027ve not once had it send me into orbit or throw me around unexpectedly.\n\nThe module set is becoming quite feature-rich, with perhaps a better feature set than the stock modules as far as ease of understanding and configurability goes.  They don\u0027t auto-calc anything for you, or try to hold your hand, but all of the options are there for the engineer to configure.  Have the basic modules capable of being used for tracks as well as standard wheels, so they should be compatible with as wide a range of models as possible. On the physics front I implemented a cleaner default torque curve today that gives the wheels an even more realistic and reliable response, and added some low-level anti-jitter code that cleaned up any jittering that I have seen on craft so far (without needing auto-struts). \n\nWorking on cleaning up a few more of the module features (speed-based-steering-curve?) and I\u0027ll probably have a testing release of KSPWheels available in the next couple of days.  Will contain the plugin and a set of patches to create duplicates of the stock wheels (currently; may make it patch in-place the stock wheels).  It may contain patches for some of the KerbalFoundries models as well, though it will likely only be a small selection (some have special rigged models that would require additional modules and config to handle properly)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T21:47:20Z","Content":"OMG, the semi is hilarious.\n\nYou need to add the basic whip antenna as a CB antenna ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-26T21:48:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2016 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"}]}
