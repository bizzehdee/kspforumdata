When I try them, by rocket dismantles either on the launch pad or at some random point in space. I am starting to becoming mad.\n\nWhat I want to do is probably the most basic usage of service bays. I want to launch a probe to an asteroid, with a grabbing unit. I am in career mode, I still don\u0027t have the large probe core. So I need a small probe core, under the grabbing unit. To do that, I want to put my probe core in a service bay (alternative ideas welcome).\n\nSo that\u0027s where I start having troubles. My core in not as high as the service bay. So I put the core first, then the service bay attached to the top of the core, then the lower part of the rocket under the service bay (and therefore not touching the core, which is stuck to the upper part of the service bay). Fine.\n\n![xSPYbmm.png](http://i.imgur.com/xSPYbmm.png)\n\nBut then in space, at some point the rocket is dismantling itself. The upper part seems to vibrate, then the rocket breaks and the higher part (service bay \u002B prob \u002B grabbing unit) is detaching itself to the rest of the rocket.\n\nAny help would be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:56:07Z","Content":"I\u0027ve run into a similar \u0022detachment\u0022 situation from time to time, but I\u0027ve had some luck avoiding it with a particular part-placement-sequence.\n\n1. Place the service bay first. In fact, if I\u0027m launching a probe that\u0027s going to have its core inside a service bay (which is most probes, for me), the very first part I place is the service bay.\n2. Put the core in second (I usually attach it to the inside of the \u0022roof\u0022 of the service bay rather than the inside of the \u0022floor\u0022 of the service bay)\n3. Do not put anything on the service bay before you put the probe core in it (just precautionary)\n4. Build rest of rocket as normal.\n\nWhen I\u0027ve gone this route, I seem to mostly have success in all of the parts staying attached the way they\u0027re supposed to be. No promises, but something to try. Definitely try the \u0022service bay first\u0022 approach."},{"CreatedByName":"kreutzkevic","CreatedById":146514,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:56:47Z","Content":"I use service bays A LOT and have never encountered problems like that. It seems sensible, though, to make the service bay the root part if you\u0027re going to put in probe cores and not just offset the service bay so it looks as if the probe core\u0027s inside.\n\nCould be the AGU: **the grabbing unit is notorious for buggy behavior.**\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100286-BUST-Claw-Frozen-Stuck-Orbits-Breaking-Infinite-Acceleration](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100286-BUST-Claw-Frozen-Stuck-Orbits-Breaking-Infinite-Acceleration)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T13:00:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kreutzkevic**"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:58:56Z","Content":"Had the same problem with servicebay, but in my case it wasnt probecore but battery. One of folowing advices should help.\n\n1.You have to be sure, that the core is attached to a propper node. \n\n2.When/if the wobble starts, open the service bay. it will stop wobling. (Probe core might glitch out of the bay)\n\n3. Try to fix the bay with few struts if you have them unlocked."},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T13:22:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.You have to be sure, that the core is attached to a proper node.\n\nYeah, this is basically what it boils down to. I\u0027ve found that placing the parts \u0022Bay-first\u0022 helps make sure that the probe core gets attached to the right spot, instead of ending up in some sort of weird arrangement.
