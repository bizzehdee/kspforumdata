When I try them, by rocket dismantles either on the launch pad or at some random point in space. I am starting to becoming mad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to do is probably the most basic usage of service bays. I want to launch a probe to an asteroid, with a grabbing unit. I am in career mode, I still don\u0027t have the large probe core. So I need a small probe core, under the grabbing unit. To do that, I want to put my probe core in a service bay (alternative ideas welcome).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s where I start having troubles. My core in not as high as the service bay. So I put the core first, then the service bay attached to the top of the core, then the lower part of the rocket under the service bay (and therefore not touching the core, which is stuck to the upper part of the service bay). Fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xSPYbmm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xSPYbmm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then in space, at some point the rocket is dismantling itself. The upper part seems to vibrate, then the rocket breaks and the higher part (service bay \u002B prob \u002B grabbing unit) is detaching itself to the rest of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run into a similar \u0022detachment\u0022 situation from time to time, but I\u0027ve had some luck avoiding it with a particular part-placement-sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPlace the service bay first.
