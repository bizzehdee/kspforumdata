They enter, but a copy of them is still outside. The game then gets confused as to what the situation is. I had this happen in the tutorial scenarios but not in the actual game until today where I was trying to do a couple \u0022rescue kerbals from low orbit\u0022 missions. I did my rendezvous and put the kerbal on EVA to be rescued. Then the clone bug happened. So, I just took off leaving the copy adrift. Did the 2nd rendezvous and this time the kerbal doesn\u0027t go in even though the game acts like they went in. I get no video of their face, so I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s going on. Either way there\u0027s some sort of clone bug in the game and I\u0027m wondering if anyone knows why. I\u0027ve seen others post similar problems but nobody has an answer.\n\nHere\u0027s a video showing what I mean. Looks like any kerbal doing EVA is going to get cloned every time now. I\u0027m not sure if this is a corrupted install now and I have to start over or what. Hopefully the save itself is not corrupted. Did not have this problem yesterday.\n\n[edit] It would seem to be a problem with my save file. When I use a save I made a couple days ago, I don\u0027t have this problem. It would still be nice to know what\u0027s going on. I\u0027ll keep a copy of the bad save in case anyone needs to see it.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujMShfhXwVk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T15:41:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Recon777**"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T23:57:32Z","Content":"This started to happen to me when i installed KIS.After updating to 1.1.5. and new save,problem was gone."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T18:10:09Z","Content":"I\u0027m having one while trying to EXIT capsule, and no, I don\u0027t have KIS/KAS."},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T08:01:06Z","Content":"Also having this problem.. would love to know why.."},{"CreatedByName":"Zoophagous","CreatedById":152133,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T00:33:36Z","Content":"I am also having this problem, any ideas?  \n\n I really dont want to revert"}]}
