However, in terms of career progression, I don\u0027t understand how it can be used effectively. To be able to build it in the first place you need quite a bit of science, pretty much all of which will come from LKO and maybe Munar experiments. So when it comes time to put a station with a science lab up there as part of a contract, you might as well use it to generate more science, but to generate science it requires experiments, all of which you\u0027ve exhausted researching the thing.\n\nAm I to believe they expect us at that stage to bring back experiments from Minmus and beyond and deposit them at the station?\n\nPersonally I think it would be nice to get contracts to send experiments to the station that add to the science generation. After all, we wouldn\u0027t send a rover to Mars, send back a sample somehow (assume we didn\u0027t have in situ analysis) only to have it rendezvous with the ISS."},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T11:23:39Z","Content":"You can do experiments again to fill up your MPL.

Started my Duna mission, gathered science, left the MPL there and started an EVE mission. By the time my EVE lab arrived, I could harvest the Duna installation twice. That 1000 science transmited was helpful, but not too much to make further research moot.
