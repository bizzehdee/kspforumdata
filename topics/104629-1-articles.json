Water take-offs are no problem too!\n\nThis craft is also really safe, as the pilot tends to survive. Displayed (and described) below are some what would otherwise be deadly crashes.\n\nHere is the craft in flight:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The end result was about half the plane surviving the first impact to actually fly off and crash again. The pilot survived.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
