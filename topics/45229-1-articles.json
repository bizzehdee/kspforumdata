If you fly solar panels through an atmosphere parallel to the axis along which they open, the game simply ignores it and lets it pass through unscathed. In other words, the solar panels are very strong as long as you don\u0027t push on them sideways very far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T03:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet when I try this on my ion powered rover, even at high noon when the solar panels aim straight up and I drive forward, narrow edge facing the wind, instant breakage at like 8m/s. The game is horribly inconsistent with solar panel destruction. You barely tap it with a kerbal. Does it flex or scratch? no! it instantly disintegrates!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
