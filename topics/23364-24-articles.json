I have read several post where people are experiencing the same problem. I like the mod for background sounds but I cannot have it constantly resetting it\u0027s volume to near 100% every time I launch a ship, change ships, go in and out of the vab, etc. Regardless of what I have the sliders set too it just resets itself. I have had to remove the mod until this is fixed. It actually caused me to crash a ship because the volume shot up and I was trying to turn it down instead of watching my ship and it flipped out and crashed.
