It was free then. It didn\u0027t have Kerbol or a moon or Minmus or any other planets. (As I recall, even Minmus was a development tool that was left in accidentally for one release and then it stuck.) Some time later, they started selling licenses for $6. I bought 3 of them because I thought the game was worth more than 6 bucks. I bought KSP2 today. I\u0027m underwhelmed, but I didn\u0027t buy it for me. I bought it for my kids. They will enjoy it, I can play it with them, and maybe over the years it will be improved as my kids abilities to undertake its challenges grow along with it. Who knows?

Planets with an atmosphere are really bright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game currently has a set exposure, which causes places with an atmosphere like Kerbin and Eve to be obscenely bright near the surface. I like the high exposure, it makes space look more \u0022spacey\u0022 but i feel like there should be a way of the exposure automatically turning down as you get closer to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The game looks blurry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar away objects appear blurry and aliased, even some nearby object have this problem. I\u0027m not sure why this is, but the main thing i noticed when i first booted up the game was how crazy blurry everything is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Terrain looks bad. Really bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand this is not a priority for devs at the moment, but i hope this is resolved later. In some places the terrain can look worse than KSP1, even without mods. Surfaces have sharp edges, or will look too flat, more bumpmapping could easily solve this, although it would probably reduce performance, maybe this could be implemented after the game is properly optimized, and could be available under a certain graphics setting or preset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Terrain scattering is disappointing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you decide to build a plane or a lander, as most people do, you\u0027ll immediately notice that trees will just pop into existence as you get closer. I understand that things have to be this way for performance\u0027s sake, however the effect is very jarring, and tree will also have a very noticable color shift in between LOD\u0027s. This could be fixed by, adjusting the colors on the LOD\u0027s so that the shift is less apparent, Adding more LOD\u0027s that draw further away making the tress disappearing less noticeable, and adjusting the color of the terrain further away to more closely match the color of the trees, since the main reason the scattering effects seem so jarring is due to the contrast between the trees and the ground making\u00A0 where the trees and and the ground starts very noticable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Planet textures are in a rough state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the way the planets look in this game, they look crazy good and they managed to make every single planet in the game look like a work of art.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...As long as you\u0027re looking at them from 600km away. Any closer and you\u0027ll notice how low res the textures are close up. This is especially noticeable in orbit, which happens to be where a lot of player will be spending their time. This is why i think this is a big issue. The LOD system they implemented for rendering planet textures does not seem to hold up. Near the terminator of the planets, where light fades into darkness, many of the craters you\u0027ll see looks increasingly low res. And when your orbiting over light, the textures look blurry, and you cant make out any detail. This could be fixed by having a second, high res texture for the planets that renders between 500-100km altitude, and then an even higher res one for 100-50km, and so on. I believe this is what they are already doing, but it doesn\u0027t seem to look very good. For orbiting in direct sunlight, i understand that there isn\u0027t much that can be one, and with straight down sunlight most features of the mun will be washed out due to a lack of shadows.\u00A0 Again, i understand that the main reason for the low res textures is performance, which is why i desperately hope that things like this will be added in a \u0022visual update\u0022 after optimisation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. The surface is flat as hell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the original game this was also the case, and mods like Parallax 2.0 simply brute forced the problem with a billion scatters. however i believe that KSP2 would benefit from a more elegant solution; Procedural mesh generation. I believe that by using Perlin, Worley or any other type of mathematical noise, you could use that to generate a mesh, similar to the terrain generation used in Minecraft, that is layered into the surface. of the planets. This is essentially how they created the planets in KSP1, however i thing doing it at a smaller scale for the surface, and layering these meshes on top of each other as you get closer will create very good looking terrain. Blah blah blah optimisation performance, add this once they 7090ti Super releases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.
