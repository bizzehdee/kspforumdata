I\u0027ve certainly found seemingly randomly exploding parts are more common on Kerbin than, say, Mun. If I had to guess, lengthy \u0022rover\u0022 bodies like yours probably make that problem all the worse since the shaking induced by uneven ground will have the whole length for leverage on every bounce. Physics speed up past x2 leads to explosions on Kerbin for me even with vehicles that survive x4 on other bodies just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever heard the wind sound, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I thought it was some flaw in my rover caused maybe by wheel contact \u0022biting\u0022 something with suspension compressed (Kerbin is what, the second highest gravity environment?
