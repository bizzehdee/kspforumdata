While you\u0027re right that KSP Win x64 is very crashy, and that most crashes (at any rate, crashes that can\u0027t be duplicated in 32bit) are KSP\u0027s fault, not the mods\u0027, you\u0027re wrong either that KJR is at fault for ignition issues (see above, HoneyFox found the actual culprit) or that the steps you mention are anything but the start of a lucky break. The reason x64 crashes is (or appears strongly to be) related to how it handles pointers when memory usage is larger than a 32bit address space, so in other words, instead of crashing *immediately* once \u0026gt;3.3GB or so is reached, it becomes a ticking time bomb.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right again about the cause of the problem for EI.
