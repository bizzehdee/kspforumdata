I wonder if someone could please help me with a graphic/visual bug I have when inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E hangers? Ive searched the internet high and low but cant find a solution as it seems to be very uncommon. The problem/bug is that the terrain (the ground) on the \u0022outside scenery\u0022 of the hangers is missing and I see only sky (with the exception of the runway and launchpad floating out in emptiness). I can send a screenshot if you want but not sure how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recently upgraded to KSP v1.3 on steam and after much hard work finally managed to get all the mods I find necessary to work.

The rest of the mods were installed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E which states that they are 1.3 compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also \u0022might\u0022 have happened after I installed textureReplacer to get Diverse Kerbal Heads but, from what Ive seen, there is nothing in textureReplacer that effects terrain textures (at least Ive installed nothing). There is EnvMap folder but its empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also recenty moved my KSP game folder from where Steam installed it (D:/ProgramFiles (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common) to D:/KSP after I was having trouble with win10 file permissions when trying to delete mods (acces denied). I had to use safemode to move the game folder. This (and textureReplacer) was before I installed scatterer and noticed the bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from this small but annoying \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E graphics bug, everything seems to be working 100%, but I would really, really like to get rid of it as it kinda gets on my nerves.

Its fixed. It turn out to be an integrity problem which I fixed with steam, but I first had to make a new steam folder on another drive (C:) and then move the game there via steam (which is the proper way to move steam games, didn\u0027t know that till now). Then I removed mods and verified integrity. After that it was fixed. I think my D: steam folder has some sort of pesky win10 file permission problem so it was maybe blocking steam from fixed the necessary files.
