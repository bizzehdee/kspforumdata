A larger space center that covers more area, longer distance to launchpad, better graphics, etc. All of those things are kinda given if it is created in the future.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T23:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:30:27Z","Content":"To everyone who wants more star systems.

Unity is easy, but it holds KSP back quite a bit. A better engine would mean you could build bigger ships with less lag and stronger part connections. A good looking engine (like Space Engine), plus things like deformable terrain (minimally stuff like Spin Tires, but maybe not *as* muddy) would be amazing. Physics would be the biggest priority, the other engine features else could come second, and then add all the other features could go on top of that.

So basically, KSP, but where I can pretend-time to be the astronaut, instead of being an invisible hand helping out my little green friends. I don\u0027t see rocket, plane, design as being part of this so much, but as a trade-off for being less physics intensive (because crafts would be constructed to be one piece, instead lots of separate parts flying in formation, attached with crazy glue), more realistic graphics. Also more flight simmy controls... ie autopilots, flight computer, twiddling knobs, pushing buttons. Etc. \n\nAnother iteration I think would be cool, would be Kerbal History of Flight..... a KSP focusing on pre-spaceflight aeronautics... starting with Wright brothers levels of wacky design, maybe up to spaceplanes in the end goal. \n\nFinally, I I\u0027m picturing a mobile game, where you have wait one real day after every launch, unless you pay real money ....

KSP is a space simulation **game**, which attempts to simulate space exploration with a very unique humorous side (the \u0022Kerbal Way\u0022). There are a lot of things realism-wise, which we could throw at the Kerbals, increasing challenge and fun. This is of course better aerodynamics, deadly reentry, heat, power and lifesupport management. I also would like to see the addition of e.g. weather effects on the planets (wind, rain, fog, clouds, extreme / high / low temperatures, humidity, acidicity, ...) which could affect our space craft.\n\n**However**, what I do not want to see is KSP evolving into am Orbiter clone, which surely would satisfy those willing to deal with this particular challenge. But when I want to do that, I will install Orbiter.
