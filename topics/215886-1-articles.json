This was not a problem in ksp 1 as you had this feature,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhowever ksp 2 simply lacks this feature, and you can not delete saves without going into the files. I mean sure you can \u003Cem\u003Eoverwrite \u003C/em\u003Ethem but I would like to have a timeline of saves, that I could delete later when Im done the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be a simple, but useful feature for me, and probably a bunch others.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-25T05:08:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2023 05:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Little 908\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
