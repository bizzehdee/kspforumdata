And I planned on using a Keyboard protocoll to relay information to KSP, so the Swiches an levers should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main problem is retreaving the Information from the game to be able to process or display it for I have no Idea how the Game is internally structured or how to access the various variables, or in C# I think stuff like that are called Classes and where to find what, so thats why I\u0027m here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks alot for reading and excuse my spelling, I have never been good at that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T22:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, welcome to the forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s two existing mods that are popular for simpits and controller hardware: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594-0-25-%282014-10-12%29-Telemachus-%E2%80%93-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETelemachus\u003C/a\u003E uses a web socket to get data in and out of the game, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66393\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPSerialIO\u003C/a\u003E uses a serial link over the Arduino\u0027s USB connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey both output a lot of very detailed telemetry information.

It seems to be a better Idea to use the Serial IO mod, than to emulate a Keyboard. I however found the Idea of maybe writing a mod myself kind of cool, so I wanted to know, where I could find the required documentation, or a tutorial that coveres the KSP API (Ill learn C# with the help of books and learning by dooing other smaller projects).
