In fact, it\\\u0027s a little nose-light right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe canards on the wings were because that big tail was, for some reason, giving me almost no rudder, and they were the only way I could get the thing to turn. I replaced that vertical stabilizer with 2 canted canards, and it seems to be working better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\\\u0027t figure out what everybody was talking about with the shift-placing 5 degree thing, because it never worked for me. Turns out that it no longer works if you map pitch/yaw functions to other keys. :\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I put it back and now I can tweak stuff.

I was trying to build something as stable as possible so it would stay in the air long enough for me to practice flying. It goes in a straight line like a dream. Get it in the air, leave the avionics SAS in charge, and mild corrections every few minutes will keep it flying until it runs out of fuel. Then once out of gas, it glides about 40% as far as it flew under power (is it even \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E to stall under the current flight simulation?). Lands pretty well, too, if you don\\\u0027t care what piece of flat ground you come down on. Changing heading is the thing it struggles with.

Any higher and the engines suffocate, any lower... Well, your speed gets capped at ~700 m/s at the edge of the lower atmosphere, and you can start roasting weenies on your innermost engine nacelles.
