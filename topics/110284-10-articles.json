Where are they and how do I get them??\n\nGood question. RocketParts are a resource that originated from the Extraplanetary Launchpads mod and are now part of the Community Resource Pack as well. They are the standard for building spacecraft at a base or station in flight. Currently Pathfinder does not have the means to make RocketParts. You can disable the RocketPartss requirements by opening the settings window, which is done by holding down Alt and P at the same time. Or you can install Extraplanetary Launchpads and use the Smelter to make RocketParts.

Currently, the stock resource detection works like this:\n\n1) Fly the M700 Survey Scanner to the celestial body of interest and enter a polar obit. This will provide a big picture of the celestial body\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resources.\n\n2) Land the Surface Scanning Module on the celestial body and perform an analysis of the biome to improve scanning resolution of the biome\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resources.\n\n3) Fly the M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner near the desired biome to pinpoint the highest resource concentrations in the local area.\n\nWith Pathfinder, it works like this (warning, spoilers ahead. The in-game tool-tips are there to give hints, these spoilers will outright give you the answers)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) Fly the TERRAIN Geo Scanner to the celestial body of interest and enter a polar obit. This will provide a big picture of the celestial body\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resources. Once you\u0027ve completed the survey, you can initiate continuous resource monitoring (similar to how NASA conducts Earth Watch experiments) to gain Science over time. That Science will be immediately available (your Science value shown in the game\u0027s GUI will immediately be updated), though I might change it to use the stock experiment window in the future to make it more clear. Of course, since you get the TERRAIN earlier in the tech tree than the M700, the TERRAIN might break down and need fixing. It certainly will require servicing at some point to replenish its ResearchKits, which are used up while performing its continuous resource monitoring (I picture ResearchKits representing Polaroid photos that are digitally scanned and then discarded, with the scanned image being transmitted back to KSC). Instead of the TERRAIN, you could fly the M700 Survey Scanner into polar orbit once it becomes available much later in the tech tree.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Land a Ponderosa configured as a Pathfinder Geology Lab onto the celestial body and perform an analysis of the biome to improve scanning resolution of its resources. This is the same thing as landing the stock Surface Scanning Module onto the celestial body once that part becomes available. The important difference is that the Lab gives you a bit of Science for all the trouble of landing people and equipment on the planet to perform the analysis. Right now that Science is immediately available, though that might change to use the stock experiment window in the future to make it more clear. And just like the tiny surface scanning module, the Geology lab can show you its current location as well as the local concentration of resources.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Land the Gold Digger Portable Mini-Drill on the biome and take a core sample. Each core sample brings with it a chance to improve or worsen the landscape\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resource concentrations. For gameplay reasons, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have a limited number of attempts to alter the landscape\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resource concentrations. If you happen to have a Geology Lab staffed with scientists in the area, the lab will improve your core sample results. For this step, think of Pathfinder as a space western, and you\u0027re a gambler. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E 4) Fly the M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner near the desired biome to pinpoint the highest resource concentrations in the local area.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIn addition to the above functionality, the Geology lab is equipped with a seismometer if you have the Impact mod installed (one of the recommended mods). From the Geology Lab, you can press the button marked \u0022Review Impact Data\u0022 to review the experiment. It will only show up if you crashed a vessel into the planet and you captured data. \n\nHopefully that explains the purpose of the Pathfinder Geology Lab. For the Ponderosa Habitat template, right now it\u0027s just a decorative set piece for role-play reasons. It doesn\u0027t really have any useful functionality. I just checked to make sure, but the Ponderosa Habitat template does indeed have space for four kerbals.\n\nHope that helps. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ObiVanDamme","CreatedById":136329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T13:15:32Z","Content":"Thank you for the clarifaction.

If not, that might explain why it falls through the ground.\n\nOh, it does sit there if you set it down. But if you change focused vessels, THAT\u0027s when it vanishes. For example, I switched from Kathrice to the rover at the base of the stairwell to check on something in its inventory, and when I switched back, it was gone."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T05:52:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good question. RocketParts are a resource that originated from the Extraplanetary Launchpads mod and are now part of the Community Resource Pack as well. They are the standard for building spacecraft at a base or station in flight. Currently Pathfinder does not have the means to make RocketParts. You can disable the RocketPartss requirements by opening the settings window, which is done by holding down Alt and P at the same time. Or you can install Extraplanetary Launchpads and use the Smelter to make RocketParts. Hope that helps. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Aha, so it\u0027s dependent on another mod. Thanks for the clarification. I was putting actual rocket parts into the inflation module\u0027s KIS inventory, wondering what the heck I\u0027m supposed to do (don\u0027t worry, I was just testing it on the runway. I didn\u0027t go to the Mun and get surprised by the RocketParts message or anything).\n\nAnother solution is a small MM patch for either the Squad ISRU or if you use Angel\u0027s DSEV for the Compact ISRU unit from that mod. If you combine them both into the same patch it will add the ability to create Rocket Parts to both. The advantage to this solution is not having to install another mod since Rocket Parts are already part of CRP. The ratios are direct conversions from EPL so the resource usage and rates remain the same as if that mod were installed.\n\nHere\u0027s the MM code I use...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @PART[CompactISRU]\n\u003E \n\u003E {\n\u003E \n\u003E  MODULE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  name = ModuleResourceConverter\n\u003E \n\u003E  ConverterName = RocketParts\n\u003E \n\u003E  StartActionName = Start ISRU [Rocket Parts]\n\u003E \n\u003E  StopActionName = Stop ISRU [Rocket Parts]\n\u003E \n\u003E  AutoShutdown = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  GeneratesHeat = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  UseSpecialistBonus = true\n\u003E \n\u003E  SpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2\n\u003E \n\u003E  SpecialistBonusBase = 0.05\n\u003E \n\u003E  Specialty = Engineer\n\u003E \n\u003E  EfficiencyBonus = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E  INPUT\\_RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  ResourceName = Ore\n\u003E \n\u003E  Ratio = 0.5\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  INPUT\\_RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  ResourceName = ElectricCharge\n\u003E \n\u003E  Ratio = 30\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  OUTPUT\\_RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  ResourceName = RocketParts\n\u003E \n\u003E  Ratio = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E  DumpExcess = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E @PART[iSRU]\n\u003E \n\u003E {\n\u003E \n\u003E  MODULE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  name = ModuleResourceConverter\n\u003E \n\u003E  ConverterName = RocketParts\n\u003E \n\u003E  StartActionName = Start ISRU [Rocket Parts]\n\u003E \n\u003E  StopActionName = Stop ISRU [Rocket Parts]\n\u003E \n\u003E  AutoShutdown = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  GeneratesHeat = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  UseSpecialistBonus = true\n\u003E \n\u003E  SpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2\n\u003E \n\u003E  SpecialistBonusBase = 0.05\n\u003E \n\u003E  Specialty = Engineer\n\u003E \n\u003E  EfficiencyBonus = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E  INPUT\\_RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  ResourceName = Ore\n\u003E \n\u003E  Ratio = 0.5\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  INPUT\\_RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  ResourceName = ElectricCharge\n\u003E \n\u003E  Ratio = 30\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  OUTPUT\\_RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  ResourceName = RocketParts\n\u003E \n\u003E  Ratio = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E  DumpExcess = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T05:54:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 05:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rasta013**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:54:17Z","Content":"Just a heads up, KIS 1.2.1 was just released.
