I know it\u0027s possible to create custom planets and add them into the game using planet editors, but I\u0027m wondering... could you create a cylindrical shaped object say... 5 km across and 20 km long? Like a huge O\u0027Niell Cylinder, who\u0027s orbit is on rails. I was reminiscing on Rendez Vous With Rama just recently and I was wondering how hard it would be to edit in a Rama mission. With a huge cylinder appearing at the edge of the solar system, coming in towards the sun on a hyperbolic orbit. You\u0027d have to catch it, match it\u0027s heading, then land on one of the end caps, then leave before it escapes the solar system. We could say it gives you a nice sizable reward of science and prestige (cash too if we want).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the outer surface of the cylinder is (I believe) travelling faster than 50 m/s we could keep the code simple for that surface and just say any part that touches it goes poof (like when your ship gets too close to the Sun). I don\u0027t actually know if this is easier to code than normal surfaces that you can land on (I\u0027m not much of a programmer), but I\u0027ll assume it\u0027s that way. The only surfaces we would really want to land on are the end caps, and even then it would have to be near the middle. We can keep them relatively featureless, since it\u0027s just a big ol\u0027 cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow making the interior... that would be another story entirely, and probably well beyond the current game engine. But yeah, any modders who know how the planet editors work, could this be done?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T02:57:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T05:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince RSS includes Deimos and Phobos (which are, ballpark, that size), you certainly could have the exterior.
