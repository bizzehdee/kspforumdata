Those values are now defined separately for each possible situation, so we now keep vessels in the atmosphere (or in sub-orbital trajectories) loaded up to 22.5km away. That means falling debris can now easily hit the ground (or KSC facilities) during launch, other vessels can reenter with you and actually hit the surface, quite a few interesting things.\n\nYou could potentially make a 45km long airplane now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:46:03Z","Content":"Now to find which planetary body is small enough.
