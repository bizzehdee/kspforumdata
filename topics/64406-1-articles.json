If I rotate the camera as I am trying to place the part, it moves along some invisible plane. If it hits something (most usually floor), the part stops following the view and cannot be placed at such angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore often in SPH but sometimes in VAB, the part is placed initially at some ridiculously high distance and placing it in such case becomes pretty hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- hold the part at constant distance from the camera instead of moving it along a plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add a control (key, mouse) which would allow me to adjust how far the part is from the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-27T12:48:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2014 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T10:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah i\u0027ts annoying sometimes.
