My first thought then was this is better than a lot of \u0022full\u0022 games I\u0027ve played.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I discovered the community. Everyone here and the moderators, who inspired me to look at aspects of hard science and creativity KSP has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a replica of the Thrust SSC (my thread and that account sadly lost in the server crash) I created models, I RP\u0027d a mission to Duna as if it were actually Mars. Then I recreated the trailer of Sunshine in KSP. I decided to upload it to YouTube, and thought nothing of it, just a bit of fun. Last week I had a similar idea about the AC:Unity trailer which wound up as The Daily Kerbal featured video and has just hit 10,000 views. It also had wonderful comments and insightful criticism. I am awed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you if you watched it, and thank you if you helped me when I was a noob and couldn\u0027t land on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than that, think about how easy Squad has made it is to create things in this solar system sized sandbox. Create something, Screenshot, video, livestream that idea. There\u0027s probably a mod that allows you to do [insert bits you need for your idea here.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen go watch someone else\u0027s creation because it will probably be a 180 degree flip on anything you create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a short list excluding the really popular ones; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/goose79335\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGoosexi\u003C/a\u003E,\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/okIdfgh7OX8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4OVObkGdv73Z3T5d3rDLWghttp://\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECoolJWR\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/Chickenkeeper24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChickenKeeper\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzrjFgCriZ1kGJ16cX3qEhg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThat1Guy\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/AppleBased/feed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFelsmak\u003C/a\u003E,\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLAZCdOy8dk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese people create and comment on each other\u0027s content, and I bet they\u0027re part of this forum too they\u0027ve probably helped you out once or twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what KSP inspires and hell, when Scott Manley commented on my last video I felt slightly starstruck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for creating content that inspires me and thank you for enjoying content I create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EFor Those with a short attention span;\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWhat does KSP inspire you to do?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
