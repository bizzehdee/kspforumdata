The weld could just attach to the first part selected as far as the tree is concerned. With some tolerance value established for distance and alignment to another part, if part \u0022A\u0022 with weld attached were within tolerance to part \u0022B\u0022 then a \u0022weld\u0022 could occur and simply establish a physics connection. \u00A0 Behavior could be like a docking port but obviously should be a rigid connection.

This will be an obvious issue when constructing a colony that, unless the plan is to make colony construction parts generic and just big units that snap together, without solving the problem in an intuitive way will result in a lack of creative freedom. Rocket and vehicle design is one thing but a colony is a different beast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
