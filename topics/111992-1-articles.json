(Somewhat around 8km to 15 km.) I also had a huge problem with the first stage of the central stack overheating.\n\nNow the point of 1.0 is that it is suppose to be different.

Drag is indeed the issue.\n\nA big contributing factor is the position of the CoM. If I\u0027m looking at your first screenie correctly, your payload (the station core) is about 25 tonnes all told, tops. So that means out of your 337 tonne tocket, the vast majority of it is in the rear. You\u0027ve also got waaaaaay more thrust than you need at this point; 1.5 at launch is plenty.\n\nWhat\u0027s going on is the old \u0022throw a dart backwards\u0022 problem - you need the majority of your mass up near the top. Failing that, you need fins down towards the bottom. Now, you have them, but look where they\u0027re attached - to those SRBs, which you\u0027re getting rid of toot-sweet. Fins on your LF tanks would help matters tremendously.\n\nI might suggest you look at the [Optimal Rocket Calculator for KSP 1.0](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/) site; it\u0027ll help you out with designing a more reliable booster better suited for the new drag conditions. As for flying - stay going straight to 5k, then slowly begin to pitch over; have your nose pointed at 45 degrees by 15k (instead of shooting over hard to 45 degrees at 10k - doing that\u0027s gonna kill ya in 1.0.x).

It\u0027s not as noticeable if used as a single stage, but it will get quite hot in asparagus staging as it runs longer.\n\nFor aerodynamics, consider something other than the large cones for your big orange rockomax tanks. They\u0027re apparently no better than a flat surface at the moment, and this may be causing significant drag issues. \n\nOtherwise, what speeds are you hitting at the flip altitude? For stability on large loads, I\u0027ve been trying to keep things only a little above 300 m/s below 10k, max of around 500 m/s by 15k, and max of 800 or 900 at 20k.\n\nAre you heading straight up, or doing a gravity turn? Large and long, unaerodynamic loads may benefit from later turns (where there is less air). Aerodynamic shear can cause massive instability if you step outside the prograde vector with such a craft (even sometimes within the circle itself).\n\nAre those control surface wings on the bottom (it\u0027s a bit hard to tell)? Between engine gimbal, electronic steering, and control surface - the SAS may not be able to handle it, and you\u0027ll begin to wobble back and forth as it overcompensates every movement.

So this is going to read like a running commentary.\n\nJust out of curiosity - is there any reason why you have your launch clamps in a stage other than the initial stage? You do know they\u0027ll work just as well if you let them loose at the same time you light your rockets up (and you won\u0027t blow up your launchpad in the process). Seriously - if you\u0027ve never tried it before, put the launch clamps in the bottom stage. I guarantee you that you won\u0027t be disappointed. Unless for some reason you forget to throttle up first...\n\nThe nosecones on the bottoms of the internal booster units are a complete waste of mass. Just saying.\n\nYou should not be getting your gee meter that high that early in your flight. Too much thrust - you\u0027re losing delta-V to excessive drag. 100 m/s by 1000 meters was good enough even in the old soup.\n\nFloppy rocket beginning around 2500; you start fiddling with the gimbal controls. Struts between the boosters and the payload would help here. A fairing covering the entire payload would also not go amiss (I don\u0027t know if you can do that or not in 1.0.x, though - I use Procedural Fairings and haven\u0027t bothered with the new stock fairings at all, so I don\u0027t know how they work). It also looks to me like you\u0027re using a fairing to connect the payload to the booster; I\u0027ll go ahead and tell you that it doesn\u0027t really work - you still need good old-fashioned space tape to keep things steady when you\u0027re connecting things up around a narrow little point (like, for example, a Clamp-O-Tron). \n\nYou should be starting your turn sooner, though given your stability issues I certainly understand why you\u0027d want to hesitate...\n\nFloppy rocket stops around 15k. By 20k you\u0027re 50 seconds to Ap; I\u0027d ordinarily be flying about 20 degrees above the horizon at that point trying to pick up horizontal velocity. You\u0027ve definitely got enough vertical velocity to coast up for a bit.\n\n27,000 you cut lose the second stage and light the twin boar. There\u0027s another source of instability there - you don\u0027t light a central engine up until that point. \n\n35,000 and the video stops.\n\n----\n\nOkay, so summary then - a big part of your problem is bad asparagus, made worse by the changes to the aero model in 1.0.x.\n\nYou *can* still go with an asparagus design, but you\u0027ll need to re-engineer it for your payload, which in my previous post I figured was somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 tonnes. If you go with [Temstar\u0027s Guidelines for Asparagus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026viewfull=1#post346702) (which are still valid for 1.0.x despite the vast number of changes to the game since they were written way back in 0.21), a 25 tonne payload can be lifted with a 166.67 tonne rocket. You need 1.5 TWR on the launchpad, so calculate that and you get 2450 kN of thrust - that\u0027s all you need on the pad. Now you put 22% of that in the core - 539 kN - and take the other 78% - 1911 kN - and distribute it among...let\u0027s go with three booster pairs...so six more engines - so that comes out to 318 kN a piece. Pick a set of engines capable of that level of thrust - Skippers all around - and now tune them to the appropriate thrust levels, about 83% for the core engine and 49% for the side boosters. Seven skippers weigh 21 tonnes total and your payload is 25 tonnes, which means out of your 166.67 tonne mass budget, you\u0027ve still got 120.67 tonnes for fins, nosecones, decouplers and fuel. Let\u0027s say 6 Protective Nose Cones, 6 TT-78s, a Rockomax Decoupler, and six Tail Fins (which move nowadays and make excellent fins IMHO). That comes out to 2.68 tonnes, so let\u0027s just round up and say three tonnes for sundry junk. You\u0027ve got 117.67 tonnes left for fuel - which you divide evenly into seven stacks. That comes out to 16.81 tonnes of fuel each...so let\u0027s look and see here......X200-32 tanks hold 18 tonnes of fuel. What you could do there is go ahead and use just one X200-32 tank per stack and then up the thrust on each engine to compensate for the slightly higher than needed fuel amount, or go ahead and drain down each tank to 1345 LF and 1644 LOX. \n\nNow, long rocket designs - why would one be better? Less overall drag for one. Less cost for another. Lower part count for yet another. If they\u0027re floppy, add more struts; there used to be an old trick where you could put Cubic Octagonal Struts out on the sides of a stack decoupler and a matching set above, and then connect them with space tape - you could try that to see if it\u0027d shore up the connections and make the rocket sturdier. If you wont have them, you could go with Modular Girder Segments instead (though those would add mass so don\u0027t go nuts with them). First solution of the Calculator says - Rockomax Brand Decoupler, Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank, Rockomax X200-16 Fuel Tank, RE-I5 \u0022Skipper\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine; then TR-38-D, Kerbodyne S3-3600 Tank, Kerbodyne S3-14400 Tank, Kerbodyne KR-2L\u002B \u0022Rhino\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine. And that\u0027s it. 4,040 ms of delta-V, \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A146050, 16.4% payload fraction. Good design if you\u0027ve got the tech. Add a few fins to the bottom stage to keep the rocket steady.\n\nAs for keeping the mass of the rocket up higher, that goes back to the physics of levers. For the basics, I\u0027ll direct you to\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXn19is-dDI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n - and don\u0027t laugh at the haircuts, pay attention to what he\u0027s talking about. A rocket is a lever, and the CoM is its fulcrum point. The end of the rocket that\u0027s got the bulk of the mass - that\u0027s the one that takes more force to move around.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T14:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T19:11:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Tip I haven\u0027t seen mentioned here:\n\u003E Don\u0027t use SAS on long (many part) rockets with weak joints until you get above 40km. \n\u003E \n\u003E Really, you should not need SAS very much at all during the gravity turn.

The craft file is [here](http://pastebin.com/1FgT7Urs).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...and limit the use of fins for active control.\n\nIMO, if you need fins then control fins will do the anti-spinning job better with less mass than other mere lifting surfaces. The one time I found if can make sense to have non-control lift is when you need to counter higher up lift (wings, radiators) and already have too much control (symptom is SAS freaking out)."},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:10:10Z","Content":"So control fins on the central stack, slipped in between boosters, are as effective as ones mounted on the out most boosters?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:17:36Z","Content":"Good question. Control fins on the outside and further are away from the center of mass are more effective. However, your BACC booster stage is so short in burn time that those fins are not carrying their weight. To be honest, the BACCs themselves are probably not carrying their weight. Confession that I might be biased since I started a thread about how SRBs were overly nerfed in 1.0 (BACCs got 15% less Isp in a relative sense to most LFO engines, 30% less burn time, and 50% increased cost)."}]}
