So this is going to read like a running commentary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust out of curiosity - is there any reason why you have your launch clamps in a stage other than the initial stage? You do know they\u0027ll work just as well if you let them loose at the same time you light your rockets up (and you won\u0027t blow up your launchpad in the process).

It also looks to me like you\u0027re using a fairing to connect the payload to the booster; I\u0027ll go ahead and tell you that it doesn\u0027t really work - you still need good old-fashioned space tape to keep things steady when you\u0027re connecting things up around a narrow little point (like, for example, a Clamp-O-Tron). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be starting your turn sooner, though given your stability issues I certainly understand why you\u0027d want to hesitate...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloppy rocket stops around 15k.

If you go with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post346702\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETemstar\u0027s Guidelines for Asparagus\u003C/a\u003E (which are still valid for 1.0.x despite the vast number of changes to the game since they were written way back in 0.21), a 25 tonne payload can be lifted with a 166.67 tonne rocket. You need 1.5 TWR on the launchpad, so calculate that and you get 2450 kN of thrust - that\u0027s all you need on the pad. Now you put 22% of that in the core - 539 kN - and take the other 78% - 1911 kN - and distribute it among...let\u0027s go with three booster pairs...so six more engines - so that comes out to 318 kN a piece. Pick a set of engines capable of that level of thrust - Skippers all around - and now tune them to the appropriate thrust levels, about 83% for the core engine and 49% for the side boosters. Seven skippers weigh 21 tonnes total and your payload is 25 tonnes, which means out of your 166.67 tonne mass budget, you\u0027ve still got 120.67 tonnes for fins, nosecones, decouplers and fuel. Let\u0027s say 6 Protective Nose Cones, 6 TT-78s, a Rockomax Decoupler, and six Tail Fins (which move nowadays and make excellent fins IMHO). That comes out to 2.68 tonnes, so let\u0027s just round up and say three tonnes for sundry junk. You\u0027ve got 117.67 tonnes left for fuel - which you divide evenly into seven stacks. That comes out to 16.81 tonnes of fuel each...so let\u0027s look and see here......X200-32 tanks hold 18 tonnes of fuel. What you could do there is go ahead and use just one X200-32 tank per stack and then up the thrust on each engine to compensate for the slightly higher than needed fuel amount, or go ahead and drain down each tank to 1345 LF and 1644 LOX. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, long rocket designs - why would one be better? Less overall drag for one. Less cost for another. Lower part count for yet another. If they\u0027re floppy, add more struts; there used to be an old trick where you could put Cubic Octagonal Struts out on the sides of a stack decoupler and a matching set above, and then connect them with space tape - you could try that to see if it\u0027d shore up the connections and make the rocket sturdier. If you wont have them, you could go with Modular Girder Segments instead (though those would add mass so don\u0027t go nuts with them). First solution of the Calculator says - Rockomax Brand Decoupler, Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank, Rockomax X200-16 Fuel Tank, RE-I5 \u0022Skipper\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine; then TR-38-D, Kerbodyne S3-3600 Tank, Kerbodyne S3-14400 Tank, Kerbodyne KR-2L\u002B \u0022Rhino\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine. And that\u0027s it. 4,040 ms of delta-V, \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A146050, 16.4% payload fraction. Good design if you\u0027ve got the tech. Add a few fins to the bottom stage to keep the rocket steady.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for keeping the mass of the rocket up higher, that goes back to the physics of levers.
