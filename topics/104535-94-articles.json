IR parts will only work in one direction. Example: place any IR part using it\u0027s node with the yellow \u0022base\u0022 out away from the craft, then try to move it. Nastiness will ensue.\n\nNow knowing this, if you dock one ship to another through any IR part. Once they become one ship. Which Command Pod is now in control of everything? And switching \u0022control here\u0022 really won\u0027t help. But playing with dock, go to Kerbin and then reload the ship without moving anything \u0022sometimes\u0022 will allow you to work around this issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Uke17","CreatedById":180924,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-02T08:23:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 26/08/2017 at 0:16 PM, Uke17 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve installed the mods, compiled them under smokeindustries folder after unzipping them and I\u0027ve also deleted IRactivestruts and struts.
