As\u00A0long as the player is occupied with contracts (or should I call them MISSIONS?) that make sense and are fun to do in the mean time I see no problem with that. I would\u00A0gladly focus on expanding and maintaining my LKO station\u00A0or research new ways of SSTO propulsion, or build a permanent Mun base and focus on harvesting the ore and bringing it back to Kerbin (without abusing the clones, of course)\u00A0while all the interplanetary probes are on their way to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s one of the reasons I think that actual programs should be included instead of strategies.

This is interesting too, but still feels like modular infinite money in that you can send up as many launches as you wish so long as they are under the cap. It also seems to preclude roll-over, which means there\u0027s no way to strategically \u0027save up\u0027.

Its what I do because I like managing complicated systems, but I worry that outright precluding one-off missions is maybe too severe for players who like to focus on one big mission at a time.

Yeah, ships become obsolete as you progress, but I think adding the step of having to time warp through a research node\u00A0changes that much.\u00A0For time to be fun, for it to be a real challenge and not just a an extra thing you have to click, it needs to be involved in some way with \u003Cem\u003Estrategy\u003C/em\u003E.

Its because your suggestion depends upon a larger discussion we\u0027ve been having about how time-based mechanics could be integrated. Your argument that R\u002BD should take time is very similar to arguments others have made for rockets, building upgrades, and budgets to take time--that it doesn\u0027t make sense that these things would happen instantly and its breaking your sense of immersion. I understand your concern and get why you feel this way.\u00A0My argument isn\u0027t that time-based mechanics are bad, in fact I agree with you and Tater that they would make a clever dynamic in the game. My point is that making these mechanics both meaningful and stable is surprisingly difficult. If time has no cost and is detached from an incentive process then it is an element of role playing and not an actual game mechanic. Time warping through an R\u002BD node \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E trivial because in KSP\u003Cem\u003E time is trivial\u003C/em\u003E. So long as your ships are in stable orbits you can time-warp infinitely and nothing bad will happen to you. Time, in this way, \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t matter\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Let me try to be specific about what the problem is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany players like to invent stories and role-play through career. For some this includes administrative tasks, and when those tasks don\u0027t fit their stories it breaks immersion for them. The trouble is there are many ways to role-play and many ways to interpret stories. Some players like to focus on big Jool motherships or character dynamics between kerbals or grand head-cannon stories about rival nations.\u00A0Its not fair or smart to tailor the game to a specific way of role-playing. What matters, ultimately, are \u003Cem\u003Eincentives\u003C/em\u003E. Right now getting new parts is\u00A0the central incentive of career mode. When a player has clicked \u0022research\u0022 on a tech node and are presented with a choice of launching an obsolete rocket or simply time-warping through the research phase almost all players will time-warp every time. They won\u0027t even think about it. The lure of new parts is just too strong to allow them to busy themselves while they wait. This is, counter-intuitively, \u003Cem\u003Ea disincentive for obeying time as an element of role-play\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0You haven\u0027t added a new dynamic for them, you\u0027ve just required them to exit the R\u002BD facility and time-warp through dozens of nodes. The reason they won\u0027t have to think about it is because time has no cost. If, as Tater suggests, time is a currency, it is a \u003Cem\u003Efree currency\u003C/em\u003E. The only way to prevent players from time-warping every time is to give time an in-game cost, and this is where the real challenge lies.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is mostly for \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002239636\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Veeltch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.\u00A0Say the cost is your reputation decreases over time if you don\u0027t complete missions.
