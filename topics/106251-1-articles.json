Now that I\u0027m at 1.0, I can\u0027t launch with those rockets because it says: \u0022Unavailable Experimental Parts. This vessel contains experimental parts which are not available at the moment: 2x TR-18A Stack Decoupler. 1x Communotron 16.\u0022 In the structural tab, I only have a Modular Girder Segment and a TT-38K Radial Decoupler. \n\nDoes anyone know how to get the stack decoupler back? \n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:45:32Z","Content":"Sounds like you are in a career save. The tech tree was modified quite a bit. It\u0027s possible that the node with that decoupler isn\u0027t unlocked. See if finding it in the tree and unlocking it helps.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Paramars","CreatedById":142267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:46:58Z","Content":"You\u0027re right!
