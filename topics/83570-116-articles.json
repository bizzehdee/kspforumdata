Many other mods, some of them with similar complexity, were brought fully up-to-date quite a while ago. I\u0027ll freely admit to some procrastination: some of my KSP time is spent actually playing the game, while balancing parts gets BORING.

Welcome back!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking at making a patch/mod for the heat system. Basically, because the heat issue comes from small thermal masses adjacent to large ones and the Euler approximation method using too large of a step size, the system swaps too much heat for even small differences in temperature, then it swaps even more, repeatedly, until BOOM! Right now, I\u0027ve got it worked around by modifying the physics.cfg file to change \u0022conductionFactor = 20\u0022 to \u0022conductionFactor = 12\u0022. What I would prefer to do is have a thermal mass comparison between two parts that scales the heat transferred down by some constant times the ratio of the thermal masses. It\u0027s not especially realistic, but neither is the current heat system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding wing area: I quickly put the two side-by-side as a double check in the SPH. The 4x4 delta wing is definitely not the same area as the 4x4 square wing, and same for the others in the SH wingset (delta vs square). Of course, the leading and trailing edges add to the surface areas and chords of both, which is why the FAR values are different from what you would calculate for a \u0022strict\u0022 4x4m square wing (\u0022strict\u0022 MAC = 4, whereas \u0022actual\u0022 MAC = 5, implying 1 m added by leading and trailing edges and a wing area of 20 m^2 instead of 16 m^2). So my proposal to simply cut the deflection lift coefficients in half for the delta wings was off (thanks for making me check), but the deflection lift coefficients for the 4x4 delta wing vs 4x4 square and 4x2 delta wing vs 4x2 square should absolutely be different values from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a lot of energy we\u0027re putting into rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Before I change any of these values for stock aero, I\u0027ll be careful and derive areas from the provided FAR values of MAC, sweep, taper ratio, etc. I\u0027ll also see if I can check other parts for the magic number Porkjet mentioned, as you\u0027re right about the shuttle delta wing using a value of 3.3 instead of 3.52.
