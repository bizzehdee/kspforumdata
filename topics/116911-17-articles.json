When can we expect a release?\n\u003E \n\nVulcan was finished a long time ago, as were all the other lifters. I chose to not bother with them until 1.1 was released, so now that 1.1 actually is released I can start running all the parts through Unity and get them into the game. However, since this mod is only intended for RSSRO, I\u0027ll need to wait for those mods (and their dependecies) to update before I can go ahead and test all the launch vehicles in-game.\n\n**In other news:** People who have been following this thread might have noticed that I\u0027ve not been around for the last few months. That is due to me getting the opportunity to travel to Africa and work with big cats. So now that I\u0027m home and 1.1 is out, I\u0027ll start working on the mod again. I have had a few days since being back, so I finished modeling Titan 34D, Titan IIIE, IUS, Centaur-T, Centaur-D-1T and Soyuz 2-1v. After finishing all the parts for Titan IV it was really easy to convert some models and make some new ones and add a few versions of Titan III to the roster. Soyuz 2-1v was just a case of \u0022meh, might as well\u0022. I\u0027ll keep people posted once I get back into the swing of things."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T12:58:23Z","Content":"Hooray, LiquidHype is back!
