It pulls from a lot of other theories and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this same idea has already been proposed. Please enjoy and discuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis little theory is based on a few points\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B7\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EBlack holes are a point with huge mass but no matter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B7\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EOn the other end of a black hole there are theoretical white holes that are a point with no mass that spews matter forth\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B7\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EThe universe is expanding at an accelerated rate-speeding toward the heat death\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B7\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EIn the final stages of the heat death of the universe matter will cease to exist and a low energy radiation will persist\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B7\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EBlack holes emit hawking radiation-less when they are large but more and more he saller they get\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my theory is that in every black hole in our universe there is a self-contained, and smaller in mass, universe. The big bang for these smaller universes is really a theoretical white hole and what we call our big bag is a white hole connected to a black hole in a much more massive universe than ours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a smaller universe accelerates toward its heat death, more and more of it is composed of radiation. This is the hawking radiation emitted by black holes. Hawking radiation increases as a black hole nears its life because the smaller universe is accelerating to its heat death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would mean that our universe has spawned ?billions-quintillions? Of smaller self-contained universes. Each of these is younger and will die before our universe. In turn, our universe is just one of the ?billions-quintillions? Of self-contained universes in our parent universe. We liv in a younger universe than that of the parent and will succumb to heat death before it can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this way we can start with a universe of a given mass and spawn an unimaginable number of smaller universes in generations down to the point that the youngest cannot support creating a black hole of its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-05T17:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFamiliar:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.insidescience.org/news/every-black-hole-contains-new-universe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.insidescience.org/news/every-black-hole-contains-new-universe\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
