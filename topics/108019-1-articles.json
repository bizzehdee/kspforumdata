The main fuels are 1.0t per 200 units (or 0.5t per 100, or 5kg per unit, if you prefer that). In the years that I have been playing KSP, I have never once manually calculated fuel weight from quantity, I\u0027ve always let the game calculate it for me (via KER or MechJeb, usually).\n\nIt\u0027s not broken, so it should not be fixed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T09:12:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:51:09Z","Content":"I think that 2 units should be used, cubic meters (m^3) for fuel tank volume and kilograms for mass of current fuel load.

I think it would make it easier to estimate fuel/range ratio intuitively.\n\nBut anyway we should have a stock DeltaV reader (see signature), which would naturally become your main tools for mission planning and navigation."}]}
