While putting together the mods for my new career, I want to include realistic rocket sounds with crackling noise. I knew a bunch of mods do this, but I\u0027m looking for a package that just replaces stock rocket sounds and doesn\u0027t use KW. Could anyone point me in the right mod direction? Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
