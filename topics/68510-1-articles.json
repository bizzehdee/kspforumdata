Been real fun! I so far have two manned landings on both kerbin\u0027s moons. An unmaned rover on Duna and Eve, a space station in orbit (my first docking experience was a 5 hour nightmare), etc.. Im new and Im sure you guys have all done this before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy new thing is making an unmanned ariel drone that can take off from the runway and get into orbit. Finally accomplished this lastnight, but I have I have very little fuel left to really do anything else with. Still working on this.. Its too bad the game doesnt give you more science points for unmanned things. Making probes is kinda fun actually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T11:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello! Welcome aboard!
