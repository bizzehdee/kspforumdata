You could use the 6S Service Comp tubes for the unpressurized cargo and mission modules... etc...\n\nAnd I realise this would be easy to build with existing stock and mod parts (I use TONS of mods already ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif))... Thats why I was kind of surprised I havent really seen anyone post up anything QUITE like this that they have built...Yes, I realise its basically just a tug...But this seems to be more independent than most tugs I have seen most people post, which seem to be mostly dependant on staying close to some sort of space station... This seems able to become a cheap interplanetary ferry... Granted, while it is economically feasible in real life, yeah, I\u0027m not sure about in KSP...As if used as intended, you are basically only \u0022recycling\u0022 the small Jupiter module...\n\nAnd as for a new set of specific parts, yeah existing parts could be used, but the same could pretty much be said for most parts mods...ie Kosmos, AEIS, KW, NovaPunch, any of the Soyuz or SpaceX packs... I know lots of those mods offer parts with functions that are not included in stock, but I guess I\u0027m just highlighting the aesthetics of having new parts modeled... And also, JUST BECAUSE... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) lol\n\nLike I said, I have been thinking about trying my hand at modelling, but just didnt have anything (relatively) simple in mind that hasnt already been done..."},{"CreatedByName":"Deltervees","CreatedById":133567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T18:08:23Z","Content":"This is a cool concept, but I don\u0027t understand how this is more practical that conventional resupply vehicles. \n\nAnyway, [T](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92684-v0-25-MEPS-Multipurpose-Express-Pallet-System-v0-2-1-Cargo-Bay-Flooring-27-10)his mod would work for the unpressurised cargo."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T17:24:57Z","Content":"Looks like someone already created it with stock parts: [http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2z2vfl/stock_jupiterexoliner_space_transport_recreation/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2z2vfl/stock_jupiterexoliner_space_transport_recreation/)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
