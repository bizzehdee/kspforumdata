Sure, universe can expand at FTL rates, but because that expansion is inherently non-local. If you can lay out rail from here to destination and warp space all along in any way you want, you can avoid this restriction. But if you can draw an imaginary bubble around your ship and the warp field and say, \u0022The warp effects only space within this bobble,\u0022 then you can pull in some theorems from tensor calculus and the fact that stress energy is a conserved flow under GR and show that non-zero mass warp would cause problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlcubierre Drive works precisely because a bare bubble has a zero mass. If you place a source of gravity within Alcubierre Drive, you actually have to adjust the metric and end up with mass of the bubble being exactly negative of the mass of the source. It\u0027s a wonderful example because the math for AD is comparatively simple and these results can be worked out explicitly. But we also know that it\u0027s a fundamental limitation.\u00A0 Any fully contained device capable of going FTL has to have a net mass of zero. (Edit: Or if it moves from one location to another without something absorbing recoil, I should add, even if you don\u0027t go FTL.

It allows for superluminal travel at the cost of enormous amounts of matter with negative mass density. For this reason, the Alcubierre warp drive has been widely considered unphysical. In this study, we develop a model of a general warp drive spacetime in classical relativity that encloses all existing warp drive definitions and allows for new metrics without the most serious issues present in the Alcubierre solution. We present the first general model for subluminal positive-energy, spherically symmetric warp drives; construct superluminal warp-drive solutions which satisfy quantum inequalities; provide optimizations for the Alcubierre metric that decrease the negative energy requirements by two orders of magnitude; and introduce a warp drive spacetime in which space capacity and the rate of time can be chosen in a controlled manner. Conceptually, we demonstrate that any warp drive, including the Alcubierre drive, is a shell of regular or exotic material moving inertially with a certain velocity. Therefore, any warp drive requires propulsion. We show that a class of subluminal, spherically symmetric warp drive spacetimes, at least in principle, can be constructed based on the physical principles known to humanity today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGR isn\u0027t the end of knowledge.

Which, ok, maybe. But then you jump to conclusion that it might make that technology more plausible? I think not. If GR is incorrect, then we\u0027re just making up a fantasy drive that has no chance of ever doing anything. Sure, there might be other means of propulsion somewhere in physics unknown, but it might as well be unicorn farts at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sum of all of humanity\u0027s knowledge tells us in a dozen different ways that warp requires exotic energy. Is that possible? We don\u0027t know. The requirement that we balance out the energy perfectly to create a flat region of space-time beyond the bubble is rather precise, however. It has to be effectively flawless. Clasically, that\u0027s problematic.\u00A0So the idea of practical warp drive lives or dies on quantum gravity. And this is, unfortunately, where our models hit a big fat divide by zero, almost literally, and we need a better approach to the theory before we could even properly model the quantum behavior of a warp field to see if it\u0027s going to be possible to make it into a stable configuration that \u0022wants\u0022 to stay in tachyonic regime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other bit of good news is that while a flawless warp bubble is necessary to go FTL, for subluminal warp, you are allowed a margin of error. If the space-time beyond the bubble is merely\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enearly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0flat, then you are generating wake of gravity waves compensating for the non-zero accelerating mass. That means acceleration will sap energy, but potentially orders of magnitude less than it would have taken to accelerate without warp. That\u0027s not bad. Of course, you still need that negative energy in the bubble, because without it, the gravity waves you generate have to carry all of the compensating momentum, and that means you\u0027d be better off, energy-wise, to just have a photon drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, a subluminal warp doesn\u0027t have to have a static warp bubble. We don\u0027t know if a static configuration with negative energy density is possible at all, but dynamically unstable systems with regions of negative energy density are well known. There are even published works showing that oscillating warp field can reduce the amount of negative energy required. The net mass of the ship and bubble still has to be close to zero, which means the ship will have to emit an enormous amount of energy on departure and absorb it on arrival, which is way more energy than we know how to deal with, not to mention all of the engineering problems of maintaining bubble stability given that it will want to collapse to the ground state instantly absorbing the ship as such into a net vacuum with a small puff of radiation... We\u0027re basically at the stage where we\u0027re trying to figure out how to ride a steam rocket to the Moon with all of this. But you know, at least we\u0027re making progress. One thing we know with absolute certainty - if we manage to come up with practical warp drive as prescribed by general relativity, it will involve some form of exotic energy. Anything else is the violation of the very principles going into designing the thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T04:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-20T19:01:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2021 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TROPtastic","CreatedById":211826,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T10:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223982194\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221622496698\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/31/2021 at 2:31 PM, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do.

I honestly never looked into that too deeply.\u00A0The problem is with taking matter here and making it go over there. That requires either forming a warp bubble around an object, transporting it, and dissipating the warp bubble, or trying to hop onto a structure that\u0027s passing by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was discussing strictly the former method. We can do more comprehensive analysis when we start with ship being the only source of gravity prior to warp and after the warp\u00A0and place very strict requirements on the whole procedure that way. The outcome of that analysis is that either the space-time around the warp bubble is flawlessly flat, requiring negative energy densities, or the accelerating bubble produces gravitational waves that require energies comparable to a photon drive. For FTL case, that energy requirement goes to infinity, so the cancellation has to be flawless, but for sub-light \u0022close enough\u0022 could reduce energy requirements to sensible levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you have a structure that\u0027s already moving, we reduce the problem to hopping on. The issue, however, is that if it\u0027s an FTL soliton, then how do you even without already having a warp drive? That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not an interesting concept. If these solutions are physical, there could be any number of FTL solitons bouncing around our universe. If we can learn to interact with them in any way, we can at least try encoding information, and having an FTL broadcast capability would already be huge. If you give me a few bits of classical data over an FTL channel, I can walk you through turning it into a proper interstellar high bandwidth network with \u003Cs\u003Ethis easy trick quantum physicists don\u0027t want you to know about\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0a modified quantum teleportation algorithm using entangled photons as carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill doesn\u0027t help you move ships, unfortunately, unless you go full stargate on this concept.
