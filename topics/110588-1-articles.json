Having the same platform that we\u0027re all comfortable with is a definite plus. Also, the size of the iPhone 6 is not that much larger than the 5, which is a good thing for me who keeps the phone in the pocket. All the Android models we saw earlier this year were more like small tablets.

I understand that the Android platform can be customized much more than the iOS one; does anyone really do that and why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Two bullets is a really short list, but I\u0027m sure you users can better identify \u0022these things work better/worse on X\u0022, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m interested it. And which models are good?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last time: I\u0027m most likely to stick with the Apple option here, but I want to hear from you about this because I don\u0027t want to rule out switching completely.

I run custom software and modify Android quite a bit too. The ROM itself (the OS), a custom launcher (\u0027desktop\u0027, so to say), keyboard and browser, to name a couple of things. Stock Android is pretty good, especially when brands do not add their own skins and such. However, I am fairly aware of what is possible, and when a detail is not quite how I like it or annoys me, I can change it. I like the fine grained adaptability to make the experience *exactly* the one I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Custom ROM: much more options while leaving the junk behind. Some also allow advanced tweaking of system parameters to increase things like performance or battery life\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Launcher: this governs the desktop and app drawer.

Google released an update that included a new implementation of encryption. When turned on, it can indeed slow down the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6, as Google decided not to use the hardware that can accelerate this. How much of an impact it has depends on who you ask (and ranges from \u003Cem\u003Enone\u003C/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E) and, more importantly, it is both an optional update \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E feature. If you do not care about encryption, you can run your phone perfectly without. It is expected that other phones have less of a performance impact, as those should be able to use hardware acceleration. It is pretty much why ARMv8 was developed in the first place, along with 64 bits capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the boot loop: phones, from whatever brand, are pieces of technology, which means things go awry from time to time.
