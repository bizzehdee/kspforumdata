However, without having a lot of experience with the particular planet in question, it\u0027s really just trial and error trying to find how much to lead the target. To make that calculation easier, I\u0027d like to see an indicator of how far the planet will have turned by the time my craft reaches the point where it\u0027s orbit line intersects with the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, maybe a doted line starting at the intersect point, and pointing to an X which is where the line will be intersecting by the time the craft reaches that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a career mode such a function could even be locked behind an upgrade, so players could still enjoy the challenge of trying to find the correct lead time on their own, but once they\u0027ve already mastered that skill, they can have it calculated for them to reduce tedium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptimally I would also love for such a calculation to also include atmospheric drag as well, but that might be impractical. since each craft will have a different amount of drag and thus would preform differently, and that\u0027s assuming they came in at a predictable angle, since different rotations could create wildly different aerodynamic profiles for the same craft...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CiberX15","CreatedById":68461,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T22:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would also be nice to have a similar indicator outside of the ship view to have an idea of where the ship was going to land, though that might make things too easy? Perhaps make it an optional part, similar to a light that just draws a dot where it hits, but is super long range. A few of these could then be placed around a craft pointing downward so that when approaching a planet\u0027s surface, the lasers can be used to gauge how close the craft is to the surface and where it\u2019s coming down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fermentation","CreatedById":75814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-18T00:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems like a great science upgrade.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
