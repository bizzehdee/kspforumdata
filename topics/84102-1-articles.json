Night operations is a breeze with the integrated lighting systems so you always know where you are. During this demonstration, a hotter than expected reentry was encountered which damaged the external lighting systems and emergency parachutes. No critical systems were damaged. The Phantom II works best with shallow reentry profiles so as to maintain handling and in turn increase landing precision.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
