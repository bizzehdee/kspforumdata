Its strange though because I have another space station and having SAS and the Shuttle docked doesn\u0027t cause this issue.\n\nsince this is being mentioned, I did experience this when I tried docking with Kristall on my Mir station a month or so ago, I don\u0027t remember right now which docking port I used though, could be APAS, Chaka APAS, Mir Docking port or stock Clamp-o-tron, I didn\u0027t mention anything because it was prior I sent Mike the Mir files, still when I had them only as my private edit\n\nDidn\u0027t happen when I docked the shuttle \u0022inline\u0022 with the core through Kvant-1 or with the bottom of Cacteye though\n\nHaving SAS on did make it worse, and turning it off didn\u0027t help much back then, the only way to effectively stop the wobble was undocking the shuttle"},{"CreatedByName":"Dnaha","CreatedById":137983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T03:40:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmmm.
