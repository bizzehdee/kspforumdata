It seems stable in the pitch direction, a little less stable in the yaw direction, but it is almost impossible to control in the roll direction. It always seems to roll one way or another out of control after a couple minutes of flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I have noticed is that the roll controls on this work weirdly. If I try to roll it right, say, it will roll right a little bit but then zoom back left, even beyond where it was initially. I have tried looking at some spaceplane tutorials but they always seem to address stability in the pitch direction, and I haven\u0027t been able to find one that addresses stability in the roll direction.
