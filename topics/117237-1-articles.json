I\u0027ve managed to get a lander in position but can\u0027t seem to get the Grabbing Unit to actually latch on. Here\u0027s a screenshot showing my setup - I know it won\u0027t grab in the current position but I\u0027ve managed to pogo the ship directly onto the can a couple times and it still won\u0027t grab.\n\n![nUnLpwL.png](http://i.imgur.com/nUnLpwL.png)\n\nIs this fixable or do I need to try another approach? I couldn\u0027t figure out a good way (with stock parts) to adjust the height of the grabbing unit on the fly - should I be using some other approach (e.g. a cargo bay instead of the grabber)?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T22:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xentax**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T07:14:54Z","Content":"How fast are you approaching?

Turns out there\u0027s not quite enough clearance so I\u0027m doing little thrust hops and coming back down on it (about one try in 5 - the RCS thrust over 1.0 TWR so I have to use the main engines some too - often to hilarious results). I may have to send another ship with the one-size-smaller legs (they seem to lower more smoothly) and adjust the clearance.

I combined parts of several suggestions and built a lander with a rover section and enough d/v to return home.
