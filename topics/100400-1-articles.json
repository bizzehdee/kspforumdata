Idealy your decent will look liek a reverse gravity turn, at least thats what ive found to work well for me."},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T03:56:05Z","Content":"The entire way down you should be looking to make sure the area you picked is going to turn out to be as flat as you hoped. Make your corrections to flatter areas early if possible. In the last hundred meters or so I think it\u0027s easiest to leave the camera in the normal (auto) mode and constantly scroll the view around with the mouse to make sure there\u0027s not a better spot to land just a few meters away, and to keep an eye on how far away the ground is.\n\nIn the last 10 meters or so I just watch the navball, making sure I\u0027m landing at low speed, straight down."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T04:36:28Z","Content":"Auto view gets my vote. Burning vertically over a slope doesn\u0027t give you horizontal movement.\n\nIf you want to know about the slope of the ground before you land, I recommend SCANSat - it\u0027s fun, and adds a reason for unmanned probes too."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T05:08:14Z","Content":"I like to look past my ship at the intended landing spot at roughly a 45 degree angle. As for tipping over at touchdown, the trick is not so much piloting as ship design. The lower and wider the better. \n\n![PB0SFy5.png](http://i.imgur.com/PB0SFy5.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T06:52:48Z","Content":"Note that it\u0027s going to be easier to adjust a landing to a further target than a closer one, if you decide the landing zone is poor. Just apply less thrust, but more vertically."},{"CreatedByName":"lodestar","CreatedById":101720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T15:01:10Z","Content":"First, keep pointing to the surface retrograde vector. Click the label above the navball until it shows \u0022Surface\u0022 and your speed, and then point to the retrograde marker. Apply thrust aiming for 10m/s in the last few hundred meters.\n\nBeing top-heavy doesn\u0027t help, but you are tipping over because you have too much horizontal velocity on touchdown. If you do the above, you can kill all velocity a few meters above the ground, then you can simply point to the center of the navball and then proceed to a gentle vertical fall."}]}
