Now, with an ISP of 800s, we expect to move mountains! So to prove it, we\u0027ve targeted asteroid FOE-883c for you to move as our mini-mountain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur new ROCK-O-MOVE-IT-SHIP will carry you to the stars! At launch, this baby features over 9000m/s delta-v! Just look at the quadruple-set of liquid-fueled booster engines! Can you tell I\u0027m excited about this mission? Anyway, in just three easy stages, we expect you to be well on your way to intercept the demon-rock. Our upper-stage makes use of the TAC life-support module to allow you ample time to complete your mission and, since you will be completing the intercept as the first set of kerbals to loose the bonds of our beloved Kerbin, we have added ample scientific instruments to further the fabulous cause of the Kerbal Space Program including the all-new dual-technique Magnetometer. You be sure to tell us whether there\u0027s anything nifty to know about the orbiting big-scary Kerbol directly. You also better be poking and prodding that rock so we can tell if it\u0027s a happy-demon, angry-demon, or playful demon whether it\u0027s orbiting beautiful Kerbol, or high over Kerbin, or low over Minmus! We have to know whether we should respond to these things with friendly, hostile or groveling dispositions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have determined that you will make your interception with 9 days before the demon-rock enters the Kerbin sphere of influence. With this much space, it should require far less delta-v to make significant changes in the trajectory. In fact, with just 100m/s, you can adjust the orbit away from impact toward a close-approach to both Kerbin and Minmus. In fact, with the close-approach on Minmus will give you a gravity-assist in reducing your relative velocity and require only an additional ~100m/s to capture the angel-rock into orbit around Kerbin. We also approve of your memorial naming of the rock to recall your comrade Kerbonaut Charlie...what\u0027s his name. This is the perfect system to remember the pioneers who have gone before us into the great unknown and undiscovered country!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an additional 200m/s or so, you can partially circularize the rock between Mun and Minmus orbit in a retrograde direction. The brand-new RPM system has been installed into your cockpits to help accomplish all of these maneuvers. We expect a full report on its functioning upon your return!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, once you\u0027ve returned we expect ample science from various reports and stored data and samples that will propel our space ships to new heights! Now, don\u0027t go accidentally hitting the staging button before you\u0027re ready for it in the mission plan and have a whole lot of fun out there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/kUcvD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESee the mission here!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-01T02:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2014 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DivisionByZero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
