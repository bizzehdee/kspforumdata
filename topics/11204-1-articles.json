After a little while playing with other people\\\u0027s stable aircraft in 0.15, I decided to install my favourite part from C7 Aerospace to counter the seeming difficulty in creating large non-delta wings that actually look good using stock. I came out with the Vigilant T1, almost identical to a craft from my 0.14 fleet. Unlike my 0.14 aircraft, this one is actually still flyable and I\\\u0027ve been using it to get re-accustomed to flying in 0.15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vigilant is fantastic for Principles of Kerbal Flight training - basic maneuvers such as turns, climbs and landing on the runway (most people can land but some not on the runway); and also functions such as trim. It seems all craft in 0.15 have an initial nose-down tendency, so before/during your takeoff and climb you should hit Alt\u002BPitch Down a few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will notice the (relative to stock in 0.15) excellent turn rate of the craft, which makes it an ideal middle ground between 0.14 and 0.15 plane performance. However, one drawback is the insane ratio of roll vs. pitch, so I recommend using Precision Control (default CAPSLOCK) and only tapping your roll buttons. Flying above ~5000m not recommended unless you switch up the engine for a TurboJet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequires C7 Massive Wing - I\\\u0027m having trouble finding a way to upload the C7 wing part, so for the moment this craft is only available to those who have the C7 Aerospace pack. If anyone can help me with this, drop me a PM, because I don\\\u0027t want to go through the rigmarole of getting a one-use account on an upload site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/ndll68.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ndll68.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
