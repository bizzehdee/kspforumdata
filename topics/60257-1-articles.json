Right now, the only difference between the large fuel tanks and their smaller cousins is that they are a (very very small) better value for money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me that doesn\u0027t make sense. I mean, if you\u0027ve got two separate tanks as opposed to a single bigger one, you have valves and pipes and casing that\u0027s doubled. It\u0027s inefficient as a function of weight as well. My suggestion is that either the smaller tanks get a slight dry mass increase, or the larger ones get a small mass decrease, so that doubling the size of the fuel tank only increases dry mass by 1.8 or similar. More realistic, in my opinion, and also gives you a little more incentive to choose between them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
