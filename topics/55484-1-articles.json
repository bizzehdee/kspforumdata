It seems to be caused by either docking, computer overheating, or both. It\u0027s not an effect that stems from the actual connection with the docking ports or any symmetrical deviation. It\u0027s not from parts not fitting together. Not sure what it is but it\u0027ll continnue to happen even after you undock them I believe. That\u0027s how it is on my system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that it\u0027s tied together somehow with some of the other bugs in the KSP physics engine.

Otherwise, make sure that none of the docked objects hit each other ever, otherwise this can happen. Another cause may be that those small girders that are attached to the orange fuel tanks are jumbling around. If any part gets affected by moving when it shouldn\u0027t, then it will cause motion on the entire ship. Personally I would suggest scrapping this design and going with something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LJSquared","CreatedById":95823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T03:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe clipping is behind the docking ports on the 5 way docking bit, a few batteries and rcs tank.
