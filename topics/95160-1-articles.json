However, I keep getting stuck on the To The Mun Part 1. I either constantly run out of fuel before I reach the Mun\u0027s atmosphere and am unable to slow my orbit to descend, or I attempt to conserve my fuel but I never have an orbit that reaches remotely close to the Mun. My question is how do I make it to the Mun with enough fuel to slow my orbit?

Secondly, it\u0027s not a dumb question at all! You\u0027re definitely in the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you\u0027re having a bit of trouble properly setting up your Transfer Orbit. A great way to make sure you have the proper trajectory is to create a maneuver node and tweak it so that your trajectory enters the Mun\u0027s Sphere of Influence (you\u0027ll see the orbit change colour).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, it\u0027s just a matter of burning retrograde at periapsis, and you\u0027ll be in a stable orbit around the Mun! The spacecraft is in an Apollo-style setup, so don\u0027t try to land just yet. You will have to transfer a kerbal or two into the lander, then undock it (right click the docking port) from the main spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, take control of the lander (the bracket keys [ ]), and try to land!

I guess what you\u0027re struggling with is figuring out where to place the maneuver nodes. The tutorial does tell you how to use them, but it\u0027s a bit difficult if you\u0027re not familiar with the terminology; you want to stick the maneuver node somewhere on your orbit - anywhere will do; you can adjust it later - and then drag the prograde marker (the green circle with 3 lines sticking out of it, but no cross) until your apoapsis (the \u0022high point\u0022 in your orbit, it\u0027s the \u0022Ap\u0022 marker) reaches out to Mun\u0027s orbit. Once you\u0027ve done that, slide the maneuever node around in your orbit until you have a good intercept. It should look a bit like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/545265666698127501/C1D9D9D88D6D53045FC7C86BE84CD02921C31951/\u0022 alt=\u0022C1D9D9D88D6D53045FC7C86BE84CD02921C31951\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about the various icons and overlays on my screen that you don\u0027t have - or that the navball is bigger. That\u0027s caused by the mods I have installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you want to tweak the prograde/retrograde (the opposite one) to get your Mun periapsis (low point - it\u0027s the Pe marker) down to about 30km (to be safe - ideally you should go lower). If you go too far (Pe marker disappears - that means you\u0027ll hit the Mun) use the retrograde one to drag it back. Don\u0027t worry too much about precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, you need to aim at the node marker on your navball - it\u0027s the dark blue one the arrow is pointing to. Try to get the dot in the middle of the navball to line up with the blue one on the marker as closely as you can. Since it\u0027s the tutorial, you can also use the \u0022hold maneuver\u0022 button to the left of the navball when you activate SAS (T key) - it\u0027s the top right one in the list. Normally you need to level up kerbals pretty far in career mode to have that ability though, so it\u0027s worth learning to work without it. It\u0027s also slightly buggy in 0.90, so be careful about using those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship you\u0027re given takes about 2 minutes to complete the burn plotted by the maneuver node, so wait until 1 minute before the node (i.e. \u0022Node in T - 1m\u0022) before starting the engine. Double check you\u0027re aiming at the maneuver node at the time though! As you\u0027re burning, try to follow the node marker - it\u0027ll almost always move a bit; that\u0027s because you usually can\u0027t line up with it perfectly, but don\u0027t worry about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve completed the burn (the \u0022m/s\u0022 bar is very close to zero), cut engines (X key to do it instantly) and then time-warp until you\u0027re about to cross the \u0022Mun Encounter\u0022 marker. Slow down timewarp to 1000x for that - there\u0027s a minor bug where timewarping through those markers too fast will alter your orbit. After you\u0027ve crossed the marker, your orbit around Mun should look a bit different, and change colour. Next, place a maneuver node at your Mun periapsis, and then drag the retrograde marker out to bring the orbit down from a big arc into a nice, neat circle. You want to get your Ap/Pe to about the same value, but within 5km will be fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
