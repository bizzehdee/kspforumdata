There are a couple great tutorials on how to do this, I don\u0027t do these pure, in the sense that I\u0027ll use correction burns to get the most out of them. aim for a low periapsis, say 15km to maximize my time in low space over the Mun.

In my experience, it takes about a 2/3 - 3/4 of a jetpack to de-orbit, land, then re-orbit and rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, refine your Minmus craft into a Minmus lander. Should be pretty simple since Minmus\u0027s gravity is so low. A few landing legs, some extra fuel, and a Mystery Goo and a Materials Science bay should make a pretty decent lander. Maybe even consider a station in Minmus orbit with a Science Lab (to reset the Goo and Mat.Sci. bay, and store lots of science data) and some fuel, if you have the rendezvous and docking skills down \u0026lt;-- Rendezvous and docking is essential to later stages of gameplay, so get good at it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, science from Minmus should be able to unlock most, if not all, of the Tech Tree. In order to go interplanetary (the next stage of your career), you really should: 1) unlock the nuclear engine, 2) perfect your Rendezvous and Docking techniques, 3) get decent at EVAs, 4) understand the concept of Delta-V and use a dV chart, 5) learn how to use an interplanetary calculator like AlexMoon or Olex\u0027s, 6) get decent at landing your spacecrafts on other bodies (Minmus and Mun are good practice), 7) master inclination changes. There are plenty of resources and tutorials in the forums for all of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time you go interplanetary, you pretty much NEED either MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux, and Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to some of your other questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Getting to the Mun and Minmus without mods involves understanding and using phase angles. Google or search these forums for an explanation and the appropriate phase angles to reach these targets. Usually Minmus is about 115 degrees, and to get to the Mun, burn when the Mun is rising above the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Kerbal Space Center is located on the equator, on the east shore of the Africa-shaped continent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It\u0027s true that in the real world, launch windows are calculated to minimize fuel expenditure. In Kerbal, this is far less important, since Kerbals can survive in orbit indefinitely. Don\u0027t worry about launch windows for now. Launch eastwards and establish a cicular orbit around Kerbin (some people prefer 80km orbital altitude; I prefer 100km). Then let the spacecraft orbit Kerbin as you time-accelerate to the right phase angle and burn point for either Mun or Minmus-- the Kerbonaut inside won\u0027t care! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater on, even in interplanetary missions, you don\u0027t really have to worry about launch windows. I tend to launch a craft whenever I finish building it, stick it in a 100km orbit, then time-accelerate until the planets line up for an interplanetary burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach advanced gameplay or play with Kerbal Life support or something, then launch windows will matter: for setting up a satellite network, or launching to rendezvous with an asteroid, or something like that. But for now, don\u0027t worry about launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T14:07:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NASAHireMe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blondai","CreatedById":80004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T15:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would say I\u0027m advanced intermediate.

From your current tech tree, you should have the mystery goo container and the science Jr available. What you need to do is put them on a ship and fly it to where you want to get science from. When you\u0027re there, right click on them and there is an option to run the experiment. Click on this and you get the dialogue box with some text and the options to \u0022reset\u0022 \u0022keep data\u0022 or \u0022transmit\u0022.

If you make your escape burn so that you depart Mun in the same direction as Mun\u0027s orbit around Kerbin, you will end up on a much higher orbit and possibly escape Kerbin. You don\u0027t want to do this (as you have discovered). You need to time your escape burn so that you come away from Mun in the opposite direction from its orbit around Kerbin. When you escape you will then find you are in an elliptical orbit around Kerbin with quite a low Pe. You need to adjust that orbit to put the Pe inside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, preferably lower than about 30 km. The atmosphere will then slow you down enough that you come in for a landing. If your Pe is in the atmosphere (below 70 km) but higher, you will likely find you don\u0027t lose enough velocity to come down that orbit. When I first came back from Mun, I made this mistake and ended up going around about 20 times, each pass through the atmosphere bleeding off a bit more velocity until eventually my orbit decayed and I landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022donfouts\u0022 data-cite=\u0022donfouts\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIs that hundreds of gameplay hours from now?\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recover this unfortunate Kerbal from an orbit of the sun will take quite a lot of time to learn the techniques to do it. Your first step will be to learn how to perform an orbital rendezvous in low Kerbin orbit. To learn to do this, launch a simple rocket into LKO, then go back to the space centre and launch another one to a similar orbit. By playing with manoeuvre nodes you can figure out how to make the two meet in orbit. This is a key skill in KSP, and takes a fair bit of learning to perfect. There are plenty of youtube videos giving tutorials on how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are confident with orbital rendezvous, you need to build a rescue ship. This will have to have lots of fuel capacity and either a spare seat or \u0022the Klaw\u0022 on it. You can then launch this into a Solar orbit, perform a rendezvous with your stranded vessel. If yo have The Klaw, you can dock with the lost vessel and bring it home. Alternatively, just bring your rescue ship near to it and use EVA to bring the pilot across to the rescue ship to bring him home and leave his ship behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you leave this poor chap where he is and get on with learning the game. Once you have managed a successful Duna orbit and return mission, you will have sufficient experience to know what you need to do to rescue this guy. Think of it as a long-term objective. I\u0027d say 100 hours gameplay is a realistic time frame depending on how easily you get the hang of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general strategy, I would make the following suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) if you haven\u0027t already done it, use the Mystery Goo and Science Jr to get extra science from places you have already been to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) send missions to orbit Mun and Minmus, with the Science Jr and Mystery Goo, and get science from orbit of those, as well as crew reports and EVA reports. All the planets and moons have Biomes on them just like Kerbin, so you can get lots of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the science you get from these missions, your first target will be to unlock the basic solar panels and batteries. This will let you transmit crew reports and EVA reports and make life easier. Your next target will be to unlock the thermometer (the 90 point node with the \u0022man in space suit\u0022 symbol\u0022. This lets you get more science from biomes, and you can take it to the places you have already been. Once you have that, your target should be \u0022landing\u0022 (the 90 point node with the undercarriage wheel on it) and then \u0022advanced landing\u0022 (the next one along, 160 points, with the rocket on legs). These give you landing legs, which will give you the parts you need to actually land on Mun and Minmus. You get lots of science from landing on (and running experiments on the surface of) various biomes on these two moons. At this point, you should be getting loads of science to get much of the middle part of the tech tree unlocked, and you can probably figure it out yourself from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve not seen it suggested before, but I think it might be easier to learn to perform orbital rendezvous in orbit of Minmus rather than LKO.
