It has the capability to turn your \u0027rocket parts\u0027 into actual parts that we would then use to repair the craft during EVA. This could lead to all sorts of really cool launches and missions. After all, instead of just using some anamalous rocket part to repair the alternator, why not use an alternator? It would be an excellent way to differentiate your mod from DangIt since they are functionally similar, and add a layer of \u0027next level\u0027 functionality that represents pretty much what everyone probably hoped for when they thought \u0027wouldn\u0027t a repair mission be cool\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, it would also be nice if the problems were more visually represented. For example, let\u0027s say there is an issue with the gimbal. You might be able to use something like the sparks in Collision FX to show that the gimbal is moving but maybe with reduced range. If the player continues to use it without some sort of repair, it might get stuck in whatever position it was when it finally gave out. Without repair parts it might be possible to still adjust the gimbal to zero it out, or as you\u0027ve already done, perform more proper repairs. In the case of something like a fuel tank, an effect that shows it\u0027s leaking, like a wisp of smoke out in space, just a visual indicator that you may or may not catch, would be cool. Perhaps something like a fuel line is leaking, rather than the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue I have with problems in KSP is they simply occur and a big contributor to any issue is the human factor. Whether it have been improper maintenance, improper installation or maybe just improper operation, we\u0027re pretty much responsible for all our problems. That said, in a game like KSP you have no control over that element and are pretty much relying on the factor of Kerbals being a bit absent-minded or parts being fished out of a river to be the culprit. As such, I think it\u0027s important there has to be a wide distinction between malfunctioning and broken so that the player can be somewhat in control of these problems. For example, what if your landing gear sticks? In an actual plane there are several options available, such as back-up hydraulics, manual extension, gravity extension, or the most dangerous option someone once suggested \u0027see if it could be knocked loose by a touch-and-go\u0027. In KSP those options aren\u0027t really available, so I think if you want to take the malfunction route you should really consider ways in which the player is able to work around these emergencies, especially in situations where they are rapidly running out of options. Does the parachute that tears have a back-up chute? Perhaps there is a way to fire the engine but once started you\u0027ll have no throttle control and it\u0027s going to go until it burns itself out. Can you close up a leaking tank? The player can really only be required to plan for these contingencies so much, how many chutes do I have to put on my craft just in case? Having to manually deploy a reserve chute is plenty stressful without simply rolling the dice to tell the player they lose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best example I can give is the 1.0 release trailer. That thing is dark. The rocket explodes, but Jebidiah and Valentina are like, whatever, pop the chute. Then the chute flies off. Everyone dies, the installing technician is like \u0027crap!\u0027. Unless you get to perform some sort of total diagnostic to let you know your rocket isn\u0027t full of problems waiting to kill everyone on board, there should definitely be some built in safeties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T16:36:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shaymes","CreatedById":140526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T12:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edont know why you 2 guys work at the same project but i like it - maybe make it KIS compatible that you need items like ducktape screwdriver things like that, but dangit or kerbal mechanic will be very interesting in cooperation with Kerbal inventory system\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nezumi","CreatedById":144833,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T21:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been really enjoying this mod.

In the very first stages of the space program, once you unlock decouplers you have a short period where if they fail in the atmosphere, your mission fails. Jeb dies. End of story. Until you revert to launch. Then, once you get a bit farther, you can handle the failure, but the mission has to be aborted. There\u0027s no way around it (and I don\u0027t enjoy being forced to abort a mission because of something I had little control over - if it\u0027s my fault, it\u0027s my own fault, but these failures aren\u0027t really my fault, just my bad luck). Once you start getting out of the Kerbin system, though, (towards Duna/Eve etc) you can deal with the failures of decouplers inside the atmosphere. Sure, you lose that second stage, but you have another that could possibly take you into orbit anyway. You can afford to pay for backup systems. Thing is, out of the gate you can\u0027t afford to pay for those backup systems. One solution could be to remove the failure rate entirely from the first decoupler you unlock (and only that decoupler), although that is less than ideal (and probably would warrant increasing the cost of that decoupler significantly). Alternatively, it could be hard-coded that if that decoupler is purchased at 100% quality, its failure rate is insignificant (as in, 0.1% chance or less) or even 0% (although this could be simulated by adding a new, failure-proof decoupler that is more expensive). This, however, is a lot of work. Also a lot of work would be to \u0022unlock\u0022 failure rates on decouplers at some point in the tech tree (I don\u0027t even know if this is possible). Anyways, I\u0027m seriously considering just taking the failure rate off of the original decoupler for my games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IRnifty","CreatedById":85825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHyomoto and Drake1500, I get that there are issues with the current method of decoupler failures.

I realize now I should have programmed them the same as everything else: With the ability to determine chance of failure before the time for critical use.\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, they are literally a random number the instant they are used. I get that this was wrong, and should I find the time to fix that, I will. Promise. However, I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that I will need to rewrite most if not all of the mod in order to add in failures while not actively steering.
