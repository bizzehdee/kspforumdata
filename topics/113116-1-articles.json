I just go by what worked before and how fast I hit the ground. Also have to take into consideration speed, gravity and atmospheric density. When I think I have enough, I add two more.

I once made a long ionbased mission to minmus (planethopping) for science and n reentry i realize i had no parachutes... So i put up my landinglegs and hoped for the best. Only ONE of the landinglegs broke due to landing on all legs simultaneously, the rest of the craft including the kerbal on board was intact. Landinglegs are op as hell."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T18:26:34Z","Content":"I use RealChute from StupidChris, as it allows you to not only set a number of parameters such as deployment altitudes, it also tweaks the parachute size to aim for a speed that YOU set for landing. Standard is 6 m/s, which is usually slow enough to keep stuff from exploding on landing."},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:19:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E this\n\u003E Also here\u0027s a tip:\n\u003E \n\u003E When I\u0027m parachuting a long ship horizontally to the ground.

Return fuel to tanks. Keep building.\n\nAnd in case you knew that: I always try to drain my fuel to zero when landing on Kerbin on descent.
