SINGLE. DESIGN. has had issues around the Mach 0.95-1.45 region. I just seem to hit a wall, and I need to use rocket boosters to get through it. I\u0027ve been trying to climb and accelerate at the same time, and I\u0027m usually in the 3-7 km altitude region when I hit the wall.\n\nThe only thing that\u0027s come remotely close to making it was this:\n\n![eRLhuZX.png](http://i.imgur.com/eRLhuZX.png)\n\nWith this a close second:\n\n![gsn5DW3.png](http://i.imgur.com/gsn5DW3.png)\n\nI\u0027ve done every practical engine combination, without success, so I\u0027m pretty certain it\u0027s an aerodynamics issue I\u0027m not familiar with.

If you right click on your engine you\u0027ll see that as you pitch up and down the thrust will vary a little and that as you lose speed it will fall and as you speed up it increases. It also varies with altitude, but you aren\u0027t high enough yet for that to be a major factor. Both of your planes look like they use RAPIERs which have a peak thrust much higher on the velocity curve than other engines. This makes them great high altitude, high speed engines, which is why I use them in most of my post-1.0 planes, but means that if you aren\u0027t careful you can get stuck at an apparent wall when you lose too much speed and you no longer have the thrust to go faster. You need to either pick up speed before climbing or add an engine that peaks at a lower velocity to give you a boost. Don\u0027t climb too aggressively unless you have a lot of excess velocity/thrust (too aggressive depends on your plane, but usually 5-10 degrees above prograde is my rule of thumb below 10 km). If you start to lose thrust and airspeed you can point prograde and build it back up. This works even if you lose altitude as long as you don\u0027t fall too far and you pull up slowly because you\u0027ll maintain most of the speed you gained which will give you the thrust to push through. Alternatively adding a Turbo RamJet is a very easy way to get plenty of thrust in the low altitude, low speed portion of your flight, but means extra weight and air intake requirements.\n\nAlso drag and weight are extremely important factors. Yours look reasonably aerodynamic. They look like they might be a little heavy, particularly with just two RAPIERs, but I tend to try to design my SSTOs as light as possible which may give me a bias. You can probably get away with less wing area, but your designs are still fairly reasonable.\n\nThe posts pointed out by I\\_Killed\\_Jeb are good specific examples how to design planes and ascent profiles that work. SSTOs are so varied it is good to know why things like this are necessary so you can accommodate them in your design or ascent profile when they don\u0027t quite match up with specific examples."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T01:26:13Z","Content":"MaverickSawyer,\n\n Both of those spaceplanes look underpowered to me.\n\nYou should keep your takeoff weight under 20t per turbojet and under 17t per rapier.\n\nYour wing loading looks fine, but I\u0027d recommend not using deltas as your primary lifting surface. their parasitic drag is higher than average.

I tend to use the LF/O ones, though, to provide more rocket burn time once it\u0027s been refueled on-orbit.\n\nAs for the deltas... didn\u0027t know about that. That would certainly explain why the upper craft was having so much trouble. Looks like I\u0027m going to have to go the route of the lower one, then.\n\nThank you for the tips and ideas, folks.

Speedbird 1 might do it in 4, but to me it seems it has too much wing area anyway - with so much lifting MK2 surface it really needs token amount of wings - ones so big introduce some serious drag."}]}
