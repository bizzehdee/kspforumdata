With a cloud layer almost completely covering the planet[land could still be seen, so you won\u0027t need scansat to land on laythe], once you pass that layer it will be very hazy, and a visible blue horizon from orbit? I\u0027m still thinking of what color the layer should be, so if you guys are down with this idea, I would like if you suggested a color.(I dunno about orange, because titan is already orange and that would seem a tiny bit un-original, but if you guys would be okay with orange that could work very well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke - I really don\u0027t know about Ike, should it reflect sunlight like the Mun does?

Being that Vall is an analogue for Europa, and Eeloo being an analogue for Pluto, should either Vall or Eeloo get an atmosphere, or should they both? Or would you rather no changes to them?
