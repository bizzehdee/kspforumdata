It needs tested pretty thoroughly (normal gameplay most importantly, but some people should try playing with it to see if it responds correctly). It may not seem like much, but this is a fairly monumental change (in my opinion).

Mostly small graphical fixes or improvements to some existing systems. Recently there were tweakscale related issues that I fixed and issues with the Upgrades window being out of sync. I\u0027ve gotta do some testing on the system I just put in last night for resetting modules when recovering to storage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI moved most of the settings for it out into a config file so that users can add more modules (presumably from mods) that absolutely need to be reset, along with the parameters they should have reset. So things like ModuleEngines and ModuleEnginesFX or ModuleParachute are in there by default to turn off engines and repack chutes, but there isn\u0027t anything for RealChutes for instance and people might want that to be reset. A lot easier to change a config file than to have a new release after every new mod gets added. The only hardcoded modules are ModuleScienceData and Log. The first gets totally removed (it\u0027s literally science data, which gets recovered and so needs to be removed) and the second gets all of the values removed (that\u0027s the trip logger I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding the RealChutes module should be as easy as adding something like the following (but with the right parameters) to the KCT_ModuleTemplates.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E  name = ModuleRealChute\u003Cbr\u003E  state = STOWED\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also might play around with the math parser some more. If I change from a character by character parser to a block by block one (with each block being separated by an operator, such as \u0022\u002B\u0022) I can probably speed things up. There\u0027s also a limitation that nested min(x,y) and max(x,y) functions must be placed in the second slot [the \u0022y\u0022 slot, ie min(x, max(a,\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E), not min(max(a,\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E,y)] which I can probably fix by checking the current \u0022depth\u0022 when the comma is encountered. The current method splits the string by commas, takes the first split as \u0022x\u0022 and everything else as \u0022y\u0022. Checking the depth would split it into exactly two parts at the appropriate place, meaning you could nest anything you wanted in any slot as many times as you like. By depth, I mean \u0022how many parenthesis are there\u0022 where \u0022(\u0022 increases the depth by 1 and \u0022)\u0022 decreases the depth by 1. So, starting at depth=0, the first \u0022(\u0022 in min(max(a,\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E,y) sets the depth to 1, the second one encountered at max( sets it to 2, a comma is encountered, the \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E sets it back to 1, a second comma is encountered, and the last ) sets it to 0, which lets us know we\u0027re done. The appropriate comma would be ONLY in depth 1. The one encountered in depth 2 isn\u0027t the correct one and is ignored. Any additional \u0022)\u0022 later would be depth -1 or lower, but the parser would have stopped searching already when it got to 0. \u003Cem\u003ETechnically\u003C/em\u003E I think we start at depth 0 and ignore the first \u0022(\u0022, and stop when depth goes negative, but it\u0027s equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might not get to work on things for a few days, but I might push one or two more small changes here and there.

Maybe I\u0027ll get at least the parser to let you enter a date in normal time rather than seconds. I obviously never got around to finishing that feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Aaaannnnnd done! Well, somewhat. You can now enter a time in \u0022colon formatted\u0022 format, so yy:dd:hh:mm:ss. You don\u0027t have to use higher terms (like years), but must always go down to seconds. So 10:3:16:23 would be day 10, hour 3, minute 16, second 23. You can also now set an \u0022absolute time\u0022 like before, or can use time relative to the current time (by clicking the \u0022From Current UT\u0022 button). Both ways account for Kerbin days/years vs Earth days/years. Absolute time uses the KSP convention of starting at Year 1, Day 1. So if you put 2:3:0:0:0 it\u0027ll go to Year 2, day 3, rather than Year 3, day 4. Relative time doesn\u0027t need to worry about that problem, so if you put in 2 years, it\u0027ll advance time by two years, which is year 3 if current UT is 0 (a new game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t automatically fill in relative time based on when the ship would finish, but you can always do that yourself.
