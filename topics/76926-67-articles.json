The opposite team had a rocket on the pad that, when launched, would eventually enter the first teams sightline, which should try to shoot it down I would think. Team two also had missile trucks that were set up to counter team ones missiles once they were seen.

I wanted to do more, but I figured I\u0027d release what I\u0027ve done so far so at least you can play with it and find mistakes I made with the new stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome specific comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew visuals: \u003C/strong\u003E The smoke trails are thicker and more solid, the tracers are brighter and more visible at a distance. I hope you like them. I also changed around some of the tracer colors - not all of them are red anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA note to part makers: \u003C/em\u003E With the new tracer effects, you may need to adjust the tracer start and end widths of your turrets - they may look smaller than they were before. Look at my turret configs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmart Guards: \u003C/strong\u003EThe guards will use missiles when you are further than 2km, and switch to guns when you get close. As before, they will switch weapons when the selected missile or gun\u0027s ammo is depleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I eventually want the guards to choose appropriate weapons based on the weapons\u0027 optimal range, type of missile, etc. I will also eventually put an option to bring it back to old behaviour, so it only uses the one weapon you choose for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERicochet: \u003C/strong\u003EBullets have a chance to ricochet depending on the angle they hit surfaces. There are also new sound effects for bullet impacts and ricochets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustomizable explosions: \u003C/strong\u003E This one is for part creators. Any part that uses explosions - bombs, rockets, missiles, cannons - no longer uses the \u0027size\u0027 parameter for explosions. Instead, they take a file path for an explosion effect model and sound effect. Ask me for specifics if you are trying to make something. You can just not define these, and they will default to the already existing explosion model and sound. Check the mk82 and cluster bomb configs for an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETweaked damage: \u003C/strong\u003E Things generally do less damage, and explosion force/damage doesn\u0027t pass through all objects. Parts with high impact tolerance like structural plates etc can be used as armor to some extent. Direct hits from missiles or volley\u0027s of high caliber rounds are still pretty deadly, but you could probably walk/fly away from a glancing hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECountermeasures\u003C/strong\u003E are \u003Cem\u003Efinite\u003C/em\u003E, so use them wisely. I find that its enough to drop 4-6 in front of a missile, then turn away. If you are/were spamming countermeasures and still got hit, you should try different maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T22:20:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BahamutoD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T22:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Changed: Missiles and bombs are not explosive until they are fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat prompted this change?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T22:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA stray bullet to a mounted missile would chain-reaction destroy the whole vessel... it was kind of annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eeveelution","CreatedById":81194,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T23:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan shells ricochet an infinite amount of times?
