Spinup torque is horribly sudden.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, when you make robotic wheels and other ground rotors they don\u0027t have traction control.\u00A0\u00A0 This would basically provide them with traction control.\u00A0 This is literally what traction control is.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently, the improvised solution I use is to turn down my engine torque during takeoff to reduce the spinup torque.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking of adding some computer units to the planes to \u0022smooth\u0022 any transitions as well.\u00A0 This could help a lot.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
