I have a issue or a bug which causes any other vessel than my own craft that i\u0027m piloting, to be invisible. I can only see the square marking the object til\u0027 about 150 meters or so and then the rectangle disappears too. When i go to the exact spot where the other plane (i\u0027m talking mostly about planes here, haven\u0027t tried this with objects a lot or with orbiting vessels) is supposed to be,\u00A0 my own craft just taxis as usual. I\u0027ve also tried this with a plane and a runway marker thingy or whatever (you know those\u00A0T-shaped poles with lights on them what they put near the beginning of runways in real life), no difference. What could be the cause for this? I took a couple of screenshots of the situation on Steam, how do i put them here? In case i cannot upload them in the future, here\u0027s the deal in the pics: i taxied an Eurofighter Typhoon (stock) to the front of a yellow door left of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 main doors, and then i took an F-18 and did the same, still can\u0027t see the Eurofighter from the F-18 or the F-18 from the Eurofighter. Both planes seem to be almost in the exact same spot (really they are indeed in the same place) when watched from the view where you can select which facility to go to (what\u0027s this view called, btw?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T16:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t have to repost the same topic just because no one answered the first time...sometimes it takes a while \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to upload some screenshots, here is a good tutorial for different hosts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5166074464\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173756-quick-guide-to-posting-pictures-on-the-forum/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, some additional informations are welcome, like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich KSP version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich OS?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this happen since you are playing or did the problem appear after some time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you changes anything on your KSP install just before this problem occures?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happens when you try to switch between those vessels by using the hotkeys (I don\u0027t know the default keys for other keyboard layouts then german, you have to look\u00A0 into your settings)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny mods installed (I know, this is the unmodded sub-forum but just to be sure)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you already tried anything to fix this problem, like reinstalling KSP/verify gamefiles through steam?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspguy77","CreatedById":189458,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-21T04:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t even notice i had reposted.

ModuleManager creates a cache for patches which may still contains the patch files for your deleted mod. This would explain why these parts still show up in your game and it may also causes some other issues. Please be sure to that your GameData folder just contains \u003Cspan\u003Ea \u0027Squad\u0027 folder and, if you have the DLC installed, a \u0027SquadExpansion\u0027 folder. Nothing else! (\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003ECaution: If any modded parts are still used in any craft, they will break!!!\u003C/span\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf ModuleManager is uninstalled as well and these parts still show up in your game, you can try to delete the PartDatabase. This is a file in your KSP install folder, called \u0027PartDatabase.cfg\u0027. Just quit your game and delete this file. The \u0027PartDatabase.cfg\u0027 will be recreated automatically as soon as you restart your game.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223402648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176040\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221529556676\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189458\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kspguy77\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, kspguy77 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVerify gamefiles through steam?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight click on KSP in your steam library -\u0026gt; Properties -\u0026gt; local files -\u0026gt; verify integrity of game files.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would prefer a clean reinstall but verifying the gamedata is faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to do a clean reinstall, make sure to backup your savegame and that everything else got deleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
