That\u0027s not the point of an ion engine... W.H.Y?\n\nI stand corrected. I think the existing ion engine is too large actually. We should have it scaled down to 1mm and only use it for orbital corrections on a single blinking LED. Seriously though, I\u0027d like to have a larger ion engine to do exactly the kind of stuff I do with the existing ion engine, but scaled up. Mainly, I\u0027d like it to be useful for sending larger probes to distant places.... or smaller probes to the same places quicker... or more simply, reduce the part count for missions where I normally use 4 ion engines. You can only get so far scaling down payloads.

It is a larger ion engine composed of multiple smaller ion engines. Take 2 normal ion engines and mount them in parallel. You get double the thrust and double the power consumption! Alert the presses! What you\u0027re talking about is holding the reaction mass (Xenon) use constant and ramping up power. I\u0027m talking about using more reaction mass along with the additional power. In that case, thrust, power consumption, and reaction mass use all scale linearly."},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T15:25:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Part of the confusion is that what are normally called \u0022radiators\u0022 for cars or computers are actually convectors. They use airflow through a high surface area device to carry heat away through convection; very little is lost as actual radiation. We should take a note from the Germans, who just call them coolers.\n\nDepends on airflow. Granted, even with still air, you are probably convecting 80% of the heat from the radiator as convection and conduction in to the bits of the vehicle touching the radiator, but a measurable and reasonable amount is still being radiated (by my math, using .20 as the emissivity of heavily oxidized aluminum, about 200W). This would of course be at idle. Spray paint that thing black and you\u0027d up that significantly to 900w or so. Of course you\u0027d also reduce convection...which would be a bad thing, since that is the primary way it removed heat (since your radiator is probably dumping 10% of the energy produced by combustion, with only about 30% of it utilized as workable energy by the engine and the rest out the tailpipe or in to outer bits, like radiated/convected from the engine itself, the engine oil, pumping air, etc.). Engine cranking 150hp means it is probably dumping something like 9-10kw in to the coolant. That is a lot of heat to move.\n\nAs everyone else mentioned, radiation is how they work. Which takes a great deal of surface area and/or a very high temperature. I haven\u0027t looked at cooling systems for space vehicles in AGES, but my guess is a lot of the manned ones use heat pumps to make this more efficient. If you are only trying to cool something like 80F coolant a few degrees, it is going to take a HUGE surface area, even in space. However, if you utilize a heat pump and can heat that coolant up to 200F on the hotside, you just doubled your radiative losses. Heat it up to 400F and you\u0027ve nearly doubled it again. So what might have been a 10m^2 radiator, you can bump down to 5m^2 or even 2.5m^2.\n\nThis is a big issue with generating and utilizing power in space. You have a 1000w electrical system in a space ship, you are going to need to radiate 1000w of heat. Give or take of course. The shell of the ship will radiate heat. Then again, in sunlight it\u0027ll absorb heat. In orbit, the balance is generally on losing more heat than gaining (because half your ship is in sunlight on the daylight side and at night the entire ship is radiating heat). At least from \u0022room temperature\u0022. Hence why \u0022shut down\u0022 space stations stablize at something like 0F or so.\n\nHowever, start generating electricity and using it on the station and you can quickly \u0022bake\u0022 the ship if your radiators are not working. A few kw of power can seriously heat up a station if you cannot dump some of that heat. Space shuttle had radiators in the shuttle bay doors and the shuttle would orient itself so that the radiators were generally facing away from the sun to dump heat. If they bay doors failed for some reason, the shuttle would have limited time in orbit before it would have to return to Earth, because it would have no way to dump the dozens of kws of heat being generated."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:15:04Z","Content":"An inline drill.
