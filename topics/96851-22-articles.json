I do have the link \u0026amp; upload image options, but both of those require a URL where the file is already available online- mine is not. I also tried just dragging \u0026amp; dropping the file to my \u0022go advanced\u0022 quick-reply here, but it won\u0027t accept it that way either. I went to the FAQ for uploading a file and its directions are misleading as there is no \u0022new post\u0022 button here- only the \u0022reply to thread\u0022 button which does not have a \u0022manage attachments\u0022 option.
