(But it works, so don\u0027t sweat it!) It is more efficient to pitch over much sooner but not so far, and then follow the prograde direction until you are in orbit. Pitching about 5-10 deg as soon as your rocket is at 50 - 100 m/s speed and then following the prograde vector once it is down to your pitch angle is usually a good strategy. But the exact parameters depend on the rocket (how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and how much drag it has during its flight).

not enough to begin tearing pieces off or cause overheating problems, but one of the things to remember about rocket control is that fins (or, in this case, the solid rocket boosters which on this design work to a similar purpose) help stability\u00A0by introducing drag at the aft of the rocket.\u00A0 However, drag increases with thrust.\u00A0 This is often a good thing, because it means that at least until it causes heating problems, the faster you go, the more stable your rocket is in its flight, but you then get new problems when you try to turn and find that your rocket is \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E stable that it \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E turn--or, worse, tears itself apart when you

something else with it--add a solar panel and it easily has enough propellant to take a sightseeing tour of Kerbin\u0027s moons.\u00A0 If we assume that the rocket that you have is the rocket that you want to build, then there are a number of ways to get better performance from it.\u00A0 One way is to reduce the thrust of the solid rocket boosters:\u00A0 you can reduce that thrust by about half and still be slightly overpowered at the pad.\u00A0 You can do this with thrust limiters, but you can also do it by splitting the solid rocket boosters into two stages.\u00A0 Light one pair at launch and the second pair as the first burn out.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAnother choice is to improve your flight profile.\u00A0 You have a mostly-up path, and since you got it into space, that obviously worked, but there is nothing wrong with improvement.\u00A0 For a typical well-designed rocket, you should build up speed to about 100 m/s or reach an altitude of 1,000 metres, whichever comes first (and I usually try to get both at the same time), and then gently tip the rocket about three degrees to the east of straight up.\u00A0 Then you keep it turning gently so that you reach forty-five degrees at about 10 km and approach horizontal\u00A0at about 30 km.\u00A0 That may seem a bit low to you, but remember that for one thing, that altitude can be adjusted, and for another, orbit is not about going up, it\u0027s about going sideways.\u00A0 The idea is to try to\u00A0make this as smooth a motion as possible.\u00A0 Your rocket is overpowered enough to potentially make that difficult, but on the other hand, it\u0027s also over-fuelled enough to give you lots of room for error, which means lots of room to learn what works and what does not.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EHowever, I will say that for your\u00A0rocket, you will want to turn a bit harder and earlier than I would normally recommend.\u00A0 The reason is because the ideal rocket only should use\u00A0enough upward thrust to counter the pull of gravity, and it should put the rest to moving horizontally, because horizontal velocity is what puts you into an orbit.\u00A0 Since your rocket has an abundance of thrust, it can put more to horizontal velocity while still

some terminology.\u00A0 Your 90-degrees-parallel is actually zero degrees of pitch.\u00A0 Ninety degrees of pitch is straight up (although\u00A0once you are in orbit, it is probably more appropriate to say that it is straight\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E).\u00A0 However, pitch is often considered in relative terms (pitch down three degrees from prograde, for

not enough to begin tearing pieces off or cause overheating problems, but one of the things to remember about rocket control is that fins (or, in this case, the solid rocket boosters which on this design work to a similar purpose) help stability\u00A0by introducing drag at the aft of the rocket.\u00A0 However, drag increases with thrust.\u00A0 This is often a good thing, because it means that at least until it causes heating problems, the faster you go, the more stable your rocket is in its flight, but you then get new problems when you try to turn and find that your rocket is \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E stable that it \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E turn--or, worse, tears itself apart when you

something else with it--add a solar panel and it easily has enough propellant to take a sightseeing tour of Kerbin\u0027s moons.\u00A0 If we assume that the rocket that you have is the rocket that you want to build, then there are a number of ways to get better performance from it.\u00A0 One way is to reduce the thrust of the solid rocket boosters:\u00A0 you can reduce that thrust by about half and still be slightly overpowered at the pad.\u00A0 You can do this with thrust limiters, but you can also do it by splitting the solid rocket boosters into two stages.\u00A0 Light one pair at launch and the second pair as the first burn out.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAnother choice is to improve your flight profile.\u00A0 You have a mostly-up path, and since you got it into space, that obviously worked, but there is nothing wrong with improvement.\u00A0 For a typical well-designed rocket, you should build up speed to about 100 m/s or reach an altitude of 1,000 metres, whichever comes first (and I usually try to get both at the same time), and then gently tip the rocket about three degrees to the east of straight up.\u00A0 Then you keep it turning gently so that you reach forty-five degrees at about 10 km and approach horizontal\u00A0at about 30 km.\u00A0 That may seem a bit low to you, but remember that for one thing, that altitude can be adjusted, and for another, orbit is not about going up, it\u0027s about going sideways.\u00A0 The idea is to try to\u00A0make this as smooth a motion as possible.\u00A0 Your rocket is overpowered enough to potentially make that difficult, but on the other hand, it\u0027s also over-fuelled enough to give you lots of room for error, which means lots of room to learn what works and what does not.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EHowever, I will say that for your\u00A0rocket, you will want to turn a bit harder and earlier than I would normally recommend.\u00A0 The reason is because the ideal rocket only should use\u00A0enough upward thrust to counter the pull of gravity, and it should put the rest to moving horizontally, because horizontal velocity is what puts you into an orbit.\u00A0 Since your rocket has an abundance of thrust, it can put more to horizontal velocity while still countering gravity.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I typically try to keep my apoapsis approximately 30 seconds ahead of me while in the upper atmosphere,

of them is the practical inability of rocket engines to be shut off and reignited an infinite number of times:\u00A0 for a lot of (even most) rockets, the engines are ignited once and that\u0027s it.\u00A0 The Titan and Saturn rockets worked this way.\u00A0 Even the Space Shuttle Main Engines worked this way:\u00A0 they were ignited by external igniters on the ground--they did not have the ability to start themselves at all.\u00A0 Restartable engines do exist (the SPS engine that Apollo spacecraft used in lunar orbit is one example) but they introduce a lot of engineering complexity--especially since rockets typically need to enter orbit only once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother reason is that Earth is much larger than Kerbin.\u00A0 Kerbin has a radius of 600 kilometres.\u00A0 Earth\u0027s radius is nearly 6400 kilometres.\u00A0 Even though your gravity and altitude above the surface is the same, the curvature of the planet is much more pronounced in KSP, which means that you will get much shorter orbital periods.\u00A0 That, in turn, means that it doesn\u0027t take so much to make a circular orbit--and the difference is enough that, for the available thrust, you often end up needing to simply shut the engines off and coast to a better place to complete your burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo actually answer your question, typically, yes, you should shut your engines off and coast.\u00A0 However, it has nothing to do with your altitude, but rather is tied to the altitude of the orbit that you want.\u00A0 If you want a 75 km orbit, then you should shut down your engines when the apoapsis reaches 75 km.\u00A0 If you want a 300 km orbit, then you should shut down when your apoapsis reaches 300 km.\u00A0 I will note that if you are still in the atmosphere when you do this, then your apoapsis will begin to drop because of air resistance slowing your ascent, but the remedy to that is to simply burn for an apoapsis slightly above what you
