One thing i\u0027ve noticed adding a bunch of mods at once is that the module manager .dll is duplicated a lot. Should i let these duplicate with (1),(2),etc or overwrite? I\u0027m assuming duplicate as I overwrote them last night and some mods didn\u0027t activate in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do some modders leave the \u0027game data\u0027 folder in the zip file when you have to move the mod into your own game data folder?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-16T13:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly keep the most recent ModuleManager. Multiple versions can lead to unwanted behaviour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome modders assume it is easiest to the mod drop in your KSP folder and merge their GamaData with yours. Others want to you drop their mod in your GamaData folder. Since there is no standard on this both methods get used in roughly equal numbers. People who actually KNOW what they\u0027re doing see the difference and install mods correctly either way. The digitally challenged however just do whatever they think is right or what they did last time. Hence the overflow of mod complaints that could simply have been avoided by a correct install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-16T13:49:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2017 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Tex_NL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synyster31","CreatedById":163338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-16T16:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhh I see, i was under the impression the .dll file was like a config file for each mod, not that it actuall\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the Module Manager itself!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-16T16:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like this is a request for support with mods, and so, moved to modded support.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
