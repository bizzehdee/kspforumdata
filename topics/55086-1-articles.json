But I\u0027ve also got mobile Kethane refineries in several other spots; these are 300-ton vessels designed to land on low-gravity moons, fill up with Kethane, refine as necessary, take off, and place themselves in convenient orbits to act as pseudo-stations.

And they\u0027re much easier to dock with than a big station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my game, I\u0027ve currently got five of these depots outside of the Kerbin-Mun-Minmus SOI (each of which has several, mainly for testing purposes). I have one around Duna (refills on Ike), one around Eve (refills on Gilly), and three at Jool (one in low Laythe orbit, one out near Pol\u0027s orbit, and an intermediate one near Vall\u0027s orbit; all refill on Pol). It makes it very easy to do interplanetary trips, when you can fill your tanks at each step. I\u0027m planning on putting another at Duna and another at Eve, to cover both high and low orbits, but there\u0027s no real reason to place any at Moho, Dres, or Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m also planning on launching several of my giant (870 tons) space stations to other planets in the near future. They\u0027ve got plenty of engine power and fuel, but I\u0027m still refining the basic design a bit before the trip. The reason is, one day we\u0027ll get an official resource system. When that happens, it\u0027s unlikely we\u0027ll be able to have self-sufficient mobile vessels simply because the fuels would require multiple ingredients from different locations. That means that space stations will be our refineries, with ships only serving to move the raw materials to and from them, and that means it\u0027s important to get some practice with large stations now. Of course, that\u0027ll depend heavily on the specifics of the resource system...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T01:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy vote is for Laythe.
