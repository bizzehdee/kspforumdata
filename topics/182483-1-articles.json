Pay close attention to your navball. Is it flipping between the prograde and retrograde markers near the surface? If it does then retrograde \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will usually just default to standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E hold, but it has been known to try and flip your craft over to keep pointing retrograde - except that now retrograde is towards the planet\u0027s surface. The solution is to either make sure that you watch your velocity (in the window above the navball) and control your throttle carefully so that you don\u0027t arrest your descent too early.

Descending was way easier when I reduced my outwardmost engine to 89%, I was even able to\u00A0pull off a suicide burn, however after a dozen attempts or so the best case scenario is my fist section laying on it\u0027s side with all peripherals attached. No matter how smooth I came down it always fell on a side, but it should be easier to get it upright than land perfect.
