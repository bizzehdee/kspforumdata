I am slowly teasing secrets out of this new aero model that are making it easier to get heavy craft into space, and back again. Right now, I feel confident enough in this design to give you guys a sneak peak at what I\u0027ve been able to make so far.\n\nI present to you all, the -------. Well, it doesn\u0027t really have a name yet, it\u0027s still simply designated as Jak-102. It is, a 305 ton, 34 engine equipped(26 rapiers, 8 lv-n\u0027s), 45 ton payload hauling SSTO. I\u0027ve been able to get it orbital already with an empty cargo hold and i\u0027m currently tweaking the design a bit to get it orbital with a 45 ton refueling pod in it\u0027s cargo hold. It can already break atmosphere with it\u0027s full payload and still re-enter atmosphere intact. The flight profile for getting it orbital is a bit strange, coming from KSP 0.90 and earlier, but from what I\u0027ve read, it\u0027s quite similar to it\u0027s smaller brethren. The design it\u0027s self is meant to act as an orbital mothership once orbit is reached, hence the LV-N rockets. And with a full refueling, it\u0027s got 19K Delta-V for the LV-N\u0027s.\n\n![heavyssto10-1_zps7adwzur9.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/heavyssto10-1_zps7adwzur9.jpg)\n\n![heavyssto10-2_zpsoja3upnq.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/heavyssto10-2_zpsoja3upnq.jpg)\n\nA bit of the info I have been able to tease out(and some of this may already be known):\n\n1: The wings only need a total lift rating of 10% of the crafts weight to fly, not really well though. But a total lift rating of at least 25% is needed to give it a manageable glide profile. 50% allows it to fly completely level/horizontal. Anything more then 50% lift rating per ton is just extra drag.\n\n2: In order to go supersonic, a thrust to weight ratio of 1.25 seems to be the absolute minimum needed. Even at this amount, it requires going into a shallow dive to gain enough extra speed to break the sound barrier before the engines can spool up to full thrust. This is true for both the Turbo Ramjet and the Rapier engines. A thrust to weight ratio of 1.40 will allow the craft to break the speed of sound and go supersonic in a shallow climb. And in level flight, a TWR of 1.40 allows it to go supersonic at low altitudes. Once the craft breaks the speed of sound, even with the minimim 1.25 TWR, the craft can still maintain supersonic flight while going into a much steeper climb, or even keep accelerating if you let it.\n\n3: The medium sized MK3 cargo bay has a fairly weak connection strength to the rear fuel tank, making it a primary failure point. Trying to reinforce this connection using struts that go from the fuel tank to the cargo bay cause instant structural failure the moment it is launched. BUT, connecting struts from the fuel tank, to a separate part, and then connecting struts from this separate part to the cargo bay, does allow the connection to be reinforced successfully.\n\n4: The gimbaling on the Rapiers is a bit silly. Sometimes it is too strong, other times it is not enough. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) KSP, your drunk...\n\n5: With large aircraft like this, a gentle stick is very important. Pulling up to hard causes an aerodynamic hit on the wing surfaces that can tear them apart. Turning on the other hand, they don\u0027t seem to mind so much.\n\n6: speed.... yeah... Over speed is a very dangerous drug. For this craft, the top safe speed is 1100m/s @ 9000m. It\u0027s actual top speed @ 9000m is somewhere above 1300m/s, moments before it\u0027s wings start melting off and it eats its own air intakes. heh heh\n\n7: Brakes, air brakes are important. When you\u0027ve got enough thrust to go supersonic, it\u0027s even harder to slow down... I still need to find the right spot to add them to my SSTO, but they are very important for re-entry. Every little bit of speed you can bleed off early in the re-entry, saves your wings from being burned off, and air brakes work very well at giving you that little extra drag you need. And yeah, they have that nice sci-fi feel to them as well. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n8: Reaction Wheels. Yeah, they only help once you breach the 20K altitude mark, otherwise your wings and tail fins should suffice. But when your craft weighs over 300 tons, you\u0027re going to need quite a few of them...\n\n9: Last of all, intakes. For the Rapiers at least, having 2 rapiers per ram air intake seems to be the ideal amount when your craft can go supersonic. I always end up having plenty of air intake left(ok, maybe not plenty, but some...) once the craft pierces the 20K altitude mark and switches too closed cycle. The Turbo Ramjets seem to have similar properties but I haven\u0027t tested them as much due to this design needing the Rapiers for their duel modes.\n\nTip from Kagame:\n\n10: when attaching cargo to your cargo bay be careful of the slightly buggy attachment point snap. if attaching the cargo to the front or back of the cargo bay, it can sometimes attach to the fuselage part in front/back of the cargo bay instead of the cargo bay it\u0027s self. This can cause the cargo bay to detach on launch, breaking you craft. If this happens, try re attaching your decoupler/docking port to its mounting point and see if it connects to the cargo bay correctly this time. (I can confirm this issue, I\u0027ve had the same problem when adding large reaction wheels to the JAK-102. It effects more parts then just the cargo hold it seems)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T00:30:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T07:27:01Z","Content":"Nice!\n\nDownload though?\n\nAlso, it\u0027s for 1.0.2, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:52:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m waiting on uploading it for download until I can get it orbital with a payload.

In my experience, it\u0027s actually due to accidentally attaching the decouplers for whatever payload you\u0027re using to the fuel tank instead of the actual cargo bay. Try detaching everything but the cargo bay, then attaching your payload to the cargo bay\u0027s little green dots, then attaching everything else again. If that fails, begin all over again, you\u0027ve got a part clipped funny somewhere. It also seems like you have an abnormally high amount of those nukie engines and intakes- my preference is to use Sabres alone and double the amount of fuel you\u0027re using. My last Mk. 3 cargo ship needed about fourteen of them, if memory holds. I\u0027m trying out a trimaran layout to add SABRE mounting points and overall craft rigidity, I\u0027ll get back to you on whether that works or not. Finally: Dude, use the FAT-455 control surfaces. In fact, add control surfaces overall. That\u0027s probably the reason you\u0027ve got issues getting it into orbit, because you can\u0027t get there in the first place! =P. And add RCS thrusters, as air tends to act... silly... past 20K. (This is based off of my experiences in 1.0, though, yours may differ.)\n\nEDIT: Still working on the trimaran layout. It is an absolute pig to fly, it rolls given the slightest provocation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T23:44:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T01:13:29Z","Content":"@Kagame That is some good advice, I\u0027ve added it to the list of tips. As for the thrust part, the 26 rapier engines are needed to get the TWR high enough to go supersonic. You can\u0027t see all 26 due to careful clipping of the engines to keep it from getting to big and to keep the engines from over heating each other. The 8 LV-n\u0027s are needed due to it\u0027s heavy weight, but they are only ment to be used for orbital transfers once an orbit has been achieved. Without a cargo it can already reach a minimal orbit of 76,000m and from there transfer to a higher orbit, or even make a Mun run. It\u0027s just the added weight of the cargo has reduced it\u0027s current delta-v, which I\u0027ll fix when I next load up the game. As for the FAT-455, that is what the center-ish wing already is. That\u0027s the pivot point of the front half of the craft making that a good spot to have that wing. The smaller canard on the nose is for fine adjustments and to reduce the over control it was suffering from.\n\nAlso, the only mod I have installed is Kerbal Engineer, so I do not have access to the Sabre engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:51:21Z","Content":"Jaka 4 turbo jets where 2 of those rapiers are would help a lot, give you that push over the 320m/s barrier and once you switch the engine modes you will not need the extra rapiers anywho, i have gone to putting turbo jets into the designs of all my SSTO\u0027s, seems to be the best way, 1 turbo jet for every 2 rapiers is a good rule i have found (This rule only works in toe with nuclear engines 4 rapiers and 2 turbo jets per nuke i found for smaller SSTO\u0027s, could go more nukes the bigger the craft is) without nuclear engines there is no point using them though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T02:54:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Roflcopterkklol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakalth","CreatedById":136495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T04:14:17Z","Content":"I\u0027ll have a downloadable version available tomorrow when I get home from work.

It didn\u0027t quite reach the potential I was hoping it would reach, but it is still orbital and is a good learning tool. The SSTO can still carry an orange tank into orbit, but for now, it burns the fuel out of it to help with orbital ascent. Without the orange tank, it still reaches orbit with basically the same amount of fuel left. I had to change a few things around on it again to fix a problem I didn\u0027t notice at first due to it only happening during re-entry. The changes have altered its flight profile a little, reducing it\u0027s pitch authority, but not enough to alter its ability to go orbital.\n\nThe Jak-102 \u0022TopKnot\u0022, is a heavy ssto with a decent sized cargo bay for orbital activities. I couldn\u0027t think of a better name for the ssto, sorry... ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) It might be possible to keep the orange tank full once in orbit, if you drop the LV-N\u0027s and engine necells they are attached to, but this might also leave it stranded in orbit with no oxidizer to deorbit and you\u0027ll need to add more air intakes to make up for the loss of the 8 on the LV-N necells.\n\n![heavyssto10-4_zpscopyfrn2.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/heavyssto10-4_zpscopyfrn2.jpg)\n\nThis is the new look of the Jak-102. The LV-N\u0027s were moved forwards to help keep the center of mass from shifting so far backwards as the fuel is burned off. It has 24 airbrakes that are deployed only when the normal brakes are applied, or when the parking brake is turned on. This is to prevent them from slowing the craft down while maneuvering(if they even do that), and because that is simply how I wanted them to work. How it looks fully deployed can be seen below.\n\n![heavyssto10-3_zpsgmlupcyc.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/heavyssto10-3_zpsgmlupcyc.jpg)\n\nI know, the cargo bay doors clip through several parts, but that is simply how I had to do it with how this craft is built...\n\nFlight profile:\n\nTake off: Set the throttle to about 75% on the runway and let the craft run the length of the runway to build up speed. At the end of the runway, pull up lightly to get it flying, then pull up some more(more aggressively) until it is nosed up 20 deg from horizontal.\n\nClimbing: Continue to fly at a 20 deg nose up. adjust the throttle to maintain speed under 300m/s as you climb for efficiency sake. At about 8000m, go to full throttle and nose down to between 5 and 10 deg, or until it\u0027s climb rate nearly stops. Let the craft build up speed. This can take some time due to it being a large and heavy craft, but it will eventually accelerate up to supersonic speeds. Let the craft accelerate up to about 1000m/s and watch the heat on the middle wings and ram air intakes, they are the first to overheat if it starts going too fast. At this speed, reduce thrust until it\u0027s acceleration pretty much stops. The craft at this point should be over 9000m, probably just shy of 11Km and climbing. Keeping a close eye on the heat of the middle wings, let the craft accelerate slowly to about 1100m/s as it continues to climb to 19Km. At this point, or a little sooner, it has probably switched to closed cycle on the rapiers. Throttle up enough to maintain speed on the rapiers and, as it continues to climb, little by little bring down the throttle when it starts accelerating again. Using minimal throttle to get to orbit should save you a little fuel for orbital burns later on.\n\nOrbit: In orbit, swith to the LV-N\u0027s for orbital corrections. They are a lot more efficient, but take a lot longer to make corrections. In space, it changes direction slowly, using only reaction wheels to turn. RCS thrusters could be added to improve orbital maneuvering if you wish to do so. Deploy the 2 large solar panels, which are behind the middle wings, to generate power. Be sure to retract them before re-entry.\n\nRe-entry: Set a re-entry orbit to graze the atmosphere at an altitude of 50,000m, but try not to go much deeper into the atmosphere then this. A shallow descent is needed to bleed off the orbital speed before the craft overheats. Once it has descended to 60Km, deploy the airbrakes by applying the parking brakes like you would on the ground. You can deploy them sooner, but they don\u0027t really help this early. Deploying them any later and you loose out on some of the initial drag they give that reduces how much the craft accelerates as gravity pulls it in. Keep the craft pointed prograde during the descent to reduce heating on some of the more sensitive parts of the craft and to help keep it stable. It is not recommended to go off prograde until the craft has slowed down to below 1000m/s. Once below 1000m/s you should be able to turn the rapiers back on and run them at low thrust to fly the craft around a bit. Just be careful flying the craft after re-entry, it is going to be rather nose light and will pitch up a bit easier then it should. Waiting until the speed is dropped to below 400m/s is recommended.\n\nLanding: The craft is going to be a handful after burning off nearly all its fuel. It will want to pitch up most of the time but should be able to turn much tighter. Landing is best done at a very shallow descent, keeping the nose down so the landing gear can all touch fairly close to the same time. It will probably take a few tries to get it to land nicely, or you might be able to land it on your first try.\n\nDo have fun playing around with this craft and I hope you learn a few things that help you with your ssto\u0027s, and atmospheric craft in general. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAction groups:\n\n1: Rapiers turned on, LV-N\u0027s turned off\n\n2: Rapiers turned off, LV-N\u0027s turned on\n\n9: release the cargo from the docking port(in the cargo hold)\n\n10: open/close the cargo bay doors(\u0022I can\u0027t do that Dave.\u0022)\n\nDownload: [Jak-102 TopKnot](http://www./download/h3c6ds2d33wdxal/Jak-102_TopKnot.zip)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T00:35:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
