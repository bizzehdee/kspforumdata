I have not installed it and tried it yet, but maybe it will be possible coding-wise to implement the functionality of your mod in any cargo bay part - such as CTS, B9 or Lack\u0027s part packs. I have no idea how easy would that be, but it would make your mod even greater, since it will allow great versatility regarding craft uniformity. However I do think implementing it should keep the volume requirements, and calculating those for third party mods may be hard or impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it is not so stright forward. The Hangar module that brings the functionality relys on some particular objects in the part model. Namely, to function properly, it needs an empty which transform is used to position the launched vessel, the convex body which determins the position and bounds of the hangar space, and a trigger collider to sence the vessel that has flown into the hangar. If these are not provided through the config node of the module in the part definition, they\u0027re guessed from the part center and bounds. Which is so far from perfect that I was thinking to remove this guessing at all. In a \u0022good\u0022 case it will result in smaller hangar space that it appears from the part\u0027s model. In bad case the launched vessel will intersect with some of the part\u0027s colliders and both will explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words: it is quite simple to make new hangar parts. And plugging the Hangar module to existing parts will \u0022work\u0022... but I wouldn\u0027t want to look at the results =\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ringkeeper","CreatedById":88438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T16:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry for the mess with your station =( I hope you have your save backed up.\u003Cp\u003EAm I understand correctely that you stored Moths during construction in VAB?

This doesn\u0027t work as well for large hangars with a lot of small ships, but the solution for that is to cycle through ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought of that myself, but I\u0027m not sure if it is even possible using KSP API to display just the graphical model of a vessel without loading it into the game with all it\u0027s physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I preffer the \u003Cstrong\u003Ecolmo\u003C/strong\u003E idea of closing hangars befor storing. The only thing -- it\u0027ll make operation slower, considering the time needed to close the doors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the texture work: I\u0027m more a programmer than a designer, and at this period priorities go to bugfixing. But if you wish to retexture something, go ahead: all source models (I used Blender) and textures are there at GitHub.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T14:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allista\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allista\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI thought of that myself, but I\u0027m not sure if it is even possible using KSP API to display just the graphical model of a vessel without loading it into the game with all it\u0027s physics.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out the Distant Objects mod, it does exactly this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
