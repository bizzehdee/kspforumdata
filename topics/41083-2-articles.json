And SRBs? Maybe even text saying THIS END TOWARD SPACE? When we get proper re-entry heat do we need red arrows pointing HEAT SHIELD THIS WAY?\u003Cp\u003EYes I\u0027m drawing it to the extreme silly end, but consider that it\u0027ll take you longer to try and remember what way the arrow should point compared to just looking at the docking port when placing it. And the red arrow isn\u0027t the final solution, I\u0027ve read and replied to threads where people couldn\u0027t figure out why their decoupler was sticking to the engine, even if it has an arrow AND description stating exactly what the arrow does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf \u0027most people\u0027 can\u0027t figure out which way the docking port needs to go, and can\u0027t be bothered to actually look at it when placing it, then perhaps \u0027most people\u0027 should go play Hello Kitty Space Adventure II instead of KSP. If this game was to be dumbed down to the point that \u0027most people\u0027 could do it without a single error or learning along the way then it\u0027d just be a single click game where you press the \u0027go to space\u0027 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecouplers have an arrow because they have a very specific function, we don\u0027t need arrows on everything. Docking ports have an extremely clear visual indicating their function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to \u0027most people\u0027, stop being lazy and check your work while building, then test it thoroughly. It\u0027s part of the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, let me see how far I can this apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Engines and SRBs both have obvious, readily visible indications of which end is which. Specifically, big, obvious engine nozzles. Clamp-o-Trons and the Jr variation both have large, obvious shaping differences that indicate which side is which. The Clamp-o-Tron senior has small, subtle variations indicating which end is which. Someone that hadn\u0027t ever played the game before, and didn\u0027t know which end was which, might not be able to tell right now, frankly, because both sides have obvious \u0027doors\u0027, and the ring\u0027s so small it\u0027s barely noticeable unless you\u0027re looking for it specifically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) The problem is not that people \u0027can\u0027t figure out which way it\u0027s supposed to go\u0027(Noobs probably couldn\u0027t, but they\u0027d figure it out after testing it), it\u0027s that it\u0027s difficult to tell which way it actually is, due to the differences being so subtle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) I personally would prefer that \u0027most people\u0027 bought KSP, thus funding the development and ensuring that we got a finished game. As opposed to, say, Squad going bankrupt and development being stopped before completion, because everyone was playing Hello Kitty Online Adventures instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Docking ports also have a specific function. Decouplers have an arrow because you couldn\u0027t tell which way it was pointing without it. Fuel lines, on the other hand, have arrows to indicate the flow direction just to make things easier. The fuel flows from the first part they\u0027re placed on to the second, and you can determine which end was placed first because only the first end is actually selectable after the fact. The arrows are just there to make it easier to tell after placement that it\u0027s placed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Arrows don\u0027t insure you build it properly, witness people that still place decouplers the wrong way round. It just makes it easier to check that it is placed properly: You still have to check. You just don\u0027t have to zoom all the way in and squint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-05T09:38:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2013 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T09:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ereally, nobody here is wrong.\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Tiron - your argument is flawed. if people dont check the orientation now - they won\u0027t check it if there is a pretty arrow on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas stated, people still get the decoupler the wrong way round. i dont even know which way the arrow should point!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is simply a case of people not placing the part properly, if they dont check now, a huge sign pointing from it saying \u0022THIS WAY UP DUMBFACE\u0022 wouldnt change a thing. the way i do it is place it properly the first time, if i\u0027m unsure, delete it and place it properly the second time. pressing W twice if it should be inverted isnt exactly hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly the same as the docking hub - squad didnt have written on each side \u0022NOT A DOCKING PORT\u0022 people just made the mistake once, and never again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eequally the probe bodies models arent labeled with \u0022DONT FORGET A BATTERY\u0022 and the solar panels arent labeled with \u0022ONLY GENERATES POWER WHEN DEPLOYED\u0022. while the landing legs arent labeled with a directional arrow dispite the fact it isn\u0027t clear which way up they go before you first see the animation/deployment. there are certain things you have to learn in any game, like if reloading a half spent magazine loses the remaining rounds, or if fall damage or friendly fire is a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESUMMARY:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, an arrow would more clearly indicate the required orientation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, people wouldnt be more likely to check it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a precedent of squad not labeling things that arent imediately obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall that said, mod an arrow onto your version if you feel it would help you, and feel free to distribute it to others if you feel it would help them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPERSONALLY:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the aesthetics the way they are, I like the KW decouplers because they arent covered in arrows and stripes.
