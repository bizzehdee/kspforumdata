The idea of dynamically changing the fuel is built straight into the engine; the only thing that is missing is the GUI. If we are direly in need of a toroidal xenon tank, what about adding in a whole set of xenon tanks that would, potentially, give a most insane deltav.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that WAS bloody planned... and it is simple enough for them to add.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T08:45:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T09:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake a diffrent version with XE but colour it the same foil colour as the inline XE tank and keep the ROUND-8.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T09:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think my post in the devnotes thread covers my opinion adequately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, am on mobile right now so no linking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvert the Oscar instead.
