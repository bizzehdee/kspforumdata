I love Kerbal Space Program and I applaud the hard work everyone over at Squad has done to make this game possible, but the current career mode and science implementations are poor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Science experiments need to be more involved and fun. Perfect examples are the impactor experiment from KSP Interstellar and setting up orbital research experiments that must be returned to Kerbin in Station Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Science should not be a currency to be spent, but a level of how technologically progressed your space program is. Also when parts are unlocked should not be determined by how large or expensive the parts are, but based on what technologies you have researched (the most powerful single-nozzle LF engine, the Rocketdyne F-1, was not invented in recent years but in the 1950s!); if I want to build large rockets early on and I have the basic technologies unlocked and required funds, I should be able to build it. I would have liked science to work as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. For every experiment you conduct, you gain Science XP. Once you gain enough Science XP, you gain a Science Level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. The individual tech tree nodes do not all directly unlock parts, but are technology concepts that can be unlocked through funded research (but may have pre-requisite unlocks and minimum Science Level) that may or may not have parts unlocked through them. Examples (basic brainstorming): Liquid Fuel Science (unlocks all Liquid Fuel Engines and Tanks of all sizes, but with initially reduced efficiency), Liquid Fuel Efficiency (requires Liquid Fuel Science and a science level of 10, allows LF engines to have slightly better Isp; this could have multiple levels of unlocks), Lighter Metal Alloys (requires a science level of 5, the dry mass of your fuel tanks is lower).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Any effiency upgrades above would be toggleable in the VAB. This would allow you to keep your saved spacecrafts/launchers exactly the same. Upgrading would be as simple as loading the spacecraft, individually upgrading the parts through tweakables, or have an upgrade all button. Obviously the upgrades would not effect pre-existing spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Limit how quickly science can be gained. It\u0027s ridiculous that you can currently unlock the entire tech tree before a Duna/Eve launch window occurs and without ever leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Current career mode does not feel like I\u0027m actually running a Space Program. The player should dictate the direction of the Space Program, not contracts. The player should be able to select and plan main mission objectives: focus on probe exploration of the solar system, setting up a Kerbin space station that would unlock further objectives once completed, setting up a communications satellite constellation, manned exploration of the Mun/Minmus, etc. Keep the random survey/satellite contracts for the companies as a way to make extra funds on the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Most of your funds should come from a budget that increases/decreases based on your reputation. Very low reputation would cause you to lose funds (maintenance costs of running the program are more than what you gain). To prevent the player from just time-warping for long periods of time to \u0022cheat\u0022 in funds, have gradual reputation losses over time. These gradual losses would easily be offset by completing mission objectives and contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T17:48:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T03:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhm - thread asplode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd all the confirmed things from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115866-Squadcast-Summary-for-2015-04-18-Picture-Perfect-Edition%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Squadcast\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T03:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E#Fixthefairings\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T05:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust so I know, have they ever mentioned fixing parachute clipping? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only mention this because I heard them mention 2 or 3 times recently that they fixed a clipping problem with the flag plant animation, like clipping is a terrible thing (and it is pretty ugly) and that that example was unbearable/had to be fixed, yet I have never hear a peep about the worst, thus far untouched clipping issue in the game: radial parachutes.
