Also known as the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSea Duck\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, this twin-tail aircraft was flown by Baloo in the 90\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s animated show Tale Spin and entered the record books as the first plane ever to be flown by a Bear.\n\n[**DOWNLOAD**](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/SPH/Conwing-L-16/Conwing%20L-16%20Mk%20I.craft)\n\n*You might need to right-click that link and use \u0027Save As\u0027 or similar.*\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nSubject to change.\n\n**Tonnage:** 14.31t dry\n\n**Parts:** 155\n\n**Kerbin TWR:** 1.70\n\n**Delta V (Recommended Fuel):** 68,618 m/s\n\n**Delta V (Max Fuel):** 117,135 m/s\n\n**Flight ceiling:** 12,900m approx\n\n**Maximum water landing speed:** 50m/s\n\nCONTROLS\n\n**[6]** Toggle Internal lights\n\n**[7]** Toggle External lights\n\n**[8]** Toggle Ladders\n\nNOTES\n\n**FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS:** The aircraft has a slight tendency to roll right when pulling up. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not so difficult to correct and SAS will help.\n\n**FUEL LOAD:** A lighter plane is easier to fly! Your new plane will be fueled with its recommended load. See diagram below for details.\n\n**TAKEOFF FROM GROUND OR WATER:** Start the engines and pull back on the stick immediately to get airborne as quickly as possible.\n\n**GROUND TAKEOFF:** Too much time on the ground at full-throttle can lead to front wheel wobble. Aim to get airborne as quickly as possible. Engaging SAS before starting your takeoff run is recommended but not required.\n\n**WATER LANDING:** Landing speed should be no more than 50m/s. Approach water on a shallow glide slope with engines at idle / off. Easy enough with recommended fuel amount, not so easy with maximum fuel load.\n\n**LADDER INGRESS:** Climb to the top of the yellow Telus Mobility Enhancer. At the top, quickly let go and re-grab. You should automatically grab the horizontal wing mounted ladder and from there you can walk to the cockpit hatch. Ensure ladders are fully retracted before flight.\n\n![Conwing-L-16-Schematic.jpg](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/SPH/Conwing-L-16/Conwing-L-16-Schematic.jpg)\n\n![Conwing-L-16-Shot.jpg](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/SPH/Conwing-L-16/Conwing-L-16-Shot.jpg)\n\nThanks for looking!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T00:30:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by whoshotdk**\n  \nAdded a couple extra PB-NUKs to the craft so it doesn\u0027t run out of power when the tanks run dry."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T23:57:47Z","Content":"Dude you rule!\n\nOhh-ee-ay!"},{"CreatedByName":"whoshotdk","CreatedById":115018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T00:02:41Z","Content":"Thanks!\n\nOhh-ee-ohh ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T15:31:51Z","Content":"Very nice!
