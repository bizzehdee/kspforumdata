Some of our defenses however are tuned specifically to Earth-life, and would do nothing to alien life: something like the membrane attack complement system may or may not work depending on the alien membrane composition \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_membrane_attack_complex\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_membrane_attack_complex\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0cell wall presence, etc. Likewise, alien pathogens would have evolved to get around alien defenses, and would likely be of no use against our immune systems. If they can\u0027t really make good use of the organic molecules in our bodies, they will be at a further disadvantage when \u0022trying\u0022 to infect us. Some of our defenses like acidic compartments after macrophages engulf foreign microbes should work even if the alien microbe has different biomolecules (acid is acid, and will cause chemical reactions in lots of compounds). I\u0027m assuming we wouldn\u0027t be walking around in acidic environments. Earth has some bacteria that can tolerate very high acidity, and are adapted to it, but they aren\u0027t pathogenic because they aren\u0027t adapted to the ambient environment of our bodies and cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlien viruses infecting our cells would be a non-starter, they can\u0027t hijack our cellular translation machinery if they have never encountered it, and use different genetic molecules/a different genetic code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I actually thing the risk of infection is overstated... however, our bacteria and their bacteria would immediately \u0022go to war\u0022. Their bacteria would be adapted to the conditions on that planet, and would seem to have an advantage... but time and time again we see on Earth that an introduced species becomes invasive because nothing has evolved to counter it. We also see cases where introduced species simply cannot compete with the native life in the native conditions. Its likely a binary outcome... either our biosphere wins out, or theirs does. If the bottom falls out of our biosphere, our food production will fail, and the colony will fail. I do not see 2 very different biospheres coexisting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it seems their biosphere wins at the microbial level: It might be possible to wipe out native macroscopic life, and adapt our plants to coexist with their microbes, but we may also need to adapt, as our intestinal flora may need to be changed for native flora. Their microbes should rapidly adapt (years? decades? centuries?) to make use of our biosphere\u0027s organic molecules as nutrient sources. I can imagine them fairly rapidly forming symbiotic associations with plants and our guts following that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, our microbes win out. If we\u0027re careful what we bring, if we can introduce our bacteria and archea without any phages, then the base of our biosphere may have an advantage. There will surely be native viruses that will harm native life but not our own. Right now phages are an enormous selection pressure on our microbes. If native life has its replication rate checked by viruses, and our microbes don\u0027t, if they are more or less equally adapted to the environment, ours might win out if we can avoid introducing our biosphere\u0027s viruses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I suppose if you want to terraform, and don\u0027t have a moral objection to wiping out the native life, you start by introducing large amounts of diverse (and thoroughly screened) kinds of our microbes to the planet, and see if they take hold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they do, then you just wait for the biosphere replacement.
