Of course thats working off of my memory so I may have the numbers mixed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the booster problem goes, as cfds mentioned stage:liquidfuel works on all the liquid fuel in the current stage, so yeah it\u0027ll wait until its all gone meaning after the boosters and main stage are empty. What you have to do is put your boosters and main stage on separate stages, then in kos stage to activate the boosters (no throttle) grab the amount of fuel and set a variable with it, wait 1 second, stage grab that fuel and set another variable. So now you can subtract and basically if stage:liquid fuel \u0026lt; (totalfuel - booster fuel) stage.

When you stage (to activate the boosters) grab the amount of fuel and store it in a variable, then stage again (main engine(s) and boosters activated) and grab it with a different variable. Then after that you can set throttle to 1 or whatever you\u0027re using to get off the launcher and release the clamps (or release the clamps then throttle to 1, as long as it happens fast enough to get moving forward. The key part is to throttle up after activating the boosters and main engine separately.

For now I just removed RT2 as I tested it about as far as I could at the time. If the comm network in KSP is really basic I hope JDP and Cilph (and whoever else was working on it) continue working on RT2, with the ability to communicate with kOS. I can imagine setting up an orbit/landing program in kOS and setting up RT2 to run the programs once it gets to where it should be triggered(maybe a delay that says run this program in so many days, hours mins..it wouldnt really work to run the program and have the program commands on delay), just as it would in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-04T22:30:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2013 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bizz Keryear","CreatedById":68896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T23:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECool.

WHen I use heading 90 by 90 from launch, the rocket rolls so that north faces the left of the nav ball. From where I can use heading on other angles without a problem. How ever if I start with any of the other steering methods, or no steering method then use heading it gets really unstable until it finally gets to the designated steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit: Did someone else recognized that \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eprint at\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E now works with variables?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Do you mean like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eset position to \u0022(0,0)\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003Eprint \u0022Hello World!\u0022 at position.\u003Cbr\u003E//or\u003Cbr\u003Eset spX to 0.\u003Cbr\u003Eset spY to 0.\u003Cbr\u003Eprint \u0022Hello World!\u0022 at (spx,spy).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-05T02:49:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2013 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
