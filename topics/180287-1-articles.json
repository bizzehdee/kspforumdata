Combined with the DLC, I spent around $50.\u00A0 With 890 hours listed on my Steam account plus all the time spent on my planet pack copies that Steam does not record, I am well over 1000.\u00A0 That works out to one dollar per 20 hours of play...not a bad deal.\u00A0 So, I\u0027d gladly put up money again for a new version, especially if that new version incorporated newer graphics and some new content.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know what the challenges would be for making sure craft and missions built in the old version would be transferable, but hopefully that could be overcome.\u00A0 I would not want it altered out of recognition, but rather given a facelift with a few features that really belong in stock (propellers, easier refueling on the ground--and I\u0027d love to see a scenario in career where you can unlock new launchpads and airfields around Kerbin as you progress--but that is for another discussion) and a modern architecture that will ensure its continued existence for years to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think that would also make sense financially.\u00A0 Right now, Squad makes no money off of most of its player base; they only make money selling new copies.\u00A0 So why not put all that effort they do into updates into creating something new they can get a financial return on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, just some thoughts.

KSP is clearly bumping into the edges of the engine\u0027s capabilities as well as suffering from a somewhat crusty codebase. This manifests as seemingly-irresolvable issues like\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nthe memory leak that makes the game increasingly stuttery the longer it\u0027s run and the more scene switches there are\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmassive performance problems in certain circumstances that could be optimised away by tweaking physics (e.g. bases with multiple craft standing on a surface)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nsurface interactions -- wheels and legs still not working quite like they\u0027re supposed to, with bouncing, oscillation, and drift when craft are supposed to be staying put\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe kraken rearing its tentacles in all kinds of circumstances\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlong load times\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s a lot of stuff that\u0027s really well done in KSP also, notably with the data model -- the .craft files, the way it\u0027s super moddable, the general modularity and so on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI for one would certainly buy it all over again if it was ported to a more powerful engine that put to bed at least some of these issues, and gave us something that looks better and performs better to boot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, it would wipe out the mod scene in a single fell swoop. I don\u0027t know how much of it would be willing to learn the ins and outs of the new engine and new codebase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would also be a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emassive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0undertaking. No doubt parts of the codebase could be ported over, but a lot of it would have to be written from scratch. And then there is the matter of the game engine -- which ones out there do the kind of physics modelling KSP needs? Is it economically feasible to use them? It\u0027s not an easy thing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder these circumstances I\u0027m ... pessimistic. I think KSP is what it is, it\u0027ll be maintained a while longer while it pushes against its fundamental limitations, but what we\u0027re seeing now is more or less what we\u0027ll be getting until one day it fades into the pantheon of classic games with a devoted fanbase that continue to be played, even if they are no longer officially maintained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-04T12:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d wager KSP\u0027s acquisition (Not Squad)\u00A0by Take Two pretty much guarantees a KSP sequel.\u00A0 It may even\u00A0currently be in development by another team.\u00A0 Surely Take Two wouldn\u0027t have made the acquisition just for the long tail of KSP1.\u00A0 No matter how some might disagree with whether it needs to happen or not, this is a part of the industry.\u00A0 Successful games get sequels.\u00A0 The current code base must be a mess at this point.\u00A0 For KSP2, the development team actually has an idea of the sort of game they\u0027re going to make, and what parts need to be in place from the beginning.\u00A0 They could even have things known as development road maps and art bibles.\u00A0 Something Squad claims to have, yet certain evidence can point to the contrary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-04T12:24:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2018 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by klgraham1013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadLeo","CreatedById":107972,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-04T16:38:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe KSP has a marketing potential that we are still to witness the full unleash.
