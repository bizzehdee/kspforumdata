favorite, single player game, ever, by far at this point.\u00A0 I am rather biased to start with, as I am obsessed with space in general.\u00A0 I have been watching ksp develop for the last 4 years waiting for a polished product, in order to have the best first experience with game as possible.\u00A0 lol anyway\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 I have been advised to think of ways to improve the game that mods have not already accomplished.\u00A0 \u00A0 A few mods have touched on this subject but not enough.\u00A0 Perhaps there are not enough tool currently for them to work with?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I would love to see the Kerbals in game have more influence on adventures, and conquests than they currently do.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Currently after you acquire enough science to get the\u00A0AI pilot, the usefulness of all the Kerbin seem nearly meaningless.\u00A0 \u00A0You need a pilot for back up in case you forget to deploy fairings or suddenly fall out of range of comm network.\u00A0 \u00A0Engineers repack shoots and open solar panels when you make a mistake.\u00A0 Scientist are needed to reset science experiments if you need while on the go.\u00A0 However this aspect is only really necessary if you try to make it hard on yourself in science, either by mod or by career settings.\u00A0 Also they are needed to make the science modules work, which are extreamly op and only really needed if you have a modded game or have made science hard in game settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I would love to see more things for the Kerbals to do, and a more meaningful leveling experience for all of the Kerbals.\u00A0 \u00A0I also want to feel something for a Kerbin, after I take the time to level he or she up.\u00A0 I want to feel bad if i lose someone.\u00A0 I currently only feel bad if i lose Jebidiah or Valentina ... lol\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0 For example, perhaps\u00A0the following could be entertaining if worked into the game.\u00A0 \u00A0Perhaps add RNG into the game, say in the form of malfunctions,\u00A0 which are abundant in real life rocket science.\u00A0 Simple designs with few parts would have little chance of malfunctioning.\u00A0 \u00A0Larger craft with 50\u002B parts would need an experienced engineer on board\u00A0 in order to get ahead of, or fix any potential problems that may arise.\u00A0 \u00A0 Perhaps a good pilot could give you 5% more agility with any craft that hes in.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0There has to be thousands of good ideas out there on how to improve upon the Kerbals\u00A0interactions with the Kerbal Space Program.\u00A0 \u00A0 I would love to hear others thoughts and ideas on this, and see if something meaningful could be achieved.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited

Im not as much a fan of making Mech-Jeb \u0022land at target\u0022 or \u0022execute rendezvous\u0022 stock because I think it takes away too much of what players should really be learning to do well, but some of the more basic functions not only are nice to have but act as tools for players becoming better pilots themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor engineers I do agree the best thing is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Hooking up fuel lines field-strutting would be great to start, and giving the option to add parts to existing craft both solves the \u0022Oh shoot I forgot x!\u0022 problem and could provide some fun contract possibilities. It might also be nice to let engineers edit control groups, make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E wheel and landing leg adjustments, etc. You could also give some functions like display drag, delta-V, maintain \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E by pumping fuel around, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe easiest perks for scientists seem to me boosts to sample values and MPL payouts, but the mobile lab is already kind of \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
