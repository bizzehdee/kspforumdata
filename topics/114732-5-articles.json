Given it\u2019s roughly 13km radius, I expected it to take virtually no time to get around. However, I\u2019ve also not land on Gilly, so turns out I was in for quite a surprise.\n\nThe Gilly encounter was relatively uneventful, except that it was in slow motion. This should have been the crew\u2019s first clue, but they forged ahead. The landing was pretty easy, but when Julella stepped out for EVA, things began to go awry. At some point during the rover release sequence, Obemy made contact with one of the wheels and nearly went into orbit. Fortunately (after striking the ground again) he regained his senses and was able to jetpack back to the rover, which was sliding downhill...\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/tZtq9/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe darn drive...The short story is that I knew Gilly had a low gravity, but I failed to realize just how important a \u201Cdown-thrust\u201D system really is here. The drive had to be completed at a slow pace (on the order of 1.5m/s) to keep the rover on the ground. The direction of travel ended up being a polar route, and was pretty much dictated by the direction of slide after I released the rover from the Tin Poppy. After nearly an hour of game time, the crew was only about 5km from the landing site. Ultimately, the drive on Gilly took nearly as long as the Moho drive.\n\nThe terrain is okay and there are some neat shots of Eve and the Sun. But what should have been a quick trip was an agonizing test of patience. It was like watching a car chase scene in slow motion. If you want to do Gilly, I recommend taking some cleats with you. I normally add a map with the route on it, but quite frankly I couldn\u0027t tell on the map where I had landed. The map surface is rather nondescript."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T13:43:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Claw said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The terrain is okay and there are some neat shots of Eve and the Sun.

So Julella sets off northwest bound to head out of the water-ringed landing site. Not long after setting out, the crew hits the first stumbling block. The rover seems incapable of climbing up even a moderate hill. Obemy made several continuous adjustments to both the traction control and the friction control to very little effect. The rover had to take huge zig-zags up the low-grade slope to make any progress (the yellow arrow). In all the adjustments, I was even able to get the motor limiter to overdrive at 170 percent (I somehow glitched it out), and that still wasn\u2019t strong enough to get going uphill.\u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E \u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EIt took a good while of fiddling with things to actually figure out what was going on and, in the end, it was actually that the rover ran completely out of electrical power. This was the first time I\u2019ve run into the issue at all, and it\u2019s primarily due to the changes in 1.0. Before the wheel update, the rover would not ever run out of power. In fact, it could lose two RTGs and would still have enough electrical production to keep going with almost no impact. But after the wheel update, I had noticed that the RTGs didn\u2019t quite keep up with the demands anymore. For the most part, it wasn\u2019t a problem because the rover would do quite well at coasting. However, on Eve, the gravity was forcing a heavy drain when the motors were pushing. The rover wasn\u2019t really capable of coasting, so the motors had to run nearly all the time.\u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iHjtXg3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iHjtXg3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E \u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EAfter figuring all this out, Obemy deactivated the rear axle and set the front motor limiters to 85%. At that rate, the rover drew about the same amount of power it produced while under \u201Cnormal\u201D driving. Later, the front limiters were lowered a bit more to 75% to allow for some recharge capacity. During uphill climbs, the wheels would sometimes bog down and draw higher than usual EC to keep up. Obemy also kept up the rear-wheel drive panel to toggle the rear wheels on/off as required to climb up steeper hills. Ultimately the 75% limit meant the rover was running a bit slower top speed, but the crew had nearly eliminated the power issues.\u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E \u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EAlso, it turns out the wheels don\u2019t like more than about 2x warp on Eve, even when standing still. (At least not in this configuration.) So the Eve drive might take a bit longer than originally anticipated, but the mission is still a go. The crew forges on, and continues up out of the landing site. They finally settle into a rhythm and set the rover on cruise control. After a bit, Julella apparently falls asleep at the wheel and the crew finds themselves wedged into the shallow end of the ocean shore (meant to be the red arrow, but was actually quite a bit further on).\u003C/font\u003E\n\n![W2vB0HH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W2vB0HH.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E \u003C/font\u003E\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Times New Roman\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EThis ended up being a huge problem, because it turns out the kerbals don\u2019t have enough swim power to push things in Eve\u2019s ocean. So try as he might, Obemy just couldn\u2019t get the rover to move pushing it from behind. In his desperation, he sacrificed himself by doing what all the scientists had told him not to do. (Good thing Marissa isn\u2019t here.) He\u2019d been warned of the dangers of letting Kerbals and the antimatter core of the wheels come into contact.

Not to risk a second encounter, this time he climbed on the hood of the rover and weighed down the front axle.
