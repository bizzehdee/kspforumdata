After that I would like to see how to place a few structures on the Mun. My problem is two fold:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Putting a fuel station in Mun orbit - which I have never tried even with MechJeb - may not have enough fuel to be worth it. If that seems unlikely I will need to find ways to land fuel tanks onto the Mun itself. Which brings me to the next problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Refueling with stock parts seems to have many problems. The big one seems to be that while you can test dock a F-Rover (my name of a Fueling Rover) to a lander on the launching pad doing so while on the Mun is another issue. Mun gravity seems to mess it up somehow and the two parts have a problem meeting. I have seen this problem solved by using RCS or playing with aircraft landing gear. Has anybody found a non-mod way to easily refuel while on the Mun? I was thinking of maybe having a Jr. Docking Clamp on the sides of the tankers, maybe attached to landing gear, to lower down onto the top of a F-Rover but that seems to be asking for trouble. And I wish to keep the part count down. Also the F-Rovers would also need to fuel visiting landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET-Rovers (Transport Rovers) would run on juice and be just for moving the Mun Base crew around so that isn\u0027t a problem. Just slap on a few solar panels or some reactors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions? Or is this just an engineering issue that everybody deals with in their own way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - MechJeb II is turning out to be very easy to use and I think a twice as smart as the last one. Docking can still be a problem sometimes but it handles it well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Mod-Free station - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-w5gXKoW5Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyromaniacal","CreatedById":57241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T15:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaying stock, I can\u0027t think of an easy, effective way to refuel ships from a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar station. If you wanted to remain stock, I would recommend using an orbiting fuel station around Kerbin, as this would be the easiest place to rendezvous with after launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot using stock, one of the easiest ways to transfer fuel would be using the Kerbal Attachment System, or KAS.

If you wanted to use a different system that has no connections whatsoever and just kinda \u0022beams\u0022 the fuel to another craft, you could use the Lazor System.

This includes several different useful things including docking cameras, resource transfer, guided flight, interplanetary transfer systems, and various weapons.

The magnetic pull that pulls the ports together is strong enough to appear really powerful when you\u0027re drifting in space, but in space everything looks powerful (i.e. you can maneuver around with a really low TWR once you\u0027re up in space). In actuality the magnetic dock pull is actually quite weak and is not strong enough to counter gravity, even minor gravity like on the Mun. Therefore you end up having to manually get ALL the alignment right yourself, AND have everything at the right height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have your rover, say, 2 degrees off angle from your base, the docking ports won\u0027t work. In space they would work like that but on a surface they\u0027d have to pull the rover sideways against its wheels to pull it into alignment and they\u0027re not strong enough to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you can test on Kerbin and it works and it still fails on the Mun is that gravity pulls on suspension differently when it\u0027s weaker, and this causes the craft to rest at a different height on the Mun than it does on Kerbin. Sometimes i\u0027ve been able to raise or lower the rover\u0027s docking ring by simply having a bit of RCS on it and using that to lift the nose of the rover up or down a bit until it grabs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
