Now, I\u0027ve settled on a working design and I\u0027m aiming for Kerbin circumnavigation. The thing is, I\u0027m obviously getting different fuel efficiencies at different altitudes, if efficiency is measured as fuel used over surface distance traveled. Well, duh! Drag, surface speed, thrust and lift profiles, all of that stuff matters for making my plane fly the farthest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to ask the Lindkerbs around here what they think of my flight SOP. What I\u0027ll do is get up to my maximum safe altitude as fast as possible, then use turbojets on low(ish) power and trim to a pitch that maintains airspeed and altitude. My thinking is that there\u0027s minimal drag up there, so I can get up to higher speeds using less power. However, there\u0027s also minimal lift, so I have to spend more downward thrust to maintain altitude. There\u0027s also engine intake and ISP to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no feel for the tradeoffs between high- and low-altitude flight in relation to fuel efficiency. Anyone care to straighten me up so I can fly right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T15:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you get up high enough you can be making about 2 km/s (depending on how big your plane is, if you\u0027re intake spamming, etc) with the throttle as low as you are physically capable of setting it. As opposed to flying along at the surface where you can make about 200 m/s with the throttle all the way up. So yeah, you\u0027re doing it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to consider: B9 engines actually have an atmospheric pressure curve in addition to their speed curve, so if you\u0027re using that mod pack you can leave the throttles all the way up and watch as your thrust drops off at higher altitudes, taking your fuel consumption with it. If you\u0027re using the stock turbojet the way you get more efficient is by throttling down as your intake air decreases, which it sounds like you\u0027ve got the hang of. If you\u0027re crazy nose-high to maintain level flight, try adding some more wing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
