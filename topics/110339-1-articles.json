Laythe has more similarities to Saturn\u0027s moon Titan (at least: surface liquid, significant atmosphere).\n\nSaturn\u0027s radiation belts are not so strong.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Magnetosphere)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 0.2 gauss (20 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5T) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth\u0027s magnetic field. As a result Saturn\u0027s magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter\u0027s\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Saturn#Radiation_belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Saturn#Radiation_belts)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Saturn has relatively weak radiation belts, because energetic particles are absorbed by the moons and particulate material orbiting the planet.[45] The densest (main) radiation belt lies between the inner edge of the Enceladus gas torus at 3.5 Rs and the outer edge of the A Ring at 2.3 Rs.\n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E The saturnian radiation belts are generally much weaker than those of Jupiter and do not emit much microwave radiation (with frequency of a few Gigahertz). Estimates shows that their decimetric radio emissions (DIM) would be impossible to detect from the Earth.[48] Nevertherless the high energy particles cause weathering of the surfaces of the icy moons and sputter water, water products and oxygen from them.\n\nWe know nothing about Jool\u0027s magnetosphere. Maybe space around it isn\u0027t so much worse than the space around Kerbin (which is closer to the sun, where the solar wind is more intense)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T09:50:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:45:08Z","Content":"So I take it that you don\u0027t like the nuclear powered asparagus staged Tylo lander that I used in my Jool-5 mission?\n\n![5Y1rRSk.png](http://i.imgur.com/5Y1rRSk.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:50:51Z","Content":"I only feel guilty when I make a bomber in the SPH and load it with a NERVA..."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:54:53Z","Content":"Guilty?
