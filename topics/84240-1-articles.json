And yes, with enough delta-v, you could go anywhere anytime - but longer burn times will also mean they will be innacurate unless you use a ship with an insane TWR.

Delta-v is not constant time wise, meaning that you could spend 1000 m/s of delta-v in 10 minutes or 10 seconds depending on how powerful your engine is. So in theory you could fit a very weak engine and burn it at minimal throttle the whole way (turning around at the half way point) but it would be far less practical and no faster then just using a proper engine and burning for a few minutes in Kerbin orbit at a much higher thrust, coasting, and then braking at Duna or whatever planet you are flying to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are trying to get to another planet \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E then burning the whole way is still not practical in KSP - any practical burn will easily be done while still inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Burning a realistic engine longer then that would fall over into the realm of using cheats or exploits to gain infinite fuel or abuse massless parts and at that point it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E more practical to use those cheats or exploits to make a burn inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI and then coast for the few seconds it takes to reach your destination. This does not even get into the fact that you\u0027ll likely break the game (Kraken) because of how the floating point numbers work (if you move too fast the numerical precision isn\u0027t high enough to keep up accurately)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing your question comes from several futurist plans where a nuclear powered probe would fly to another star by accelerating to a significant margin of the speed of light in the first half and braking on the second half of the journey. This does not apply to visiting other planets in KSP, the distances are just so small (and you are still heavily influenced by the gravity of the sun) and the attributes of the engines aren\u0027t right for that kind of journey to have any benefit over a \u0027normal\u0027 transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECould just go any time and not worry about launch windows\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is easier to answer. Yes you can go at any time (though in a few isolated cases it may be a shorter trip to wait a short while because a planet is blocking the ideal path and a trajectory around it would take longer then just waiting for the path to clear). The only consequence of going at a different time is the delta-v cost. In fact even leaving at the same time you have a choice in how much delta-v you might trade off to reach your destination faster. You can explore this by looking at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elaunch window planner\u003C/a\u003E. Once you enter a destination and click Plot It you\u0027ll get a colored graph showing from lowest cost (blue) to highest (red) departure times and desired travel times. If you move your mouse over the graph you will see how much delta-v that departure time will cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T02:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could see this being a real possibility ... but not with the KSP engine or anything near stock.
