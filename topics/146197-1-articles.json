So what i have here is a version 2 of my comm sats version ones worked fine but they were half the size they used all .625 parts and now im working with 1.25 m parts here i have some more batteries a bigger antenna and a different probe core. So really the only thing thats the same is the base of the rocket. the part that lifts the probe into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is now whenever i try to launch this it does this nice tumble and flies nicely out of control.
