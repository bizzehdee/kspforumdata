I got the idea from one of the pictures in the post your station thread. I had it all docked up perfectly and went to bring a spaceplane full of kerbals up to it. However, upon arrival I found that 2 of the ports had come undone. So i fixed it (and redocked, again extremely difficult). Then I went back to the space center and when I returned the same two docking ports had come undone so I re docked... again. It now appears that every time I return it is always un-docked again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhats going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe annoyance factor is compounded by the fact that my computer runs this at something like 2 frames per second. Its 417 parts and I start chugging at around 200. Could that cause random un-docking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize for not using image code, but for some reason every time I do its just white space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I built it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bqcnwcm0t10znh1/screenshot98.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bqcnwcm0t10znh1/screenshot98.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1xoy2xy1i6wvv5/screenshot101.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o1xoy2xy1i6wvv5/screenshot101.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere it keeps breaking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1nonyd3yi8ip3gu/screenshot103.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1nonyd3yi8ip3gu/screenshot103.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because I like my space plane ferry here is a picture of that (not really important to the thread):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4dt4vvlj2jz5h7a/screenshot49.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4dt4vvlj2jz5h7a/screenshot49.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T22:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the looks of things, its tight enough that it shouldn\u0027t get completely wocker-jawed that far without some degree of torque on the parts somewhere. Fixing the excess torque issues would probably require a re-design, but basically having SAS on causes torque, as does having command modules (at either end especially). SAS will continually over-correct for the slightest bit of station movement, and the gyros in the command pods will merrily help it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I saw someones cylinder station yesterday also and became very inspired myself. My design is a bit bigger though, but my issues involve part count and trying to de-couple the launch vehicle from the thing without tearing it apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lattice work, all the struts, and the bottom engine matrix and webwork are all supposed to come off.
