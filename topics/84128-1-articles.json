I wrote all about it a couple of days ago\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and also warned that you can expect a bunch of breathless and fact-free YouTube videos about it, claiming it would hit us.

That claim is really really really really really wrong. Really. The author of this article, Nathan Rao, has a history of writing reality-impaired articles; for example, in August he wrote a piece suggesting the Supermoon might kill everyone on Earth. This led to a less-than-satisfying exchange of tweets between Rao and me (and many others), with him trying to defend his writing, and ended with me telling him, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhatever helps you sleep at night.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T17:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you don\u0027t have a source that\u0027s not the express, I\u0027m going to say it\u0027s probably based on a misunderstanding of something.

So just because we haven\u0027t had a major impact in 30M years, doesn\u0027t mean that we\u0027ve got it coming to us now (or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEDIT: However, off the hand, we may or may not know the probability of a major impact in a hundred-year timeframe. The point is, that just because it didn\u0027t happen for a while, doesn\u0027t mean that the probability has changed. The next paragraph deals with estimating this probability.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose, on the other hand, that we don\u0027t know whether the coin is biased or not. In that case after 100 heads in a row, I\u0027d bet precisely 100:1 that the next outcome will also be heads (as you said, by a huge margin of confidence, the coin is biased). Similar logic follows: we haven\u0027t had a major impact in over 300\u0027000 centuries. I\u0027d bet 300\u0027000:1, that we won\u0027t have a major impact in the coming century.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, to speak with any real authority on the coin problem we have to first set our prior probabilities of the coin being biased or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T12:34:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 12:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LLlAMnYP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T12:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe the 100 heads streak falsifies even our understanding of probabilities \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFace it: if your theory isn\u0027t falsifiable, it\u0027s not scientific.
