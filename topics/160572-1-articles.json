A windows bug which caused the Pc to shut down and restart - may be nothing to do with\u00A0KSP, then after playing for two days whilst in game the buttons for options from the crew (cre report etc) stopped working and , finally at the same time the add manoeuvre button stopped working. But after loading the save, they worked ok again.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EPlaying the previous version had no issues apart from the admin bug.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeith\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T11:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, no idea at all; but I also doubt anybody may identify what caused the issue from only the information provided in the opening post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s start with one thing: sometimes we find what can be called \u0022intermittent bugs\u0022, weirdnesses we are unable to identify the cause and, trying to reproduce in the same situation, don\u0027t show every time (or even never again). There is no chance to diagnose bugs unless reproducible, so these intermittent ones are very hard to squash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above brings to consider one of the most important pillars with testing: reproducibility. Who has to examine the issue has to know the correct situation to make the bug appear. Among KSP testers, the consolidated procedure to report an issue is to provide a detailed explanation of the situation, possibly a savegame that leads to the appearance of the issue, KSP settings if appropriate to the issue, a detailed list of steps to perform to arrive at the bug, criteria to identify the bug occurrence (e.g. what is expected against what is produced by KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother pillar with testing is appropriate documentation of the issue, e.g.: showing pictures (or even better, videos) while the bug is occurring; making tests of your own and providing results showing when the bug shows or not; if appropriate, external references providing evidence about the expected results. Plus of course the KSP logs as proper: often times logs provide information about KSP workings, showing if something went wrong (e.g. the various exceptions being logged with output_log.txt). Plus, mandatory information about the KSP version installed and the OS used (sometimes corroborated by further details, e.g. GPU brand, screen resolution, input devices used...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal and very important pillar: no add-ons if trying to isolate a stock KSP bug. Actually, even better to run a virgin KSP install and try if the bug shows on a brand new game, rather than one you may have running (and could somehow have been corrupted).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the above is described in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eguidelines for stock support \u0026amp; bug reporting\u003C/a\u003E. Should your bug be reproducible on your side, best you could do is to actually use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eofficial bugtracker\u003C/a\u003E and fill all available information as suggested above. This forum section may give you help about fixing what may be wrong with your game or KSP install; but won\u0027t solve any real KSP bug: those have to be reported with the bugtracker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverwood","CreatedById":177391,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T14:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk thanks. I am not intending to be a tester for the beta, I have only had the game a week, I installed it to stop the other bug. I have tried the same save and neither issue has happened - so perhaps it was something else. However if it happens again, I will follow your suggestion on reporting, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only post the issue in case anyone else had a similar issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
