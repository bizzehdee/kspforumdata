(One of my proudest achievements in version 0.25 was the Wayfarer Program--a small ion-drive science satellite in orbit around EVERY celestial body in the game.)\n\nThat being said, the very fact that repeatedly clicking the big red X on the list of available contracts is *possible*, let alone advantageous, is a big problem. In the current system, the player can (eventually) get any contract desired, but the *interface* makes it tedious to do so.\n\nIf we are \u0022supposed to\u0022 be able to get any contract we want, then the interface ought to include, for instance, a \u0022reject all these contracts and bring up a whole new list\u0022 button, or a \u0022search for (i.e. generate) specific types of contracts\u0022 button, or a \u0022give me only these types of contracts from now on\u0022 button.\n\nIf we are \u0022supposed to\u0022 have access only to the contracts the RNG decides to give us, then there should be some sort of penalty for rejecting contracts, or an incentive for taking contracts unlike the ones we\u0027ve already done.\n\nIDEA #1: Instead of new contracts being generated when the player rejects (or completes) an existing one, new contracts are generated at semi-regular intervals as time passes. Old contracts that have not been accepted remain in the queue of available contracts, and after a while maybe some of them disappear (the deadline expired, or a hypothetical rival space agency did the job)... OR maybe the reward increases (the customer gets desperate and makes a better offer). Contracts that have been waiting for a long time pay more (maybe), so there is incentive to pick up old contracts that you\u0027ve been dodging for a while, but there\u0027s also a possibility that the customer will give up, so it\u0027s not worth the risk to just fast-forward until the pay goes up.\n\nIDEA #2: Diminishing returns. The first contract of a certain type pays a lot, the next of the same type pays a little less, then a little less, and so on. This way a player can\u0027t make much money in the long run by repeating the same mission over and over and over again, and would have to diversify and try a variety of contracts. Of course there are only so many types of contracts available, so if the player avoids a certain \u0022played out\u0022 contract type for a long time, it should gradually \u0022refresh\u0022 and start paying reasonable amounts again."}]}
