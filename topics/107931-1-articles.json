I think the sesame butter makes it taste better, because sesame butter melts more easily giving a rich texture. \n\nMost westerners haven\u0027t really experimented with sesame butter, but it\u0027s a staple in Chinese sauces and can usually be found at the \u0022imported foods\u0022 section of the super markets. \n\nSeeing how easy it is to make, I think you guys should try it."},{"CreatedByName":"Thnd3r","CreatedById":137708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:49:16Z","Content":"NO.\n\n![peanut-butter-forever.gif](https://thesweettreat.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/peanut-butter-forever.gif)"}]}
