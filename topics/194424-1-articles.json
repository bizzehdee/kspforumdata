It mostly happens to all my craft that I put on the runway. Now I don\u2019t know if it has\u00A0something to do with the aerodynamic forces hitting the craft at a certain angle. Does anyone else have the same problem or is it just me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T01:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T07:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a very common problem with spaceplanes.
