About what mass range are we talking about? Most I\u0027ve ever gotten into space with a reliable booster was 450 tonnes on a dare - I\u0027ll have to search for the screenie. Meantime there\u0027s this one, which does 180:\n\n![eMHN8m5.png](http://i.imgur.com/eMHN8m5.png)\n\nGranted, this was from an earlier version of KSP (so it probably could do more now; stock air recommended TWR on the pad for 1.0.x is 1.5 or thereabouts). My observation, though, has been that anything that worked in pre-1.0 KSP will work in the current game, provided you A) add fins, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) add nosecones and C) fly it carefully down towards the ground (don\u0027t start turning until 5k, then be gradual about it - try to be at 45 degrees by 15k but don\u0027t rush it and DEFINITELY don\u0027t turn all at once). As for attaching the payload, struts are still going to be necessary, even if you use a fairing. All the fairing does is protect the internal bits from thermal damage and reduce drag; it doesn\u0027t add much in terms of structural stability to the vehicle. They\u0027re expecially necessary if you\u0027ve got a really narrow connection point (like say if you\u0027ve got a docking port on the bottom of the payload and the booster uses large or extra-large radius parts right off.\n\nIf you\u0027re having problems with parts coming apart from one another, you could try an old trick from the days where the connections weren\u0027t as strong - put cubic octagonals on the side and stitch those together with struts. Like this:\n\n![cNbwiFh.png](http://i.imgur.com/cNbwiFh.png)\n\nMakes things a big stronger - less likely to come flying apart at the seams...\n\nBTW if you think stock fairings blow and aren\u0027t adverse to mods, try Procedural Fairings.

Here\u0027s a few tips:\n\n- Use a stable lifter with above average fuel. You \\*will\\* waste fuel. This is intentional.\n\n- Fly straight up to above 35km using lower than normal thrust. Try to keep velocity between 200-300 m/s. Do no break mach 1. Not even near it. This minimises the effect of drag and reduces the likelyhood of the rocket being pulled by air friction. This costs/wastes fuel.\n\n- Try to avoid SAS lock because it has a nasty habit of wobbleing rockets to death. If you must make manual inputs be very gentle and try to keep pointing straight up.\n\n- Don\u0027t worry too much about inclination (veering north/south), but try not to let the rocket turn retrograde.\n\n- As your lifter climbs, the effect of gravity decreases and velocity increases. Adjust throttle as needed to avoid going too fast.\n\n- Once past 35km air friction subsides to the point where it is safe to gently begin turning prograde. Gently. Hit Alt-F5 to quecksave a specific save and use Alt-F9 to reload if bad things happen.\n\nIn addition to being susceptible to drag, fiddly payloads often lack structural integrity and can be broken off by high thrusting engines. Sadly high thrusting engines are needed for sub-optimal 35km prograde turns otherwise the rocket will fall back down before it reaches orbital velocity. If high thrust is impossible, then it\u0027s best to keep the angle of ascent high and keep wasting fuel. If the payload can be strutted up tightly then it\u0027s time to throttle up and gain orbital velocity.\n\nIf you keep running out of fuel, use stonger engines and bigger tanks. This ascent is initially slow and steady but eventually needs to make up for it. Maybe someone has a better idea but i prefer Mainsail \u002B Skippers for the job unless payload is also stupidly heavy as well as drunk \u0026 disorderly.\n\nIf wobble is incurable then the lifter needs to be redesigned. Try a more vertical lifter with additional vertical support structures. Gratuitos struts should be used to connect the payload to the load bearing part of the lifter. If drop tanks are used, struts \\*can\\* be used to attach payload to them, but keep in mind that they will be dropped.\n\nBy \u0027more vertical\u0027 i mean a central stack with 2 additional companion stacks that can be used as anchor points for struts keeping the payload in check.\n\nImage of a medium sized [rover/lander hybrid craft strutted up on top of a medium lifter](http://i.imgur.com/F2iWPMN.png). This failed to make orbit on the first attempt but second time with an extra bit of fuel and better piloting it worked.\n\nA rather silly ore transporter [rover/lander secured using vertical extensions](http://i.imgur.com/9gs1A4x.png) of the lifter. I was too lazy to rebuild the lifter with fuel tanks instead of girders. Both ideas would work.\n\nIn conclusion, i too have been driven crazy by KSPs refusal to let me lauch silly things into space. My stubborn solution was to WASTE FUEL, lift straight up above 35km thereby wasting more fuel, make sure that i have firmly strutted up the payload, keep wasting fuel and eventually it relented and let me have my way.\n\n[edit]\n\nAlso, if you have rover wheels, engage the parking brake to keep the wheels from spinning. Not sure if they affect anything but they might.\n\nThat trick capi3101 mentioned to secure central tanks to one another is an oldie but a glodie. However i will be damned if i will ever resort to it again post 23.5 joint strenghtening. It\u0027s a flaw in the game and using this as a solution would increase part count. But it does work.

No problem - we can calc the asparagus for that easily enough.\n\nFirst, let me point out [Temstar\u0027s guide to good asparagus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026viewfull=1#post346702). Those guidelines were written for 0.20 but they\u0027re still good in the days of 1.0.x (the main differences being that you don\u0027t want your TWR to be quite as high as it needed to be in the old days - 1.5 is plenty - and that you actually need nosecones and fins these days). 0.20 was the days before thrust limiters, so you couldn\u0027t fine-tune your engine thrust; these days you can.\n\nSo let\u0027s do the math based on those guidelines. Your payload is 80 tonnes; 15% payload fraction gives you a theoretical rocket mass of 533 tonnes. With a 1.5 TWR on the pad for that mass, you\u0027ll need 7840 kN of thrust on the pad. Putting 22% of that in the core - 1724.8 kN; a Twin Boar set at 92.5% could do the job. Alternatively, you could use a rocket cluster (like Temstar used to do). BZ-52s, Cubic Octagonal Struts or even Modular Girder Segments could easily be added to the bottom of a fuel tank, and the rockets attached to those. Say 4 Swivels and 6 Reliants - that would give you 1879.02 in the core, a little more than you need but nothing that can\u0027t adjusted (adjust the Reliants to 87% - you want the Swivels at full blast).\n\nSo, let\u0027s say then you want three booster pairs. You have 78% of the 7840 kN left to allot, distributed among six engines - that comes out to 1019.2 kN each. That one\u0027s easy - use Mainsails set at 74% thrust. So, assuming you go with the rocket cluster and the Mainsails, you\u0027ve got 49.5 tonnes worth of engines.\n\nNow to figure up fuel in each stack. Your theoretical mass is 533 tonnes - you\u0027ve got 80 tonnes of payload and 49.5 tonnes of engine. I always say three tonnes for unexpected sundry crap like decouplers, nosecones and fins. So subtract all that from the theoretical mass - you have 400.5 tonnes of fuel left; dividing into seven stacks gives you just over 57 tonnes of fuel tanks per stack. Your options are partially drained S3-14400s, or a combination Jumbo64/X200-32/X200-8 - the second of which would give you 58.5 tonnes of fuel, which is close enough for jazz, and would keep your stacks to the 2.5 radial size (so you wouldn\u0027t have to waste mass on adapters and such). They\u0027d also save you about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A124,000 or so, if that\u0027s a consideration. You\u0027d need a little more thrust to offset the extra seven tonnes of fuel but that shouldn\u0027t be a problem since we\u0027ve got engines tuned down all over the place - they have room to go up a bit.\n\nIf you did go with a Twin Boar in the core, you\u0027d have 46 tonnes of engines plus 32 tonnes of fuel in the core already. The 3.5 tonnes of fuel saved for engines comes out to an extra 0.5 tonnes of fuel tanks per stack, so not much change over what you already have. You\u0027d need to add 25.5 tonnes of fuel to the top of the Twin Boar - an X200-32/X200-16 combo could do the job, though you\u0027d have to drain off 1.5 tonnes of fuel from one of those two tanks. Or just go with it and up the thrust.\n\nOne other thing you might want to try is the [Optimal Rocket Calculator](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/) site; it\u0027s a handy tool that will calculate the parts required to build a booster for specifications you define. It\u0027s a really handy tool when it comes to booster design.\n\nOther than that there\u0027s not much else I can suggest. I\u0027ll plug the Procedural Fairings mod again and call it a day at this point.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T17:05:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T16:13:40Z","Content":"Thanks capi, going to definitely check out a rocket calc it should make designing a bit less of a exercise in chance!"}]}
