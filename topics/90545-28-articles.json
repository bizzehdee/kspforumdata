Or try playing with the thermal section in the debug menu, that should lead to something workable as well. Those are some rather unelegant workarounds, but they should do the job temporarily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PanzerAce","CreatedById":142172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T03:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PanzerAce\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PanzerAce\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got an issue with the 8x 1.25m and 1x 2.5 plate has the 2.5m engine mount point noticeably below the level of the plate itself (like....5m or so below)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an idiot.
