All of those ships will be sent out on a schedule so Kerbal Alarm Clock would be a good mod to get. Dpending on your strategy you could go for a short tour (my initial route was a bit over five years) or for the long haul with optimized trajectories and minimal delta-V expenditure (if you want to send as few refuelers as possible).
