Putting some kind of protective shielding around the mission critical bits (i.e. the cockpit) wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea either; girder segments in this case, but in general anything with a high impact tolerance. Ordinarily I would suggest driving in docking mode; in staging mode, the main directional controls are going to want to pitch your craft rather than turn it. In this case though, with the engine providing the thrust, it\u0027s best to ignore that bit of advice. You might also consider adding a reaction stabilizer if you\u0027ve got access to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight also want to consider using an engine with an alternator - that Terrier\u0027s not going to recharge your batts.

Put them about where you want them vertically, then roll them (Q and E keys) in that position until they\u0027re parallel to the ground. Then add additional girders to widen out your wheel base.

It will help with control. Braking on the front should be tweaked down, too much brake and it will roll forward. The only reason to have 4 wheels (or more) wheels instead of 3 is for power. Since you are using unpowered wheels, that doesn\u0027t matter much and 3 is more stable than 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your basic jet engine only needs liquid fuel and air and will last a lot longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you might reconsider the rover entirely. As it seems you may be new to the game, you might not have learned to build and fly (or more importantly... land) a plane yet, but your tech tree shows you have all the parts you need and you can get around a lot faster in a plane than a rover. Rovers are good for KSC science, but beyond that, they are very slow.

A six-wheeled rover can loose a wheel or two and still be functional (if not quite as optimally.)
