I did not check lately but there were components with a naturally offset center of mass so if they are still there you may be able to build a rover with an actual center of mass that is under the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere in the pic there is an example of what I mean with \u0022downforce\u0022.

Irrespectively, any slight bump you hit at speed will still flip you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs suggested, aerodynamic down force is the conventional solution, but I like Fierce Wolf\u0027s slightly more kerbal solution of a separate engine for downforce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re feeling creative and have breaking ground or a robotics mod, you could have a variable pitch on your main engine to angle it up slightly. Be careful about the relationship between centre of thrust and centre of mass, and watch your centre of lift, especially if you have any components providing lift. A couple of fins either side of the engine nozzle might just help keep it straight, once you have downforce sorted out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
