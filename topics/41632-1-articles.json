Between being on a Mac and having downloaded through Steam and not knowing where to look, to not really wanting to get too crazy until I\u0027ve got the basics of the stock game down, I\u0027m just not there yet. Second, I don\u0027t want to go the easy way by just pulling up lists of anomalies and locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I wanted to spice up my experience a bit by going off in pursuit of thses anomalies. I assume all the scanners or map making stuff were mods, but is there a stock instrument or method of some kind that I\u0027m missing that one can use investigate planets closer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, I may just have to \u0022simulate\u0022 a remote sensing mission by getting a probe with something weighing and looking like a camera into a polar orbit and watching from orbit on time acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn one hand I want to find them for some targeted landings, but on the other, I want to feel like I\u0027ve earned it at least a little bit.

On the other hand, my strategy for finding anomalies with a stock game amounted to flying insanely low orbits and looking for flicker. Though I did find one with it, don\u0027t expect to find munoliths with this stratgety, as they are very difficult to see and you have to be VERY close (often closer than the edges of any given crater might allow).
