Exponential decrease with a certain equation, corrected to actually reach zero when the temperature of atmosphere is identical to the core temperature of the unit.\n\n![ne.png](http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f184/PhotoKK/Random/ne.png)\n\n2) Core temperature well below Eve\u0027s minimal atmospheric temperature (360 K @ sea level) so that RTGs are completely useless on its surface.\n\nThis would leave the player with two options for probe landings - fuel cells or solar panels.\n\n(It would be interesting if Eve gets shrouded in clouds one day so that even the panels themselves aren\u0027t very useful. This combination would indeed turn every probe into a ticking failure, just like it is in reality.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T19:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote27","CreatedById":141964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T11:42:31Z","Content":"Ooh, I like this suggestion.

That 30\u002B year lifespans of RTGs can be ignored for the sake of gameplay. (Time is nearly a nonissue in KSP, as you might spend a year doing literally nothing but waiting for a planetary alignment. If/when KSP gets Kerbal Alarm Clock, then maybe RTG decay can be a trackable thing.)\n\nAs for the RTG thermals; I agree that they should become less efficient the hotter they are.

RTG\u0027s have a life to them. \n\nAs they age, their power starts to diminish, even after one year (a very minuscule amount of drop to say the least).\n\nI would be happy with a 10 gameyear lifespan in KSP. That would be realistic enough for the game.\n\nAs for efficiency drop due to their working environment (Eve for example), ABSOLUTELY! That would be just fine with me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T15:15:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T00:42:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Signo, what do you mean solar panels don\u0027t work on the sea level?

And exposure does not work like that anywhere else afaik.\n\nJust to expand a little bit the concept: the energy you can gather using the same OX STAT on Kerbin near a random pole is more or less equal to the amount you could gather on KSC landing strip at dawn. That amount is more or less halved compared to the energy you can gather at noon. \n\nWith a comparable exposure (85-95) and as close as possible to sea level (max 75m altitude) the energy gathered is as follows:\n\nKerbin pole - 0.05/0.08\n\nKSC dawn - 0.05/0.08\n\nKSC noon - 0.18/0.22\n\nEve north pole - 0.00/0.01\n\nEve equatorial region dawn - 0.00/0.01\n\nEve e.r. noon - 0.01/0.03\n\nIf you make RTGs to explode down there you should provide an reliable and feasible alternative, it might not be comfortable to bring down there a single seat rover propelled by a random number of gigantors.\n\nI was not particularly happy with the RTG solution myself so I thought to model a kind of ram air turbine to propel the rovers but that is still WIP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T14:22:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 02:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**\n  \ndatas"}]}
