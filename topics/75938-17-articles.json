Made a micro tank with them, some Firespitter parts, the Bahamuto Armory Vulcan Guns, and a config modded RTG (10x the power generation, but I added in Decay Heat, which goes down over time. Lose all the heat and the RTG is merely a lump of weight.) Quite a bit of fun. I like how they instantly respond to rover controls, one of the things I did dislike in the original RBI tracks. They\u0027d respond quickly, but acceleration left something to be desired. These, not a problem, they accelerate like rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad no problem with traveling 7 KM to my target site, then destroying a simple block of structural panels. I\u0027m impressed. A good amount of power draw, more than a rover wheel under starting draw, but correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but once you reach peak RPM, I think the power draw was fading down. The old RBI tracks did that, too, and was something I wished could be applied to rover wheels. It takes much less to maintain RPM than it does to reach it. It\u0027s very impressive. Grip was superb, climbing a bit of a rough hill from a dead stop, though I had to keep stopping to let my 400 unit battery recharge (which wasn\u0027t ever really a problem) and it\u0027d just pick up and go again, chewing battery until I\u0027d coast to a stop, apply brakes, and do it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning rate, also pretty good. No problems with being able to turn. In fact, I\u0027m glad they\u0027re actually a little bit twitchy. The old RBI tracks had the opposite quirk, they tended to refuse to turn while traveling at any reasonable rate of speed. These, not a problem making a rapid 90-degree turn at 15 m/s. Made aiming a pain on approach (My brain has enough trouble going in one direction, now let\u0027s try swiveling a cannon to point at something and keep the tank chassis going straight...) but I liked the fact that they would actually respond like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t run into the usual \u0022stock rover code suspension bug\u0022 where the wheels oscillate at a high rate of speed, preventing braking, steering, or accelerating in a direction other than wherever the wheels plan to go. Think infiniglide-for-rovers, except infinitely more destructive when it happens. Also had no problem with a terrain bug at 16 m/s that snuck up on me (was in IVA view) and ran right over a terrain seam. That usually leads to wheels ripped off of rovers, instant screaming, and an explosion. These tracks... No problem. A slight bump and away we went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoss of steering responsiveness above 20 m/s, but that doesn\u0027t bother me. Application of the brakes brought my tiny tank down to a low enough speed to turn. In fact, I\u0027m glad of this because it means making half tracks is easier. No having to worry about the tank tracks being the dominant steering compared to the rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t played with repulsors yet since the update, I really wanted to try those tracks. And once I clear my space center and surrounding properties from crashed debris, I\u0027ll make some lucky Kerbal a half-track hot-rod so they can go racing down the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T22:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the detailed report!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe steering authority is set up to fade as speed builds or it got a bit unstable.
