Ideally a game *should* use all power available to deliver the fastest gaming experience instead of slowing things down just so it doesn\u0027t use all your processing power. Having said that, in practice you may have a laptop that overheats too easily for whatever reason so I do recommend you test your system at full load to see if it doesn\u0027t get too hot and if it does, take precautions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrischambers","CreatedById":69113,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T16:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the advice, I usually on play on a flat surface, with nothing getting in the way of the airflow, and at the moment this is just a temp solution, as I am about to go out and purchase a gaming motherboard and graphics card, so hopefully this will resolve the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T17:02:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrischambers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrischambers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethanks for the advice, I usually on play on a flat surface, with nothing getting in the way of the airflow, and at the moment this is just a temp solution, as I am about to go out and purchase a gaming motherboard and graphics card, so hopefully this will resolve the issue.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure you aren\u0027t going for a PCChips or Elitegroup board, and I can almost guarantee you\u0027ll be glued to the new system for the whole weekend with all the newfound smoothness it brings to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...at least until you get to the point where you\u0027re building 700\u002B part ships and the cycle begins all over again.
