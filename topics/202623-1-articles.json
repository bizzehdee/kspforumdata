I have posted this issue in the RealChute thread also but had no response as of yet and I\u0027ve wasted nearly a full day trying to find what is causing this issue. I can\u0027t see anything obvious in the configuration file and the RealChute module doesn\u0027t have a line for \u0022invertCanopy\u0022 so that one is out. Anybody know of a solution or a config line that can be added to @RealChuteModule to resolve this? It would be greatly appreciated and save the last few locks of hair I have left in my head.
