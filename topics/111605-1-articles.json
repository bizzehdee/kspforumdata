But I dont know if it is KER or KSP parts\n\nHere is a Mk2 cockpit (2,06T) , then i add a MK2 rocket fuel fuselage (3,57T) and a Rapier Engine (2T)\n\nTotal weight should be 7,63T \n\nIn fact it is 7,435T, because if you look the weight of the fuselage (right click) wet weight given is 3,375T and not 3,57T given in SPH Fuel tank part.\n\n[![211050screenshot8.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/211050screenshot8.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=211050screenshot8.png)\n\nThen I add 2 delta wings. Given weight of each is 0,2T as indicated in aerodynamic parts. Total weight should be 7,435\u002B0,4 = 7,835T\n\nIn fact it is 8,279 . So each delta wing weight is in fact 0,422 and not 0,2T\n\nIf you add mechjeb on the aircraft, it will find the same total weight as KER. They agree.\n\nAnd you can try a lot of wings, each time the real calculated weight is not the indicated weight.\n\n[![248824screenshot9.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/248824screenshot9.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=248824screenshot9.png)\n\nSo there is something wrong somewhere with the weight and in final, my SSTO is given for 67T by KER and 57T by Mechjeb.\n\nHere Mechjeb is right and disagree with KER\n\n[![878610screenshot10.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/878610screenshot10.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=878610screenshot10.png)\n\nBut when i launch my SSTO, Mechjeb take the wrong KER weight in account, 10T more! Weight is now 67T\n\nIn other way, I can see that mechjeb don\u0027t take in account weight of some small parts, when I add them, like vernor engines or adjustable landing gear......\n\nThat\u0027s why i posted in mechjeb and KER section\n\n[![320515screenshot12.png](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/320515screenshot12.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=320515screenshot12.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T12:15:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gilflo**"}]}
