Other adapters have the same mass as a fuel tank of their capacity does, and other Mk2 spaceplane parts have the same mass as a tank of their capacity \u002B a wing of that lift rating would (1 lift per 0.1t), but the Mk2 - 2.5m adapter has the mass of the latter with no lift. I assume, therefore, it was intended to have a lift rating of 0.7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T10:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll Connector pieces (conversions between various sizes) have around 8:1 wet:dry mass ratio. This tank does too. It has worse dry mass than a dedicated tank not because it\u0027s MK2 which have wing area, but because it\u0027s a connector, with two different sizes on two ends. And with its shape it would have very poor lift properties...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T10:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I realized that later when I took a closer look at some of the other adapters.
