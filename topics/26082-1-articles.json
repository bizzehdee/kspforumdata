I often have several photos full of photos of what ever im trying to create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well as knowing what all the pipes and pumps do on actual rocket engines. Here is an example from the Titan III SRB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tiny orange rockets on the side of the titan SRB\u0027s are actually how the SRB\u0027s vector its thrust. They inject fuel into the exhaust at different points so it will divert in different directions. This gives it some more detail and also has a real function, helping ground it a bit in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://space.skyrocket.de/img_lau/titan3c_7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022titan3c_7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IZzE7ji.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IZzE7ji.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T16:42:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by frizzank\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boosterspice","CreatedById":58629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T17:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips, all of you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll be trying out different methods, but you guys have given me an idea.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZaeo, I\u0027ll give you a hint: Salami! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryocasm","CreatedById":5299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T18:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink with \u003Cem\u003Eportals\u003C/em\u003E. If you do a bit of research on the physics behind it you can begin to a get a feeling and imagination for what a different nozzle shape does and how it releases thrust according to its fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve probably noticed that SRBs are usually broad cones with a wide throat, this is because the burning hot thrusting exhaust is coming from within the SRB, and isn\u0027t being mixed up in the combustor/nozzle. In Liquid engines, the fuel is either combusted and then throated into the nozzle, or combusted in the nozzle itself. In order to maximize the area which can pickup force from the reaction as well as orient the thrust beam nozzles are usually \u0022cone\u0022 shaped, but actually they are more parabolic than conic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome engines also have additional small tanks near the nozzles on gantries and strutting, these can add visual touch, and in real life usually contain cooling liquid or a hypergolic reactant pair, in order to restart the engine in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at many liquid engines also makes you find that they often have a ring around the nozzle, this \u0022ring\u0022 or \u0022tube\u0022 is actually for cooling, which adds nice detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen working in Blender, choose the depth of your engine carefully, so that you don\u0027t have to do any funny stuff in Unity or for placement in KSP. If its thrust vectoring, you need to have 2 models. 1 \u0022anchor\u0022 and 1 \u0022gimbal\u0022. Accordingly identify it in the part.cfg file. Use ctrl\u002Be to Mark Seams, this helps greatly with easy texturing and UV unwrapping.

This model specifically lacks the hypergolic fuel tanks for restarting, but this is only preliminary. If I remember correctly this engine is 2m in diameter.
