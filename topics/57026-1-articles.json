No liquidfuel-only tanks because stock doesn\u0027t really have any that are small enough for this kind of short-term use, so it\u0027s just 1 normal-size and 1 double-size rocket fuel tank, 2 RAPIER engines, 6 air intakes and a command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt even has enough fuel left, and surprisingly also gets enough intakeair (despite the intakes being turned in the wrong direction for that), to turn on air-breathing mode again when it gets back into atmosphere.
