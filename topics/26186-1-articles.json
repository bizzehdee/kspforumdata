For the smaller stacks I run 2 lines out of the bottom into the mainsail stacks (one line to each stack on each side) This ensures the smaller stack burns out first and the 4 mainsails stay full till the 4 smaller stacks drop. the 5th mainsail is attached to the center stack and only burns when the rest have dropped. I tried running lines into it from the 4 big stacks but it caused the tanks to burn unevenly and I would flame out a single engine before the others, which in turn caused death, destruction and a very pretty light show for the folks on the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to do a similar arrangement with this large a setup though O.o\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl","CreatedById":58210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T08:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar problem and discovered it came from a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fiuel was drained from my upper stage to a random bottom tank.
