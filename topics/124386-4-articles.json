I like the idea of trying to better convey the idea of how jet engines actually look/work, but like so many others have mentioned before me: it does mess with designs that rely on short engines and VTOL designs that have them pointed downwards. In real life there are engineering options that allow for the exhaust of the engine to not be in line with the turbine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how to incorporate this into the game, i\u0027m not entirely sure.
