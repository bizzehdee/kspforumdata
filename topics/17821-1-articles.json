The list down the right side of the interface in the VAB shows the sequence things will work on. It starts at the bottom and works up.

You\u0027ll want to do this opposite in your orbit from where you want to go. Which is about 45-50 ish degrees ahead of where it is when you begin. Watch out for the speed as it gets really sensitive once you\u0027ve reached escape velocity. Also, if your orbit is off vertically you can change the angle by accelerating perfectly perpendicular up or down to it. If you\u0027re too slow you can maybe fix it by speeding up inside the Mun\u0027s path, kind of like you\u0027d do if you were to try and catch up with someone on foot or in a car chase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry not to come in too hot, and watch out that your rocket doesn\u0027t tip over and split into little pieces with no fuel left.
