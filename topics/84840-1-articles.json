A recent third revision of the Ariane 6 proposal appears to have won over its previous critics, and though it has yet to be made official (likely in December this year), signs point to the cancellation of the Ariane 5 ME program in favor of the new launcher. The goal would be to have it flight ready by 2019.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ariane 6 will have to live up to a big legacy, as the current generation 5 ECA is considered one of the most reliable launch platforms ever created, with 61 consecutive mission successes out of 62 launch attempts (and counting). Unfortunately it turns out to be too expensive to compete with the recent wave of newspace startups, particularly SpaceX. Because of this, the Ariane 6 program will attempt to deliver a modular launcher that can be better sized for individual mission requirements and costs significantly less per kg to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-17T18:39:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2014 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T19:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh, 2019, same year as the ULA/Blue Origin announcement regarding a new rocket.
