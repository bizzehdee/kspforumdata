Also to some extent, I had lifted all the large payloads I had planned, and have been flying missions with the reusable architecture I had set up... so no more massive SSTOs to lift massive payloads... just small crew SSTOs... I also used some vertical launch rocket(or rocket-airbreathing hybrid) SSTOs (ignoring attemps to land at the runway for 100% recover) to save time at the expense of extra funds spent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I hope to get a new computer to go with 1.1...
