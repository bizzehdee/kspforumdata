One of them did not, and only the valiant efforts of the Mission Control Crew and Jebediah Kerman prevented the deaths of three other crew members.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EINCIDENT 1: \u003Cem\u003EChariot\u003C/em\u003E-class lander crash\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a successful landing in the highlands by Joewise Kerman, Rayhat Kerman was dispatched to scout out a landing site on the low flatlands using a \u003Cem\u003EMinmus\u003C/em\u003E-class pressurized scouting lander. Once this was completed, Joewise and Hamford Kerman boarded Geo 2 and safely landed less than a meter from the target beacon. Hamford requested an extended stay on the surface, which was granted after a reprogramming of the \u003Cem\u003EMinmus\u003C/em\u003E lander\u0027s autopilot. Joewise and Rayhat boarded Geo 2 and initiated the Ascent Guidance module of the flight computer. The craft lifted off, tipped sideways, and crashed into the surface at more than 30 m/s. The craft apparently landed with Joewise on the ground side, as Rayhay reported seeing the stars, a flash of light and heat, and being hurled from his seat at great speed. Analysis from telemetry revealed that the nearly-full fuel tank exploded, catapulting Rayhat to relative safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter several seconds of shock, Rayhat activated his EVA Pack thrusters and proceeded to manually insert himself into a stable orbit to enable a rescue, even though he had no idea if that rescue was coming. Thankfully, Hamford reported the explosion and resulting launch of Rayhat, and a plan was rapidly enacted to rescue him. Hamford dropped all further EVAs, and returned to the ship, allowing the single seat lander to be refuelled and dispatched on an automatic rendevous mission. This took almost an entire day, but it finally arrived 10 meters away from Rayhat, who gleefully climbed aboard and was returned to the main ship, where he remained under the watch of Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECAUSE: An accidental flip of the switch selecting guidance system input left the flight computer taking accelerometer input from Rayhat\u0027s chair, resulting in a horizontal flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERESULT: All future \u003Cem\u003EChariot\u003C/em\u003E landers will have a guard installed over this switch that must be intentionally opened before actuation can occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EINCIDENT 2: \u003Cem\u003EChariot\u003C/em\u003E-class lander explosion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a successful landing, an extensive surface exploration mission by Patsen and Hamford Kerman at the highlands geology site, and placing a makeshift memorial to Joewise overlooking his first footprints on Minmus, Geo 1 returned to the ship. However, less than a second after successfully docking, the Remote Guidance Unit that formed the main chassis of the lander suffered a massive explosion, rocking the entire ship and catapulting the two geologists into ballistic trajectories out of the SoI of Minmus. Rayhat and Jeb promptly jettisoned the still-docked fuel tank of Geo 1, and coached Patsen and Hamford on how to use their EVA Packs to safely decelerate into a highly elliptical orbit. After a rushed refuelling, the first \u003Cem\u003EMinmus\u003C/em\u003E-class lander was dispatched in pursuit of Patsen. However, a typo at Mission Control resulted in the lander suffering an uncontrolled crash into a mountainside. The second lander was then dispatched after a thorough round of triple checking the math. This arrived 10 meters away after a several hour pursuit. A second multi-hour flight then returned Patsen to the ship, where he proceeded to EVA across the 25 meter gap to the habitat. The lander then departed in pursuit of Hamford, who was also recovered and returned. At this point, Jebediah proceeded to board the lander, and departed in pursuit of the jettisonned \u003Cem\u003EChariot\u003C/em\u003E fuel tank, where he retrieved the flight data recorders, geology samples, and small debris fragments lurking nearby. He then docked with the tank and deorbited it, before returning to the ship and deorbiting the remaining \u003Cem\u003EMinmus\u003C/em\u003E lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECAUSE: Unknown. Crew attributes the accident to the mythical boogeyman of the kerbonaut corps, the \u0022Space Kraken\u0022. Engineering focus remains on the junction between fuel tank and RGU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERESULT: All \u003Cem\u003EChariot\u003C/em\u003E-class landers are currently grounded while the investigation continues. Further actions will be dictated by the results of the accident investigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEND MISSION STATUS: SUCCESS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission has proven the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbals can operate in very low gravity environments, low temperatures, and rough terrain without issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbals can perform remarkable feats of ingenuity and courage in times of crisis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbals are ready to leave the Kerbin system and proceed into deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Minmus\u0027s flatlands are made of a mysterious frozen gas that has an unusually high chemical energy potential when burned. This has been dubbed \u0022kethane\u0022 by the crew, and the name has stuck for now. Research is ongoing into possible uses for this exotic material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cem\u003EPrepared with the help of notes from crew members collected during cruise home.\u003C/em\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T10:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat writeup and quick thinking.
