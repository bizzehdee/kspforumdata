I quicksaved a few thousand feet above the window where all the conditions are met.\n\nEach time I enter the window, I bash the spacebar repeatedly to try to open the chute, but to my dismay it never opens until just after I have passed through the lower bound altitude from the contract. It is like the game is just trying to .... me off. I have even tried opening the chute a few thousand feet above the window, but still, it never opens until below the window. \n\nDoes anyone know what is going on?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:13:47Z","Content":"Right click the parachute and click run test when the conditions are met.

If your minimum altitude is higher than that, it will not deploy.\n\nI didn\u0027t think it actually had to deploy for the test to work though. As long as you\u0027ve activated it, that should be good enough, just like engines with no fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"gradi3nt","CreatedById":111157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:29:53Z","Content":"Thanks for your comments!\n\nThe lower window is 23.7km, just above the pre-deploy threshold, so I guess that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t see anything happen.\n\nThere is no \u0027run test\u0027 option in the parachutes context window.\n\nSo, I was able to complete the contract after a half dozen more tries, but I\u0027m not sure why it worked. I simply continued with my bashing of the spacebar and it miraculously worked.\n\nIf you end up at this thread and had a similar problem please post!
