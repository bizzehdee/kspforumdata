I\u0027m just making sure because I run a lot of mods, mostly big parts packs like B9, LLL, Fustek, etc. I\u0027d like to try using JUST this mod first, because ATM is starting to become... bothersome, ever since 0.25 hit, insofar as the fact that I\u0027m still running up against my memory limit, plus a lot of my textures look really crappy because I have to compress them so much, and the game STILL crashes way too frequently (even by \u0027normal\u0027 KSP standards) due to, I believe, a nagging memory leak in one of the mods that hasn\u0027t been updated for 0.25. But if I need to run LOD with ATM (v3-8 aggressive, x86, naturally), and NOT use \u0027 -force OpenGL\u0027 as instructed somewhere in the OP, I believe... well, should I even give LOD a try, or should I not bother, given the info above?

It actually might be worth a try to simply not load the high resolution texture in such a case. Though it would still mean KSP is close to running OOM and might crash because of sth else needing memory. Anyway, it would be good to have a look at LoadOnDemand.log first, just to make sure its not actually caused by something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, Issues on GitHub would be great.
