Are not there quite common weird occasions where the rocket just can not stop wobbling simply because joints bend and wobble and certainly so does the guidance part near the top. I think in real life it would be quite impractical to increase the weight of an interstate beyond what is required for its structural integrity to stabilize the joint. Can we for example significantly increase the strength of certain joints via the configs so they can simulate a realistic big holding strength while keeping the real life size and mass?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso is the current latest release supposed to make the tweak scale default size grid decimal with a fixed big step of half a metre and fine adjustments available instead of the stock size like it was done in the previous versions? Currently in my game installation the tweak scale uses the stock size and scale system up to five metres and then allows me to go up to no more than seven metres and not all parts work.
