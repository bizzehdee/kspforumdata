I really want to make a video of me playing it. The problem is that whenever I start recording, KSP\u0027s framerate would go to as low as 1 FPS, even at the VAB. And I am too lazy to increase my RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what are the important settings in Graphics that I would need to tweak in order to boost performance in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T09:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart by disabling AA if you have it enabled anywhere. Then move-on to AF, texture levels, and turning-off sprites (rocks and things) might not be a bad idea. That feature is a WIP and causes a pretty substantial performance hit as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point it depends on how much RAM you have available. If KSP is eating almost all of it, I\u0027d suggest removing mod parts, and possibly recording the raw video to a separate drive. Recording raw or very lightly compressed video might help too. It\u0027ll take more physical memory space in the short term, but can be compressed later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd perhaps reduce your recording resolution?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lemonhands","CreatedById":53664,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T04:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERecord in 1280\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D720, since anything lower then 1080P wont\u0027 be visible on youtube, it\u0027ll automaticall revert to 720p, and by recording in 1280\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D720 in stead of, say, 1680x1050, you\u0027ll get a FPS boost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
