Anyway, in all that time I have yet to find a way to collect or transfer only specific science experiments. For example, I have a couple of missions to pick up artifacts from Duna and Ike, which are recorded like science experiments, and bring them home. I have\u00A0 about 25 other experiments in the probe core (RC-L01) that I would like to move to a science lab in orbit. The probe core, and the science container can \u0022collect all\u0022. I can review the list and transmit or turn it into the science lab until it gets full. The problem is, with 25 experiments, it will get full and I want to leave the rest with it\u0027s container before heading back to Kerbin with the two artifacts. Has there been any way that anyone has found yet, without mods, of doing just this? If not, I hope they add it to KSP2. It doesn\u0027t make any sense that science experiments can\u0027t be separated because scientists don\u0027t just toss everything into a pile of goo and study the reaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-16T04:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved from Science and Spaceflight to Gameplay Questions for better visibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-16T14:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods might help but else its no way.
