Since Ship Manifest essentially deals with Flight operations on a vessel, the Roster Feature always felt like an \u0022afterthought\u0022. It was part of the original Crew Manifest, which I used as a basis for Ship Manifest over a year ago, but now with the way Ship Manifest has evolved, it makes more and more sense to separate and expand on this feature.\n\nI\u0027ve already got a working shell running with the base functionality of the Roster in Ship Manifest as my starting point.\n\nHowever, this plugin will not end up looking like a rehash of that. My thoughts are as follows: This initial post will be updated as more info and a definition is added.\n\n**Alpha (0.3.0.0) on [SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/191/RosterManager) | [GitHub](https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/RosterManager/releases).**\n\n![For KSP-v112.3-green.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/For%20KSP-v112.3-green.svg)[!\\[license-CC%20BY--SA-green.svg\\](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY--SA-green.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/For%20KSP-v112.3-green.svg) [![CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067)\n\n**Installation:** \n\n1.

Default value is 10000 funds.  \n\n   - Salaries are deducted monthly or yearly, but if you do not have enough funds then the kerbals who aren\u0027t paid will go into a contract dispute mode.  \n\n     - Contract Disputes occur when kerbals are not paid their salary. Each pay period the kerbals who aren\u0027t paid will ask for a payrise (which goes up each time they aren\u0027t paid).  \n\n       All un-paid salary will accrue each time they are not paid.  \n\n       The user can accept the payrise and the kerbal will continue to work for you. However, this will only occur for 3 pay periods. At the end of the third occurrence of them not  \n\n       being paid the kerbal will go on strike (Become a tourist). Until such time as they are paid all owed money.  \n\n     - A Contracts Window is available to see all kerbals that currently are in contract dispute and allow you to accept payrise, decline (they go on strike). Or if you have  \n\n       funds available you can re-pay them all owed monies and they will go back to work for you.  \n\n     - Each month or year (salary period) funds are checked and if there are enough contract disputes are automatically resolved.       \n\n - Added KerbalLifeSpanInfo including Age and lifespan processing setting for each kerbal.   \n\n   - If this setting is on all kerbals in the game will age over time and eventually die from old age.  \n\n   - If the Repawn kerbal option is on in the main game settings then they will respawn when the die (but as a new freshman again).  \n\n   - If you also have DeepFreeze Mod intalled then freezing a kerbal will stop the aging process whilst they are frozen.  \n\n   - Each Kerbals age is shown in the Attributes Tab for each kerbal and the main roster list. But the age cannot be changed.   \n\n - Refactored code, cleaned up code style, standardized variables and usage.  \n\nIf you use DeepFreeze, you will need the latest version above to work with Roster Manager.  \n\nVersion 0.1.0.0 20 Jun 2015 - Initial alpha release  \n\n- Roster interface based on Roster window from Ship Manifest, but greatly enhanced (sorting, more detail)  \n\n- In flight controls removed. These will stay in Ship Manifest. Roster Manager will not be visible in the Flight scene.  \n\n- Kerbal manager Tab buttons for various areas to manage.  \n\n- Support for DeepFreeze cryo canisters. Frozen kerbals are displayed with assigned vessel.  \n\n- Attributes Tab, contains kerbal editing found in SM. However, all kerbals can be edited.  \n\n- Training Tab contains ability to edit kerbal skill and experience  \n\n- History tab contains kerbal\u0027s flight history.  \n\n- KSP-AVC aware and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E listed.\n\n**Roster Manager**\n\n**- Roster list** - From the Roster list, you can select the kerbal to manage\n\n**- Attributes** - This section allows you to change the kerbal\u0027s attributes (like in Ship manifest, but more control and no limit on which vessel. Will be affected by realism...\n\n**- Records (career file)** - This is where all management functions will reside. In the personnel file we can manage:\n\no Salaries - Kerbals don\u0027t work for free, so some cost for each kerbal should exist. We will pay a salary to each kerbal on the roster, on a Biweekly/ Monthly/ yearly basis, (configurable). Salaries can be adjusted for realism and playablility.\n\no Stats Editing - Editing stats. You can change the Primary profession, name, and other properties of your kerbal.\n\no Notes - A simple editor that allows you to add notes to your kerbal\n\n**\\* Training**- Training is a means to increase your kerbal\u0027s experience through training. Training can consist of time spent away from flight learning specific tasks, or via Simulations such as in HoloDeck mod.\n\n- *Cross Training* (multi Profession) It will be possible to maintain multiple professions. Through training and flights, you can increase a specific profession by selecting that profession for a given flight.\n\no Experience - Experience is gained thru flights. With RM, experience can also be gained thru training on specific tasks and thru Simulator training using HoloDeck. Training will increase the experience level of your Kerbals in the profession for which the training occurs.\n\no Flight / Simulation Log - Flight history and Simulation history will be stored in your Kerbal\u0027s personnel file\n\n-Vessel flown\n\n-Dates of filght\n\n-Results\n\n-Accomplishments\n\no Crew Performance - Crews that stay together fly better together. It will be possible to improve the performance of a given crew through training and Simulations performed together. Kerbals with more time together will perform better on a given flight.\n\no Accomplishments/Achievements - using Other addons, accomplishments can be gathered and added to your Kerbal\u0027s personnel file.\n\no Medals - Medals for significant achievements can be earned.\n\no Medical / Psych - Your Kerbal\u0027s abilities can be impacted by their medical condition and sanity. While no insane kerbals are possible (yet), (no suicides, sorry), their mental state will impact their skills. Things like time in space alone, traumatic events like crash landings and such can affect their abilities for certain periods of time.\n\n- Kerbal Type and Status are now here.   Since medical typically approves kerbal for flight status... It made sense to include it here... ther are restrictions to flight status, so if you pick unusual settings, the Medical Team will warn you against these rash choices....\n\n**- Recruitment/Termination** - It will be possible to hire/fire Kerbals. Fired Kerbals will be removed from the game permanently (Will impact the game save).\n\n**- Scheduling** - It will be possible to schedule kerbal crews and crew rotations, vacations, have impacts to crew due to illness, and medical issues.\n\n**- Settings**\n\no Reputation/Currency\n\no Realism\n\no Scheduling\n\no Recruitment / Termination\n\n**- Persistence** - This Mod will change the game save. This allows the management of many parts of the kerbal\u0027s experience, profession, and accomplishments.\n\nI\u0027ll be placing this in a PDF on the GITHUB site I will be creating to make it easier to read..\n\nThe Idea behind this mod is to extend the Kerbal experience, provide some control, and provide an ecosystem around them. I intend to leverage the available mods around this theme and attempt to maintain compatibility as much as possible.\n\nAt the moment I\u0027m looking at leveraging and compatibility with CrewQueue, HoloDeck, KerbalStats and other mods.\n\nSuggestions and comments are welcomed.  Your thoughts/suggestions are welcome.\n\nIf you can think of a better Name for the Mod, I\u0027m certainly up for discussion on that as well...\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-14T01:07:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2022 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**\n  \nNew Version, 1.12.3 compatibility bug fix"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T06:42:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 9.

But to answer your question, I hadn\u0027t looked at that but I certainly can. Iirc, CLS disables the stock transfer behavior and makes it respect living spaces... I\u0027ll verify that. if it does not, I\u0027ll look into disabling the stock behavior when in realism mode and using CLS.\n\nYup, I was right. With the release of CLS 1.0.10.0, Kerbal transfers from one part to another cannot be accomplished if the living space is not connected. I just verified in the code, and confirmed in flight. I closed a hatch to a capsule, and tried to move a kerbal from the capsule to a Hitchhiker storage container. it failed and gave the proper screen message message that the destination could not be reached. So, if you desire this restriction, I suggest you install CLS if you have not already done so. This can be overridden in the CLS window by checking \u0022Allow Unrestricted Transfers\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E does this/will this allow you to set up an exact lineup so that one set of kerbals will not show up 2 times in a row (Jeb flies one mission and then, until the current lineup is exhausted, will return to him)?\n\nInteresting. I\u0027m thinking that could be possible. KSP already has a mechanism for dead kerbals. There may be a way to make that happen.

I will be removing Roster feature from SM and moving it to Roster Manager, as it really does not belong in SM anymore with its current focus on the Vessel and flight.\n\nCrew renaming and profession management are both features will need to be supported, and we may well can work out a framework to allow it for all.\n\nAs I mentioned in your thread, KerbalStats may be the solution, as it provides an API framework and persistence model to work from...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T16:46:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"zilfondel","CreatedById":108254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T19:59:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Rather than costing reputation for hiring, how about costing reputation for \u0022losing\u0022 kerbals, flight faliures, etc?
