Since Ship Manifest essentially deals with Flight operations on a vessel, the Roster Feature always felt like an \u0022afterthought\u0022. It was part of the original Crew Manifest, which I used as a basis for Ship Manifest over a year ago, but now with the way Ship Manifest has evolved, it makes more and more sense to separate and expand on this feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already got a working shell running with the base functionality of the Roster in Ship Manifest as my starting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this plugin will not end up looking like a rehash of that.
