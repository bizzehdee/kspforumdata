The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E as I discover new bugs but here is what I have experienced so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- Saves are very odd. Whenever I make a save and try to load that save, sometimes it starts an old save but if I go back to the Space Center and try to load my save from there, then it will load my correct. And sometimes when I load a save it sends me back to the Space Center, but not in the correct save, but from there again I can load the save again and it will be correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2- Air Controls get corrupted after a 10 minute plus Surface flight. The trim settings no longer function correctly and my left roll no longer works, even when I pick advanced flight. I have to do a complete barrel roll to orientate myself horizontally again. The work around here is to reload the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3- The \u0022B\u0022 button does not work on long space flights after a while. And I have noticed that it happens more often if I heavily use the \u0022B\u0022 button to select modules. The work around is that I have to reload the game at a save point. And even when I do, then on that particular mission the \u0022B\u0022 button not working occurs\u00A0more frequently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4- If I have too many saves then I can no longer save my current progress,\u00A0and also I can not select recover vessel or go back to the space center. Work around here is to delete saves. It happens when I have about 12 saves or more in my inventory load page.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you guys have found something else please post it.
