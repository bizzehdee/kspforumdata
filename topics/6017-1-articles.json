All I know is that this is some kind of transmitted rabies, but nobody can treat it. Something went wrong, and Z1N1 went global. There were those lucky few who were immune to it, and were able to survive a bite. The world fell into anarchy. Governments fell apart, leaving the military as the highest authority. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne year later, 90% of the world\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s population had died. The disease had developed an airborne strain, Z1N2, which appeared in some locations. Infected behavior had become slightly mild: as long as no humans are nearby, they act similar to wolves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe population was separated: there were the civilians, non-immunes who managed to survive the hordes; then there\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s the military, the upper class that were in control. And on the outside, there were the carriers. Those who were immune may have not been infected, but they are still carrying the disease and are considered unsafe to the military. Most carriers formed into nomadic gangs, but some created their own cities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe world has been marked into zones, depending on their safety for non-carriers. Green zones are perfectly quarantined, and owned by the military. Yellow zones are not quarantined, and thus may contain an infected population. Gray zones are like yellow zones, but have significant traces of Z1N2 in the air. Finally, Red zones are overrun with a sizable population of infected. Carriers created cities in gray zones, primarily to deny easy access to them by \u0027prones\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy name is John Tassor, and I am a carrier. I lost everything: my house is in a green zone, along with my wife and child. They are both prones, so they can\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t leave. Currently, I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m living in Yellow Zone #15. At this point, I want answers. I want to know how this happened, and why. A disease does not just appear. I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m going to get to South America, and I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m going to find a way to immunize my family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow. sounds like I\\\u0027m going to be writing a short story.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-26T06:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI vote C by C because we simply don\\\u0027t have the mass interest to create a turn by turn story right now.
