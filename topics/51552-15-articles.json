I\u0027ve had enough time with this version to setup interplanetary satellites already and have probably made most of the mistakes people here have (I.E. un-docking renaming a ship and losing connection etc). Let me know what you\u0027re looking for and I\u0027ll see if I can whip something up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Really enjoy this mod, added a whole lot more factors to exploring space in career mode! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, my science did stop working, but i run several mods and am not sure which caused it. Science looked like it was being performed just fine over a great connection, however going back to mission control science there did not increment. I had to restart the campaign in a new game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobyz28","CreatedById":72108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T03:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jpinard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jpinard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eomg omg omg omg omg...
