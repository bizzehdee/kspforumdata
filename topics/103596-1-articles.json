Use L-SHIFT to go up and the a key to go left. It is also possible to freely orient a Kerbal using the middle mouse button when on EVA (assuming enabled jetpack and zero-g enviroment) but I personally find this fiddly and not helpful most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T10:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T10:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I have learnt to navigate Kerbals from all possible angles, it\u0027s just I\u0027m wondering why pressing space does not work as expected?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T11:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe vertical axis doesn\u0027t change.
