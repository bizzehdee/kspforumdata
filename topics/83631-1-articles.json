The He 162 was a deathtrap, designed to be cheap and easy to fly, but it wasn\u0027t. At this stage of the war, Germany had pretty much lost already. Because they were running short on metal and couldn\u0027t afford rivets or screws, it was mainly made of glued wood that fell apart in flight. It was also highly unstable, so only experienced pilots had any chance of flying it successfully, which teenage boys weren\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, most of them crashed after running out of fuel, losing parts of the airframe, or due to pilot error.
