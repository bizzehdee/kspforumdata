What visual mods are currently confirmed to work in 1.0.2 to do this? I am not having much luck figuring out how to actually install texture replace properly, the instructions somewhat confuse me as to what is required where. I do have CKAN installed at present however.\n\nAny help appreciated!\n\nKerbal007 \n\n![L6lx8M9.png](http://i.imgur.com/L6lx8M9.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:06:12Z","Content":"Ye olde [EVE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-24-7-4-Sep-9-2014-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements) works ok still, though IIRC the \u0027city lights\u0027 bit doesn\u0027t.\n\nAs usual, that\u0027s a \u0022works for me\u0022, it\u0027s officially outdated though so YMMV.\n\nIf you\u0027re feeling adventurous, there\u0027s an [overhaul](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100857-WIP-EVE-%28Environmental-Visual-Enhancements%29-Overhaul) in the works, looks very nice."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:11:46Z","Content":"Thanks Steve ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ll trust the advice of a fellow kiwi ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT: Yeh thats still pretty experimental ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) ill hold off for now\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T01:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal007**"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:13:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ye olde [EVE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-24-7-4-Sep-9-2014-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements) works ok still, though IIRC the \u0027city lights\u0027 bit doesn\u0027t.\n\u003E As usual, that\u0027s a \u0022works for me\u0022, it\u0027s officially outdated though so YMMV.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re feeling adventurous, there\u0027s an [overhaul](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100857-WIP-EVE-%28Environmental-Visual-Enhancements%29-Overhaul) in the works, looks very nice.\n\nEVE with city lights works fine in KSP 1.0.2 for me.\n\nI also really love [Engine Lighting](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121987) and [SmokeScreen](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71630) although those make your rocket flights look better, not Kerbin itself.\n\nIf you fly a lot of planes and want more realistic light scattering, [Scatterer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115408) looks amazing. (It doesn\u0027t transition well to space yet, and I mainly fly rockets.
