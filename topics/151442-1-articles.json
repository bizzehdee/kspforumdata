Then you jettison the fairing -- usually while you are still in the upper part of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, but certainly once you get above 70km. Heatshields are for the hot parts of reentry, wherever you are reentering. As soon as the flames die down to tolerable levels, you jettison the heatshields to begin maneuvering for landing. There is usually little benefit to landing on your heatshield -- you almost always need it to be gone once you are past the landing step\u00A0(and sometimes landing on them makes them explode violently).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically your question does not really sound sensible.
