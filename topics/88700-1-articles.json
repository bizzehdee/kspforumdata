But you\u0027re looking for help, so enough of the backstory stuff. You\u0027re going to need a powerful rocket. There is a magical number to each rocket called \u0022delta-v,\u0022 or, in professional terms, \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. Delta means \u0022change,\u0022 and v stands for \u0022velocity.\u0022 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv is how much your rocket can change its velocity, whether it be done to increase or decrease speed, change inclination, or maybe something else. For low Kerbin orbit, you\u0027ll need at least approximately \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E4500 meters a second\u003C/a\u003E of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. Orbital velocity, or the speed you must acquire to orbit a celestial body, at low Kerbin orbit is a bit over 2 kilometers a second. Big your rocket big. I like to have a large, powerful 25x4 Kerbodyne engine in the middle of a launch stangem with its tanks surrounded by eight of the biggest solid rocket boosters. Works like a charm, and can carry almost anything into orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you may have a rocket capable of achieving orbit, but how exactly do you \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E it into orbit? There are many ways, but they all comprise of one thing: a gravity turn. If you\u0027ve ever seen a real-life rocket launch (which you probably have, whether it be in person or on a video), you\u0027ll notice the spacecraft turns over sideways as it climbs. What\u0027s happening there is that the rocket it trying to get as much horizontal velocity as possible, while maintaining a vertical climb, as well. Vertical velocity is easy to obtain, but horizontal velocity..well...not so much. But you need enough horizontal velocity to keep gravity from pulling you down. So, when do you start this gravity turn? Really, everyone starts at different points. I myself like to wait until my rocket is travelling over 300 meters a second, then I pull the nose down towards the horizon, gradually. Don\u0027t do it too fast, don\u0027t do it too slow, and you\u0027re golden!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are in-game tutorials to help, and really, they are super helpful.

They help, they really do. KSP is not a first person shooter: it is literally simulated rocket science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, getting to space is easy: just go up. Getting to orbit is much harder: in KSP, you spend about equal effort going sideways as you spend going up, whereas in the real world, you spend \u003Ca href=\u0022https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efar, far more effort\u003C/a\u003E going sideways than upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, there are two main characteristics of a rocket stage: delta-V, capacity to change velocity, and thrust-to-weight ratio, which is how much your rockets push divided by their weight. As mentioned, in stock KSP, you need about 4400-4500 m/s of delta-V to reach orbit. Delta-V comes out of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: delta-V = G * Isp * ln(full mass / dry mass). G is Kerbin surface gravity, 9.82 m/s^2, Isp is specific impulse, how efficient the engine is, ln is the natural log function (this is an evil demon who feeds on the tears of KSP players), and the full mass / dry mass essentially means that, the greater the ratio of fuel to other stuff, the farther you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe G * Isp term comes out to equal how fast the exhaust gases are traveling: engines which propel their exhaust out faster get more delta-V out of each kilogram of propellant. The reason we use G * Isp instead of just exhaust velocity is that scientists in different countries got frustrated by constantly converting specific impulse between meters/second and feet/second, divided by Earth\u0027s surface gravity, and got a measure independent of which set of units you were using. The natural log function is one which steeply decays: when the ratio of full/empty mass is close to 1, you get almost linear delta-V increase (going from 5 kg of propellant to 10 would almost double delta-V), but when you start getting big ratios, you see decreasing gains from adding more fuel. More on this later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust-to-weight is crucial during ascent: you need to get to orbital velocity as fast as you can, because the longer you spend screwing around at suborbital velocities, the more delta-V you lose fighting gravity. However, you also have to account for two things: atmospheric drag and engine mass. Atmospheric drag increases with velocity and decreases with altitude. As it turns out, for the vertical part of your ascent, the ideal speed is terminal velocity, where the force of gravity exactly equals the force of atmospheric drag: have less TWR, and you waste fuel fighting gravity, have more TWR, and you waste fuel fighting atmospheric drag. You also have to account for the mass of the engines: in the rocket equation, the rocket engines are dead mass. As such, it favors having lighter weight engines, even at the cost of TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it usually shakes out is that you want your launch to be a little bit short of 2.0 TWR, throttle your engines to maintain terminal velocity (which will go up as atmosphere gets thinner), and then have progressively less TWR as you go up stages and have less need for thrust: once you\u0027re most of the way to orbit, you can coast on any remaining upwards velocity, and the fact that your suborbital horizontal velocity will reduce the effective amount of gravity that you feel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing I\u0027m going to say (this is going on rather long) is a bit on staging. You know that ln(full / empty mass) term? There is a theoretical limit, which is determined by the mass of a full fuel tank divided by its empty mass: in stock KSP, that ratio is 9:1 for the most efficient fuel tanks (KSP fuel tanks are much heavier than real-world counterparts). The solution to this is staging: dumping off empty fuel tanks and thus resetting the rocket equation. This usually means dumping off engines as well: this is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because engines are dead weight, and you do not need as much engine mass for your next, lighter-weight stage, and it is a curse because now you\u0027ve got to add new rockets for your next stage. There are funny schemes like asparagus staging and onion staging which play with this a bit, but for now, simple staging should suffice for your first rocket. There are vertical decouplers like the TR-18A which dump off stuff below, and radial decouplers like the TT-38K which let you dump off engines attached to the side of that part. Both are useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, throw out the advice I gave you regarding launch TWR if you ever install FAR or NEAR, two mods which make aerodynamic drag much more realistic. In stock KSP, drag is proportional to the mass of a part, which is a stupid approximation which lets you get away with stupid launch profiles: its sole advantages are A: it\u0027s simple and forgiving for new players, and B: it exists.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T03:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch this video playlist by Scott Manley it is very helpful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEm5nyZU3a-O2ak6mBYXWPAL\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T04:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roflcopterkklol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roflcopterkklol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWatch this video playlist by Scott Manley it is very helpful. \u003Cp\u003E*snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s something more up-to-date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/puC-YV_h9Us?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I recommend \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-25-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-3-2-10-21-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/a\u003E even for new players.
