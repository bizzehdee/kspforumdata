Space station above Duna, with a lander and suitable kerbal storage, essentially to enable me to hop to and from the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain segment and power array went up well, have a few fuel tanks and a big monopropellant tank up there for supplies. Was a little hairy, because I always come in at the wrong inclination, so I have to transition from a polar orbit to equatorial. Did some mid altitude aerobraking, my first attempts at that, and got it done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, time to get the lander in. Using the stock super heavy lander, I stuck a rocket on the bottom and tried to get it there. Sadly, I didn\u0027t have quite enough juice to get the lander into orbit- my launch stages got it to the right trajectory, but I had to slow down with landing fuel. Got hooked around, polar again, did a little too deep of an aerobrake. Ran out of gas, had to burn RCS to stay in orbit for the next pass, and burned about 500 units all told to RCS myself from the polar orbit to equitorial over about 6 passes of 3-4 min burns. Satisfied with the stable orbit, I built a rescue vessel. An atomic powered tanker with a long probe, the craft is easy to fly and should be easy to dock. Came in perfectly inclined, perfect launch, lined up to dock with the stranded lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put the lander in a retrograde orbit. Rescue vessel is prograde. I have no idea what to do with my rescue vessel now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI missed you KSP\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-03T04:49:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2013 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thiosk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T05:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha. Well, since it is nuclear-powered, it might have the 2000m/s or so dV required to go from retrograde to prograde.

My initial plan was to sop up all the forward velocity in an aerobrake, and keep just enough altitude to get retrograde before crashing. Instead, I went out to ~ike\u0027s orbit, and only had to do about 300 m\\s total change to get an intercept on the first return orbit. Snatched the lander, and still had enough juice to get prograde. Going to swing back in about 12 clicks from the station. Considering dumping all the fuel I can onto the lander, detaching, and try to deorbit the now-empty rescue vessel using RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try just catching the station with the docked pair... I\u0027d like to save the rescue vessel, but I really doubt I have the gas for it. I\u0027m quite low on gas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
