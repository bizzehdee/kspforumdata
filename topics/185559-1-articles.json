I dont know really.\u00A0 Lunar module ascent stage of the fasa part pack launches upward and the engine ignites and then it hangs. It accelerates extremely slow .. like .01km/h fuel runs out about 6 feet from the decent stage. I would have thought... oh the engine is too weak or the module too heavy but no. After burnout\u00A0 the thing just hangs above the surface of the mun. Does not fall back. Going eva ....\u00A0 the kerbals just fall out as one might expect at the regular rate for the mun\u0027s gravity.\u00A0 You can then use the suit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 to jet back up to it.
