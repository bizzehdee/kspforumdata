On my Shuttle like spacecraft, the radial decoupler heats up, and it explodes. First I thought it\u0027s because of the heat of the engines, but I put on a lot of radiators next to it, but it also explodes. And it also heating up after I shut down the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzNKKmq_O3uSfi1lV2sybkdnUzJRaXlCTk0wZ3VhSGR3VVFFbG1WYmJ5elg0bnR2N3hESGM\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzNKKmq_O3uSfi1lV2sybkdnUzJRaXlCTk0wZ3VhSGR3VVFFbG1WYmJ5elg0bnR2N3hESGM\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you your answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1vid\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:14:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat type of engines are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Begga","CreatedById":151137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T23:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei had the same problem. i took another radial decoupler ( i think if we had the same problem we also had the same type of radial decoupler) and than it doesnt happen anymore. nearly got mad before and i dont know whats the problem but this works with me\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
