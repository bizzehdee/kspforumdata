The advantage is that the projectile is going its max speed when it leaves the ship, so you can get really close and don\u0027t have to worry about missing the target. Unfortunately they\u0027re usually heavy and big, plus you have to deal with recoil from the engines. I think Spartwo has one, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
