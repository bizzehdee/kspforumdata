Your rocket is so powerful it sets fire to the launch pad. Your rocket, however, sets there and gets all warm and toasty in the fire before launching to the Mun. This should not happen, of course. The rocket should fail if it is engulfed in flames. At the very least, it should cause some sort of failure down the road. Could there be a way to implement this into the game? \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*][B]Water systems\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B]When your rocket ultimately cooks and falls to the ground you have a raging fire on your hands. \u0022What will I ever do?\u0022 you might thing. But before you can finish that thought the fire puts itself out. \u0022Well that was a little silly.\u0022 Yes, yes it was. Could there be a system to spray water on the fire when the launch pad catches on fire? Could it be toggled? Could it be a part? \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. [B]Big ol\u0026#39; pile of ash[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, when all that water puts out the raging fire your rocket caused, you sit there with a burnt down launchpad. No matter how big your rocket is, the debris is the same amount. Could there be a system where if your rocket is a certain mass, if will make more ash appear?[B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=2]Yes, the 3rd point isn\u0026#39;t formatted properly.
