I simply patched in the ability to store one unit of ore. Now I\u0027m thinking this might be helpful for other players as well, some of which have absolutely no idea where to start, so I\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll release this as a tiny mod to save them the trouble. This leads me to the question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this allready a thing that exists? And if yes, is it a stand-alone feature or simply part of a larger plugin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless it allready exists as a stand-alone mod, I\u0027ll go ahead and upload it to SpaceDock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
