As a former mod builder for SimCity 4, let me throw my two cents here since I\u0027m not a mod builder for KSP yet...\n\nThere are several things that must be considered right now and here\u0027s a list of things y\u0027all (yeah, I said y\u0027all) begin jumping up and down about your favorite mod not working. Each mod builder is different, but much of this list comes from my experiences, albeit on another gaming platform:\n\n- Knowing that another update will be out in a couple of months (I have read that January is now the speculative month), is it worth spending XX.XX hours to make the mod compatible with the current version of the game just to spend YY.YY hours to make it compatible with the next version?\n- Is the new platform the game is being migrated to (Unity 5) going to make this mod obsolete or totally incompatible?\n- How much time will it take to redo this mod and can I honestly commit that much time in light of my other obligations? (Relates to the first question)\n- What are the new tweaks going to affect the programming of the mod? Will I have to learn a new language, a new methodology, or other knowledge to make the mod work?\n- Does the mod I am attempting to make compatible replace a stock part and is it actually worth it?\n\nI know that a lot goes into mod building, but please be patient. Your mod builder will make the appropriate tweaks when they are able!\n\n**(note: I accidentally posted this before I had completed my entry. Darned fat fingers!)**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T22:08:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacePod9","CreatedById":151177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T22:34:41Z","Content":"How do I get this thing on the Mun?\n\n(BTW dont know how to use Hyperedit Ship Lander)"},{"CreatedByName":"I.O.M.","CreatedById":88342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T22:41:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How do I get this thing on the Mun?\n\u003E (BTW dont know how to use Hyperedit Ship Lander)\n\nFiguring that out is half the fun. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T23:33:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just stopped by to say this.\n\u003E **This is my new favorite mod.

But you will not be able to build new ones with it. The new landing gear looks like this (not finished yet):\n\n![zBmVbns.png](http://i.imgur.com/zBmVbns.png)\n\nIt can be attached to the \u0022normal\u0022 landing legs and can also be jettisoned when no longer needed.\n\nAlso the ground clearance is way better for moving around.\n\nThe cargo-bay is in process ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).
