When I load the game (whether modded/unmodded, even a clean install) my pc stats appear in the upper left hand corner. I hadnt played KSP for a while before 1.0 and when it came out last week I loaded it and it has the pc stats. After a few ALT-F4s, it disappeared. I played all week without the pc stats, then today after the update the pc stats have reappeared and will not go away this time. I did a complete clean install of the game and its always appears. It event appears in the launcher. I\u0027ve checked the graphics card [GTX 760] setting and it has nothing to say about this. Have checked steam setting and it only shows a FPS counter, not the full pc setting i\u0027m getting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the only game I play in which this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NGHVfFR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NGHVfFR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dg0ss0H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dg0ss0H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T08:07:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded image of launcher with pc stats\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eddy514","CreatedById":99142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESOLVED: NZXT\u0027s CAM software was making this appear.
