What I do for sun viewing is use the telescope like a projector. If you point the telescope at the sun and the eye piece at a large flat white surface (preferrably in the shade), it will project a huge image of the sun. My favorite method is to put a portable movie screen in a garage then set the telescope just outside projecting into the garage and onto the screen.\n\nI\\\u0027ve been able to study a 4\\\u0027 wide live image of the sun in great detail. You can see sunspots really well. It\\\u0027s great for eclipses too. And the best part of this method is that a large number of people can see it at the same time without having to take turns at the eyepiece.\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:27:37Z","Content":"I just realized how idiotic that post made me seem...
