Wikipedia explains it pretty well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA gravity turn or zero-lift turn is a maneuver used in launching a spacecraft into, or descending from, an orbit around a celestial body such as a planet or a moon. It is a trajectory optimization that uses gravity to steer the vehicle onto its desired trajectory. It offers two main advantages over a trajectory controlled solely through vehicle\u0027s own thrust. Firstly, the thrust doesn\u0027t need to be used to change the ship\u0027s direction so more of it can be used to accelerate the vehicle into orbit. Secondly, and more importantly, during the initial ascent phase the vehicle can maintain low or even zero angle of attack. This minimizes transverse aerodynamic stress on the launch vehicle, allowing for a lighter launch vehicle.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T03:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the Oberth effect, I would suspect that the most efficient way would be to do a normal ascent profile and just keep burning prograde horizontal near the fringe of the atmo until you reach the desired apo, then raise the peri to match. So, \u0027no, don\u0027t circularize\u0027 (though at some point in the transfer it will become roughly circular). Though it is possible that a bi-eliptic transfer *could* be more efficient than the standard Hohmann, depending on the final altitude. If I recall correctly, that is useful if you\u0027re changing your orbital radius by more than a factor of ~13, but you\u0027d need to read up on that more thoroughly (though the savings are small at best and prob not worth the extra effort).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T03:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are precisely three quantites you should be aware of for every maneuver. Energy, angular momentum, and delta-V resource of your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, lets look at a simpler case. Suppose your ship is in parking orbit at 70km. Is it cheaper to go directly to a 500km operational orbit, or to make a stop at a 200km intermediate orbit? In terms of energy and angular momentum chnage, the two maneuvers are equivalent. So which one requires greater delta-V? Turns out, the answer is very simple. A reaction engine, such as conventional chemical rocket, is more efficient at higher speeds. If your rocket went from velocity V to V \u002B dV, then the energy went from MV\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/2 to M(V\u002BdV)\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/2. So dE = M(dV\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u002B 2V dV)/2. The higher your velocity, the more energy you get from the same burn. So if you want to go from a 70km orbit to a 500km orbit, you want to get as much of the needed energy as possible when you are moving the fastest, which is at your lowest point. In other words, direct transfer to 500km is your best choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, suppose you are taking off from the planet\u0027s surface. What is your priority? Well, if it wasn\u0027t for atmosphere, your best ascent would be equivalent to circularizing at minimum safe altitude and transfering from there to your operating orbit. However, you are operating in the atmosphere. That means you have to start with ascent, transition to gravity turn, and then either park at 70km or burn directly to operating orbit at 500km. It turns out that at altitudes of about 50km the atmosphere is thin enough that you are not saving much by operating bellow orbital speeds. Obviously, you can\u0027t have a stable orbit there, but if you burn directly to 500km, it works as if you have circularized at 50km and then transfered to 500km. In other words, you get a bit more dE out of direct transfer to operating orbit over parking at 70km first. This \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t much\u003C/em\u003E. Difference between 50km and 70km is pretty small, in terms of energy gain. So if it\u0027s a matter of convenience, parking at 70-80km is not a bad option. But if you do wish for the most fuel-optimal way to reach the operating orbit at 500km, you do go for direct ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I mentioned that there is also the angular momentum to watch. While you get most delta-E for your delta-V at the lowest point, you get most delta-L for delta-V at the \u003Cem\u003Ehighest\u003C/em\u003E point. This is why you want to circularize all in one go at the apoapsis, and not start early or make adjustments mid-transfer. Obviously, if you have to make corrections to catch up with your target, or whatever, you have to make corrections. But that will always cost you extra delta-V. Hence the optimal transfer between two circular orbits is a Hohmann Transfer. The low burn optimizes delta-E, the high burn optimizes delta-L, and the combination gives you the least delta-V needed for transfer. Understanding of these simple rules behind it will help you design more fuel-efficient maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-06T03:41:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2013 03:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T03:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParking orbits to give you a huge breathing room for the final burn (in which in my case, a geostationary orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmkIqQI_7sA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, if you will fly the rocket in a way that you won\u0027t cut the engines off at any point during the ascent (just throttling down to the lowest possible without losing speed).
