For exemple VTOL vehicles :\n\n[![mini_6682222015052800011.jpg](http://img11.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_6682222015052800011.jpg)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=6682222015052800011.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:41:11Z","Content":"The workaround I use for this is to place a small docking port or probe core in the other orientation and control from there. Not much help for IVA, though, that is locked to the pod\u0027s orientation."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:55:33Z","Content":"However, it would be nice to be able to IVA without immediately controlling from the capsule in question. For example, IVA VTOL landings using MJ, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T10:40:30Z","Content":"you should be able to change orientation of the navball, or recalibrate it or reverse axis-directions simply with a key or a right-click action imo. i often have the problem that probes are upside-down, while the capsule is fine. so if i build a rocket with a capsule and a satellite attached to it, it often happens that the satellites orientation is reversed, which is quite annoying, because i have to mark the ships or remember them being upside-down in axis-directions."},{"CreatedByName":"NonWonderDog","CreatedById":10479,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T00:43:04Z","Content":"You don\u0027t even need to be doing something odd to have the problem come up. The control axis of the landers is upwards, which works fine until you go to \u0022yaw\u0022 (roll on its axis) from IVA and find that the rudder is reversed. Almost every time I try to do an IVA landing in one I end up crashing because at some point I forget that my twist-stick is backwards and I panic.\n\nControl directions need to be more configurable in general. Not just the navball direction, but which axis counts as roll or yaw and in which direction. Changing the lander control axis to forwards would solve the IVA controls issue, but then the navball wouldn\u0027t be very useful as a landing aid.\n\nThe Plane Mode mod helps a lot with aircraft (it swaps roll and yaw for anything built in the spaceplane hangar), but it only solves a narrow range of problems."}]}
