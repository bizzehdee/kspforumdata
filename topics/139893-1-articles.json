For example, the Jool 5 challenge seriously limits the amount of mods that I\u0027m able to use, so I have to remove most of the mod folder in order to play in that save, and then replace all of those mods when playing in a more heavily-modded save. I also have several installs in which I use different planet packs, and I have to change which planets are installed in which save. It all becomes quite a pain, and I\u0027m sure most other players who use mods have similar troubles.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EAnyway, the point of this thread is to question the possibility of a mod that allows each save to have an independent folder for addons, and to request that someone make such an addon if they are able to. I would do it myself (or rule out the possibility if it\u0027s not doable given the way the game is coded) but I have next to no knowledge about coding, so all I can do is make the suggestion.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T00:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn easy way to do this is to have separate installs for each config - assuming you have enough disk space. Looking at my stock install it looks like about 4GB each without the GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
