I invite you to try.\n\u003E \n\nFirst, my hate began in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI and remains in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI (and spaceplane GUI as well, but I don\u0027t make many of them).  When HarvestR announced that he was fixing the GUI, I had great hopes.  Alas, he \u0022only\u0022 worked on the in-space GUI (which \\*is\\* vastly improved), but didn\u0027t get to the issues that makes it a crap shoot between building your rocket and tearing it apart.\n\nI think a lot of the issues people are now whining about came from people pushing unity 5.3 (well, unity is shipping 5.3, not sure which KSP uses), expecting all the lag to magically disappear.  Oddly enough, a lot \\*did\\* disappear (and the game can even be played on 8 1.2GHz bobcat CPUs (i.e. PS4/XB1), don\u0027t even think about it with KSP \u003C1.1) which was a lot more than I was hoping for (and I run on an \u00228 core\u0022 AMD job.  Not exactly a single thread beast).  I\u0027m willing to believe that all these new bugs can be directly traceable to either the changes in unity itself or the changes made in the code to adapt to changes in unity.  KSP just wasn\u0027t ready.  Note: I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve even noticed crashing in 1.1.  I think I\u0027d prefer crashing to what I\u0027ve run into: saves that turn into insta-destruction (that were fine in the playthrough while saving), mysterious phantom torques that prevent docking, complete removal of critical bits of spacecraft (typically involving the command chair.  Don\u0027t save in vehicles with a kerbal in the command chair), failure to display one of the spacecraft while docking (I think it was the one I was piloting.  If I could see the intercept (and the time/distance) I could dock, but I can\u0027t recommend the procedure).  I think those last two may have been leftover from 1.0.x)\n\nThe other issues that get me are career mode.  KSP is basically a sandbox game with a career mode tacked on.  It feels natural it should have a career mode, but every change to sandbox throws huge wrenches into career, and career isn\u0027t all that good to begin with.  I suspect that HarvesterR left because he got the sandbox to as far as his wildest vision could see (well, at least what he knew he and Squad could code) and knew he had to leave career for another.  Unfortunately for his replacement, sandbox was never really designed with career in mind, so trying to shoehorn such a thing will be tough (although I assume this is common for \u0022single player mode\u0022 in fps shooters).  I\u0027d suggest digging deep into the KSP community \u0022campaigns\u0022 of old (disclosure, I started with them and found them ideal for learning KSP).  Career mode forces you into artificially limiting\\* situations, while if you can\u0027t be bothered with a campaign\u0027s \u0022nuke the koviets\u0022 (some sort of probe to hit another continent), there was nothing stopping you from going straight to the Mun (or better yet, Minmus.  Career shouldn\u0027t be so insistent on Mun first).\n\nSummary:\n\nI have a burning hate for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI and suspect that it will remain for as long as I play KSP.\n\nUnity and working around unity should eventually remove a lot of bugs.\n\nCareer mode should get better, but don\u0027t hold out for any \u0022quick fixes\u0022.  I suspect that at some point they will have to declare sandbox \u0022done\u0022 to really make career work.  And most of sandboxes issues now appear to be bugs, not lack of features."},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-28T18:00:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, wumpus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Career mode should get better, but don\u0027t hold out for any \u0022quick fixes\u0022.

It take like 20 sec to gather the research and plant the flag before I lift off and return home.  \n\n     I do however like the mission system now give you missions to go somewhere to example scan at location a-b-c but it still just feel like my journey wasent of much purpose. So much work to get there, so little to do.  \n\n     I like we now can mine ore and make fuel, that give a little more purpose of getting there.. However it take a very long time in career mode to unlock this things.  \n\n2): The research tree. I think it would be better if the solar panel and small engine was avaliable from the start so people more easy could create a ship that could go into orbit ( especially for new players ).  \n\nAlso getting the large flat docking port should be avaliable more early in the game, as well as some better wheels for peoples airplanes. Lets face it the \u0022cesna\u0022 airplane wheels are terrible.\n\n3). I think the kerbal universe should be different everytime we start a new career game. Move the planets in random formations, and give them random physics...   \n\n( however the mum and maybe minmus should always be the mum so new players can go somewhere. Maybe the best would be if the mum has minmus physics so people much more easy can get a good start and impression of the game ).  \n\n4): I kind of feel like the mission system is bugged... When i start a new game I always get allot of \u0022non interesting\u0022 contracts that i cannot cancel since it cost me money.  And also why do I not get a chance to extend or even build a space station above kerbin.. I always get more contracts about building base on the mum/minmus ect. again and again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-31T10:44:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2016 10:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Peder**"}]}
