Personally I am using a web site to plan my interplanetary travels and I\u00A0 think it would be great to do this directly in the game, from the Kerbal Space Center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T17:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I actually think this would be a huge help. We\u0027re given all these great tools to check COM and COL \u00A0and drag to make planes work but then when we have to go to other planets we\u0027re kind of left hanging in the dark.\u00A0There are a few ways to do this. It could be as simple as making a simple\u00A0in-game estimator in which you could select start and target location and it would let you set an alarm for the next\u00A0launch window and tell you\u00A0how much dV and time it will take to get there.\u00A0There could also be a more rigorous tool in which you set preplanned maneuvers and could scroll forward in time to find the best window manually. They each have their advantages. A basic drop-down\u00A0estimator would be much simpler to use and program, but wouldn\u0027t be as good at letting players know about trade-offs between shorter mission times vs optimum dV. The visual orbit-based pre-planner would give players a more intuitive sense of what\u0027s happening and might be more educational, but might leave us where we are now, spending silly amounts time fiddling with nodes and time warp without giving us a clear idea of what we\u0027re looking for or whether we are close to an optimized solution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T19:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162580-maxboost/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162580\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162580-maxboost/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@maxboost\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Firstly, \u00A0hi and welcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes\u00A0I agree, there are quite a few design and planning aids that are currently only available as mods that many of us think should be stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that Squad will get around to including\u00A0such things at some point, but apart from the fact that there are probably more urgent things to deal with at the moment, I think they also want\u00A0to take the time to \u0027get them right\u0027 and blend\u00A0them into the game more seamlessly than can be done with mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"todofwar","CreatedById":160465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T02:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222536860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137845\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461525954\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130621\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pandaman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, pandaman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162580-maxboost/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162580\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162580-maxboost/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@maxboost\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Firstly, \u00A0hi and welcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes\u00A0I agree, there are quite a few design and planning aids that are currently only available as mods that many of us think should be stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that Squad will get around to including\u00A0such things at some point, but apart from the fact that there are probably more urgent things to deal with at the moment, I think they also want\u00A0to take the time to \u0027get them right\u0027 and blend\u00A0them into the game more seamlessly than can be done with mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would disagree on this one.
