It\u0027s not multiple materials so much as mucked up UVs. And it\u0027s not clear in Blender how to remove a UV properly. If you select the mesh, and in the properties tabs, select the \u0022Object\u0022 properties (the one that\u0027s a triangle with solid vertices), there\u0027s a list of UV maps there. Remove them all with the minus button and then re-unwrap for the whole mesh at once."}]}
