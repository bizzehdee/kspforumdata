Also, if SAS is on it actually exacerbates the wobble instead of making things better. Try putting a large probe core lower in the stack and control the rocket from there. Also, try not to use SAS on huge payloads (you can hold F to toggle the SAS for a few seconds if you need it). What happens is your SAS is reacting late because it is trying to damp motion where you\u0027re controlling the craft, but the engines are generating most of the torque. If the craft is not stiff enough, SAS control inputs are out of phase with the motion of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T01:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are various add-ons that provide aerodynamic payload fairings for rockets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-0-23-5-Procedural-Fairings-3-05-upgrades-visible-in-tech-tree-bug-fix-%28June-17%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037-0-23-KW-Rocketry-v2-5-6B-Avaliable-working-3m-Docking!-31-12-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/3870-0-23-5-ARM-NovaPunch-2-05-June-15th-New-Odin-OTV-Updated-Freyja-More-Tweaks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENovaPunch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just looking at the picture you\u0027ve posted, whilst I\u0027m tempted to use the \u0022more struts\u0022 adage, I\u0027d also advise dividing your payload up further into smaller, dockable subassemblies - the taller and more ungainly a payload is, the more likely it is to flop about even with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T01:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.

Are you saying I could omit the decoupler from the station part and that the strut will decouple itself without one? Sorry I dont quite understand what you mean.\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EBasically yes. This arrangement will work fine, the struts will vanish when the cupola is decoupled from the engine.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oiQYGz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2925/14641785441_e64b47de88_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214641785441_e64b47de88_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T17:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lukaszenko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lukaszenko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe fairings from Procedural Fairings can also be structural, which is relevant to OPs problem. The key is to put a second fairing base on top of the payload, facing down. The payload is then stiffly braced from top and bottom and all problems are solved...at least until the fairings are jettisoned \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.
