The module is called HangarPartResizer, it also uses KSPAPIExtensions to bind allowed dimensions to the tech tree. I\u0027m willing to make a mod with procedural wrap around radial tanks and looking for a programmer who would extract, rename and recompile the module. License for the mod is CC 4.0\n\nThe reason I need to extract it is because the mod has UI and many other tools that get in the way if I use the unchanged .dll library.\n\nI tried asking Allista to do this, but he seems very busy.\n\nGithub source: [https://github.com/allista/hangar/tree/master/Source](https://github.com/allista/hangar/tree/master/Source)\n\nModule in question is contained inside the [HangarPartResizer.cs](https://github.com/allista/hangar/blob/master/Source/HangarPartResizer.cs)\n\nThe part I\u0027m going apply this plugin to is a wrap-around fuel tank, which will have a model and textures adapted for stretching:\n\n![mt0W7VF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mt0W7VF.jpg)\n\n![ogu3BDG.png](http://i.imgur.com/ogu3BDG.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T19:28:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:07:48Z","Content":"Interesting, so it would allow you to drop a large part of empty fuel tanks, but keep the spine which means you can continue with the same rocket engine without the empty tanks, thereby minimize dead mass.

But I\u0027m looking to make these wraparound fuel tanks procedural. Extra parts like \u0022saddle tank\u0022 truss and fuel hangar are still parts that add extra weight. We\u0027re min-maxing output here. I think wrap around tanks have a very neat shape both for lifters and for interplanetary transfer stages. They have a fairing friendly shape, which was the main problem if I wanted to have jetisonnable tanks on my probes, cause every fuel tank out there is round. Extra inline stages add an extra engine weight and increase the length of the spacecraft. Still trying to find somebody who would extract that part resizing MODULE described in the OP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T13:11:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T22:53:02Z","Content":"Anyone out there who can help?"}]}
