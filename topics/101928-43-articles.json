Simply put, they don\u0027t fit. Yes, they technically don\u0027t stick out of the fuselage, but their corners do clip into it in a way the old KAS containers did not when everything\u0027s packed away. The way I\u0027m placing them in the Mk2 payload bay is side by side with their bases attached to either end of a centrally-running \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/M-Beam_650_I-Beam\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eflat structural beam\u003C/a\u003E. In this way they end up poking through the fuselage. \u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible or in line with your plans to change the shape of the current container, but the solution there would be to taper the top sides just \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E in a similar way to the old KAS containers. If you also created some alternate mounting brackets especially for payload bays, and specificially for Mk2 and those new inline cylindrical storage bays, I would love you even more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, they\u0027re both clipping through the fuselage and leaving a bunch of space in between each container. A custom mounting bracket for the Mk2 fuselage that keeps them neatly arranged and minimizes dead space would be wonderful here, though only in addition to a small change in container shape, or possibly a small size reduction to keep them from clipping the walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534020142368556071/58E2F55896757D72578014234FAC2D5D165EC8C8/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534020142368556071/58E2F55896757D72578014234FAC2D5D165EC8C8/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe situation with the cylindrical storage bay is quite a bit better, with four containers fitting quite comfortably wihtout any clipping thanks to the cut corners. Though it\u0027s still a little fiddly building mounting brackets in there - I had to use offset magic to get them fitting like that. I think for those, we might get away with using the same hypothetical Mk2 payload bay double-sided mounting bracket and sticking it to the ceiling or floor of the storage bay, attached radially as pictured here.
