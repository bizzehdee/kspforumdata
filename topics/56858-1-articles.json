Recovering the SSTO, of course, defeats the purpose of having it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I can see this working is if I do some weird docking stuff with the body of my SSTO with a capsule then undock the two once landed and recover only the capsule...

So you could get the data out of the SSTO, recover the Kerbal, then send another Kerbal (or the same one again) using a capsule and perhaps a vehicle on the launch pad. But, yeah, what you suggest wouldn\u0027t be a bad feature. Then again, are you refueling your SSTO on the surface?
