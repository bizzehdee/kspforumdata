My 2m drives always break in 2 seconds, but somehow my 1m drives are reliable as hell. Just can\u0027t break them even if I try. Try getting a drive with LESS acceleration for precision maneuvers, put on a crapload of RCS, and get both RasterPropMonitor and KSI MFD for better control. They give you LCDs in the cockpit with flight info. I personally use them on K-Drive ships to check my orbit because you can\u0027t toggle the drive in map view.
