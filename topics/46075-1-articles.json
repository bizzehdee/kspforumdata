I have two spotlights, intended to light the open docking ports, but instead lighting the docking ports to which I added the hab modules. I need to somehow edit the spotlights positions 90 degrees around the large orange fuel tank they\u0027re attached to, to put them in the right spot. Right now, if you were to look at the end of the tank, the lights are positioned at N and S.
