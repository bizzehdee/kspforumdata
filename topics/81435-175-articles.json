Preliminary tests give it VASTLY improved protection vs ibeams and other crap, and while it is more vulnurable to heavy weapons (i used some part clipping, had no choice, but that is killing me now that i can 1 shot my ship every once in a while with the Tripedo-M, a weapon that was very unreliabe vs the older SK-CRV-Ig6/Sk-CRV-IA1 that i developed just before 1.0.5 hit. Really the other benefit is that it has ~4 tons less dry mass, which ive used to add more fuel tanks to help with the subpar range problem most of my vessels seem to have. Ohh, and with less parts, i can actually afford frivolities such as vernor RCS system, extra docking ports, cockpits that dont suck, antenas, and well, more ammo in general. Im gonna make a anti-fighter version of this one like i had of the SK-CRV-Ig3, g4, and g5 models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Ec9ByXU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ec9ByXU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i can find a solution to dealing with more powerful ordinance, the SK-CRV-A1 will become the first 1.0.5 competitive AKS warship! And it looks even cooler then old versions, and ditched the useless railguns for 6 nose mounted drones that shoot out of the slot in the nose (which actually protects the ship too). Ohh, and given the crazy amount of internal space, i could (not that i ever would cause part count\u002Blagfest) technically arm it with 4 1.25m weapons, and an astounding 16 internal and 8 forward mounted drones.

I suggest you to use the original parts as the core of your ship, by that I mean parts that were there since the beginning of the development of the game, why? because I bet that the physics and computations involved with them has not been changed compared to the other newly added parts. That way you will have a reliable base hull or sturdy core. I suggest you use the new parts outside and away from the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion. Always build crafts that will last even if the game will have updates. So do not use new parts excessively. So when your crafts you can easily update them (or even rebuild them from scratch but still the same form) but with reliability (Just like we all rely on the Structural beam as cores for most of our ships, do you get what I mean?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at my BASIL, I used all the parts that could be probably used as armor. Using fuel tanks as padding inside and sandwiched between armor plates/wing plates is a \u0022timeless design\u0022. I treat everything as an expendable part, I don\u0027t consider fuel tanks as things you need to protect (I can see you are still stuck with this idea in your ships, trust me I was there. You desperately still try to protect vulnerable parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, \u0022treat every part as expendable\u0022 the only thing you need to protect is the engines itself and the core nothing more (unless you have multiple engines that could still function when hit). The rest is secondary and disposable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering you tested my BASIL with flame weapons (Which is an old weapon actually) I only need to update it by protecting it using the new parts such as the heat shields and covering the engines (I admit, I kind of designed it lacking protection on the engines so that\u0027s my fault)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse a hull configuration that is simple and basic, anything that has three or more core parts (Like three (3) girders is dangerous, two (2) is safe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis considerably eliminates the \u0027Kraken Wobble Bug\u0022. My Atlantis and Aurora is very susceptible to this but I learned later on. This concepts though limits the ship you are about to build to certain sizes cause if you try to build anything bigger it gets weaker. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI build the core of my ships using one (1) part as core, yes that\u0027s right one (1) this is the only part that when destroyed will kill my ship at once (That\u0027s why it can still be one shotted) but I try to protect and pad that dreaded part with as many things as I can. So you can\u0027t really cut my ship in two, either that or it\u0027s completely dead. Since zekes made a new powerful piercing weapon I need to rethink my designing pattern. So basically competition is bringing this game forward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my ships survivability will rely on how accurate and how deep a piercing capability of the weapon used against it will be. By the way I use a single plate armor as my core part then build from there in a torus fashion (If you get what I mean). I think the Drek also used only two Girders only as core nothing more so it\u0027s strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my design paradigm, I got into this game when part count was not an issue for me. That\u0027s why I have high part count ships. It\u0027s not about who has more on the field or stronger ships (You try to design low part count ships but in battle we actually mostly field a max of 3 vs 3 ships), It\u0027s about having reliable ships then develop from there. I guess I could say that the Drek as a \u0022reliable\u0022 ship, I think that\u0027s the secret of it\u0027s success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of us create designs trying to innovate but I guess we are pretty much limited with the starting parts. Unless that\u0027s changed our game will still be the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me a 2-3 months to stay away from KSP, its a very long break then it hit me. So consider this advice a gold mine. Ahh I have come a long way since the beginning, I can\u0027t even believe I used fuel tanks as core of my earliest ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderTeaH","CreatedById":111209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T14:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe vector engines are insane!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k2BETQQ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/k2BETQQ.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh damn, that thing\u0027s pretty!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T16:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is most defenetely against the geneva convention, its even worse then taking a kerbal and firing thrusters at it from every angle until it slowly roasts alive.\u003Cp\u003EGood thing AKS, being sentient AI is immune to torture tactics.

Most of the weapons ive developed are in one of 3 categories, either super simple/lightweight but rather weak (useless against any armor), a bit heavy and highish on part count, but fairly powerful, or somewhat in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since missiles dont takje excessive time to design, ill even be happy to make a missile based on specs you give me (provided something i have atm doesnt fit into them). Just give me roughly what sort of vessels you intend to use it against (are these wings and weak armor, or something say based on the 50m/s impact mk2/mk3 parts?), how heavy roughly it should be (note that you cant make something ultra light be deadly vs armor), and if you have a preference as to maximum part count per missile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, in other news, progress on the SK-CRV-A2 is going well, after teh A1 was deemed a failure of epic proportions. The A2 hull is essentially the same as the old SK-CRV-IA1/g6, except the girders have been replaced with ibeams, and the entire engine assembly has been redesigned to prevent the rear from getting shot off. Preliminary testing shows it to be IMPOSSIBLE to 1 shot kill with a popper-H, although the same was teh case for the old A1 failure, so im not getting my hopes up until i actually have it armed and fully fueled (since weapons and fuel add weaknesses overall).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve also managed to narrow down the reason for why the 6th generation\u0027s rear was occasionally able to be 1 shot vaporized: Clipping a nuke into the core girder is just a BAD idea period! The A2 goes up in parts (from 130 of the A1 to ~180 atm), but it has relatively good protection against the 3 weapons i use as a standard test, the long ibeam and 4 sepatrons, the RT-5 with 2 1x1 panels in front, and the popper-H. Like every ship, i have managed to neutralize it with excessive fire, but im currently unable to 1 shot it with anything i tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a small tip that may help those making armor, is to AVOID using the offset gizmo much. Since the force when something is hit is applied at the point of original contact regardless of where you moved said part afterwards, moving parts faryer away INCREASES bending moments, and thus makes it easier to destroy something. The offset gizmo is a great new addition, but you need to use it moderation with armor design, and if you must use it, only move the part a little bit, not like attach it at one end and move it across the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the one rule that i keep violating in terms of armor still stands, ANY CLIPPING WHATSOEVER IS BAD! Sometimes you dont have a choice, but clipping does one and only one thing in a military craft, and thats create weakspots which can lead to being shot in half reliably with anything including weaker weapons. The most critical thing is to NEVER clip fuel tanks or engines into the skeleton, but near every instance of clipping is VERY BAD!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T20:58:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T20:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharkman Briton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharkman Briton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHas anyone got any good 0.625m missiles (liquid-fuelled please) I can use for a carrier?
