Myself, I just do a low altitude hop. Get up a couple thou km, then horizontal. Begin breaking while maintaining altitude then down again. I do it this way simply because orbit at 5000m or 50000 is in the end similar fuel, but at 50,000, you are burning more counter gravity on landing instead of just gravity while you kill horizontal. Technically the most fuel efficient would be mobile rover landers, but that is no fun. Toughest part of the low altitude burn is there is no indicator of the direction of burn, need to do it entirely by feel and watching your vertical velocity gauge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T19:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel efficient way is with a rover. Unlimited miles to the gallon because it doesn\u0027t use any fuel! Seriously though, if you are thinking about doing short trips (Or are very patient) rovers are the way to go. If you don\u0027t have a rover then you want to do a sub-orbital hop. Liftoff towards the direction of your new landing zone (LZ) and thrust up to about 10k. If this doesn\u0027t get you to your destination then you will want to build up horizontal velocity until you get there, but keep in mind that the body you are on moves so you will have to adjust your hop accordingly. From there it\u0027s just like any other landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T01:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERovers take a very long time to get anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to hop from biome to biome, you\u0027ll need to do just that.

I actually just did this in project Cheese (not yet posted on my mission log). I lifted off then put on a lot of horizontal velocity to get me quickly to my destination (it\u0027s not just about speed, the more time it takes to more fuel you use keeping altitude). As you near your destination the big thing you need to do is brake your horizontal velocity, but keep an eye on the vertical velocity indicator (the little dial to the right of altitude). You want to keep it at around 0 or \u002B1 so that you don\u0027t crash. Once you\u0027ve slowed your horizontal velocity so that the retrograde indicator moves to the top/bottom of the navball you can safely land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
