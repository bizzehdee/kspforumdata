But I had one I discovered about a week ago and was wondering what else people have thought up of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically by adding a detachable Jet Engine below a booster, then feeding fuel from the booster tank and adding air intakes works as a first stage. I usually add a few short burning solid states for an added kick. But really even that isn\u0027t necessary. The drawback is it\u0027s slow, but since the jet engines get you out of the thickest atmosphere, it makes the entire rocket lighter and more fuel efficient. Prob wouldn\u0027t work in the real world, but hey it works for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i129/spinomonkey/2014-02-16_00001_zpsc3a26100.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-16_00001_zpsc3a26100.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T10:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a cool concept, but only work on kerbin and laythe, and you could use rapiers instead.

What you can do is place a liquid fuel tank below the decoupler to facilitate using a jet engine. Additionally you can add a decoupler and seprotrons between the air intake and fuel tank so that when you jettison the jet engines you also jettison the air intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T16:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had success with jet boosters which use small fuel tanks. These are radially mounted to an upper stage and set up to be decoupled shortly before flame out (which is sometimes at the same staging to decouple a lower stage). These boosters contain the jets of course, as well as their small tanks and air intakes. The radial decouplers need to be those with maximum explosive force so that the spent boosters clear the rest of the craft. I start the jet engines as the first stage, so as to let them warm up for several seconds before igniting the main rocket engine(s) and releasing the launch stabilizer clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
