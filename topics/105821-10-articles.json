They do and they did, so I\u0027ll get those up end of this week when I am back home.\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know what\u0027s special about tourists that allows them to go EVA. I guess I need to do some research when I get back home.\n\u003E \n\u003E As for screens - don\u0027t bother trying to DDS-ify the fonts and stuff - the way RPM works is it draws to a render texture which is used as a replacement for a texture on the prop (which is why the props have a small emissive texture or something like that). I tried setting the flags on the rentex to generate and use mipmaps, and it looked like it worked for DX, but OGL mode didn\u0027t - the screens were all blank. I may have to jump through extra hoops for the OGL path (assuming I can identify which renderer is in use), unless someone knows the secret Unity handshake to get rentex mipmap generation to work in the OGL case.\n\nThanks so much for you hard work MOARdV, and have a nice trip. As for the Tourists, they\u0027re not meant to leave the pod by the game\u0027s design, and [USI Life Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116790) plugin benefits from that:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When supplies run out, things go into the red... they just say \u0027screw it\u0027, get grouchy, and quit.\n\u003E They are still in the pod. they still take up a seat. But they can\u0027t fly, can\u0027t EVA, and essentially do the Kerbal equivelant of spinning around in their office chairs, refusing to work, until resupplied...Mechanics wise, they are transformed into tourists, as they are essentially on a self-imposed vacation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T17:07:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 05:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tubal","CreatedById":38146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:05:20Z","Content":"Maybe this has been asked before but can you put RPM screens outside the vehicle?
