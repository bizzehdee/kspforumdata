Let\u0027s have an example, think about a part that will sit on the surface of your vessle and behave like a mountable four direction light. Naturally you would have four spot lights in the modeling phase. You would like to turn all four of them on or off at the same time. Also, you would prefer to make all four lights blink at the same time. The stock ModuleLight, will only accept a single light geometry from your model. So, you would have to add four ModuleLights to your part file to handle all four spot lights. This will cause a huge headache for you. Using four ModuleLigths, means that now, in the part action window, you will have four buttons for turning lights on/off, and four buttons to make them blink. Unless you bind these actions to an action group, this won\u0027t work as intended. Also, now you would have four light color options. In some cases that is exactly what you need, then by all means, use the stock module. How ever, if you want to turn many light objects on/off and blink syncronously with a single button click, this little module is for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EHow to use\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe syntax is similar to ModuleLight, how ever, when you have lightName in ModuleLight with a single name of the object, here you can have as many objects as you want, separate names with a comma and you can even use single space between comma and names to make things readable more. The final result will be something like this :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\n{\n\tname = ModuleMultiLight\n\tlightName = light_obj_1, light_obj_2, light_obj_3, light_obj_4, light_obj_5, light_obj_6, light_obj_7, light_obj_8\n\tlightRange = 10;\n\tuseAnimationDim = True\n\t\tanimationName = ANIM_NAME_TURN_ON\n\t\tlightBrightenSpeed = 2.5\n\t\tlightDimSpeed = 2.5\n\tdisableColorPicker = False\n\t\ttoggleInEditor = True\n\t\ttoggleInFlight = True\n\tcanBlink = True\n\t\tblinkMin = 0.2\n\t\tblinkMax = 2.0\n\t\tblinkRate = 0.5\n\t\tisBlinking = False\n\tuseResources = True\n\t\tresourceName = ElectricCharge\n\t\tresourceAmount = 0.002\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotic, beside having many object names, now you have one additional parameter that you can set, the light\u0027s range value! The default number for this value is set to 60. This default value would work properly in case you have one or two ligths, but with more lights in close space, you may want to tweak and nerf this value down like this example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can simply download the mod from \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/3294/Module%20Multi%20Light\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESPACEDOCK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe source is published on \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/drkhodakarami/Module-Multi-Light\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGITHUB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind, the license is \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMIT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003E If I was not able to keep this repo up to date in future for next versions of game, anyone \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewho wants to maintain\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E this,\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ealready have permission\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion History \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E1.12.5.1:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E- Added the functionality for searching child objects for light, now, if you want, just put a single name (the parent) of the light object holders, the code will find all the children that are lights\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E- Added the slider for light range into the part action window both in editor and in flight\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EKnown Bug\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E : When you turn on the light on an active vessel and then leave it and go for other vessels, if you come back to the vessel, only the ring in colored and no lights are active, simply turn off the light (single light or on the whole vessel) and turn them back on, it should work.
