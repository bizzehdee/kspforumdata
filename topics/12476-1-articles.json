A man stood in a doorway cut seamlessly into the metal, the door hanging open beside him. Malachi looked him over: slim but not scrawny, reasonably tall for a Kerbo of his age, looked about thirty-five. He was dressed in blue jeans, a tucked-in button-down shirt, and a leather jacket. In the desert. In the summer. Right at high noon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi checked the paper again. Other than \u0027junk salesman\u0027 and \u0027badass\u0027, there were no other identifying remarks. Malachi had found this place by driving the three hours to the desert and asking where the junk was. It had been easy from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Are you Jebediah Kerman?\u0027 said Malachi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The man leaned against the doorframe and crossed his arms over his chest. \u0027Who wants to know?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I\\\u0027m with the Program,\u0027 said Malachi. \u0027We were wondering if--\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Program?\u0027 The man raised an eyebrow. \u0027What Program?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi blinked. It had honestly never occurred to him that Jebediah Kerman would need to be reminded about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027The Space Program?\u0027 said Malachi. \u0027This is Jebediah Kerman\\\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Company, isn\\\u0027t it?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The man leaned out of the doorway and peered up at the wall overhead. Spray-painted in red letters were the words \u0027Jebediah Kerman\\\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Company.\u0027 He leaned back and gazed levelly at Malachi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027So it is.\u0027 He grinned. \u0027I guess that makes me Jebediah, right?\u0027 Jeb stepped out of the doorway and walked up to Malachi, grabbed his hand, and began shaking it vigorously. \u0027Pleased to meet you, Mister Government Agent.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi retrieved his hand as quickly as he could, massaging life back into his fingers. \u0027Malachi, please.\u0027 He straightened his tie. \u0027Now, Mister Kerman--\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Jeb, please,\u0027 said Jeb, grinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi pressed his lips together. \u0027Mister Kerman, the Program has asked me to extend to you an offer.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Let\\\u0027s talk inside, Mister Malachi,\u0027 said Jeb. He turned and vanished into the darkened interior of what Malachi presumed to be a residence built into the wall. Malachi sighed and followed him, glad to be out of the heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He closed the door behind him and looked around. It was a small place, to be sure, but actually fairly comfortable. Most everything was made of repurposed junk--a table made of old aluminum barrels and a sheet of steel, chairs made from other, smaller chairs, a mirror made from hundreds of rear-view mirrors glued onto a sheet of wood--but it all seemed to fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jebediah sat on the bench-seat couch, reached into a cooler at his feet and pulled out two aluminum cans. \u0027Soda?\u0027 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi waved a hand and sat in the chair across the table from Jeb. \u0027Oh, no, I don\\\u0027t drink.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027How d\\\u0027you stay alive, then?\u0027 said Jeb. \u0027Ah well, more for me.\u0027 He cracked open both sodas and set them on the table in front of him. \u0027Now, Mister Malachi, what\\\u0027s this \\\u0027offer\\\u0027?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi nodded; here was something he was familiar with. \u0027The Program needs your expertise, Mister Kerman.

I might as well be a house-parts company for everything I\\\u0027ve done with this junk.\u0027 Jeb frowned and took a pull of his left-hand drink. \u0027What about Steadler, or O.M.B., or any of the other big firms out there?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027They\\\u0027re far too important to do the big work, Mister Kerman. They\\\u0027ll only contract us for a few elements. Nobody particularly cares about tanks and engines and such.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I know tanks and engines just fine, sure, but I don\\\u0027t know much about building spaceships.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Neither does anyone else at the Program,\u0027 said Malachi without thinking. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he slapped a hand over his face. \u0027I mean--\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Bunch of drunken slugs, right?\u0027 said Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Eh\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6unfortunately,\u0027 said Malachi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb nodded. \u0027Okay then, I\\\u0027ll do it. Somebody needs to bring some cool to that place.\u0027 He downed the rest of his drinks in two long pulls and wiped his lips with the back of his hand. \u0027On two conditions, though,\u0027 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi remembered what was written on the other side of the piece of paper his manager had given him: \u0027And don\\\u0027t come back without him!\u0027 While the prospect was tempting\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6well, what else was he going to do all day?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Name it,\u0027 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027First, I get to go on whatever big mission it is you\\\u0027re trying to do out there.

Grinning, he said, \u0027\u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E get to drive.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 2: The Cape\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi wondered where his life had gone wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jebediah Kerman\\\u0027s vehicle of choice was a cherry-red Thrillmaster convertible manual-transmission monster of a car, and his idea of driving it was ramping over the far wall of his junkyard and onto the other side of a low hill, onto which he had paved a road leading from the hill to the main highway. Malachi watched his Coupe dwindle in the distance as Jeb put his foot down and refused to let it up for any reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Don\\\u0027t you think this is a little excessive?\u0027 cried Malachi over the oppressive wind and engine noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Go big or don\\\u0027t go at all, that\\\u0027s my motto!\u0027 said Jeb, one hand on the wheel and the other holding another can of soda. \u0027I\\\u0027ll let you pick the station!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi examined the car\\\u0027s stereo. It was possibly the most beautiful thing he had ever seen--chrome detailing, every kind of media player, little green glowy lights--and he took a moment to admire it before selecting a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb grinned at him as \u0027Speed-Recording Device Desire\u0027 began blaring over the sound of the rushing wind. \u0027I like your style, Malachi!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi considered the statement for a moment and decided it was a good thing. He hunkered down in the seat and tried to enjoy himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was a long ride to the Cape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E They saw the rockets first. Or rather, bits of them, scattered all over the highway. In some cases, right in the middle; traffic just diverted around it and went on honking and yelling for no reason at all other than for the hell of it. Malachi wondered, not for the first time, if he was actually an alien from another planet. One with less\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6Kerbalness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I can see why you need me,\u0027 said Jeb, \u0027if this is what you call \\\u0027rocket science.\\\u0027\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I don\\\u0027t call it that,\u0027 said Malachi. \u0027They call it that.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027What do you call it?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi yelped and grabbed hold of the passenger door\\\u0027s interior handle as Jeb swerved around a particularly large bit of one of the more successful rocket engine prototypes. \u0027Junk!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb laughed. \u0027Right up my alley, then, isn\\\u0027t it, slick?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Cape was only a cape by virtue of the fact that it jutted out slightly more from the east coast of the continent than the bits immediately adjacent to it. The Kerbal Space Center was situated as close to the coast as it could get without putting floats on the buildings, which were generally low to the ground and armored on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Except for the Vehicle Assembly Building, of course. Malachi sighed when it came into view around one of the low mountainous foothills that surrounded the Cape. It was a monolithic structure, tall enough to house a skyscraper inside and packed full of enough rocket stuff to launch it into space. If, of course, they could ever get the engines to stop exploding all at once and start exploding over time like proper rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb pulled into the parking space marked \u0027KSC Administrator\u0027 and stared up at the building. He gave a long, low whistle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Not bad, not bad,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\\\u0027s pretty big, isn\\\u0027t it?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Well, the rockets going to the Mun are going to have to be pretty damn large,\u0027 said Malachi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027The Mun, eh?\u0027 said Jeb. \u0027Sounds good. How close are we to getting there?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Well, the Mun\\\u0027s about eleven million meters away, and the top of the VAB is two hundred meters off the ground.\u0027 Malachi scratched his head. \u0027How tall are you?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Never mind,\u0027 said Jeb. \u0027I think I get it.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A figure was walking towards them from the shade of the VAB. He was of average height, mustachioed, in a white button-down shirt and suspenders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Malachi as the man approached them. \u0027Administrator Kerman, this is Jebediah Kerman. Mister Kerman, this is Administrator Kerman.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb stuck his hand out of the car, and the Administrator shook it. \u0027Pleased to meet you.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Administrator grinned. \u0027You\\\u0027re just the guy for the job, Jeb. Your reputation precedes you.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Mister Kerman wants to be on the crew, sir,\u0027 said Malachi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027That right? Well, stands to reason!\u0027 The Administrator scratched his head as Jeb and Malachi got out of the car. \u0027Unfortunately, we\\\u0027ve already got a prime crew. They\\\u0027ve been training for a year for the missions ahead.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Training for systems that aren\\\u0027t even designed yet,\u0027 muttered Malachi. The Administrator appeared not to have heard him, while Jeb was stifling laughter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Well, I like your man Malachi here,\u0027 said Jeb. \u0027So if they\\\u0027re anything like him, I bet we\\\u0027ll be on the Mun before you can blink!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Yeah\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u0027 said the Administrator. \u0027Just like Malachi.\u0027 He coughed awkwardly. \u0027Anyway! Why don\\\u0027t we get down to business, eh? Mister Kerman--\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Jeb,\u0027 said Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Administrator nodded. \u0027Right, Jeb. Mister Jeb, we would like to contract with your company for the purpose of building tanks, rocket engines, and various and sundry other parts as may be required for the construction of big rockets that go WHOOSH and ZOOM and generally don\\\u0027t blow up when we push the big red \\\u0027Launch\\\u0027 button, okay?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb put a hand to his chin, thinking. \u0027Do I get my own parking space?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Administrator grinned. \u0027Have mine!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Then I\\\u0027ll do it.\u0027 He clasped hands with the Administrator again. \u0027We\\\u0027ll draw up the particulars later. For now, I want to see the rockets.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Such as they are,\u0027 muttered Malachi. Jeb grinned. \u0027They\\\u0027re inside,\u0027 he said more loudly. \u0027This way.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Malachi led the way into the building. Administrator Kerman kept trying to engage Jeb in conversation, but all Jeb seemed to want to do was look at the pictures of rockets on the walls. Malachi had been through the VAB so often that the pictures were practically invisible to him now--especially since they were, exclusively, \u0027before\u0027 pictures. They had already seen the \u0027after\u0027 shots, scattered all over the highway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E They took an elevator up to the top of the building, then stepped out onto a mesh-metal balcony that ran all the way around the inside of the massive space. A rocket was taking shape on the main floor, tanks strapped together with tape and string and stages glued to other stages. There was a capsule on top, but no parachute. That, Malachi thought derisively, was still under development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Welcome to High Bay Three,\u0027 said Malachi. \u0027Don\\\u0027t ask what happened to the first two.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Er, you call that a rocket?\u0027 said Jeb, peering down at the monstrosity below. \u0027I\\\u0027ve had random piles of junk that looked more flightworthy.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For a moment, a look of annoyance passed across the Administrator\\\u0027s face, but it passed quickly. \u0027Of course. That\\\u0027s our prototype. We\\\u0027re going to launch it off this afternoon and see how it works. Then we\\\u0027ll give you the data and you can help us make improvements, okay?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb frowned. \u0027How long until the launch?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Administrator leaned over the railing and yelled down to the Kerbos working below. \u0027How long until the launch?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One of the Kerbos, hard hat askew, waved something up at them. \u0027The bottle says we have to wait half an hour for the glue to dry!\u0027 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Better give it an hour!\u0027 said the Administrator. He grinned sheepishly at Jeb. \u0027Er, two hours, then. We still have to drag it out to the pad.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Oh, okay,\u0027 said Jeb. \u0027So, you have some kind of big platform thing that rolls out there?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Administrator scratched his neck. \u0027Er, something like that.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T19:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKERBIN! \u003Cspan\u003EKERBIN!\u003C/span\u003E Not kearth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T19:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was good, but did it really need all of those \u0027K\\\u0027s\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loved the ending. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T19:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest taking all of the place names, removing the \u0027K\\\u0027s,\u0027 coming up with your own place names, and then replacing Kearth with Kerbin.

Also, the title doesn\\\u0027t reference the Tom Hanks miniseries/the book from which the miniseries comes if I don\\\u0027t call it that. I also guarantee that the K-spamming is over--this chapter is from a while ago when that kind of thing was accepted. I could change it if it really bothers people, but I rather like a few of the puns it produces.
