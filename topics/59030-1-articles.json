You could flip between flight and the observatory to get the two values as close together as possible (or view the save file in a text editor for UT and met), then perform a subtraction to get the mission start time which could be added to MET each time you need to know the date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m wondering if there is a simplier way to get the universal time/date while in flight playing stock KSP, maybe clicking somewhere on the MET display switches it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T14:44:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T04:32:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, not that I know of...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T12:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe closest thing you can do to this is to make a rocket at KSC right at the start of the save, then use that as a clock.
