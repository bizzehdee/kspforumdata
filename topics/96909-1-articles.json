You just happen to be using a very inefficient kind of intakes. TWR (thrust to weight ratio) does have something to do with it also, of course (if you don\u0027t have enough you won\u0027t get to altitude, for example, and an extremely high TWR can give you slightly higher cutoff speeds), but really, 90% of it is the intake-engine ratio. Because most KSP designs have TWR between 0.5 and 1.5, mainly. For more info, I\u0027ve just been pointed to here, you seem to need it more than I do:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/3jrUJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/3jrUJ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Have you worked out the weight in intakes and how it hurts your in-space delta-v?
