Also, stepped nose cones are better then a single part one, as only the frontmost part is truly affected by drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis NEEDS to be fixed asap, as well as radially mounted crap being never occluded regardless ofg where it is placed (for example radial docking ports will create equal drag whether they are tucked in a recess or stuck out in teh airstream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile i love what squad did to this aero, its still just as capable of being exploited if you know how to do it. Occlusion based drag is very nice, but one radially mounted thinsg even if clipped inside the hull still create the same drag period regardless of how much stick out, and stuff that is stacked ALWAYS get occluded regardless of the shape/size of the thing in front.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:10:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol, shhhhh. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, this might be a good one.
