It can reach around 2000 m/s at around 35 km altitude before rocket engine boost into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like in the movie, the Strider also comes with a 2-stage launcher to get to orbit. However it is rather unstable to fly because of all the lifting surfaces an the top, so some extra wings and SAS-modules were required to fly it as a rocket to space. It can do an engineless glide back to KSC, both with full tanks if launched as a rocket, or with empty tanks if flown to space as an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr0r8gvh7z7qm03/Strider%20with%20launcher.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more images in Imgur album below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/WuttH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It will probably be a slow ride as my computer is not the fastest one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right that some fuel is clipped. The Strider has a FL-T100 and a FL-T400. The FL-T400 is clipped about half way into the Mk2 crew cabin, and the FL-T100 if clipped about half way into the Mk2 drone core. This gives it enough fuel to reach orbit with plenty to spare for orbital manoeuvres and rendezvous with a ship or station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
