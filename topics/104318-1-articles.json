As I just watched Interstellar, I was inspired to build this little ship to fill the role.\n\n![6ROPeXa.png](http://i.imgur.com/6ROPeXa.png)\n\nIf launched as an SSTO to an orbit of 75km, the Strider has around 700 m/s of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v left for orbital manoeuvres, and around 200 \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v of RCS. It can reach around 2000 m/s at around 35 km altitude before rocket engine boost into orbit.\n\nJust like in the movie, the Strider also comes with a 2-stage launcher to get to orbit. However it is rather unstable to fly because of all the lifting surfaces an the top, so some extra wings and SAS-modules were required to fly it as a rocket to space. It can do an engineless glide back to KSC, both with full tanks if launched as a rocket, or with empty tanks if flown to space as an SSTO.\n\n[Craft file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr0r8gvh7z7qm03/Strider%20with%20launcher.craft?dl=0)\n\nSome more images in Imgur album below:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It will probably be a slow ride as my computer is not the fastest one.\n\nYou are right that some fuel is clipped. The Strider has a FL-T100 and a FL-T400. The FL-T400 is clipped about half way into the Mk2 crew cabin, and the FL-T100 if clipped about half way into the Mk2 drone core. This gives it enough fuel to reach orbit with plenty to spare for orbital manoeuvres and rendezvous with a ship or station."}]}
