It\u0027s...well, I want to say \u0027Static\u0027 but let\u0027s go with \u0027fixed\u0027. It\u0027s clearly randomly generated, as it changes when the map gets redrawn, but it isn\u0027t animated. It stays fixed until you do something that causes the map to redraw. It basically looks like a screenshot of what you get out of an old analog TV that\u0027s been tuned to a channel that isn\u0027t there: random black-and-white dots. It\u0027s still helpful because it lets you see where you\u0027ve scanned so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe multispectral will let you turn the scans in for science even when all it can do is a static \u0022map\u0022, but the radar will not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve yet to manage to \u0027map\u0027 the Sun effectively, as I\u0027ve yet to figure out a way to circularize at a low enough altitude.
