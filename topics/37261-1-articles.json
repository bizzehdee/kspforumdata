For me to sit down and get a solid two hours of playtime in a session is nothing shy of something wonderful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion, have a mechanizim whereby you can proof a lifter design and payload combo and then be able to launch that into a parking orbit by a click. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I have been trying to map every body in the system with mapsat and Kethane. Just the launching of my probes is taking a good chunk of time. Why not have a vehicle that if launched say, 5 times without incident, move that to a \u0022auto launch\u0022 list ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the game, I just don\u0027t have the time it takes (even with the time warp system) to get things done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion, if using say nuke or ion engines, allow a button that will complete your burn. I def don\u0027t have the time to sit and watch a 10-30 min burn go down. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for listening!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw if anyone here has some suggestions for speeding up some things let me know.

That\u0027s why they left the game open for mods though. MEchJeb can do your launch for you, and HyperEdit can magically drop your things in space.
