Alternative or modified firmware may not be fully compatible with your Magic Boulder, which could result in loss of function, electrical damage, unmoderated reality excursions, or invalidation of your Magic Boulder\u0027s manufacturer\u0027s warranty. To report illegally modified Magic Boulder instances, please contact Thaumatic Minerals LTD or your local FCC office immediately.\n\nMagic Boulder may affect the inductance and capacitance of electrical parts in close proximity to it. Remember to check the functionality of flyback diodes, fuses, filters, and other safety features of all electronic machinery which spends more than two hours per day within your Magic Boulder\u0027s 500-meter area of effect, and be aware that some equipment may require adjustment before it will be operable within this area.\n\nMagic Boulder\u0027s surface exhibits a strong negative electric potential when lit, and a positive potential when shaded. While this is an important driving aspect behind many of Magic Boulder\u0027s exciting and useful functions, it can pose a significant hazard when Magic Boulder comes into contact with conductive materials. Keep Magic Boulder evenly illuminated at 201.47 lux at all times when not in use, avoid allowing shadows to pass across its surface, and never use flashlights, headlamps, or other mobile illumination sources around Magic Boulder\u0027s containment apparatus. When local illumination is necessary, use only Thaumatic Minerals LTD Magic Boulder Safelights."},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T19:44:31Z","Content":"It worked!
