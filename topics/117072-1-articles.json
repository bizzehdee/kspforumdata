As long as the jets leave me with a minute plus burn time in fuel, I have plenty of time to transfer jet fuel. Since I always disable oxidizer flow on the front tank for aerodynamic stability for the early part of the burn, it\u0027s not like all fuel is immediately available to burn regardless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only space plane design of mine that does use the drag adding fuel lines uses the jet pods for (almost) all rocket fuel storage. I like the aesthetics of keeping jets to the same stack as intakes and keeping the rocket fuel in the same stack as the engines would have made the craft too long (the primary craft feature was 2.5 module long Mk2 cargo bay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am considering bumping it up to 3 modules (the nuclear tugs that are its capstone cargo barely fit), but I\u0027m unsure of how that would affect design balance. I laugh because the craft was initially designed to lift scan-sats, but I realized that I could extend the design to handle tugs and reduce my fleet count. Since the proving flights it has become my go to lifter design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, with RAPIERs just unlocked, it\u0027s probably time to build its successor.
