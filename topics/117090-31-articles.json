I\u0026#39;ve just finished implementing free-scaling of the mounts, so now you can have them whatever size you want. Have also implemented free-scaling of the distance between engines, for further customization/compatibility with mounts.

They won\u0026#39;t fit under 5m anyway. Had you bothered to try making the cluster yourself (very easy, instructions have been given multiple times) you would have already known this. A 4-engine variant -might- work. (Consider the scales though; 10m * 64% = 6.4m, which is why they -barely- fit under 6.25m).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nC.) Do people -really- need me to make these simple configs and patches for them? Is it that difficult to figure the config and patch system out? As if that is the case, I might as well be done modding now. I have already stated several times that the engine cluster tool is a tool for others to use, and if you want a cluster/layout that doesn\u0026#39;t exist, to make it yourself. I have not the time, patience, nor the want, to make up every single engine cluster/design/layout.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T16:34:57Z","Content":"\npics that prove it isn\u0026#39;t any hard to make custom mounts, these are RO rockets that should be submitted today (M1, Apollo CSM and 12.2m and 20m decouplers are not included, first two from FASA and last two were rescaled KW ones), not sure if MM 1B and 1C are gonna be approved, but still....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]nXeHX[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfigs are exactly the same for stock, you should only need to rescale stuff\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nand I might make a stock sized C-8 just for the sake of it\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbtw, thanks Shadowmage for what is, in my opinion, the best KSP mod!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stratochief66","CreatedById":59541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T20:32:26Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027JoseEduardo\u0027]pics that prove it isn\u0026#39;t any hard to make custom mounts [/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaha, oh modest JoseEduardo. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a pretty well refined skill at modifying SSTU parts at this point, it would probably take me 10x what it takes you to do some of these things at this point.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T04:30:44Z","Content":"\n[SIZE=2][B]Updated release is available:[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.2.20-beta\u0022]\u003Cbr\u003E\nhttps://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.2.20-beta[/URL][/SIZE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=3]WARNING[/SIZE][/B][SIZE=3] - This release will break existing craft (Saved/inflight/whatever) using the existing/old engine clusters.[/SIZE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdds free-scaling to the engine mounts (and engine spacing).

Tried to give a bit of warning Friday/Saturday that I would be doing a double-release this weekend. Didn\u0026#39;t want to too-blatantly advertise it though, in case I couldn\u0026#39;t get it all done (which, almost didn\u0026#39;t... certainly would not have released it yesterday without JoseEduardo\u0026#39;s help).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyhow, the engine clusters -should- be stable now for the forseable future. I cannot currently think of any more features that I could realistically add, at least none that would be save/config/craft breaking like this update was. There are a couple minor things that might get added to help ease the setup of some mount/engine options, but they should be literal additions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the major reasons that I did this change, besides the updating to the free-scaling system, was to \u0026#39;fix\u0026#39; how the \u0026#39;current mount\u0026#39; was stored in the craft persistence file. Previously it was stored as an index (number), and would reference that mount option (by number) every time the part was reloaded. This was fine, as long as nothing in the config got changed/reordered/removed -- as soon as the ordering changed, it would change already-existing craft, as the index that they had stored now pointed to a different mount option. Now the \u0026#39;current mount\u0026#39; option is stored by name. So the only way to break an existing craft is if their -currently selected- mount option was removed from the config definition entirely. It is now safe to add new mounts, or re-order them in the config, without fear of breaking existing craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyhow.. such is the nature of progress. Occasionally you need to break the old patterns (and break the old code) to get the new features implemented.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd on to the \u0026#39;new\u0026#39; news. Will be starting on the Custom Upper Stage (can we call it \u0026#39;CUS\u0026#39;?) this week. Working on expanding on the concept diagrams I posted on Friday. So far I -think- I have the basis for the plugin figured out regarding the layout of the model parts, how they will be moved, manipulated, rescaled, etc in order to create the finished/customizable part.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth upper stage types will be based on a common plugin/code setup; the only difference is the \u0026#39;common bulkhead\u0026#39; type of tanks will only use some of the model-bits. The model will be broken up into 9 parts:\u003Cbr\u003E\nST = Split Tank\u003Cbr\u003E\nCB = Common Bulkhead\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.) Upper Tank top cap (both ST and CB)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.) Upper Tank Midsection (Resizable) (both ST and CB)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.) Upper Tank Lower Cap (both ST and CB)\u003Cbr\u003E\n4.) Intertank Bracing (only ST)\u003Cbr\u003E\n5.) Lower Tank top Cap (only ST)\u003Cbr\u003E\n6.) Lower Tank Midsection (Resizable) (only ST)\u003Cbr\u003E\n7.) Lower Tank bottom Cap (only ST)\u003Cbr\u003E\n8.) Mounting Option (different mounts for ST and CB)\u003Cbr\u003E\n9.) RCS ports (can be used for attitude control, ullage, and potentially for retro-rockets as well)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe common-bulkead type of upper-stage will only use parts 1-3, 8, and 9 (top tank parts, mount, and RCS). Models will all share from the same pool as the split-tank type. Multiple texture sets will be available. Common-bulkhead will also have a different selection of mount options compared to split-tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill be working on the initial plugin and prototype models today/tomorrow/this week. Hope to have something for -prototype testing- by this weekend (initial temporary test parts). The faster I can get this concept worked through and developed, the faster I can get back to more engines / command modules / whatever else I\u0026#39;ve been planning for the past 6-months.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T18:07:31Z","Content":"\nCUS in portuguese is..... well.... ermmm..... um.... how can I explain this.... eh..... nevermind................\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat about Tweakable Upper Stage - TUS? :P\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T18:38:50Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027JoseEduardo\u0027]just wondering, which custom mounts did you get?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout the mount stuff, I totally agree, that\u0026#39;s why I said it was very easy :P[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWas something like:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdded 1,875 to generic mount size\u003Cbr\u003E\nJ-2 in 2x, 3x, 4x\u003Cbr\u003E\nRS-25= 2x, 3x, 4x (Jupiter style and others) and Fixed the Direct mount.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRL10: Some small variant and tweek that I don\u0026#39;t remember.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCreated a mount without engine for custom stuff and testing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince I plan to only use SSTU engines, I created temporary engine using existing one:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe J-2L: A low altitude variant with average performence and low cost.

It effects every mount for that engine cluster though. Alternatively, you can adjust the \u0026#39;height\u0026#39; setting in the base mount definitions file to effect a single mount (SSTU/Data/Engines/MountConfigs.cfg); a lower \u0026#39;height\u0026#39; setting will clip the engines for that mount. You will notice though, that this creates problems with rescaled mounts; as a .5m clip on a 5m mount becomes a .25m clip on a 2.5m mount, and then the engine is not as sunk in as you want it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever - neither of those setups are officially \u0026#39;supported\u0026#39;, so when it all starts going sideways... sorry, you\u0026#39;ve been warned. The -only- supported setup is engines mounted flush against the bottom of the mount, no part clipping, and everything set up properly for scales/heights/offsets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpdating geometry - as I\u0026#39;ve already stated, no. I will -not- update geometry on existing \u0026#39;finished\u0026#39; models (and that goes quadruple for models that are part of a texture atlas / share the texture between multiple models). Should have said something when I was asking for feedback on the geometry of the parts initially (several weeks ago for those mounts). -If- I were to redo that mount, I would need to redo the Saturn-V, Pyrios, and SLS mounts as well (because they all share a texture, any change to one effects the rest)... quite simply, not happening without a very good reason. The closest I will come to \u0026#39;updating geometry\u0026#39; is -completely redoing- the part; and I neither have the time nor want to redo perfectly functional parts.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T16:16:32Z","Content":"\nThanks for the answer.

Due to how fast the work on the upper-stages has progressed, I hav moved up the \u0026#39;Payload Fairings and Adpaters\u0026#39; set of parts from the 0.4.x release to the 0.3.x release. Aiming to have the mod reasonably usable at the 0.3.x point, and ready for an \u0026#39;official\u0026#39; public at that point. And the payload adapters/fairings will certainly help that goal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpper Stages -- made -very- good progress on the plugin/module for these yesterday. Went from 0% written to having mostly functional parts in the VAB (untextured models at this point). Likely have a few more hours of coding to do, and then I can spend the rest of the week doing the actual models and the additional skeletal style mounts. So.. if all goes well this week, I should have the custom upper stage stuff ready to go for this weekends release.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHave moved from a \u0026#39;one part per stack size\u0026#39; layout, to a \u0026#39;one part per type\u0026#39; layout -- so there is a total of two upper-stage parts; one for common-bulkhead, and one for split-tank. They now allow for full adjustment of both the diameter and tank height (currently scaling a part vertically, so you get very fine-grained control over height; -might- move over to a pre-compiled model system though; undecided at this point).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the note of \u0026#39;public release\u0026#39; -- basically this just means I will start using this dev-thread more for what it is intended for (constant/rapid dev updates), while using the \u0026#39;public release\u0026#39; thread for any \u0026#39;official\u0026#39; releases.

If anyone feels like they would be up to the task of helping to put together some of this material, please let me know; would be much appreciated, and could go a long way towards the future popularity and success of the mod. Currently it looks like it will be about 1-2 weeks before I should be ready for the initial public release (possibly longer if the upper stage/fairing stuff takes longer), so I would like to get started on some of this stuff now (or as soon as possible/the parts exist).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T17:12:00Z","Content":"\nI could help with the .craft files, for both, RO and stock, but about videos, I don\u0026#39;t have a graphic appealing computer to start with :P\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbtw, got one idea for the future, but should be relativelly simple, a resizeable Instrument Unit, of course, you have the payload for control capabilities, but the IU could provide more controls for the rocket (SAS level) and reaction wheels aswell (could also include RCS, just an idea): [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V_Instrument_Unit[/url]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T17:16:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
