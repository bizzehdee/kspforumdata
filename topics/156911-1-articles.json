you said, your best bet is to use the Oberth maneuver, where you burn to get a low intercept and then another burn utilizing the speed of the encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to effectively do this, using Kerbol would work best, but using a gas giant like Jool would work as well, like how Voyager 1 used Jupiter to swing out of our solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it\u0027s up to the velocities you can get from the intercepts and whichever one fits the amount of Delta-V you have on your

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epossible\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 May not be particularly useful or practical, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I offer advice, let me make sure I correctly understand what it is that you\u0027re trying to get at, here.\u00A0 Here\u0027s my understanding:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou really do mean inter\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estellar\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not inter\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplanetary\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, here, because you\u0027re running some mod that adds another solar system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYour primary problem is that the other star is really really far away, and you don\u0027t want to take a super long time to get there, so you\u0027re trying to find a way to get there fast.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTherefore what you\u0027re trying to do is to eject from Kerbin\u0027s sun with the maximum possible relative velocity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSo you\u0027re asking about doing an Oberth maneuver by diving close to the sun and doing your main ejection burn at a really low solar periapsis.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the above correct?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming that it is, then, I would suggest that it\u0027s not worth your while to try to set up an elaborate slingshot thing around Eve, Jool, etc.\u00A0 Setting up that sort of gravity assist is really hard to do accurately.\u00A0 And there\u0027s also the question of how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E it actually saves you.\u00A0 Going to Jool directly from Kerbin, for example, takes an ejection burn of about 1900 m/s from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Compare that with going from Kerbin to Eve, which takes an ejection burn from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E of about 1000 m/s.\u00A0 That means that if you\u0027re trying to use Eve to slingshot your way to Jool, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe most \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you can \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epossibly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E save is only about 900 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E, and in reality it\u0027ll probably be quite a bit less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you consider the monstrous \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you\u0027re going to be engineering into your ship to make an interstellar trip, saving only a few hundred m/s getting to Jool doesn\u0027t seem worth the enormous hassle of trying to set up a three-body trajectory that\u0027s perfectly accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter, there\u0027s the question of why bother with Jool, either.\u00A0 Presumably the only reason to go to Jool is so you can use a gravity assist to get your solar periapsis really low, right?\u00A0 Well, consider that you can get a low solar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E for less than 3000 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, without using Jool at all.\u00A0 (This would involve launching on a near-escape trajectory that takes you to a high solar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, then doing a small retrograde burn at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to lower your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E from Kerbin\u0027s orbit down to something low.)\u00A0 So, given that it takes 1900 m/s to get to Jool... you\u0027re not really saving yourself a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, only around 1 km/s at most, by using Jool here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy far the lion\u0027s share of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E will be expended in a monster burn at low solar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 So your main focus would be on figuring out how to engineer the most possible \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E into that ship, which will require knowing some other parameters, such as (for example) how much patience you have for long burns and the like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you give us some numbers?\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat speed do you want to hit when you\u0027re crossing interstellar space?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 It\u0027s hard to give practical advice without having at least an approximate idea of what speed range we\u0027re talking about, here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAlso, what hardware do you have access to-- specifically, what engine Isp?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 If you\u0027re going after monstrously high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, then Isp is totally the name of the game:\u00A0 you\u0027ll want the highest Isp you can get away with.\u00A0 In the stock game, most engines have Isp that differ from each other by only a few percent.\u00A0 The only stock engines that have a significantly higher Isp than conventional liquid engines (which top out at 350 s for the Poodle) are the LV-N (at 800 s) and the Dawn ion engine (at 4200 s).\u00A0 Are those the highest-Isp engines that you have available, or are you running some mod that gives you access to something faster?\u00A0 If so, what are the stats?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T08:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHehehe, yup:\u00A0\u003Ca
