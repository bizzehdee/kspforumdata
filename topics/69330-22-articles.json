This could be an awesome mod but I can\u0027t enjoy it because of a strange issue. I read in the EVE FAQs that on Mac there is no support for 8K textures and this causes said textures to behave strangely and things to split and stuff, and this is what happens to me. First, I had installed EVE High res and this mod, and clouds and city lights split just like if I had a Mac, even if I have Win7 64x. Anyway I\u0027m not running KSP with the 64 bit hack. Later I tried to download the Low res version of EVE as suggested in its thread, but I had the same issue, I guess because Better Atmospheres overwrites those textures. The very odd thing is that either with Low and High res of EVE, and not installing Better Atmospheres, I have apparently no split, even if from the debug prompt it says that the can\u0027t load the textures, but it works fine. Whenever I install Better Atmospheres, stuff splits. Don\u0027t know why. I would be very happy to use this mod in my modpack, so, does anyone have any suggestion?
