If you have empty stages -above- your current stages, the new rocket puts its stages there. That kind of allows what I want to do, but unfortunately making a bunch of empty stages above your rocket is a lot of clicking so that kind of sucks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding empty stages to the part to be merged does nothing afaik.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty much changes my reqeuest not at all..
