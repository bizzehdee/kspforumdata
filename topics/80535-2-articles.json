We were hoping you could double check a fuel reading for us.\u0022 Sigsey replied in the affirmative and was busy taking down the numbers when Shepgee floated away through the orbital module and into the docking tube. He looked across the junction into the Luzhin 5\u0027s Tantares where Haloly and Gusbrett were unstrapping themselves, then made his way up into the Eutocius\u0027 habitat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eutocius was a strange craft. Both station and ship, it somehow felt smaller than anything Shepgee had flown in. The space program\u0027s eviction from KSC had forced them to seek smaller and smaller solutions. This cramped monstrosity of a vessel was the result. Controlled from the two Tantares/Luzhin spacecraft docked radially to the spine, the Eutocius was sufficient to keep a crew of four alive for the duration of the trip to Minmus. (Alive, but perhaps not sane.) Once at Minmus, the crew was scheduled to conduct two landings, and then return to Kerbin in the two Tantares, leaving the Eutocius behind for the next expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepgee was busy tearing into a snack container when Gusbrett and Haloly floated into the hab. \u0022You two hungry?\u0022 He looked up and motioned to them with the snacks.

Instead he just stretched his arms out quickly, sending the bag of snacks he was munching on careening around the Hitchhiker Can (and thus propelling himself backwards ever so slightly). He turned around to find Sigsey, done with the final checks for the ground controllers. \u0022Sheesh, Sigs. Didn\u0027t hear you come in. What\u0027s up?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, the numbers are. Or down, actually. Or up to something, depending on your view.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oooooh-kee-day.\u0022 Shepgee was paying more attention to his snacks than to his pilot, watching them as they bounced about the cabin. He caught them as they rebounded off of Gusbrett\u0027s head, Gusbrett flashing a look of mild annoyance. \u0022Care to elaborate?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigsey tossed a clipboard at Shepgee, forcing him to shove his snacks back towards Gusbrett to free his hands. \u0022Well, when they built the delta-V tables for the transfers to the planets and moons, they were all based on the assumption we\u0027d be leaving from a 500km equatorial Kerbin orbit.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepgee looked at the clipboard, which had lots of scribbling and readings for the fuel reserves on it among other engineering nonsense he couldn\u0027t interpret. \u0022And, we left from a 20 degree 70 kilometer orbit.\u0022 He understood that much at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right. So the numbers are different. And because Minmus, on its 8 degree inclination was working against us, and because we\u0027re heavier than we\u0027d planned for thanks to, well, us....\u0022 Shepgee tossed the clipboard back at Sigsey, shaking his head. Gusbrett started munching on his newfound snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s the plan?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene would like us to exercise the free-return trajectory. Except we all know the thin-ice the program is running on, so abandoning this mission might, well, be unpleasant.\u0022 Sigsey bounced the clipboard back at Shepgee, who caught it but didn\u0027t look at it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If we transfer all of the fuel from the two Tantas to the Eutocius core, we can use that to complete most of the Minmus capture burn. We use the lander\u0027s monoprop engines to finish it. Afterwards we can decide whether we want to land on Minmus, head back to Kerbin using RCS in dripped-dry Luzhins, or....\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Or,\u0022 Shepgee interjected, \u0022we could talk Gene into sending us some fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0170_eutocius1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0170_eutocius1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eutocius was only the second craft launched atop the seven-engined Cantemir launch vehicle, but I could tell something was amiss as soon as the first set of boosters were jettisoned. Whereas Bernoulli Station had made it to orbit with fuel to spare (at a higher orbit and an extra 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA inclination), the Eutocius needed to use its own fuel supply to circularize to just over 74km. And yet their mass was supposedly similar. (Turns out I forgot to include the mass of the lander and its monoprop.... Oops.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0177_eutocius1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0177_eutocius1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo partially correct this oversight I topped off the fuel in the Eutocius from the first Luzhin\u0027s launch vehicle. This launch, Luzhin 4, brought mission pilot Sigsey and mission commander Shepgee to the ship that would be their home for the next 33 days. As the Eutocius itself was in a 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA orbit, this launch was due-east.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0184_luzhin4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0184_luzhin4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne orbit later and they met up with the Eutocius.

A few orbits later and they had docked up with the Eutocius, on the port opposite from the Luzhin 4. At this point I knew I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to complete the capture at Minmus, but didn\u0027t want to throw off the symmetry of the craft by sending it up early. So I sent the Eutocius 1 off to Minmus and set about preparing the Eutocius 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0218_eutocius1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0218_eutocius1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eutocius 2 was little more than a fuel and monoprop tanker, but it was heavy enough to also require a Cantemir launch vehicle. The grounds crews robbed the Cantemir that was being prepared for the second Bernoulli Station (at the insistence of Gene), much to the anger of the Bernoulli team. This would likely delay the second Bernoulli Station by several dozen m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths or perhaps even a full year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0236_eutocius2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0236_eutocius2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eutocius 2 spent very little time in orbit, and burned for Minmus at the first opportunity.

They had spent their time surveying the surface and selecting an initial set of landing sites, and Haloly and Shepgee were selected as the first crew of two to land on Minmus. They set out shortly after the launch of the Eutocius 2 was confirmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0252_eutocius1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0252_eutocius1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike their M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landings, no one on Kerbin was watching aside from the kerbals in mission control. An extra-band UHF station on the Central Continent had tried to pick up the broadcast, but was blocked by the government\u0027s ban on the agency. None of that bothered Shepgee and Haloly, though, who were busy making their final approach to the Minmus Flats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0259_eutocius1a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0259_eutocius1a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing site was chosen basically at random, just the first equatorial flat that happened to be in sunlight when they had undocked from the station.

He scratched at the surface with his mittens, disappointed to find that Minmus too was not made of cheese. Shepgee followed him out shortly thereafter, flag in hand and ready to impale the pristine surface of Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I hereby name this place the Mint Green Bay.\u0022 He stabbed the ground roughly with the flag pole, causing a series of cracks to spread across the flats and pushing him briefly from the surface. He stared blankly at the flag for a moment, then realized what it was that\u0027d been bothering him for the entirety of the trip. \u0022So, why are we still using this flag if we\u0027ve been blacklisted by the government?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0265_eutocius1a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0265_eutocius1a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey gathered up samples and made observations of the flats and nearby slopes, then moved on to the second of their planned landing sites. Shepgee let Haloly take over duties as pilot, taking a short nap in the backseat of the lander. He also let Haloly plant the next flag at the \u0022High Lowlands,\u0022 though he did at least get out of the lander to help with collecting samples and to join in for the photo-op. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20140914_ksp0279_eutocius1a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220140914_ksp0279_eutocius1a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it was a quick trip back to the station.

No? It was back when I was just a tiny kerbal, big enough to argue with my dad but too dumb not to.\u0022 Haloly shifted in his seat a bit and strapped in. \u0022So this one night we\u0027d had a pretty big fight about some idiotic little thing I\u0027d done the day before, so I took his bike and ran off into the woods.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So how\u0027d the police get involved in that one?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The old kerb called the cops on me, that\u0027s how.

So here I was, cruising along, cooling off from the argument, and this police dropship appears out of nowhere in front of me. The hot-headed adolescent I was decided to just speed past them.\u0022 The combination of the two ships started to roll as they caught the upper parts of the atmosphere. This probably wasn\u0027t the sanest reentry method, but it was the only way they could guarantee they\u0027d both land near to each other. Shepgee armed the decouplers as Haloly continued with his tale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So we had a bit of a chase. I made it halfway across the continent before they managed to box me in.

All sorts of fascinating systems to talk to, from the lowly little ones around Kerbin to the giants that rested on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Yet the network had grown silent as Thabit ventured forth. The Messenger became the sole voice in the wilderness. The Messenger, and that dumb brute of a tug that was carrying Thabit to Eve. Thabit felt very alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first The Messenger would pass Thabit\u0027s memos on to Kerbin. Occasionally Kerbin would respond with a thank you, or even a request for more.

Allowed to go down to the surface to get data. Thabit was perfectly happy in orbit though, as orbit was where Thabit belonged. Here, on high, where Thabit could observe Eve, Gilly, and the mighty Sun. Orbit meant Thabit might one day return home. Then Thabit wouldn\u0027t be so alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E193 days.

The Tug would call Thabit from Eve\u0027s surface with more reports, reports which Thabit could only reject. \u0022No room, my friend.\u0022 The Tug always sounded sad when Thabit disconnected.

Oomph.\u0022 Haloly hit a particularly nasty bump, causing the entire van to rattle and creak. Shepgee glared at him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?

Thanks to the Asteroid system from 0.23.5 I can set the \u0022Discovered\u0022 state of those craft to -1 with an infinite lifetime and they go back to being uncontrolled. Just like asteroids.

When I saw how absurd the failure penalties were with the sliders at 1000% I quickly moved them back to 100% (by editing the save file). An example: One contract advance was for 20 funds, the payout 30 funds, but the penalty was somewhere around 32,000 funds. Just absurd. I have also used the in-flight settings menu to allow a temporary \u0022Revert to VAB\u0022 after one of my rockets phased through the launchpad and exploded before launch.

Great mod, but the base unit of construction time is a 24 hour day, so I cut that by 1/4 to match Kerbin. I then disabled the slow tech unlocking (because long research times don\u0027t make sense for this universe). Now that I\u0027ve played through the first several missions I\u0027m considering bumping the construction time back up, as even with 3 1.2-rated High Bays in the VAB it\u0027s only taking a day to build almost everything I\u0027ve launched. Part of that is due to the inventory parts effect, but ultimately it looks like the mod was already well balanced before I started tweaking with it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that the mods and changes are listed in this thread\u0027s second post as always.

As they launch things and put them into the universe I\u0027ll copy them to the canonical save and set the ownership just as I did for the pre-existing craft. Occasionally I\u0027ll need to copy things back to the \u002219th\u0022 save, and will likewise have to set the item ownership. Not the most ideal situation, but I\u0027d rather not set up something insane like a Dark Multiplayer server or something even more complex. Besides, copy and paste is an easy thing to do.

We\u0027ll work our way through flight and equipment test until we\u0027re sure we know what we\u0027re doing. Only then will we put a Kerbal into orbit. As is customary, Jebediah Kerman of Jeb\u0027s Junkyard will be making the first flight.\u0022 Milzer motioned towards Jeb, who was leaning against the side wall of the conference room, arms folded, exuding the very essence of cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilvin, oblivious to the importance of the moment that had just passed, spoke up. \u0022So, why exactly are we starting over?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because Wernher is still unaccounted for, and all of our engineering know-how was locked away inside of his brain. Especially after Linus here,\u0022 Milzer motioned to Meldo\u0027s new intern, resplendent in white lab coat, \u0022left to finish his degree. We have a basic understanding of how things work, but we\u0027d rather be cautious than dead.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Next is Project Aspdin. Officially Aspdin will see the launch of the first of our new generation of stations. Unofficially, Aspdin may be the first act of space piracy in the history of Kerbin.\u0022 Milzer clicked the clicker and an image of Bernoulli Station ka-clunked into existence. Several kerbals in the room gasped audibly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We built Bernoulli. We launched Bernoulli. We lived in Bernoulli. And now we\u0027re going to take it back. Assuming it\u0027s still in one piece, that is. So far we\u0027ve been unable to establish a comms link with the onboard systems, so it\u0027s possible there\u0027s no power. Regardless, once we\u0027ve recovered the station we\u0027re going to proceed with the Phase 2 expansion plan.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Third and final is Project Monier, which will see our return to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus.\u0022 Ka-clunk, and Eutocius Station appeared. \u0022Like Bernoulli we\u0027re going to reclaim Eutocius, and like Bernoulli we\u0027ve got expansion in mind. We\u0027re planning to use this little outpost to reinforce the next chapter of our space program\u0027s history. Any questions?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah.\u0022 Neilny stood and pointed at the kerbal standing next to Jebediah. \u0022Why is he in a hazmat suit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003ERebel \u002218th\u0022\u003C/span\u003E Kerbal Space Agency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELake Fortunate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 76 day 334\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Does anybody know how many times he\u0027s done this?\u0022 Haloly glanced over his shoulder to see Loald shrugging a response to Derbald\u0027s question. He looked back just in time to see Jeb\u0027s liftoff. This was a pretty simple mission and Haloly only had one objective to track. The \u0022Best and Greatest\u0022 records keeping organization wanted them to break the 5km altitude record, again. As Director of Mission Operations it was up to Haloly to let Jeb know when he\u0027d crossed the line and could head back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141010_ksp0020_smeaton1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141010_ksp0020_smeaton1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepgee had temporarily taken over as Flight Director. Just a few days before the launch he was appointed Program Director by popular vote and recognized by the the League, but continued to refer to himself as a test pilot. Milzer, the actual Flight Director, was busy preparing for his flight in the Smeaton 2. Meldo, who had taken over as Chief of Research and Design in Wernher\u0027s absence, was slated to fly on Smeaton 3. None of the newly appointed officers were willing to relinquish their old duties, a good thing since they were desperately short on qualified pilots. Haloly was trying to decide if he was going to keep his spot on the Smeaton 4 or let one of the rookies take it. He watched Jeb\u0027s altimeter cross the 5km mark and waved to Shepgee. Shepgee nodded and tapped Gusbrett on the shoulder. Gusbrett, the only other pilot from their group and today\u0027s CAPCOM, relayed the information to Jebediah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Smeaton 1, Lake here.

He was coming down too far towards the front of the building to land on the helipads, and even too far forward to make the building itself. For a few moments no one was sure if he was going to hit the to of the VAB or scrape along the door. Some wiggling and wrangling and Jeb managed to bring the Smeaton 1 down safely mere centimeters from the edge of the main building\u0027s roof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lake, VAB here. Smeaton 1 has landed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Jebediah, again, claimed the Vehicle Assembly Building in the name of Courage and Stupidity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141010_ksp0027_smeaton1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141010_ksp0027_smeaton1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree days later and everyone was gathered again in Mission Control, running through simulations for Meldo\u0027s upcoming flight in the Smeaton 3. Milzer\u0027s flight had gone as well as Jeb\u0027s, setting a new 11km altitude record, though he opted to not land on the VAB. They pooled the gains from the first two flights and hired on researchers from the greater League of Eight. There was only so much they could do in-house, not having the full resources of the planet behind them, and they need the research boost. It was going to leave them tight on Funds for a while, but creepy new accountant ensured them they\u0027d be ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141010_ksp0031_strategy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141010_ksp0031_strategy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer had just finished running the team through the launch simulation when something on the TV caught his attention. It was video of a kerbal, clearly in orbit, slowly crawling out of his capsule and into the void. A familiar face looked up at the camera and smiled. \u0022Hey, is that Dudry?\u0022 He motioned towards the TV, getting Shepgee\u0027s attention. Shepgee fished around in the mess at his station, found the remote, and unmuted the set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Reports from Cape Kerbal today where Dudry Kerman has become the first Kerbal to orbit Kerbin. Flight Director Gene Kerman says the mission was a resounding success, and is confident they can beat the rebels of the League of Eight to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u0022 The video cut to a clip from the press conference, where Gene was describing the Kestrel 1 and Dudry\u0027s flight. They watched the broadcast for a few minutes before Shepgee muted the TV and tossed the remote back atop his station\u0027s junk pile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141011_ksp0084_dudry.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141011_ksp0084_dudry.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I guess we know what happened to Gene and Dudry now.\u0022 Shepgee shook his head. \u0022What do they mean by \u0027first?\u0027\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, Shepgee, everyone knows Haloly was first.\u0022 Milzer smiled jokingly at Shepgee, eliciting an angry glare. Shepgee was about to quip back when Meldo burst into mission control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shepgee, Milzer, did you see the TV!?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your a bit late to the party, Mel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm. So I guess you were right about Dudry. A good bet that Barting guy is there too.\u0022 Milzer scratched at the back of his head, watching the silent TV and thinking. \u0022Doesn\u0027t explain Gene.
