Common enough that it\u0027s in the FAQ on this forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many possible causes, from overloading the front gear, to wheelbarrowing from having your rear gear lift off first, to \u0022automotive drag\u0022.

And I suspect it is also the most common problem. So, the basic point of it is that to achieve passive directional stability what you need is to have more drag in the back end than at the front end. The \u0022friction\u0022 of the wheel system does not take care of this for you automatically. So what you do is, in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, select the front gear, open the context menu, click the button to switch to Manual Friction, and set the friction to .5 or below.

But you haven\u0027t shared the craft file, so it\u0027s guessing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAre your engine pods and main gear actually attached to the wings, or are they attached to the body and offset to the sides? Wings have very flexible connections by default, and those heavy pods with powerful vectored thrust can cause the wings to independently flex higher and lower, making it veer off course. It\u0027s better to attach engines and gear to the body and offset them, so the wing flexibility doesn\u0027t affect them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt looks like your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is very far aft. As your plane picks up speed and lift increases, it will tend to want to lift its butt before the nose, at which point the main gear have less and less contact with the tarmac - leading to the dreaded wheelbarrowing. Consider designing the plane with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E a bit closer to the body center, or add flaps ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E that move the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E forward during take off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have placed your main gear in series instead of parallel, and with a good bit of distance between them. Additionally, they are very far aft as well. What this does is create considerable difficulty for the plane to rotate, adding additional stress to the aft gear, which also causes them to \u0027buckle\u0027 slightly in random directions. This too will make the plane veer off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFinally, as you accelerate and get near to take off speeds, aerodynamic forces start to overwhelm gear friction/steering, and it\u0027s actually your rudders taking over. But these too look to have very little leverage in your design... if I\u0027m not mistaken, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is quite far aft and very close to them, leaving very little arm to work with. Mk3 parts have quite high drag when even slightly off perfect prograde, so the whole body in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E probably create strong yaw forces than the rudders, with so little leverage, may not be able to correct sufficiently.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimmidii","CreatedById":9293,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-14T04:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not certain, but it looks like the fuel tanks attached to the wing tips might be slightly misaligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they\u0027re not pointing perfectly forward it might be contributing to your problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use absolute rotation, rather than relative,\u00A0to make sure they\u0027re aligned correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fulgur","CreatedById":195204,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-14T06:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!
