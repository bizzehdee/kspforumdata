But I would like to see the research become less boring and grindy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I thought of would be to give the first biome\u0027s research on a new planet the most science, with a diminishing return as you visit new biomes due to you having a lot of knowledge about the planet already. Another cool thing could be massive soil samples, in which you could select how much material you wish to hold but it\u0027ll increase the mass of your ship. That way, having a larger rocket could improve the amount of science you get from soil samples (at a diminishing return on the volume, of course). And some soil types may be more or less dense. Also, excess soil that has been heavily researched and isn\u0027t valuable for science might be something you could sell--another way to collect extra funds. This could last a lot longer than the scientific value before a particular sample type diminishes significantly in value, but might take a lot of volume and mass to accumulate a significant wealth from it, especially if you aren\u0027t managing your cost margins very effectively!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also was thinking that the experiment tools should be available early on, but without giving the top amount of science for their use. Later unlocks, instead of giving you the tools, could give you research methods that enable you to collect more science when using the tools. This, along with earlier structural elements and docking ports, will grant a better permanence to your huge spacecraft and stations, allowing you to continue using those old scrapheaps instead of having to dispose of and replace everything just because you unlocked new tech.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
