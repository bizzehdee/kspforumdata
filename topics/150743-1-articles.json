The argument is that the amount of science you return should NOT be penalized because of the signal quality, but that it should just take more time to transmit. (e.g. Instead of 5 seconds at 100% quality, it\u0027d take 10 seconds at 50% quality.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you first topic of discussion (quality) is a tangent and your second (signal delay) has no bearing on the topic at hand.

You\u0027re\u00A0telling us that no atmo, no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo atmosphere, no signal weakening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget plasma blackouts though...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe signal spreads out with distance, and so the signal gets weaker. It happens with antennas, but very little with\u00A0satellite dishes. So, the signal should get weaker with the red and white antenna and the high gain antenna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Also, transit time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay. So you want there to be a transit time for signals. Either have crews on you spaceship or invest hours in a video game planning, organizing, programming, revising and sending a science and maneuver sequence, only to find out that you probe already burned up. What\u0027s wrong with that picture?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, the problem is transit time for signals from Kerbin to Duna is about 3 minutes. Waiting three minutes to turn on the frickin\u0027 wheels is not acceptable, at least for a video game.
