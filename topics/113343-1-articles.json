Later, the fairings on interplanetary probes also disappeared.\n\nI have also consistently observed the tank butts from the abovementioned mod to disappear, leaving the engine similarly hanging at a distance from the tank.\n\nFinally, I observed the behavior of a 6.25 m NTR on a 1.25 m tank while putting a probe into a polar munar orbit. The tank but on it remained in place for the duration of transit, but once I switched to and from another munar satellite, the butt was gone.\n\nNo, it does not happen in LKO.\n\nUPDATE: Glitch still present for tankbutts in 1.0.4.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T20:38:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DDE**"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-27T21:31:44Z","Content":"Known bug.
