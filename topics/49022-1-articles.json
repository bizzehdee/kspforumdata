I\u0027ve got a heavy payload, more or less the core structure of a space station that I\u0027m trying to get into orbit. The lifter tends to break apart in odd ways each time and despite my best efforts I can\u0027t alter it enough to prevent it from randomly happening during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the contraption, with gratuitous use of struts to keep it from wobbling. I use a set of 2x2 panels as a pusher plate to keep the engines from causing any problems with the top half (the station itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi44.tinypic.com/mijith.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mijith.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s got a total of 5750 Delta-V and it uses asparagus staging to drop the orange tanks in sets of 4 as it lifts.

Turning off the outboard gimbals and transferring fuel from the top orange tank into my bottom center orange tank during flight was enough to get it into orbit where the atomic engines could take over and finish out.
