I might release a beta some time during the week, I need to have a clear and sort of my folders and make sure that everything works without Hyperedit and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E (I\u0027m going to add rr configs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your query about science values, Dusk and Olei have Biome maps. They\u0027re relatively easy to make (take the colormap and have a low colour depth so everything is only 8 or so colours for the science values). I really want to have the biome maps and science values sorted before the beta, so people can use the planets in career mode!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Side note) About the colour schemes, they\u0027re generally correct but very rough, especially for Niebos. I\u0027m a terrible \u0027artist\u0027 and I have to rely on the Heightmap for colours (low points are all one colour, high points also, maybe gradients at some places). I\u0027m hoping I can improve the look of the planets further down the line (I\u0027m sure the older ones will get a colouring overhaul at some point)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as for DM Science, Karbonite/Kethane and whatnot, that may be later down the line. The mod is only developed by myself and I have limited time in the week (only around 2-3 hours a day!), but I can hopefully assure you that the planets\u0027 configs will be suited for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E/SVE, the most common science mods (probably DM science) and *possibly* Karbonite/resource mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-28T22:44:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2017 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gamel0rd1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T00:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was actually talking about science definitions, as in the usually-unique messages that appear whenever you do a science experiment.
