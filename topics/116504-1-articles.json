Went to the map screen and saw an extra moon of Kerbin just inside Minmus. A moment later I was landing on it and then the rest of the dream was a pretty awesome Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion game session.\n\nIt was one of those funny dreams where even the most insane context-change makes perfect sense. I got lost in a catacomb and ended up confused because I couldn\u0027t buy radial decouplers from the bartender at the Bloated Float. Then someone gave me a tape recorder and a roll of paper without saying why and then I woke up.\n\nWhen I work out how, I\u0027ll upload this dream to GitHub or something because it was pretty awesome.\n\nSo sleepy."},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T18:06:49Z","Content":"Out of curiosity, how many hours you got on both games?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T18:31:35Z","Content":"Ha ha I just had a dream the other week I was doing the horizontal mombo with a girl and I was pumping my AP up each time I trust. I ended up making it to Miniums before I ran out of delta V (and yes I could see my fuel going down with each thrust). I remember being really disappointed because it was like a 15 minute \u0022burn\u0022 and it was really inefficient."},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T20:49:06Z","Content":"Works with Crusader Kings 2 as well. Should I send Bob to the administration building to increase tax income? What happens if Jeb dies? Will Valentina take over as queen or do I have gavelkind succession law and the space program is split between all eligible Kermans? Do I raid Mun\u0027s stronger defenses or do I risk to go farther out conquer Minmus for easy pickings? Do I wait and train new troops from LKO or can I afford to hire expensive mercenaries from the astronaut complex?"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:23:46Z","Content":"I suppose Kerbals are to blame for the Space Sphere crashing into a random house outside Whiterun in Skyrim, then.

Scary .... i tell ya. And there was James bond, goldeneye 5th mission i think survelance where you see Borisin teh game and run around inside the bunker, yup I was there, bad times. \n\nNowadays if i found myself in space dreaming i\u0027d probably freak out. \n\nWorst yet : Last week had a nightmare my car got stolen, thank god I was dreaming!!

Started playing it a little over a year ago.\n\nOblivion -- I have absolutely no idea, been playing it a lot on and off for 8 years, it\u0027s my favourite game outside of KSP. If I had to guess I\u0027d say probably 8000\u002B hours. It\u0027s an illness. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Probably got a couple thousand hours on Skyrim too."}]}
