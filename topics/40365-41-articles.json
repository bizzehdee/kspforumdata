Using nuclear reactors, especially unupgraded ones is counterproductive. You will need both high Isp and thrust to capture into orbit with burns costing 5000 m/s dV, and lasting longer than some encounters. My Prometheus craft that is orbiting Moho now? I had to warp three times ahead of the planet so i could bleed some velocity each time when i got encounter lasting barely couple of minutes.
