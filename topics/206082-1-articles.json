Just now, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/-_EMSuFD7lk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis video\u003C/a\u003E was posted and got me thinking about it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thought is that if there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the shadowed surface should be in total darkness, other than whatever planetshine comes from the daytime side of the ring, which I don\u0027t think should be that much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA point was raised about the ring being broken and allowing more light through, but I\u0027m still not sure if that would cause enough diffusion to light it up very well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I\u0027m not a real scientist and can\u0027t back any of this up with math, I thought I\u0027d ask here where real scientists hang out and might be able to help.
