If mechjeb doesn\u0027t feel right for someone by all means, they shouldn\u0027t use it. I used it for a short while when I started playing and it helped tremendously. But now that I\u0027ve learned how to land on moons, do interplanetary travels, and take off I don\u0027t really need it anymore. One thing I would add is that while you may feel that a dV calculator is not needed (which technically it isn\u0027t) and that it may take away gameplay elements by removing guesswork, guesswork is not fun for me. Like I said, I can be kind of dense and it\u0027s bad enough I am constantly reverting because I forgot a solar panel or an antennae halfway to duna, but guessing on dV would make me absolutely insane and is definately not what I consider fun, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not for somebody or that my way is the right way to play.

It will add a lot of dead weight and not much Delta-V.\u0022 and come up with a design that maybe relies on more efficient use of RCS - one great example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sandbox, I made a very Apollo like Mun Lander using pure stock. It had all the bells and whistles - ascent stage, with SRBs, booster stage, separate command and landing vehicles, and the Mun lander had a descent vehicle and the lander can could return to orbit on its own. Then it came down to RCS on the lander can. I asked \u0022This think needs to dock, but does it need RCS?\u0022 After thinking about it, the answer was \u0022No! The command module already has RCS and it can dock with the lander can assuming the lander has established a circular orbit near by.\u0022 No mod in the world would have helped me make this decision any quicker or easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, what are some of your favorite mods to use, because I would love to add some more to my list.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite mod is Kerbal Space Program 1.0.2 (Ha!

It\u0027s a practical planning issue that we would face in the real world. For me the value of KSP is the orbital mechanics (even if they are \u0022only\u0022 using patched conics), not dealing with logistics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try stuff. I experiment. I build and launch things to see what they are capable of. Having a good understanding of the maths (which I have learned through KSC without any mods) really helps drive my individual designs. For instance, I will ask - \u0022Do I really need RCS? It will add a lot of dead weight and not much Delta-V.\u0022 and come up with a design that maybe relies on more efficient use of RCS - one great example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sandbox, I made a very Apollo like Mun Lander using pure stock. It had all the bells and whistles - ascent stage, with SRBs, booster stage, separate command and landing vehicles, and the Mun lander had a descent vehicle and the lander can could return to orbit on its own. Then it came down to RCS on the lander can. I asked \u0022This think needs to dock, but does it need RCS?\u0022 After thinking about it, the answer was \u0022No! The command module already has RCS and it can dock with the lander can assuming the lander has established a circular orbit near by.\u0022 No mod in the world would have helped me make this decision any quicker or easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite mod is Kerbal Space Program 1.0.2 (Ha!
