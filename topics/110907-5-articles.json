That\u0027s why I prefer stock at least.\n\u003E I honestly view things like mechjeb as cheating, but when that was my sig I got reported \u0022multiple times\u0022. There are no depths of depravity mod players wont go to.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also you absolutely do not need dv or anyother KER numbers added to the game to play it. I manage just fine. I agree with [this article](http://www.pcgamer.com/kerbal-space-program-dev-on-random-solar-systems-the-joy-of-failure-and-the-cult-of-steam/), where Harv says \u0022In the end, it takes away a gameplay element because it takes some of the guesswork and some of the trial and error and figuring out for yourself what the delta-V is. It might take some of the magic away.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E Remote tech and TAC and KAS might be fun, but I enjoy the game Squad made, just as they made it\\*.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*With the exception of chatterer and EVE. I like my game to look and sound pretty. Forgive me for cheating.\n\nInteresting points, I do believe the only person you would be cheating is yourself out of some fun! If mechjeb doesn\u0027t feel right for someone by all means, they shouldn\u0027t use it. I used it for a short while when I started playing and it helped tremendously. But now that I\u0027ve learned how to land on moons, do interplanetary travels, and take off I don\u0027t really need it anymore. One thing I would add is that while you may feel that a dV calculator is not needed (which technically it isn\u0027t) and that it may take away gameplay elements by removing guesswork, guesswork is not fun for me. Like I said, I can be kind of dense and it\u0027s bad enough I am constantly reverting because I forgot a solar panel or an antennae halfway to duna, but guessing on dV would make me absolutely insane and is definately not what I consider fun, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not for somebody or that my way is the right way to play. Different strokes for different folks."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:01:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not that there is anything wrong with it, that\u0027s how I started too before I knew better.\n\nLoaded statement is loaded! =p First, this statement comes with a built in assumption that playing with mods is inherently better than playing without. I challenge that assumption, and give you a modification - it\u0027s better for you, because you find more enjoyment out of the mods than you would otherwise.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Then I did know better and I still stubbornly stuck with stock because didn\u0027t want to deal with mods in case the were too complicated (before I figured out it is pretty much just drag and drop into gamedata folder).\n\nStill a heavily loaded statement =p. This time with two built in assumptions: 1. That mods are better than stock, and 2. that the mods were too complicated. It\u0027s true that some mods make the game more fun for you, but not necessarily for everyone. A well built mod should be easy, and add the kind of value someone is looking for in KSP that KSP stock does not already give them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally I broke down and got mechjeb and a couple others like chatterer. But since then I\u0027ve been grabbing up mods like candy. I just want to try them all and I\u0027ve only scraped the surface. So my question is are there people who play a completely stock game and why?\n\nYes, and I\u0027m one of them. In fact I post four videos per week of stock KSP play on my YouTube Channel. Now, that we\u0027ve disabused ourselves of the built in assumptions in the very loaded statements above (again... =p) let\u0027s get to the heart of your question: Why would anyone play stock when there are such great mods that make game-play so much easier?\n\nAnswer: Because I want to focus on a particular style of game-play, one that KSP stock happens to offer. \n\nMy comparison:\n\nWith Stock - I have to experimentally try different rocket configurations, sometimes failing to achieve a goal several times, before I come up with a design that succeeds. Along the way I\u0027ve learned a great deal about rocket design, and how certain things affect rocket performance, when and why to use certain design techniques to overcome the limitations. \n\nWith Mods - I would just be given a number, and rely too heavily on what that number said instead of discovering for myself why things behave like they do.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Because there are certain mods I just can\u0027t do without.\n\nI submit the following possibility - you can\u0027t do without the mods, because you have not learned how to play without them. It\u0027s possible, I\u0027ve been doing it since just before Science Mode came out. What I think is more accurate for you to say is - you can\u0027t imagine having as much fun without the mods as you do with them. Which is a perfectly valid thing to say!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Engineer for deltaV and other useful info (I upgraded from mechjeb after I learned all the fancy maneuvers and such)\n\nIn my case specifically, rather than rely on what some gauge tells me my Delta-V is, I learn what a particular rocket is capable of by testing it. Sometimes its maiden voyage is just a fly by and return trip. Often times I end up stranding someone while being shy by maybe 100 dV. For me, failing to master every flight the first time is much of the fun, and I couldn\u0027t do without that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal alarm clock (seriously, how can you play without this?)\n\n\u0022Warp To\u0022 removes my need for this mod. When I have multiple missions going at the same time - I\u0027m going to watch them carefully at the tracking station. But my style is usually one mission at a time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E KAS/KIS (very useful for all sorts of things)\n\nI don\u0027t even know what these do. I\u0027ve been able to play career modes all the way to a Jool grand tour without them. =)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have also started using TAC (life support) remote tech (more realistic antennas) outer planet mods, not to mention all of the parts mods I\u0027ve added.\n\nI understand the allure of more realism in KSP such as life support. It\u0027s a practical planning issue that we would face in the real world. For me the value of KSP is the orbital mechanics (even if they are \u0022only\u0022 using patched conics), not dealing with logistics.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So once again, not to say anything against anybody who plays stock but I do want to know how you do without a mod like kerbal engineer or kac?\n\nI try stuff. I experiment. I build and launch things to see what they are capable of. Having a good understanding of the maths (which I have learned through KSC without any mods) really helps drive my individual designs. For instance, I will ask - \u0022Do I really need RCS? It will add a lot of dead weight and not much Delta-V.\u0022 and come up with a design that maybe relies on more efficient use of RCS - one great example:\n\nIn sandbox, I made a very Apollo like Mun Lander using pure stock. It had all the bells and whistles - ascent stage, with SRBs, booster stage, separate command and landing vehicles, and the Mun lander had a descent vehicle and the lander can could return to orbit on its own. Then it came down to RCS on the lander can. I asked \u0022This think needs to dock, but does it need RCS?\u0022 After thinking about it, the answer was \u0022No! The command module already has RCS and it can dock with the lander can assuming the lander has established a circular orbit near by.\u0022 No mod in the world would have helped me make this decision any quicker or easier.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, what are some of your favorite mods to use, because I would love to add some more to my list.\n\nMy favorite mod is Kerbal Space Program 1.0.2 (Ha! Another loaded question! =p )\n\n=p Don\u0027t be offended by my poking at these loaded statements. I just like pointing out phrases that have assumptions built-in, so we can all know what the heck we are really talking about. Your core question really is a good one, \u0022I have the most fun with Mods, and can\u0027t imagine playing otherwise. How do vanilla players get the same enjoyment out of KSP as I do?\u0022\n\nMy Answer: \u0022I enjoy figuring things out through experimentation and failure more than I would if I relied on a number given to me by a dashboard of some kind.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T22:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:11:17Z","Content":"2 or 3 cp more:\n\n- mods can\u0027t be without stock to be\n\n so on playin stock most of the time is a good way to help and contribute to both stock and mods as well as it\u0027s nice to play modded installs too.\n\n- as said also mostly see the game (as well as each mods) as an artwork (wich includes it\u0027s creator(s) sensibilities and devoted time) with choices made on purpose as updates goes in parrallel with time that could be spent polishing existing adding new thing by squad team, providing a nice moddable environnement is also a large part of this work in term of dev time sink that could have been spent elsewhere or not ...

If KSP was a MMO game then things would have been different but since it\u0027s not and your way of playing has zero influence on the outcome of my game, calling someone else\u0027s way of playing \u0027cheating\u0027 is just silly.\n\nAs for the original topic: I wouldn\u0027t mind playing stock at all and in fact I did for a long time before I got tired of doing the same calculations over and over again and got KER.

KOS gave me a good platform to toy around with PID controller theory.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T00:02:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**\n  \nit\u0027s 2 AM which affects my coherence"},{"CreatedByName":"Jr6150x","CreatedById":61112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T23:56:21Z","Content":"Yeah, and that\u0027s really why I live stock."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T23:56:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh you haven\u0027t?
