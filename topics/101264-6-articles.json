In the shuttle\u0027s tanks. It still ran out of fuel. \n\nI\u0027ve transfered the spaceplane into 120 km orbit (had to borrow some monopropellant from the station). If somebody wants, you can send there some fuel and get the craft home (if not, I\u0027ll have to finish this next time).\n\nBTW, the craft file for the shuttle is in SPH, so you\u0027re free to use it for whatever missions it seems fit. Payload capacity? The module was about 6 tons and it barely got to the station (but that\u0027s polar orbit). Payload capacity for bringing stuff down from orbit is at least 12 tons (and the shuttle has rather much spare fuel for maneuvering if launched empty). Yeah, this craft fully proves it - shuttles are the most useful for bringing payloads down, not up.\n\nSave file uploaded.
