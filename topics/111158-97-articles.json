It was probably different once upon a time, but the main jobs of newer moderators is just to experiment and handle low-risk moderation duties. Bigger jobs are usually handed off to higher-ups until said higher-ups are confident to sort of coach newer moderators through the steps of doing something bigger, like trimming a thread of forum-inappropriate content. It\u0027s entirely on-the-job training."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T01:57:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 minutes ago, munlander1 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How do you guys \u0022train\u0022 when you guys become mods. I don\u0027t think they just set you free after joining the irc chat.\n\u003E \n\nActually, that\u0027s basically what they do.  They pretty much just hand us the keys to the kingdom and say \u0022please try not to burn it down.\u0022  The strategy here is to be very careful to only recruit trustworthy people, and then *trust them*.\n\nIt\u0027s a self-regulating process.  The kinds of people they recruit as moderators are people that have already shown themselves to be careful, prudent individuals.  It\u0027s assumed that we\u0027re grown-ups who will know when we\u0027re out of our depth (which is pretty much everywhere at first) and ask for help.\n\nThere\u0027s a sub-forum specifically for moderators that only we can see, and it has its fair share of \u0022how-to\u0022 stickies.\n\nAlso, moderating is a consensus process.  There\u0027s some stuff that even a newly-fledged moderator can do pretty much unsupervised, like approving posts from newbies in the queue, or moving posts that are clearly in the wrong sub-forum, or hiding duplicate posts, that sort of thing.  For more \u0022serious\u0022 cases, like handing out warnings and infraction points, it\u0027s assumed that one will consult with the other mods before taking action like that (which we tend to do anyways, even after we\u0027ve been mods for a while).  We have our own IRC channel where we hang out, and most substantive moderator action is the result of a group decision.\n\n[EDIT] Ninja\u0027d by Tex."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T02:07:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E We have our own IRC channel where we hang out, and most substantive moderator action is the result of a group decision.\n\u003E \n\nThis is actually, safe to say, the key to the success of the moderation team. Often times, unless it\u0027s a minor issue such as moving a thread or even locking a necro, the moderators behave like a hive mind, and input from as many sources as possible contributes and eventually boils down to a conclusive action, executed by a single moderator. This prevents abuses of any kind, as moderators that have a prior interest in a troublesome spot will almost 100% opt out of the decision-making process to avoid corrupting any decision that is made. It is a very efficient, very careful, and most of all, a very effective system."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T02:30:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 minutes ago, Tex said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E moderators that have a prior interest in a troublesome spot will almost 100% opt out of the decision-making process to avoid corrupting any decision that is made\n\u003E \n\n^ This is a pretty important aspect of moderating.  \u0022You can moderate a thread, or participate in it, but not both.\u0022\n\nIt not only allows us to ensure the integrity of moderator decisions (by ensuring there\u0027s no conflict of interest)... but it also gives us the freedom to have \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.  Which is more important than you might realize.\n\nRemember that we\u0027re not just moderators.  We\u0027re *\u003Cu\u003Eforum users\u003C/u\u003E*.  If we had to be \u0022on duty\u0022 all the time, so that we couldn\u0027t actually participate... that would go a long way towards sucking all the joy out of the experience.  Which would be a problem, since moderators are *\u003Cu\u003Evolunteers\u003C/u\u003E*, and we have to make sure that people have a reason to say \u0022yes\u0022 if asked whether they\u0027d like to join the ranks.\n\nI know that I, for one, would have said a resounding \u0022no thank you\u0022 if becoming a moderator had meant that I couldn\u0027t be a regular forum user anymore.  Even Spider-Man needs to be Peter Parker most of the time, or he\u0027d go nuts.  Fortunately, it\u0027s not a problem.  I can just participate in the forums mostly as I would have done anyway if I\u0027d never been a moderator.  If there\u0027s a thread in which I\u0027m participating as a user, and I see something that I think needs moderator action, my recourse is simple:  I just report the post (same as any forum user might do), adding a comment that I\u0027m recusing myself due to my own participation, and let someone else handle it."},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T09:18:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, munlander1 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How do you guys \u0022train\u0022 when you guys become mods. I don\u0027t think they just set you free after joining the irc chat.\n\u003E \n\nBack when I joined there was a short induction, so a more experienced moderator (not necessarily a senior) walked you in the rules and tricks of the business. Then I could still keep asking any in the team whenever in doubt, and get advice on each case as those came. Of course there was also a guide, that I was instructed to read carefully (which I did), and some principles written \u0022in stone\u0022 coming from times old.\n\nSince the switch to IPS there is a newer guide showing how to do things in it, that\u0027s usually the first step for new mods. We actually keep a watch on new moderators, and often rush should they ask for help. When a more complex case comes, if they are around and not already on it, we like to get them involved so they can practice on it."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T12:34:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s Rule #1, which they drill into us right at the start of Moderator Boot Camp.\n\u003E \n\nThe Rule #1 *I*\u0027ve been taught was \u0022You do not talk about the...\u0022, um, wait.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, munlander1 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think they just set you free after joining the irc chat.\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t even remember exactly what it was, but in my case after joining the IRC I was sent to put out some mild fires.
