Bigger rockets experience proportionally less atmospheric drag when ascending through the atmosphere. Guidance and control systems don\u0027t have to make up as large a percentage of their mass, since the mass of a guidance computer is roughly the same for a huge or a tiny rocket. Bigger fuel tanks have proportionally less surface area for their volume and the walls are thicker- which makes them easier/cheaper to manufacture. AND, bigger fuel tanks also apparently experience less boil-off. The one *major* disadvantage large rockets have in real life, besides the logistics of getting them assembled and set up on the launchpad in the first place, is that it\u0027s significantly harder and more expensive to manufacture/design larger rocket engines- a problem that can handily be circumvented by using engine-clusters instead...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-17T09:38:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2014 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rabada","CreatedById":66044,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T18:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@NathanKell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been trying to build a very high DeltaV ion powered probe in a game using V8.0 of this mod.
