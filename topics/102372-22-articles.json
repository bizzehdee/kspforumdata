I just had a space camp that was supposed to run for 40 days. The station I was running the camp on is a working station, with lots of changes all the time. it was that lats few days of the camp, when I saw an EVA report pop up that I did not have. I popped my pilot out to grab the report, and the space camp timer was reset. Apparently that was the only pilot on the station at the time. Instead of just pausing the camp while the pilot was out, the contract was entirely reset, so now I have to wait another 40 days for it to complete. This ruined my schedule, as I had a space bus returning from the mun to pick up the camp and return them home (I try to stack missions as much as possible). Now I will be force to fly another mission in 40 days, and the bus mission i was running will only be half as efficient as it could have been, moving it from a profit generating run to a not so profit generating run (granted I still get to use the equipment it dropped off, but I was planning on fully covering the cost with the space camp reward).\n\nSo two things: Can we have the game simply pause the timer when a requirement is not met, instead of resetting to 0? and is there a way to edit the save to change the timer back to where it is supposed to be?\n\nEdit: I found some settings that may be what I want:\n\nCONTRACT  \n\n            {  \n\n                guid = 550f2703-24ae-4b63-89be-83282574fc1e  \n\n                type = ConfiguredContract  \n\n                prestige = 1  \n\n                seed = 1943887268  \n\n                state = Active  \n\n                viewed = Read  \n\n                agent = Kerbal Space Tourism  \n\n                deadlineType = None  \n\n                expiryType = Floating  \n\n                ignoresWeight = True  \n\n                values = 1585080,0,0,101112,0,0,25,62,1649006.23818754,64112.3981875113,0,0  \n\n                subtype = Tourism\\_SpaceCamp  \n\n                title = Hold a space camp  \n\n                description = Mortimer is constantly complaining about the cost of hiring new astronauts.

All portions of the mission complete except the location portion.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It occurs to me that, since locations are on the planetary body and the mission requires above 70K (which would be in space, obviously), that the system doesn\u0027t recognize me as being at the location since the biome would be \u0022low orbit\u0022 instead of the planet-based location. Possible?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No matter the cause, this makes the tourism overflights... well, un-doable.

That I have to be within 75Km of that waypoint, or that my altitude must be between 70Km (minimum for the mission) and 75Km (per this parameter)? Or maybe something else entirely?\n\u003E \n\nThere was a report that I haven\u0027t had to look at, and I think the distance on that VisitWaypoint parameter is bugged.
