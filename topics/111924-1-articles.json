Is it possible to add these in mid-flight. I\u0027m happy to have a crack at editing the persistence file if needs be.\n\nChris"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:00:06Z","Content":"Each actiongroup module is tailored to the craft with the command part that controls the craft by default. Separating the ship wont remove action groups for the vessel which that part is still on, but for any others. Simple; transcribe the action groups settings from the primary ship to the secondary ship with a bit of file editing. Each module is at the end of the list of parts, right above control state, I believe."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisD","CreatedById":144851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:26:14Z","Content":"I think I\u0027ll have a go at that then.
