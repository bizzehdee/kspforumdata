Separating the ship wont remove action groups for the vessel which that part is still on, but for any others. Simple; transcribe the action groups settings from the primary ship to the secondary ship with a bit of file editing. Each module is at the end of the list of parts, right above control state, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisD","CreatedById":144851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ll have a go at that then.
