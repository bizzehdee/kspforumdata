That makes sure you are properly in descent configuration before aerodynamic stress is applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond: reentry vehicle is too long and skinny; I\u0027d flatten her out, put it on a 2.5 m heatshield, and arrange things more laterally. There\u0027s a reason many reentry vehicles look like blunt cones; that provides a lot of drag and an aerodynamically stable vehicle. Take a look at Soyuz (the middle part is the reentry vehicle), Apollo, Gemini, the stock command vehicles; most are shorter than they are wide. Your reentry vehicle... didn\u0027t really stand a chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, if all else fails, consider sending a Kerbal along to take all the science off the vehicle and into his/her command pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it was a very good-looking probe, and it\u0027s a shame it burned up like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-30T22:13:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2016 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
