As long as it goes up, you\u0027ve done a good first step. Then the first milestone you want to reach is reaching a stable orbit. The atmosphere ends at an altitude of 70km, so you want your periapsis (the lowest point of your orbit) above 70km. Then, once you have done that, reaching and landing on the Mun or Minmus. Minmus is a bit harder to get an encounter with because of it\u0027s inclination, but once you\u0027re there, it\u0027s much much easier to land. A rocket going to Minmus needs less delta V than for the Mun. It\u0027s up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne tip though: don\u0027t overengineer.
