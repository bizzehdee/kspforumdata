There are two reasons for this, and I will explain them. First, I just thought it was friendlier than the badge sig. That was simple, but the second is... more complicated. The second reason is because of the new KSP aerodynamics of 1.0. I did the two challenges that I was talking about earlier in 0.90, which had a simpler model. The first reason grabbed at me forever, but the second reason only struck me tonight. So I hope you enjoy (or bear) my new sig.\n\nCheers, RAINCRAFTER.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T02:17:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T02:58:18Z","Content":"Okay...
