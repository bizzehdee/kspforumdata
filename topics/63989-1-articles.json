I use a heavy quite aerodynamic lander, weighting about 75t i think, which due to its inertia needs a lot of braking force. I added the large inflatable heat shield from DREC which generates enormous amounts of drag ... just enough. As you will see the high dynamic pressure warning lights up during the descent. The lander has about 9km/s DV according to Engineer, which is plenty with FAR. I had more than enough, launching from 1km ASL. The inability to avoid rough terrain made me take a few landing attempts (not exactly realistic but whatever .. they are Kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E) and actually some of the pics are from a test where i cheated the lander into Eve orbit.

I was lucky i didn\u0027t run out of fuel there! Totally eyeballed it and managed to aerocapture the whole IP drive section.
