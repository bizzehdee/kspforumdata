I can set up parts that will go outwards on 6 sides of a central cylinder, but nothing to connect what comes out of the sides to each other... I feel like I\u0027m explaining this very poorly but hopefully someone will get what I mean. Is it possible to do this? Or would they have used mods or something?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RunningGloves","CreatedById":59016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T12:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the assembly buildings you can rotate parts 90 degrees using WSAD, or 5 degrees using Shift\u002BWSAD.
