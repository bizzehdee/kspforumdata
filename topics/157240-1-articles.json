But instead of the 400 and something days it takes now for a year, imagine that it takes only four days, so that each day Kerbin moves 90 degrees around it\u0027s orbit. That means that in order to go from one sunrise to the next, Kerbin actually has to rotate the 360 degree for a full rotation, but then it has to keep going another 90 degrees in order to present the same spot on the surface to the sun. So if 360 \u002B 90 = 450 degrees takes 6 hours, then how long does it take to go 360 degrees compared to a stationary reference (ie the distant stars)?
