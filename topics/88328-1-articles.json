Currently, the only reasons we have to bring along kerbals are EVA and crew reports, and the science lab and that\u0027s it. The proposed kerbal experience system was an attempt to solve this problem, but its main feature, increases to thrust and ISP, were discarded as unrealistic. This leaves the kerbal expereince system as providing only benefits to science, funds, etc. This has two problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) We already have the Admin facility to modify how we recieve funds, science, and reputation, so this system wouldn\u0027t be adding anything new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This system doesn\u0027t really give sandbox players any reason to send manned missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I propose a new kerbals-as-autopilot system. Say there is a certain set of things that can be automated, such as landing, docking, executing a manuever node, etc. Then, if you, say, perform a docking with a kerbal in the capsule 10 times, then that kerbal is able to perform docking manuevers, automating the process for you. So, we get a reason to actually care about how experienced our kerbals are, and those who want an autopilot system can get one while simultaneously making sure you only get access to an automated procedure if you are experienced in it.

In fact, I think it\u0027s exactly the other way around - without life support requirements (as per the current stock game), why would you ever send a probe? Kerbals can perform loads more science than a probe can (Crew and EVA reports, soil samples, use the Science Lab to reset one-shot experiments, extract science from experiments for storing in the command pod for later retrieval, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo personally I would love to see more reasons to send probes. Yes I play with ScanSat, but that\u0027s not stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I also think having the Kerbals able to perform basic maneuvers would be cool. I haven\u0027t played with MechJeb so don\u0027t know what that\u0027s capable of, but if a (Pilot) Kerbal could follow a (set of) Maneuver Nodes (ideally even while in the background) that would really raise the bar and really make KSP feel like a Space Program with multiple simultaneous missions and the player being Misson Control (with the option to fly manually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why would the player fly manually? Well, because (Pilot) Kerbals just aren\u0027t very good - at least initially. But as they gain experience they would get better. This has been suggested MANY times by various people, so not claiming this as my idea. The point being, the beginning player would pretty much have to fly manually because otherwise most missions would be doomed to fail, but later in the game the repetitive tasks could be handed over to experienced Kerbal Pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does that tie into probes? Well, probes would execute maneuvers perfectly (within the limits of physics). On the other hand, probes cannot do a lot of the science, and perhaps probes would get much less reputation. Now you have a compelling reason to use Kerbals (MOAR SCIENCE and rep) and probes (cheaper, and can maneuver perfectly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue here is it\u0027s easy to \u0022cheat\u0022 - simply build a rocket with both Command Pod and a probe core. But it\u0027s up to the player, as always. Currently nothing prevents a player from installing MechJeb either..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
