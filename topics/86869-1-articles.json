Looked like a ton of parts were missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese parts are all welded parts that I created (a single part CFG file that combines multiple other parts) and now that Squad has altered the paths for a bunch of parts in their Gamedata folder all my references to the models are broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to fix the ones that were listed in the popups, and luckily I backed up my save file so no harm done. But is there a list somewhere of what parts had their paths changed? I would rather not go through all the dozens of welded parts I have, but I know roughly what parts I\u0027ve referenced so if the list of changed parts is around that would help a ton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked in the FAQ and ChangeLog and didn\u0027t see anything.
