And planets can have moons as well. Currently planets and moons do not orbit, and this may or may not change. I would like to have orbiting planets, but this could cause some extra complications for the game that do not really add to the enjoyment.\n\nThe game is less about your delta V and orbital characteristics and more about exploring and surviving.\n\nThe planets of the starting star system resemble our solar system\u0027s planets. But because of the scale of the game and planets it would be awkward to make a mini earth as the continents would not make any sense. Since when does Africa have a massive cave you can fly a spaceship into... Well it doesn\u0027t, but in the game there are big caves you can fly down into, which are spread around the surface of the earth like planet and many others. The earth like is about 1200 meters in diameter. Which sounds pretty small, but it still gives lots of area to explore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-01T00:23:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2016 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Exclipse**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:47:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, legoclone09 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, your ship is S.P.E.C.I.A.L.!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, how will the solar system be laid out?

I got a lot done in the damage system, which has been a big headache. Damaging parts is easy enough, but the things that need to happen when a parts breaks is a little more complex. For instance if a part had other parts connected to it that were not destroyed but are not visibly connected to the main section of the spaceship, they need to be set free from the main section and so on. Since I am using my own system for ship parts being connected (not using Unity3D\u0027s physics system for connections) and since parts can have multiple attachment points, this tends to get pretty complex quickly. I do feel like I got the most complex portion of it done though.\n\nSo next time I make a build available you should have spaceships that can fall apart!\n\nI also started a blog to keep track of my development for anyone who is interested.
