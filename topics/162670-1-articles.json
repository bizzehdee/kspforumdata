After getting one ridiculously easy \u0027Position Satellite\u0027 contract (equatorial, inclination = 0 degrees, Longitude of Ascending node = undefined, Argument of Periapsis undefined) I have gotten greedy for the easy money. Except the next contract is not nearly so easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo is there a tutorial or some hints on how to get a satellite into the right orbit. The one I\u0027m looking at is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApoapsis = 6,774,192 meters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeriapsis = 5,189,134 meters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninclination = 153.2 degrees\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLongitude of Ascending node = 255.1 degrees\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArgument of Periapsis = 26.7 degrees\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figured it would be like going to a slightly more eccentric version of Minmus, without the ability to actually set something as a target. So I started by first getting the orbit to roughly the correct Apoapsis and Periapsis and then trying getting the inclination right. But obviously from my failed efforts that was only half the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny hints?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks and regards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T03:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to Gameplay Questions, as it is seeking help rather than offering it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T04:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027ve got a nice reference sat up and running!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many methods but my choice would\u00A0be to try to first launch into the plane of final orbit. Which if you look in map view/tracking station, paying attention to the way the orbit line fades, is retrograde ---\u0026gt; you have to launch West instead of East. \u00A0It\u0027s also not directly West so the rocket might be hard to steer vs what you are used to, pack\u00A0at least 500dV extra worth of fuel.

Get the node to a 0.0 inclination using a standard burn before the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E (don\u0027t bother with a maneuver node, just burn). Then lock\u00A0prograde. Zoom in on your orbit vs. the satellite orbit. The most important point is the point where they are closest to each other. Burn prograde before you get to that point. This will slowly raise the part of the orbit just in front of you until it is even closer to the satellite orbit than it was before -- and it expands the other side of your orbit in exactly the right way at the same time. The nice thing is that you don\u0027t need to watch the whole orbit -- you just need to watch the little bit that\u0027s right in front of you. Stop burning before your orbit crosses the satellite orbit -- you want it really close, but not overlapping. Timewarp forward until you are almost to the closest point again, zoom in your view to see the gap between the two orbits, and then burn prograde again to make that gap as small as you can, and repeat. The whole process takes a tiny fraction of a satellite orbit to complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
