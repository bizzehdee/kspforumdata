However, if one does pop up, the rational way of integrating it into a manufacturing process would be to isolate the part of the process that requires microgravity and only send to orbit the specialized automated equipment to do that part of the job. Anything that doesn\u0027t require microgravity will still be performed on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI envision something like the X-37B or DragonLab for this. Launch it to orbit with your automated cristal-growing or zero-g-welding package on-board and retrieve it after landing 3 months later.

You could produce ingots of minerals, but to make anything useful out of them, you would need all sorts of minerals, chemical consumables, and equipment that is simply too complex to produce from a single asteroid. You might need some iron, but most parts will need specific tensile, mass or temperature propertires that will require titanium, glass, aluminium, copper or various alloys or plastics or composites. Some of these things might not be obtainable on any of the accessible asteroids. And how would you build something as simple as a printed circuit board, or a connector cable, or a rubber seal in space? Think about everything that a simple screw factory needs to outsource, from lubricants, filters and seals for the machines to chemicals for cleaning and finishing the parts. These are things that are cheap and easy to source on Earth, because you can order each component and consumable from specialized suppliers all over the world, but to make any complex products from scratch on an asteroid would require so much specialized equipment and tons of consumables that it simply isn\u0027t feasible in the foreseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-08T09:33:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2013 09:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T09:48:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I don\u0027t have to imagine as I work in a machine shop.

Cutting coolant is recycled with 0 lost, chips care recycled into new stock, replacement parts are made in space before they are needed. All oils, plastics, and rubbers now have synthetic variations that can be made in a chem lab. High end filters never die you just wash them in solvent which is then boiled recovering all the oil, solvent, and chips for more recycling.

Semiconductor fabrication is ALREADY very capital-intensive (the CHEAPEST new semicon plants cost on the order of a billion dollars, with the biggest ongoing project being in the realm of 12 billion), so, given the right environment, it might be possible to build an orbital facility of some nature for not much more than an existing ground-side facility. The upshot is, the cost of RUNNING a semicon plant is rather small. Downside is, the yield (actual amount of finished product they get for a given input) tends to hover around 30-40% (the exact figure is closely guarded). In space, even in a \u0022dirty\u0022 environment like that surrounding the ISS, I estimate that yields would increase significantly, because two of the major factors in semiconductor rejection (airborne particulates and gravity) would no longer be present. In addition, the microgravity environment would allow for the fabrication of significantly larger wafers (on the order of meters across, something which is impossible on Earth because they would bend and crack due to gravity, ruining the batch), which would drive down process costs and allow greater innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: the entire semicon production process, from beginning to end, would benefit from a 0G vacuum environment, with (with correct design) a capital cost not much more significant than that of building a terrestrial plant. Naturally, a high level of automation (something the semicon industry already does) is a must.
