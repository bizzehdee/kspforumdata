It\u0026#39;s just my experience that doing a really big upgrade less often gives me results that I prefer. So I am not really used to smaller budget computer purchases. That being said, there are a couple things you will want to keep in mind for your setup:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-- Will that graphics card fully support DirectX 12? This is something to research if you want to future-proof your PC better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-- The video card you selected only has 2GB of memory. If part of your upgrade plan is to run at a higher resolution, then you may want a card with more memory. Sometimes for a given GPU you can find different amounts of video card memory from different manufacturers. Also consider comparing to AMD models for the same tier - from one tier to the next nVidia and AMD often flip flop which has the better GPU for that tier.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-- You may also want to upgrade your RAM memory. Depending on how old your current modules are they may be a lot slower than current DDR3 kits. I doubt a change will be required for you, but it may help with performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-- I recommend you read up reviews and articles on Tomshardware.com, it\u0026#39;s my personal favorite for researching PC components, and it can help you make smarter selections. I\u0026#39;m not sure where you plan to make your purchase, but also read customer reviews if possible, they can help you to compare between things too.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TonyC","CreatedById":95836,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T10:22:41Z","Content":"\nThis build seems correct, however I suggest replacing the AMD CPU by an Intel one, they are more expensive but they are way better for KSP.

The size motherboard it will take - I [I]strongly[/I] doubt it takes a full ATX board. The make and model of the power supply, so you can judge how decent it is. How big a graphics card will fit. And what spaces for fans it has.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou might also check if your current mobo has overclocking options, information I found seems a bit unclear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nApart from the motherboard not fitting in the case that\u0026#39;s not an unreasonable set of upgrades. But as far as my thinking goes:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe graphics card is the weak point. A 750 Ti would already be a huge step up and it\u0026#39;s a great card capable of running just about anything at 1080p, but obviously pay more get more. I back Kelderek\u0026#39;s view that it\u0026#39;s not a card for higher resolution gaming.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nChanging the motherboard may cause Windows licensing issues, usually \u0022OEM\u0022 Windows is limited to the original board or a straight replacement. It\u0026#39;s also a load of work and a hardware expense.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending on uses the Core i3 might be all the processor you need, fast i3\u0026#39;s do really well in game benchmarks. But if you do want a CPU upgrade and you\u0026#39;re willing to buy one second-hand then consider an Ivy Bridge i5 or i7. CeX are my usual supplier for second-hand computer and gaming stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour chosen PSU is reasonable. Depending on what your other parts are you might be able drop the wattage a notch to save some money, but don\u0026#39;t buy cheap junk.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T13:25:50Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Camacha\u0027]Be sure to find out whether it is PCI or PCIe.

It does say it can fit Intel Core 2 Quad processors but I don\u0026#39;t know if they fit i3 or i5 processors.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo. It\u0026#39;s a socket 775 board with DDR2 RAM and hopelessly outdated. The newest CPUs for that board were released 2008 and they changed the sockets multiple times by now. You\u0026#39;d need to buy a new board and new RAM if you\u0026#39;d want to upgrade.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T16:58:41Z","Content":"\nWow, you missed a whole RAM generation, we are at DDR4 since Skylake. I definetly recommed an upgrade, i assume a complete rebuild is needed after such a long time.\n"}]}
