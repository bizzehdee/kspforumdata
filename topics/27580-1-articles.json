I tried to get the center of lift a little bit behind the center of mass. I found it quite difficult to turn the jet around. To go to the left(right) side I rolled over with q(e) and worked against the drag with w, so that the vector of thrust slowly moved to a different angle. Is there a better way to turn the jet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1273.photobucket.com/user/mastertorch/media/Test_flight_zpsf57549b7.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y418/mastertorch/Test_flight_zpsf57549b7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Test_flight_zpsf57549b7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T18:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like you\u0027ve placed an ASAS module on the plane. It will prevent the plane from turning, as it was made to keep rockets pointed in a consistent direction. Remove that and stick an avionics ASAS cone on the back of the fuselage, and you will find that SAS mode then helps steady the plane, but does not prevent it from turning, because avioinics was made for that very purpose. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"masTerTorch","CreatedById":65681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T19:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch better!
