In the top 3 stages, it was IMPOSSIBLE to gain the Delta-V required at the right time to complete a Hohmann transfer with Duna, because the rocket would spin faster and faster upwards in direct relation with the throttle of the mainsail engine I was using. I was far out of the atmosphere at the time, but I had to use \u0026lt;25% throttle in order to keep the stupid thing stable. The main payload was roughly 20 or so tons, which probably didn\u0027t outweigh the mass of the fuel tanks (at least 63 tons in S3, 27 tons in S4) so the center of mass was low. I had SAS and RCS, yet that was still not enough to overcome the weird spinning pitch force. There aren\u0027t any major model collisions on the ship either. I CAN NOT figure this out. Please help!
