I can install every mod except the mods that modify or add textures like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003EKSPRC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know \u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003EKSPRC\u003C/abbr\u003E is way outdated so I install everything itself. Not one single thing works. I\u0027m on \u003Cstrong\u003E1.2.2\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eand it does load the stuff but I never get clouds or shining on my rockets. I drag everything to the GameData folder and I installed ModuleManager too. Though not even the most mods I want need it. I hope you can help me, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
