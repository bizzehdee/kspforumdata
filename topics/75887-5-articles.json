Work continued on and off, with the release of 23.5 marking another \u0027yeah its not really showable yet\u0027. Yet here you came!

Basically, that specific bug was that raycasting, something that KSP is doing several times a second if you\u0027ve got an engine throttled up, and other times as well, was causing random crashes in win-64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I don\u0027t think Squad was putting a lot of effort into a win-64 executable until recently, because until recently, Unity wasn\u0027t stable enough on that platform for how KSP uses unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, it makes me sad how many people think there\u0027s some sort of conspiracy here or that SQUAD only bothered messing with it after someone on the forums felt like splicing some files from the Unity dev environment into his copy of KSP. The truth is that the results we see in the 64-bit thread are the \u003Cem\u003Eresult\u003C/em\u003E of work on SQUAD\u0027s part (and Unity\u0027s too, naturally), not the \u003Cem\u003Ecause\u003C/em\u003E of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened here was a positive feedback interaction between the devs and the community, and I don\u0027t see why some people have to immediately try finding fault in it somewhere. Us KSP players like to think of ourselves as more scientifically minded individuals, yet some of us will still jump to strange conclusions without taking the time to do the research and actually know what\u0027s going on before passing judgment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T20:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei run all stock. any benefits to running the 64 bit version?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore crashes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo really there\u0027s no in-game benefit to 64 bits.
