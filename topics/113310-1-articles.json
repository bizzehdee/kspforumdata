The only thing I really wanna do is make orbital telescopes. CactEye seemed a little more involved than Tarsier, seeing as how you have to replace some parts, but I\u0027m really open to either one. So without further rambling:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has anyone used both these mods, and if so is there one you liked better?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has anyone used one of these mods? If so, what were your impressions? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bonus Question: Would it make sense to have them together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to anybody who takes time to respond.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T12:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used CactEye 2, and I really love it. It makes science collection much easier and more fun - you feel like you are doing real science somewhat, because you are not just clicking things on a menu, but really do astrological science by just looking at things with a huge telescope. Combined with something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-(Version-1-21)-(KSP-1-02)-(6-16-2015)-New-Satellite-Contracts!-And-Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMission Controller 2\u003C/a\u003E that has repair and resupply mission, you can make money on your trip when you need to replace parts too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like TST. The telescopes are quite fun, and pretty too. Servos are great. You also get some cool utility things, like the Chemcam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
