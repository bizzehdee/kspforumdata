The only thing I really wanna do is make orbital telescopes. CactEye seemed a little more involved than Tarsier, seeing as how you have to replace some parts, but I\u0027m really open to either one. So without further rambling:\n\n-Has anyone used both these mods, and if so is there one you liked better?\n\n-Has anyone used one of these mods? If so, what were your impressions? \n\n-Bonus Question: Would it make sense to have them together?\n\nThanks to anybody who takes time to respond."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T12:22:15Z","Content":"I used CactEye 2, and I really love it. It makes science collection much easier and more fun - you feel like you are doing real science somewhat, because you are not just clicking things on a menu, but really do astrological science by just looking at things with a huge telescope. Combined with something like [Mission Controller 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-%28Version-1-21%29-%28KSP-1-02%29-%286-16-2015%29-New-Satellite-Contracts!-And-Parts) that has repair and resupply mission, you can make money on your trip when you need to replace parts too."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:47:55Z","Content":"I like TST. The telescopes are quite fun, and pretty too. Servos are great. You also get some cool utility things, like the Chemcam."}]}
