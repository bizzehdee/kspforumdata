I suspect that a tech tree has corrupted career or another mod is interfering in some odd way. I know it started after I added a mod becasue I was using a novapunch engine and strut that disappeared from my career game. I have tried loading new games and various trees. I suspect the only way to find the culprit will be to start all over and load each mod till I find the mod that interferes with the parts makes me wonder how many parts are actually missing..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
