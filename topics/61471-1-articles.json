But I have always had trouble reaching beyond Kerbin. Now I\u0027m not exactly a rocket scientist (actually I work on steam locomotives for a living) but I know enough to get by, know how to make orbits, can easily reach the Mun and back. Even had one mostly successful trip to Minmus (until my Kerbal got EVA happy and bounced along the ground for almost 6km before bouncing off a cliff and being killed, the lander is still there though...), I\u0027ve made one trip to Duna, but did not have enough fuel to make a decent orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided to go back to a stock game, rather then trying to keep up with mods, and also now using KMP (hence stock). But my biggest problem seems to come down to the size and possibly the style of my rockets. I\u0027d like to make a trip to Eve or Duna, but most of my rockets are too heavy at liftoff to get a good enough start to make it to any other planets beyond the Mun. The Mun has become routine for me, so its no longer a huge challenge as it once was....although one 215 M/S decent to the surface can change that. Anyway, I was sort of curious what people were using the stock game, and how they achieved orbit of other planets, and what their rockets look like. I\u0027m not looking to copy by any stretch, but I\u0027ve always sort of stuck myself to a very typical Apollo style rocket, and I was wondering if perhaps I need to rethink my designs a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The Wrong Stuff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fancycat","CreatedById":73684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T09:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had a few good ones.

KSP doesn\u0027t have any difference in drag between two tanks on top of each other or next to each other so although it always LOOKS like a better design it in fact at the moment just makes it harder to stop it wobbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is more struts. There does come a point where the stress on one strut becomes too much in the split second for it to be transferred over all the struts but you can get quite a big rocket before this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird is dock in space. It is VERY hard to get over 100 tons of payload into orbit in one go so split your rocket up into two or three launches and dock them in orbit. With 150-300 tons of fuel you should be able to get anywhere and back (apart from EVE landings). If your rockets get too wobbly with docking ports holding it together you can now try just refueling it in space. Send up a payload with many empty tanks (which you can now tweak) and then send up a large tank or three of fuel to refuel it. This means the rocket could weight 400 tons fueled but only 80 empty. This would mean sending up 320 tons of fuel but the whole ship could be strutted to your hearts desire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForth is nuclear engines in space. They may be heavy and not much use in atmosphere but in space they are your best friend.

The last space stage of your rocket should be as light as possible. Don\u0027t need 5 Kerbals for a 3 Kerbal mission? Then don\u0027t send them, hell you might be fine with one. Adding 8 engines where 4 would do? Got 4 solar panels where 3 would do?

Unless you want to optimize the mission for maximal efficiency, you can use general-purpose designs for the first two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Apollo-style vertical staging is a bad idea for the lifter vehicle. Engines are heavy, and decouplers and docking ports make it harder to stabilize the rocket. A better idea is to build a single-stage lifter, and add enough boosters so that it can get the payload into orbit. Asparagus staging can be used with the boosters, but it\u0027s not really that necessary. Here is an example of my standard heavy lifter about to launch a fuel tanker into orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/tanker_launch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tanker_launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lifter stage has three big orange fuel tanks, a Mainsail engine, and eight Mark 55 radial engines. The bottom radial engines are ignited at launch, while the top ones are used only after the corresponding boosters have been dropped. (Premature ignition can have rather unfortunate results.) There are four boosters in asparagus configuration, with two orange fuel tanks and a Mainsail each. The lifter is (usually) nice and stable due to the exoskeleton (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/raketti.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee here for a better view\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The transfer stage should have enough fuel to get the mission stage from LKO to the destination (and back, if necessary). Remove the jet fuel tanks from the tanker in my example, and you get my standardized interplanetary transfer stage (essentially an orange fuel tank and two nuclear engines). For large modular spaceships, I use several of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Even for smaller missions, it may be easier to launch the transfer stage and the mission stage separately, and dock them in the orbit. Designing good lifters for large payloads is quite hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T12:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA standard design either with mods or stock for going most anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o2gytqU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o2gytqU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8aMWjUx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228aMWjUx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy loft fueler;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CVnE8D2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CVnE8D2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pg7ZOax.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pg7ZOax.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer Mode interplanetary lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eKQOxWV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eKQOxWV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig mod Jool Mission.
