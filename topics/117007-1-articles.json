I improved the time on my second attempt but cannot recall the total time. After reviewing the video the time at the end was **4h5m.**\n\n I had tried and failed several times and was taking screen shots of that horrible mess. After all that practice this video recorded what was done on the initial take without quick-save. Valentina cool as a cucumber with zero stage fright nails the launch and rendezvous. Jebediah could have docked on the first attempt but it seemed he was showing off for the camera. The Krappy video was recorded with Open Broadcast Software using my Lap-potatoe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-28T08:45:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2015 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T20:29:14Z","Content":"Video?

MET? craft size?\n\nThe challenge is docking with limited technology, no maneuver nodes or targeting a vessel (until within visual range). This challenge is set within a tier zero facility. Mission control and the Tracking Centre offer little assistance.\n\nAs for a scoring I was thinking completing this challenge with the lowest overall time. I remember completing this in about six kerbal hours and that was including both launches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-28T08:27:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2015 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"tiffanyw","CreatedById":150063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T08:20:55Z","Content":"looks smashing. when i try to record my computer usually freezes maybe its time to upgrade before simultaneously record and play."},{"CreatedByName":"ttnarg","CreatedById":91776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T09:24:32Z","Content":"Is there any flexibility in the rule that says you have to be in stable orbit before launching the second craft?

I was thinking of simultaneous launch from pad and run way. I\u0027ve not done it before but seems like fun.\n\nWow that would be something to pull off.\n\nOne of the vessels would have to go to space unassisted and without SAS (not sure but it seems when I switch vessels in atmosphere the SAS gets turned off). \n\nThe \u0022**Can\u0027t switch vessels while in atmosphere**\u0022 would also be a hindrance until in space.\n\nIs it a bug or does anyone know the distance limit before that message starts to appear?\n\nIt is less than 25 km; I had that message when I split a vehicle similar to SpaceX and had to redesign to allow both vessels to reach space. Then had to return to the tracking centre instead of map view to switch vessel focus (is this a bug too?).\n\nIf you want to try this I am all for it. However to keep balance there would have to be another leaderboard for simultaneous launch pad and runway launches.\n\n@tiffanyw Welcome to the forums. \n\nI too was faced with the notion to upgrade my computer or switch to Linux to allow recording. The Open Broadcast Software is what I am using. My lap-potato also ran sluggish while video recording and ended up just taking screenshots with F1. However after adjusting the FPS to seven and downscaling the resolution by 1.5 I can now record improved krappy videos. \n\n![SBsmKH2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SBsmKH2.jpg)\n\n The limit is when vessels have more than 150 parts. Compared to KSP 0.90, KSP 1.0.x seems to run optimized. With the update to Unity5 and 64bit there might be even more improvements.\n\nAnother option is to buy capture hardware which is significantly less expensive than a new computer."}]}
