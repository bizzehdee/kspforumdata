Fiddle with the \u0022contact displace\u0022 property in the CFG. You can use that to alter the height the wheel \u0022floats\u0022 above the ground. (because Unity wheel collliders are derp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest my original plan was basically what the OP suggested, but I decided the stock landing gear module was just aweful and dumped it fairly quickly. I\u0027m thinking of looking into more smaller gear soon, but for now a lot of my smaller planes get built with dualgear pods and \u0022tailwheels\u0022 which I\u0027ve found make good nosegear when angled as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
