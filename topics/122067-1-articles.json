Progression is the key to lasting success. This is pretty difficult: I tend to repeat myself several times during a series with stuff I simply don\u0027t remember doing earlier. In my experience, the only way to make sure it stays \u0027fresh\u0027 is to set goals for each video, and scrap the goals you\u0027ve achieved from your list of series goals. For KSP goals could perfectly coincide with the missions you are given, such as altitude records and achieving orbit for the first time. Later you can set yourself up to go somewhere, like Duna, and do something specific, like building a base there. Again, missions help to reinforce a plan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make sure your viewers see you fail from time to time, too: There is no shame in failure, it happens to everyone. KSP takes a lot of attention, and mistakes pile up in situations that you cannot reverse, unless you save/load constantly, which isn\u0027t fun to watch. Back out of a plan if it seems destined to fail over and over again and go smaller if you need to. E.G. Get to the Mun first before trying Eeloo, even if this is your end goal. Keep it realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Figure out the basics of the game before starting. It\u0027s generally not fun watching three videos of you bumbling with the controls. I know because I\u0027ve made that mistake. Make checklists if you have to. I used to mess up my staging CONSTANTLY untill I made a small list of what to check before a launch. It saved time and it really helped keeping the flow up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Half an hour is what most people that enjoy KSP can stomach. Anything longer has to be very exciting to keep the average KSP fans attention. Short videos generally equals more views. 15 - 20 minutes will bag you a lot more new views as well, as it is easier for new people on your channel to assess what you are all about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some general stuff, from experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Be well rested before a recording.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Have a drink (water) handy, as you will be talking a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get a good mike. Static is not nice to hear longer than a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Viewers will notice when you are not enjoying yourself. Make a cut to continue another time if things get boring/annoying/repetitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The most important thing of all: HAVE FUN and express that if you feel like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T12:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022legoclone09\u0022 data-cite=\u0022legoclone09\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmm cool, I have ~375 views and 15 subs.

WHATA??!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I found that my highest viewed videos were ones relevant to prominent games. For instance, my horten ho 229 was close to War Thunder, so Im presuming War Thunder players who want to get KSP wish to know if they can make some of their favorite planes. Also never try being someone your not, if your funny, dont go around saying your not, express it. Ooh and I highly for every craft in the spacecraft exchange you make a youtube video on it because its a lot better for a user to look and like the video then look at images and text. When I first joined the forums, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112868-VTOL-AeroSpace-F-35-MetalStorm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis was one of my first threads\u003C/a\u003E, and it somehow got a lot of views. Made in .25, this VTOL was named after the F-35 (a prominent VTOL nowadays) and then I added Metalstorm to the title (Metalstorm is also a game on the appstore) and with a bit of a KSP community they surely will look at your video. And that\u0027s what you want, you want them to subscribe if they choose to or make them come back for more videos. And that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been working on, I have a multitude of files ready to be published but I cant unless I myself find them entertaining \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoh and one last thing, find who likes what on the forums, for instance a select few love planes replicas, others all about notorious rockets, the guy \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ewho likes tank history and always talks to someone about it whos interested whenever Im out of the house. \u0026lt;-- me. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAnd then you got people who love looking at cuteness, find a balance between all of these characteristics and that should surly give you more clicks.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-17T12:48:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2015 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghostbuzzer7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
