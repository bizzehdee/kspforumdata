Suffice to say, the struggle was too hard on the spaceplane hull, and an explosion ensued.\n\nSo. For my second attempt, I\u0027d like to at least be able to land on Laythe. My spaceplane has, after insertion into a 100x100 Kerbin orbit, roughly 1800-2000 m/s of dV (I think, if the maneuver node dV is anything to go by). I want to approach Laythe at a survivable velocity. Do I absolutely have to build a new spaceplane with more fuel, or can I a) make a more accurate/efficient Kerbin-Jool transfer which puts me directly on a lower speed encounter with Laythe, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) use an easy gravity assist to cut my fuel consumption and save some dV for a retro burn or c) a combination thereof?\n\nI find it especially difficult to get the encounters accurate enough, perhaps because as part of weight saving measures I\u0027ve not included RCS/monopropellant.

Fast, but possibly survivable. Bear in mind you only need to barely capture around Laythe, or even barely capture around Jool itself, you don\u0027t have to go straight to a low Laythe orbit or a landing.\n\nOn the \u0022Very Bad\u0022 trajectory you would hit Laythe\u0027s atmosphere at around 8 km/s. Kaboom.\n\nTo arrange a \u0022Good\u0022 Laythe encounter you want to set up a course correction. I usually do one around the orbit of Dres, then another just after entering Jool\u0027s SOI if needed. Then the secret is to trade off pro/retrograde and radial/antiradial components. By doing that you can change your arrival time at Jool periapsis while keeping the height of that periapsis the same. (Around 27,000 km, the radius of Laythe\u0027s orbit round Jool). Reach your periapsis when Laythe reaches the same spot and there\u0027s your encounter.\n\nThe same general geometry applies for encountering *any* planet or moon if you desire either an efficient powered capture or a gentle aerocapture.\n\n**For a gravitational capture into the Joolian system** you want to use either Laythe or Tylo for the gravity assist. Vall is a maybe, I\u0027ve never really tried, Bop and Pol are definitely too small and too slowly orbiting. I find the exact trajectory hard to visualise myself and often end up trying stuff until I see a promising capture. The same technique as above is needed to set up your gravity assist though - a course correction using pro/retrograde and radial/antiradial components to tune the trajectory through the Joolian system and the timing of that trajectory independently from each other. You may also need to add normal/antinormal components to avoid being kicked into a highly inclined orbit.\n\nHowever your gravity assist works out, you still want to finally encounter Laythe in a similar fashion to above, with your orbit round Jool just touching Laythe\u0027s orbit or close to that, not sharply cutting across Laythe\u0027s orbit and definitely not meeting it when it\u0027s going the other way to you.\n\n**For a gravity assist out to Jool itself** you want to use Eve first of all. If you need more than one assist then Kerbin itself is good too. Duna is usable with repeated flybys but not really worthwhile. Then there\u0027s a crucial trick. You cannot use a gravity assist at peri to raise apo, or at apo to lower peri for that matter. So what you need to do is get on a trajectory with a Sun periapsis *lower* than Eve\u0027s orbit. This takes a little more delta-V than the most efficient Eve transfer, but that small extra delta-V gets repaid many times over by the gravity assist.\n\nWhether you encounter Eve before or after your solar periapsis doesn\u0027t matter, and yet again the same course correction techniques will come in handy, but now with the additional variable of your Kerbin departure time. Once on course to the Joolian system you\u0027re then looking at either an aerocapture or a gravitational capture as covered in the two sections above.\n\nOn a final note, for any sort of gravity assist work I *strongly* recommend the mod [Precise Node](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863). In particular it makes changing the timing of a burn, which can be *very* important, far far easier than with the stock system."},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:05:20Z","Content":"Aanker, you have a point that just a one-time low-dV path isn\u0027t too useful, but there are a lot more ways to get from Kerbin to Jool cheaply. The trick is that 3 Kerbin-Jool synodic periods =350 (Earth)days, and 5 Eve-Jool synodic periods = 346 days, so any path involving Kerbin, Eve, and Jool will often repeat (roughly) in about 350 days. For example, the best way I\u0027ve ever found to get to Jool is that K146-E195.65-K296.2-K509.25-J821 method I used for the 1011m/s mission (and a few others). It costs 1068m/s (or 990 if you use Mun). There is another one 352 days later: K498-E546.9-K639-K852.05-J1062 (but the cost is 1163m/s). This path is very finicky so there are only a few repeats before it fades away, though I\u0027m sure it reappears someday. A much better path for repeatability is K-E-K-J. I have found there is always one of these at least every 350 (Earth) days. A given \u0027cycle\u0027 of paths will run for a while and then fade out, but another cycle will arise before it does. Here are examples for the first 1200 (Earth) days of the game, which is about 11 Kerbin years:\n\nK1-E46.4-K263-J454.5 : start boost (from a 75x75km orbit) is 1288m/s.\n\nK344.5-E391.6-K608.95-J834 : 1336m/s.\n\n that\u0027s the last in that particular chain but another has started:\n\nK132-E197.4-K406.5-J1046 : 1515m/s.\n\nK505.5-E544-K757.5-J1376.6 : 1493m/s.\n\nK843-E892.4-K1108-J1742.4 : 1228m/s.\n\nK1186-E1235.1-K1452.2-J2038 : 1256m/s.\n\nand so on. These windows are more forgiving than the KEKKJ routes, but you still should have your Eve periapsis be within about 12 hours of the time given.\n\nI do not think it is possible to do these multiple flybys without a node editor. You have to adjust a, say, 1300ms burn by \u002B/- 0.1 m/s and \u002B/- 1 second until you get the desired flyby time and I go crazy almost immediately when trying that by dragging the little node arrows. Red Iron Crown is *way* better than me at flying by hand, and it sounds like he couldn\u0027t do it either.\n\n I found these flybys by using my [Flyby Finder](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110106-WIN-Flyby-Finder-for-Real-Solar-System-Mod-V0-70) for the KEKJ routes and my Lambert spreadsheet (available in the same post with FF) for the KEKKJ routes. Another user here (winged, look a couple of posts up) came up with a way to find KEKKJ routes with just Flyby Finder, though sometimes that might give a route that has to do too low a 2nd flyby of Kerbin.\n\n Note all my dates are given in Earth time (24h/365d) and not Kerbin time (6h/426d).
