Beyond that were the trundles, many from nearby Capitol City, some from as far away as South Bay, and even one all the way from West Lake.

Especially for a new player, there are times when you\u0027ll throw a mission or a machine together just for the sake of testing something. The Dragonfly wasn\u0027t my first flight-- the winglets it uses are not actually available on the first node of the tech tree. But all of the initial BTSM sounding rockets end up looking exactly alike so I decided to skip over that. The Dragonfly carried no instruments, and without a parachute there was no way to get science points for recovering it. I built it solely as a way of testing my flightstick with Kerbal Space Program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test flight actually happened at night, and I don\u0027t have any screenshots. The thing went straight up to, oh, about 30 - 35 km, and then nosed over and dove, becoming controllable at around 8 - 10 km altitude. It flew a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E better than I thought it would. The joystick worked well, and the throttle worked too, though there was no engine so adjusting the throttle didn\u0027t actually do anything. But my throttle has an analog thumb stick on it, so I could move the camera with my left hand and fly with my right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was supposed to be a short flight, but the Dragonfly suffers(benefits?) from the \u0022infiniglider\u0022 bug, and below about 2,000 meters the lift/drag ratio gets silly and the thing can stay in the air for the 40 minutes it takes for the batteries to run down. It was. . .surreal. I was out over the water, and it was very dark, but there were sections of the coastline that were illuminated by a \u0022city lights\u0022 mod, and there was a full Mun. And the stars! There was just a little bit of cloud cover, and with no engine noise the only sound was the wind from the \u0022atmospheric sound effects\u0022 add on. And I remember looking at the stars, and realizing that a few of them were actually planets, faithfully rendered at extreme distance and drifting along in the sky like it was no big deal. And here I was, flying along in something I had \u003Cem\u003Ebuilt,\u003C/em\u003E and having a magnificent time of it, and thinking that those planets looked close enough to touch. And I remember it really hitting me that those planets weren\u0027t part of a skybox. They were really \u0022up there\u0022, and eventually I could build something that could cross that distance and actually reach them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a lot of neat things in KSP, but that really was \u0022The Moment\u0022.

And a story I needed to write. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, back to the chapter. The above moment was made possible by the screw ball stock aerodynamics system, and it didn\u0027t really fit into the story. Should I include it, or leave it out? It didn\u0027t seem right to acknowledge it without doing \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E with it, so Aleny had his own \u0022moment\u0022 where he made some mental connection in the \u0022gravity as a field force or as a particle\u0022 debate.

Old Wurlitzer had single handedly refurbished the instrument, caring for it in a labor of love that had gone well beyond pay.

It is lighter, owing to an optimized battery arrangement, and has a more balanced power curve. Most importantly, it has a passive control scheme that makes its flight path far more predictable. During the early phase of the launch, the low center of mass and relatively high drag at the tail tend to hold the rocket in a vertical position. As the drag force decreases and the fuel burns away, the carefully calculated asymmetry in the scientific payload causes the rocket to gently pitch over along a desired heading.
