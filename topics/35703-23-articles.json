Guess it\u0027s a problem with ordering again. Made a new version of the fix that pushes EditorExtensions behind EditorLogic: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7121093/ksp-mods/KSP%5B1.0.2%5DKspIssue3838Fix%5BMay17%5D.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7121093/ksp-mods/KSP%5B1.0.2%5DKspIssue3838Fix%5BMay17%5D.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully not many more plugins depend on the ordering with EditorLogic or we have to figure something out. I only need it to run after UIManager so the part spawning is fixed. So anything you figure out for EE is probably fine for me.

In EE\u0027s case the problem is that the parts do spawn, but the spawn location is off, as well as the pointer-to-part offset when dragging. I\u0027ve been poking around the pick part/spawn etc methods in the editor but no joy so far in tweaking it back to normal with an offset camera. When I did the disable/re-enable in EE itself, it was like some UI references were broken, even if I grabbed a new reference to editorlogic after the enable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll continue to poke around, if I find anything I\u0027ll let you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MachXXV","CreatedById":68210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T00:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdated, with much better strut \u0026amp; fuel line alignment. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edetails on the main post\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T15:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool, are you gonna add the function to the part clipping to enable to part to be placed upside down?
