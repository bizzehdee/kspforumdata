Just always try to stay symmetrical so it stays controllable. And you can add more air intakes - there are some radial mounted you can attach. This will get you up even higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried to optimize my rockets with turbijet engines, so *thumps up* \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E The fuel efficiency is just amazing, and gets even better with higher speed (air intakes produce more air on higher speed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T01:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E20km is about the altitude that a single intake will no longer provide enough air for a turbojet, a little lower if you\u0027re flying slowly. Then the engine flames out suddenly. Going from ~200 kN to nothing in an instant will cause things to flex, which could cause parts to bump each other -- especially if you have parts that intersect each other like those I beams and the engines and tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe log rarely gives useful information as to what actually happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
