If you are reading this and know of any great mods that improve kerbals experience of Spaceplanes that would be awesome!\n\nThanks for reading ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Sam"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T21:48:00Z","Content":"FAR is mandatory if you\u0027re serious. Either of the procedural wing mods makes a ridiculous improvement - B9\u0027s can take fuel but is a little less mature than DYJs. After that the popular parts mods seem to be B9 ( the proc wings are a standalone part ) and Nertea\u0027s Mk4 - not to be confused with TT\u0027s Mk4 ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) - Retrofuture and possibly Firespitter, but not sure how compatible the parts are with 0.90. Taverius\u0027 pizza pack has a few bits and pieces which fill some gaps too. You don\u0027t need all the parts from all the mods, especially if you\u0027re using procedural wings.\n\nThere\u0027s also AJE which is an attempt at realistic engines - I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like currently, it had some odd interactions with other mod installs when I last tried it, but that was at least one major version ago."},{"CreatedByName":"samcar304","CreatedById":55838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T23:47:46Z","Content":"Thanks a bunch got most of the mods in game now having a blast! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Thanks once again"}]}
