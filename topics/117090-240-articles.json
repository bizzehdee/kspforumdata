In fact, this was exactly what I\u0027ve been doing with the config: I changed only the type of the plume and nothing else. However, both of my attempt resulted in malfunction, with the first one resulting the two exhaust ports having no plume nor flare whatsoever, and the second one resulting both main nozzle and the exhaust ports having no plume and flare. simply changing the plume type seems to mess with the setup somehow...\n\nAlso, my point of using Kerolox plume is largely based on the fact that real life RS-68 has an ablative nozzle, which produces a yellowish-red \u0022dirty\u0022 plume with carbon and other heavier molecule, instead of a clean, blue water vapor often seen in SSME and the likes.

A pretty fascinating engine, actually. The was flown with both hypergolic propellant, as well as kerlox. In addition, a variant was tested (full size) with hydrolox as a concept for what NASA elected to use the J-2 for (as a new design). Had variants from ~650 kN to almost twice that in thrust, too.\n\nI have been messing lately with a rescale. I have planets bumped 4X in size, and the distances 6.4X. I am using SSTU parts out of the box.\n\nMy \u0022replica\u0022 Saturn V in SSTU easily makes the Mun, and with a ton of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare (about 1000m/s). I then dropped the stage three tank size a little to make it less \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E. Still looks good. Replica R-7/Soyuz easily makes orbit with a couple hundred m/s left over (not counting the SM). I shark the upper stage one tick, so it should be better now (and I never scaled S2 to the real length). Tighter designs like Gemini are much harder. I have TRAILS installed, which wants a 1.875m diameter Titan, and even bumping it up to 2m I can\u0027t get the thing to orbit, I need about 4500m/s after gravity and drag losses. \n\nWent back to 1.875m, and replaced all the hypergolic engines with Merlins. Got it to orbit. Woot. 4X planets is pretty nice with SSTU and no other changes. Getting Gemini to orbit is actually non-trivial.\n\nMercury Atlas works as well, using that technique I posted up thread to fake a half stage. That Atlas-looking mount could be turned into a half-stage with a hollow collider.\n\n![Atlas%20attempt.png](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/Atlas%20attempt.png)\n\nThe main tank has an upper stage mount (the medium length green cone with helium tanks, etc as greeble). A merlin is stuck to that, and the tank has the interstage node on. I then put a 1.875m decoupler on there, as thin as possible, with hollow collider on. Then I put a double merlin with the atlas looking mount, and adjusted the engine spacing. It was attached to the decoupler. Then, it got a fuel pipe from the main tank to the 2 engines/mount so that they would get fuel. A few times my angle is a little off (not dead-on into the flightpath) and I have the thing take out the center engine. Usually decouples fine though. I waited till the TW looked high, then dumped the half stage (liftoff was at 1.13 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for the stack, I shed the 1/2 stage at about 2.7, so that the sustainer would be over 1). The image above is the test, which did not make orbit. I had to make it taller than it should be at the 4X kerbin scale I\u0027m at, but it still made it. I used a petal to be able to fit a retro package on the bottom of the capsule. That assembly I ended up clipping a little so that the decoupler would not float below the heat shield (just moved it till it touched).\n\nPS--silver might be nice for a mount option.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-22T19:54:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2017 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"CVerts","CreatedById":168243,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T05:43:12Z","Content":"I have a question for this modpack.

What should I do if I only want to use certain packs for my game?

Due to the use of texture and mesh/model sharing across many of the parts it is extremely difficult to have a clean separation between the different series\u0027 of parts.  For example many of the engine models and textures are re-used in the various ShipCore part-series, as are the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks and docking ports.\n\nIf you have a specific list of parts that you do want to keep I can probably give you a quick write-up of what all would be safe to delete/remove.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/22/2017 at 10:50 AM, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E PS--silver might be nice for a mount option.\n\u003E \n\nMounts will be getting free-recoloring with the next update (along with tanks, nosecones, adapters).
