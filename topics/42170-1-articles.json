Used Upper stage to deorbit the Tylo lander. The upper stage with an LV-N and 3*360 liter fuel tanks was used alone at Moho, Ike, Dress, Val and obviously the rest after Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal weight was 275 ton in LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: Stock, except mechjeb, protractor and other things for control and utilities. Used mechjeb and kerbal alarm clock myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo fuel depots, you are not allowed to split the ship in Kerbin or solar orbit and put one fuel depot at Duna and one at Laythe while you continue to Eve. Like me you are allowed to split up the ship and not all parts has to visit all planets. If you use an reuseable upper stage or disposable stages is up to you. You must plant an flag, in effect you must enter en pod between the landings, its however legal to use an seat on an lander and go from Eve to Moho and then directly to Duna using an ion powered lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously it most to save on the Eve lander who was non optimal for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StevenLawyer","CreatedById":78513,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T00:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my single launch, no refuel, stock grand tour ship that includes a reusable lander for all planets except Eve (Eve is a separate one time use lander) with reusable rover and reusable probes (you\u0027re not going to land on a planet without first sending an unmanned probe, are you?).
