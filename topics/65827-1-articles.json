The spheres house the motor that either; slides it along the sides on a track, or rotates everything else in relation to it. This is just a simplistic concept design to give a general idea, but some designs could possibly offer a much higher rate of speed. Even if you only got a meter a second out of it (which would depend on size, speed, and stability of the design) that would be enough to mechanically alter orbit altitude over time. It would operate purely on electricity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you were able to create a 1 m/s speed, it would take approx. 16 minutes to raise or lower orbit by 1km.
