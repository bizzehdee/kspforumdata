And it was my opinion that a super hot ball of iron roughly the size of Earth would radiate a lot of heat and take at least several million years to cool. Which would warm any moons and provide terraforming opportunities. And while i dont doubt that Triton would definitely be damaged by the explosion, Perhaps the sudden loss of Neptunian mass would increase the SemimajorAxis of Triton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T06:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222683683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468987433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257763\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022daniel l.\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n59 minutes ago, daniel l. said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the sudden loss of Neptunian mass would increase the SemimajorAxis of Triton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the gas thrown away will stay on low orbit (inside the Triton\u0027s orbital sphere), so the gravitational mass will not significantly decrease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
