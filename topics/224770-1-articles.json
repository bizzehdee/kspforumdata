Here is what I have been able to do so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI have converted all available music tracks from KSP2 that I can find to independent\u00A0.ogg files.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome tracks\u00A0are independent \u0022layers\u0022 of a track meant to be used in combination with others as dynamic music. For now, these remain independent.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome\u00A0tracks appear to not have been used in KSP2 (afaik) as of 0.2.2 but were found in the game files. These have been included.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBy using\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/191467-112x-soundtrack-editor-forked/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESoundtrack Editor Forked\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I am able to add these files to the game.

Soundtrack Editor Forked allows for tracks to be played based on various scenarios. Tracks can be activated or deactivated depending on the altitude of a craft. I believe I can somewhat replicate the dynamic music for the descent/ascent of each body by using the altitude feature of this mod. However, some work and limitations are needed, primarily:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIdentifying tracks for each body\u0027s descent/ascent music \u002B planet surface music.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDetermining at which altitude range each track\u0027s additional musical \u0022layers\u0022 should be active for dynamic effect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCombining musical \u0022layers\u0022 in a\u00A03rd party program as new .ogg files (this is due to the mods limitation of only being able to play one track at a time).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELimitation\u003C/em\u003E: The app offers no crossfade ability and can not play/start multiple tracks at once. This means that dynamic music based on altitude (or other factors) will change abruptly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELimitation\u003C/em\u003E: Other dynamic music scenarios, such as additional tracks being played while using the maneuver nodes, are not possible to apply as the mod does not account for these situations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have done some testing to other bodies and believe this app will get users quite close to the immersive experience of approaching a celestial body, but it is not a perfectly smooth 1:1 recreation. I am at the mercy of the mods I use for now. At this time I simply shuffle the majority of other KSP2 tracks not already assigned to be played throughout missions. It still creates an ambient experience, even if it is not an intentional use of the music. My hope is to eventually complete work on the other planets/moons, but I simply don\u0027t have time at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if anyone would like to continue or collaborate on this project I am happy to help. Soundtrack Editor Forked can be used to flesh out music for other celestial bodies and many other gaps I may have missed. If anyone has recommendations for file sharing I would be happy to provide the music files and my config file for the mod to include what IU mentioned above. Beyond that point I believe additional mod support would be needed to further replicate the music of KSP2. The primary barrier I have identified is the inability to crossfade between two active tracks based on the changing scenario of a craft. If that puzzle can be solved then I believe we can best recreate Howard Mostrom\u0027s amazing work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love to hear the thoughts of others on this. A full overhaul of KSP1\u0027s music (and even sound effects/other audio) to match KSP2 would be my dream scenario for modernizing the gameplay experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genekermanisamoneylaundere","CreatedById":226707,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-07T23:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is really awesome!
