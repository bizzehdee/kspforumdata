When I launch the proton, just as the gravity turn begins, it suddenly flips out completely in an uncontrolled fashion. On other rockets, they seem to shake uncontrollably. What is causing this? I am starting to get frustrated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T03:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a larger cross section of area above the center of mass than lower, it\u0027s likely the lateral drag on those parts causing it to flip around so the center of mass is at a higher point relative to the rocket. You could take advantage of the Pendulum Rocket Fallacy, or put lifting body parts below the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T03:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI...hope this better shows what the problem I find is...for some reason, the center of thrust is going out the side...but it does not solve the strange shaking I noticed in other rockets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Ww0LdF.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Ww0LdF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T03:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh good lord that is a nightmare.
