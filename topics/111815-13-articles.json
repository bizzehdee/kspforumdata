I\u0027d really hate to lose it as a resource for my regular kerbals. I think a really cool thing to do with it, would be to treat it as a science lab extension. Having a station or base with one of the structures incorporated, in conjunction with a science lab module, would provide low G natural settings where natural science could be performed by crew members. The side effect, is if Civ Pop is installed, it would also produce food, and consume whatever resources the\u00A0CivPop biodome type structures consume, maybe at a rate that\u0027s a multiplier based on crewed capacity. Say, it takes a minimum of 1 crew to generate food, improve on science returns, but it only provides the max multiplier \u00F7 the crew capacity x the crew count on board the biodome/torus. It could also have a minimum crew to produce any results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo basically, I\u0027m proposing that\u00A0using the mod on it\u0027s own would allow you to create a small boost to science if a lab module is attached, and you crew both the lab module, and the biodome/torus. If the structure is half full, you get half the science multiplier bonus. if full, you get the full science multiplier bonus.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf CivPop is installed, it\u0027d require being manned by Crew, not civs, to operate, but would produce both the science bonuses, as well as function as a food resource for civilians, and consume the same resources civilian food production modules consume.\u00A0At least that\u0027s what would appeal most to me. Creating hooks to TAC Life support and that\u00A0snacks mod would also seem to be pretty cool. Seems a biodome ought to extend the viability of any long term mission by quite a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d ALSO LOVE if the torus could end up with an togglable spin animation, if that\u0027s a possible feature. the spin is the whole point of a torus. It doesn\u0027t need to work in warp, but the fact that if you apply a spin o it, you lose it after warp... well, it means manually spinning it up is simply futile.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust my thoughts on it, and how I think it\u0027d best serve both separate and combined with other elements of the game and other\u00A0mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222382871\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022111815\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453949117\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022108889\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rabidninjawombat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, rabidninjawombat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo Update time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am super sorry for the long absence folks (and also the lack of notice) \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Mynar posted up again is\u00A0right. \u00A0I recently started my own business, \u00A0And it has been sucking up all of my free time. \u00A0 (what with me still working my regular day job as well) ...

I\u0027d really hate to lose it as a resource for my regular kerbals. I think a really cool thing to do with it, would be to treat it as a science lab extension. Having a station or base with one of the structures incorporated, in conjunction with a science lab module, would provide low G natural settings where natural science could be performed by crew members. The side effect, is if Civ Pop is installed, it would also produce food, and consume whatever resources the\u00A0CivPop biodome type structures consume, maybe at a rate that\u0027s a multiplier based on crewed capacity. Say, it takes a minimum of 1 crew to generate food, improve on science returns, but it only provides the max multiplier \u00F7 the crew capacity x the crew count on board the biodome/torus. It could also have a minimum crew to produce any results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo basically, I\u0027m proposing that\u00A0using the mod on it\u0027s own would allow you to create a small boost to science if a lab module is attached, and you crew both the lab module, and the biodome/torus. If the structure is half full, you get half the science multiplier bonus. if full, you get the full science multiplier bonus.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf CivPop is installed, it\u0027d require being manned by Crew, not civs, to operate, but would produce both the science bonuses, as well as function as a food resource for civilians, and consume the same resources civilian food production modules consume.\u00A0At least that\u0027s what would appeal most to me. Creating hooks to TAC Life support and that\u00A0snacks mod would also seem to be pretty cool. Seems a biodome ought to extend the viability of any long term mission by quite a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d ALSO LOVE if the torus could end up with an togglable spin animation, if that\u0027s a possible feature. the spin is the whole point of a torus. It doesn\u0027t need to work in warp, but the fact that if you apply a spin o it, you lose it after warp... well, it means manually spinning it up is simply futile.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust my thoughts on it, and how I think it\u0027d best serve both separate and combined with other elements of the game and other\u00A0mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to hear you are seeing success in your business venture!
