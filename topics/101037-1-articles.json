One thing I find sorely missing would be an overview of the players financial progress. Management/city building games provide serious, in-depth reports on many aspects of growth and I think the boys at KSC could provide the same graphs, albeit in a much more Kerbalized version... I\u0027ve put together a few thoughts, feel free to expand them or squash em.\n\n**Quarterly Reports**\n\n - Income\n\n - Launch Costs\n\n - Payroll\n\n - Rep gains and losses\n\n - Science and Research\n\n**Long Term Finance Reports**\n\n - Contract gain/cost/net \n\n - Strategy projections\n\n - KSC upgrades\n\n**Post-Mission Reports**\n\n - Mission Logs: burn times, dockings, SoI transfers, take-off and landing\n\n - Launch/Insertion efficiency: for Ecc\u003C0.05 (deltaV required / deltaV used) x100\n\n - Transfer efficiency: \n\n - Crew/Experience\n\n - Time of Flight, Biomes visited\n\n - EVA/Surface samples\n\nThese would find a home in the Administration Building and I think it could be a great asset of players. I\u0027m sure some hard-core players do all the number crunching themselves for each flight, but bringing it to life in the game would flesh out the \u0027running a space program\u0027 bits...\n\nCheers!\n\nJS"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T19:55:18Z","Content":"I agree and I would be a little surprised if Squad didn\u0027t already have this thought. While the early game updates were rightly about getting the game up and running- now that we\u0027re hitting Version 1.0, it\u0027s time to start filling in the details and start player gameplay tracking.\n\nEDIT: In addition, I hope the science review panel gets re-worked. At the moment all the data on what I\u0027ve collected is overbearing. Too much information without a lot of payoff. It\u0027s a good start, but really needs to be expanded and reworked in a way that cuts all that data down to what\u0027s important to the player.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T20:00:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spinomonkey**\n  \nAdded info"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T01:23:14Z","Content":"An X/Y line chart of stuff that you could check every now and then would be a cool addition.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T01:25:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T01:30:59Z","Content":"Oh wow, that sounds awesome!
