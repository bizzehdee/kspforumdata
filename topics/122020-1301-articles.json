That\u0027s not the problem. The problem is that the LSAM doesn\u0027t realistically have enough fuel to get from the Moon Base to orbit, dock with the Space Shuttle (Not even going to get into how THAT\u0027s impossible.) and then deorbit and land back at the base. It has enough fuel to maybe, MAYBE, get into a low Moon orbit, but that\u0027s it.\u00A0 They would more than likely be out of fuel at that point. And space shuttle can\u0027t refuel it, the space shuttle has no fuel transfer system., at least not for docked spacecraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLSAM is unrealistic and impossible, both IRL and in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-13T06:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2024 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 hr\u0022\u003E1 hour ago\u003C/time\u003E by GoldForest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-13T07:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224407311\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022122020\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221720852010\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153575\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rodger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Rodger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main issue is I think the colliders would need changing for clearance with interstages, which is a little more involved than I\u2019d want to get into. You can also currently disable the shroud in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E anyway (a stock feature), and offset tool a interstage upwards to fit too. But you may get some slight bumps on decoupling due to the colliders of the transtage not being set up for this, though it will kinda work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact the transtage is an all-in-one part too with integrated engines also means there\u2019s basically no difference in stability between a shroud or an interstage. There isn\u2019t a low mass engine part sandwiched in the middle of the stack that an interstage would bypass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, was afraid of possible shenanigans with it being AIO.
