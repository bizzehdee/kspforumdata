The cockpits, once researched will cost $2500 and will be salvageable along the same rules as the regular command pod.

In case you do no private launch you can utilize the slot for groundbound activity, generating $1500 that are immediately useable in the same turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-New contract: Design a craft to put a full, free floating fuel tank in a 200x200km orbit.
