However I feel that, as things are set up now the gimballed engine might as well not be in the game, and that is a pity, since it limits our possibilities.\n\nAs things stand now, the only reason anyone would even consider using the gimballed engine is if they are dead set against using mechjeb or have an extra 5000$ they can\\\u0027t seem to get rid of in any other way.

The pilot reports a sleeker flight experience with less rumbling noises. However there was an alarming amount of creaking and tearing sounds, as well as a pervasive smell of kerosine throughout the flight. Additional research will have to be performed in order to make this option safe and viable for subsequent launches.**Sjwt** revised the flightplan for his 200km mission and re-did it to show the world that space exploration is in fact safe. Another memorable event was the first deposition of a Kubble space telescope in LKO by **Awaras**. More kubbles can be launched, but the sponsoring corporation has requested that they be in increasingly higher orbits so as to keep gathering useful new data at the forefront of space exploration. \n\nFour expeditions were sent out to the south pole by solid rocket booster, **Fireblade** and **Sjwt** both got there on 34 boosters, **robsr3v3ng3** used a staggering 80-something boosters, the expeditions that were already landed on the pole reported \\\u0027that they could hear it coming all the way from the pad\\\u0027. **Sal\\_vager** sourced a design consisting of just 30 boosters from **Awaras**, who had used up all of his funds on launching the Kubble. At the least this is a display of and perfect example of \\\u0027friendly competition\\\u0027, at best it could be the beginning of a lasting cooperation between the two aerospace exploration companies, especially as **Sal\\_vager** effectively won the contract using **Awaras\\\u0027** design. He will receive $3000, the other contestants (who were all succesfull) get $2000.\n\nLooking to the future, the Kerbal government has been debating on whether to shoot for moon exploration or LKO activities and in a close vote has decided that the focus for the moment will be on researching the possibilities for and establishing a permanent space residence or \\\u0027space station\\\u0027 in low kerbin orbit. Attached to the PSR-bill it has been decided to expand the scope and abilities of all private space explorers (that\\\u0027s you guys). All corporations now have an extra launch slot available to use each turn, to utilize as they see fit. Should no launches be planned the second launch-crew can be sent to fundraisers, generating money.\n\nHere follows the **finance overview for turn 004:**\n\n**Player:** Awaras **Mission Completed:** Deposit Kubble in 100x100km orbit **Tech purchased:** Liquid Tech I **Spent:**$23100 **Income:**$40500 **New Balance:** $41765\n\n**Player:** Sal\\_vager**Mission Completed:** none **Tech purchased:** Liquid Tech I **Spent:**$8000 **Income:**$3000 **New Balance:** $9650\n\n**Player:** Sjwt**Mission Completed:** 200km **Tech purchased:** none **Spent:**$11300 **Income:**$20250 **New Balance:** $30760\n\n**Player:** Fireblade**Mission Completed:** 80km **Tech purchased:** Salvage Tech I **Spent:**$11050 **Income:**$16000 **New Balance:** $18100\n\n**Player:** Robsr3v3ng3**Mission Completed:** none **Tech purchased:** none **Spent:**$500 **Income:**$2000 **New Balance:** $9700\n\n**Player:** Issarlk**Mission Completed:** 25km **Tech purchased:** none **Spent:**$6750 **Income:**$12000 **New Balance:** $12150\n\n**Player:** Bellaby**Mission Completed:** 25km **Tech purchased:** none **Spent:**$6500 **Income:**$10000 **New Balance:** $10400\n\n**Announcements for turn 005**\n\n-Liquid Tech I has been researched twice and thus it\\\u0027s been reduced by 10%. New price $6750\n\n-The Kubble mission will be slightly revised. It can be repeated, but each time you do it has to be in a higher orbit. Ie. Awaras has done the 100x100km orbit, should he wish to launch another Kubble it will have to go to a 200x200km, the next one to 400x400km, thereafter 800x800 and so on. This \\\u0027ladder\\\u0027 is personal, so everyone else can still launch a Kubble to 100x100km. The first/second bonus will still be universal. \n\n-The \\\u0027Probe to Kerbol orbit\\\u0027 mission will be possible to perform just once per player.\n\n-New technology: **Space Cockpits**. Allows the use of the lower-drag flight cockpits in spacecrafts. Cost **$1500**. The cockpits, once researched will cost $2500 and will be salvageable along the same rules as the regular command pod. Use of these cockpits without having the tech researched is no longer allowed.\n\n-**Additional launch slot**. Use it for personal missions. These can be \\\u0027for fun and bragging\\\u0027 (ie. send the CEO;yourself on an orbital vacation), launching satellites (some different sattelites and reasons to have them will be introduced later) or privately-funded exploration missions (which will then spawn new, paid missions). In case you do no private launch you can utilize the slot for groundbound activity, generating $1500 that are immediately useable in the same turn.\n\n-New contract: Design a craft to put a full, free floating fuel tank in a 200x200km orbit. Bonuses for least amount of engines and least amount of fuel used. Details coming up in OP.\n\nI\\\u0027m setting the turn deadline on wednesday night: 06-06-2012 23:59 (GMT\u002B2).
