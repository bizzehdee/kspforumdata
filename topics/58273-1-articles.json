I\u0027ve unlocked the whole tech tree before I bothered using any engines larger than the starting engine, but I know the science fairly well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t get to orbit with the starting parts, either your ship design or your piloting skills are off. If you want to try the craft I use to do this to narrow down the ship design/piloting skill question, it\u0027s pretty basic. Mk 1 capsule, parachute on top, 10 FL-T200 tanks under it, and an LV-T30 engine under those. Maybe a Communotron-16 antenna to send crew reports on the way up. You\u0027ll come down a bit fast, but the fuel tanks make for a nice crumple zone, sacrificing themselves to save the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get to orbit but aren\u0027t getting at least 100 science points on your first flight, then you may not know the science system as well as you think. I\u0027m not talking the really impressive first missions where you go to multiple planets, I\u0027m talking orbiting kerbin, never going higher than 260 km or so. I\u0027ve managed over 130 points on that kind of flight without transmission spam. Just the EVA reports over 9 biomes plus one in high orbit should be 80 points, though you\u0027ll get fewer biomes if you\u0027re in an equatorial orbit instead of a polar one (6 if I remember correctly, so 24 fewer science points). An EVA report on the ladder before launch, an EVA report on the ladder while coasting to your apoapsis (but before you reach 68km altitude), an EVA report where you land, and probably one \u0022flying over\u0022 where you landed. Then there\u0027s the crew reports. Even without an antenna, you can manage five crew reports, though that takes a trick that might be considered an exploit (I don\u0027t count this when I say you should get to 130 points). Then, points for a surface sample wherever you land and for recovering a craft that orbited kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat many science points should unlock decouplers, batteries, mystery goo containers, and the materials science lab. My second mission actually a suborbital flight, just bringing along as many of those parts as I can, six of each with a 260 km apoapsis being ideal. I used to go to Minmus as my second mission, not necessarily landing, but with 0.23 bringing one shot goo/mat-sci parts, I like being a little more prepared before heading to Minmus or the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the tree goes, I tend to focus on getting things in the following order: T1, all of T2, beeline for solar panels (through Science Tech, not flight controls), beeline for fuel lines (through General Construction, not Advanced Rocketry). Once I\u0027ve got all that, I usually focus on the science nodes that grant more science parts. To me, having the negative gravioli detector is far more important than having the 2.5 meter rocket parts, especially now that Minmus has biomes. The negative gravioli detector works on the surface, in \u0022space near\u0022 and \u0022high above\u0022 and respects biomes at all three of those, so that\u0027s 27 experiment results for Minmus and 45 for the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs promised;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova Punch parts early tech career ship.

So I\u0027d recommend getting mods that add essential information and instrumentation over mods that add parts, both for building and flying your rockets. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux: shows your mass, delta-V, and TWR on any planet, by stage and in total.

Both are excellent, but be advised that you won\u0027t be getting anything that\u0027s particularly better than stock parts until way late in the game, when they provide bigger engines and tanks that in stock. Otherwise, the mod engines are just slightly tweaked versions of the stock engines available at the same tech node. So IMHO, these mods don\u0027t make career mode any easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a caveat about all mods, but especially those that add parts like KWR and N-P. That is, it\u0027s highly likely that they\u0027ll break your saved game at the next KSP update. Quite often, mods that worked in the previous version of the game won\u0027t work in the next version, so you\u0027re dead in the water until the modders update their mods. Depending on the modder and his real life, this might happen immediately, within a week or 2, or never. And even if/when the mod gets updated for the new game version, there\u0027s a good chance the modder will do more to it than just make it compatible with the new version. They\u0027ll throw in major changes to the mod while they\u0027re at it, which usually aren\u0027t compatible with saves of their previous versions. So, a new version of KSP comes out, you wait however long on mod updates, and then find the mod update breaks your save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I\u0027ve cut way back on my use of mods. I use all the instrumentation ones above (and a few others like Kerbal Alarm Clock) but keep my parts mods to the bare minimum that I think are essential to enjoy sandbox mode: Kethane, KAS, and SCANsat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, SCANsat gives you extra science for mapping planets so will speed things up for you slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T05:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62814-Tutorial-Beginner-Science\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62814-Tutorial-Beginner-Science\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best for beginner.
