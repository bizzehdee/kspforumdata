How does it perform at high speed maneuvers? I like the improved wing shape.\n\nAt high speed it reverts to how it was before down low, controls stiffen up a bit but it has the recommended 6g turn at 200 to 300m/s at 5000m.\n\nAt 15,000m it goes from flight mode normal to large AoA sideslip and doesn\u0027t have a stall point within 40 degrees of your velocity vector\n\nInstead it is meta-stable in the direction you point the nose and the velocity vector makes itself accommodating to your desired flight path. It\u0027s quite unusual to fly, as I said it\u0027s you point the nose and physics takes over and now you\u0027re flying in a different direction\n\nEDIT: I added the Halsfury TM area ruling blister to the rear of the cockpit, I wasn\u0027t a fan of the obvious parts clipping of the two Mk 2 pods\n\n![XKmkX5b.png](http://i.imgur.com/XKmkX5b.png)\n\nAlso you might have noticed the large leading edge slat running across the wing, I cheated here, on the real thing there are 2 slats which can be independently computer controlled, want to invent a KOS script to adjust wing slats on negative stability fighters? lol\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlso I think I\u0027ve held you in suspense long enough now\n\nI\u0027ll leave it to you to arm it\n\n[http://www./download/09qj4eqg2pm8e4v/FAR_BD_Dassault_Rafale_F1.craft](http://www./download/09qj4eqg2pm8e4v/FAR_BD_Dassault_Rafale_F1.craft)\n\nAlso slap a speed brake on there while you\u0027re at it, it could use the control\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T17:51:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"}]}
