I haven\u0027t been to tylo yet so not sure the exact atmo and gravity concentration. I do see what I would try changing. Mainly that single goofy looking engine between your half 2m and full 2m tank. That is extra weight and not really sure if it actually has a functional purpose. Second would be those high thrust yet inefficent large engines. If tylo\u0027s gravity is less, try running just the efficient engines out there. Also put in the 2m high SI engine in the centre. It gets pretty good thrust in itself and have the outer tanks feed inner instead. Jettison those small outer ones as needed. You probably could even try putting the high efficiency 1m engines on the outer as well. Without atmosphere getting off is easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow since writing that first paragraph, I looked at some info, and assuming gravity on Tylo is similar, I recommend hauling some braking SRBs. I use them on spaceplanes and many other of my rockets for departure. My duna rockets all use them. The instant thrust at low weight is perfect for stopping. Can try fitting them outside of your lander engines to brake. For the launch, in that gap on the inner radius, attach some initial launch srbs to get a high velocity before burning your fuel. Without the atmo problem, get your horizontal velocity up using the srbs as fast as possible. This should allow you the time to use efficient engines to capture a low altitude orbit without having to worry about falling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my spaceplanes lack of functioning atm, I will need to hit tylo for a break, sounds like a fun challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
