Removed artificial light. Removed Easy\u0027s food production module. Reduced node attachment sizes. Removed duplicate shutter buttons. Removed seed resource. Added light resource. Defaults to half max amount of biomass\n\n\\*2015.0618 18:32 This is what happens when you start using automated tools to help. Added light resource back to all greenhouses. Fixed red, hard attachment node sizes. Removed duplicate modules from Easy greenhouses.\n\n\\*2015.0618 18:44 Removed algae greenhouse from Easy\n\n\\*2015.0618 19:10 Fixed problem with starting game and not explicitly choosing a difficulty. \n\n\\*2015.0618 23:38 EASY: moved tanks from Science to Utility. Changed the name of the gas compressor\n\n\\*2015.0619 10:06 HARD: removed legacy BioReactor module. Renamed the buttons Start/Stop H2 Rxn, Start/Stop KH4\u002BO2 Rxn\n\n\\*2015.0619 10:35 Misc tweaks to BioReactor. Fixed animations. HARD: increased rate of Bioreactor. Now yields 0.24L liquidFuel/day. MEDIUM: Fixed Easy BioReactor(wasn\u0027t mass balanced), increased rate of Bioreactor. Now yields 0.41L liquidFuel/day. EASY: increased rate of Bioreactor. Now yields 0.72L liquidFuel/day. Medium and Hard need water for everything to work.\n\n\\*2015.0619 12:28 Increased compressor release rates for Medium and Hard by factor of 10, except for Hydrogen. Left that as-is.\n\n\\*2015.0619 14:18 HARD and MEDIUM: Simplified the BioCake\u002BKethane gas rxns\n\n\\*2015.0622 Fixed popup window problem. Reported by Lachlan ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125880-WIP-BioMass-mod-needs-testers-%28greenhouses-gas-compressors-biofuel-production%29?p=2032459\u0026viewfull=1#post2032459](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125880-WIP-BioMass-mod-needs-testers-%28greenhouses-gas-compressors-biofuel-production%29?p=2032459\u0026viewfull=1#post2032459))\n\n\\*2015.0624 Somehow lost edits to BioReactor from 2015.0619. Hard BioReactor is fixed again. Minor testing of the MicroBiome. Set the modules (except the water valve) to be always working.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T23:59:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seanth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T11:39:19Z","Content":"I wonder if new release will use realistic (and CRP-compatible) resources and conversion rates thus being compatible with [RealISRU](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121896) and [RealFuels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118)?"},{"CreatedByName":"harvell64","CreatedById":109923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T14:00:29Z","Content":"So happy to see this mod still in development.

Included a radial oxidizer tank on Medium and Hard. Included gas storage bags (based on roverdude\u0027s landing bags). This allows things to function on rails when not selected by providing places for gasses to actually be. Will only be in medium and hard. LiquidCO2 changed to LqdCO2 to comply with community resource pack. The Atmospheric extractor works on Kerbin and Duna (though there is a rate bug on the KSP side, I think).\n\n###2015.0704 Tweaked aspects of how the compressors work.

Otherwise I would install just another life support mod with just two resources or similar. Your mod is for sure for gamers which loves challenges.\n\nSo there are two ways for supporting gamers at the beginning. \n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E Just make a simple popup screen at the beginning (witch a check box \u0022show hint again\u0022). There you describe just in a very simple way what to do. Like: \n\n***On the difficulty level \u0022Easy\u0022 a Kerbal needs 1 units of oxygen (I do not know how much they really needs), at lest 0,7 units of water and 1 units of food to survive a single day. So for this you must find the right modules producing the needed resources. Be aware all modules need other resources to function well.***\n\n ****** \n\n***Attention: The amount of the different resources which you can produce depends on the difficulty level of BioMass.***\n\n***Easy: Oxygen, CO2, Water, Food...***\n\n***Classic: ...***\n\n***Moderate: ...***\n\n***Masochist: ...*** \n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E For more information visit our homepage.\n\n(And there you can put some diagrams showing how all the modules works together. Just KISS)\n\nFor me you should actual not focus on the way to present the information but on the \u0022internal\u0022 functions of the mod. \n\nAlso just for me speaking it would just be perfect if you point out all the produced units of the resources in just one measurement systems ..e.g. Units/second. That would be great.\n\nAnd also, even if this is not your business, it would be great if I could read in this popup screen the resources a Kerbal does really need per day. \n\n**@Animation of growing plants in the Greenhouse: Expand-O-Matic**\n\nMaybe I was not that clear. I do not really care about the animation of a growing plant. I just would be happy if the module itself just extend the panels and shine in the night^^ My ships will look that awesome with your great and shiny modules.\n\nI am just waiting on the edge of my chair for the next update of your mod to test the hell out of it :-D\n\nYour mod will be soooo awesome to create my generation ship^^"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T11:51:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, seanth said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A few ready-made craft is a good idea.
