I mean SSTOs that look like rockets and take off vertically, but use jet engines. Back in 1.0.2 i made one that could bring 60 tons into orbit, but now it appears to be a lot harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see your designs! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mackadelik","CreatedById":143364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T17:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill trying lol, spent all night trying to get an SSTO (vertical) up in orbit, but it always flips once I lose the side boosters and switch to main engine. I think I\u0027m going to take the design I have (MK3 through and through) and try to create a space only ship that is pretty much complete at take off and will never be meant to land : p First I got to get this flipping issue handled when I switch to nuke engines. They have no gimble and I think my center of thrust is off causing it to flip instead of fly straight... Maybe I\u0027ll add 10 SAS or something lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T09:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one I used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SZW2ryb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SZW2ryb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another by Riph:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GGatl9S.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GGatl9S.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to mind the relative positions of aerodynamic center and mass center when tanks are full (ascent) and near-empty (descent). Those positions should be reversed between the two phases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
