Which options you use will depend entirely on what you part is and what it will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important part is at the top of the file. It is where you give your part a unique \u003Cstrong\u003EIdentifier Name\u003C/strong\u003E which is what KSP uses to reference it in save files and craft files. It MUST be unique and now share this name with any other part you have installed in KSP, and you should try to make sure that its unique in such a way that no other mod might use it. For instance, in my Novapunch mod all part identifiers start with the prefix \u0022NP_\u0022 which means that as long as no other author uses that prefix they will always be unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ename = NP_HugeFuelTank1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next line is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emodule = Part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis line tells KSP what sort of object its going to be within the game.

This is important mostly when you are setting up attachment nodes for your part. If you scale is 1 then setting your node 1 unit away is 1 meter, but you\u0027d need to use 100 to get 1 meter if your scale is 0.01.

You probably found this post from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that it has links to descriptions for all of the different part types in the list. If you are making an engine, then read the entries under engine and you will find info on the modules you might want to include.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Kerbal Wiki Config File Documentation\u003C/a\u003E Contains a rundown of most of the stock config file entries. it doesn\u0027t have everything, but its a great place to learn the basics of config files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this entry is somewhat out of date. There is currently an updated one under development that can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/User:Greys\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E Be sure to check them both over to find the best information you can. And when in doubt, reply here and ask!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are done, you just need to set up your files within KSPs directory. Mods are stored in the GameData folder, inside a subfolder unique to you. You should open up the KSP folder and then open the GameData folder. Inside you will see a Squad folder as well as folders for other mods you have installed. Make a new one for your mod. It should look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VMm540P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VMm540P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, open up your new folder. In here, you should make another folder for your part. (If you have a lot of parts, you can also make subcategories here, like a folder that will contain all of your fuel tank parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning, you should make a separate folder for each part you make. There are advanced techniques you can use if you share one model and texture between parts, but that can come later. (You\u0027ll find more information on that in the Compilation post I linked earlier. Look for MODEL node topics)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an example of three new parts in your mod folder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XSrYFjl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XSrYFjl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can go into your part\u0027s folder. This is where you will place your .mu and texture files (.mbm, .png, or .tga files) as well as your part.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/maAQvz6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022maAQvz6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note the Open with.. Dialog there, set up to open cfg files in Notepad every time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have got your exported model and textures in there, and your part.cfg file edited up, its time to load up KSP and see if it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind this is only a starting port.
