The first Kerbals in a successful mission (the first time successful, no rescue missions needed) outside of the Kerbin system. Secondly, I made a 3-man SSTO plane, which is also a milestone. The first time I\u0027ve made a successful plane with more than one Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne plus One = LAYTHE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we build it? Yes we can!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was going to be my most ambitius project ever. Three simultaneous launches into the same Jool transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hooked my SSTO to the same transfer stage I used for my Jool station. I figured the lighter plane would increase the delta-V of the transfer stage enough to allow me to get to Laythe. I was correct. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZtrLrtn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZtrLrtn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane goes first, carrying the 3 krewman, in order to scout out potential landing sites. We are bringing two hatibat landers and a rover, in order to make comfortable living zones as well as to do real science. We wanted interesting topography as well as enough resources around to be habitible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S3WUUTJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S3WUUTJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t realize how much water was on Laythe and how few landing sites we\u0027d have to choose from. We picked one with enough land mass to be an easy target to coast down with our lander cans as well as a long enough flat zone for the plane to take off and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually the 2nd of the two habitat landers approaching Laythe. These two were only seperated by a matter of 4 days. Which, when you are new to juggling crafts, 4 days seems mighty short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6bODayF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226bODayF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put the two nearly identical lander cans in nearly identical oribts. To land them, I guestimated the first one. Then the second I just tried to repeat the exact same maneuver. I got them to within 500 meters; final landing on just parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HAnyhBo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HAnyhBo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of our lander cans has a rover attached. It was extremely top heavy, so by turning off the rear wheels and leaving it in front-whee-drive only, we were able to crawl our way over to the first lander. This was a slow process, topping out at 4m/s for safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cGtkHj1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cGtkHj1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we made it. This next image shows the two lander cans in the south and how close we were able to get to the plane\u0027s scouted site. Not perfect, but damn close for just eyeballing it. [*note* I have MechJeb installed, but I only use it to manage air intakes on the plane. I do not use it for maneuvers or landing, as I find these to be too fun to miss out on. Plus MechJeb loses some of the organic mistakes that make missions fun.] Ideally, we would have ended up closer to the plane, but this will work just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cR5MSFh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cR5MSFh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was simply a matter of flying our plane and our kerbals over to their new home-away-from-home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XY4Gm6e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XY4Gm6e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can clearly see the plane, and the two lander habitats. Each pod has room for 7, which keeps plenty of space for our Kerbals to be comfy. The team has agreed to a monthly rotation: one sleeps in one, while the other two share the 2nd. Rotating sleeping quarters as well as trash and cleanup duty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iINo2n0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iINo2n0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe middle lander pod actually comes equipped with a rover. This is how we were able to move the two bases close to each other. This rover is fully detachable. We simply undock, drop to our wheels, and drive away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3JPagrT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223JPagrT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter driving, we park it underneath, raise the landing gear from the pod, dropping the whole unit right back onto the rover. A little wiggling and they re-dock. Lowering the gear again lifts the rover wheels off the ground and puts the pod back on stable footing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, our plane is ever capable to lift-off, orbit, and reach our orbiting Jool base. We had enough fuel in the transfer stage that we\u0027ve simply left it in orbit around Laythe in order to remain self-sufficient for a long time. Eventually, we\u0027ll need to send up a refuelling / resupply vessel. But we already have those from our orbital supply trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are a fully functioning, fully capable, Jool system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T15:47:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mellojoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T15:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratz man, you did some good work right there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T04:37:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to have to steal that \u0022detachable manned rover\u0022 idea from you for my own bases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The14th","CreatedById":82126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T10:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations on a successful mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still new to the game, and no where near ready for manned missions to Laythe yet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T12:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a really fun learning curve with the game.
