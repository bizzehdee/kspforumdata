For instance, stock is ~70km max atmosphere altitude (69.x actually) so you\u0027d put periapsis at about 35km by his rationale.\u003Cp\u003ENot sure that would work in RSS.... it could I guess. Depending on the craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did mostly play with a blatantly reduced heat transfer coefficient (10-11) using the 6.4x RSS config so that I didn\u0027t have to bother with the RO heatshields: whether or not I should\u0027ve set it higher is up to debate. I did usually tend towards going shallower than 50% atmosphere in any event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KoolBreeze420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KoolBreeze420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003EWhen you say halfway into atmosphere are you talking about the placement of the green thing on the ball I find if I come in and the green thing is over the atmosphere in the ball I burn for too long and blow up if it\u0027s under the line then I lose lift and cant hold pitch and blow up.

In any case, just remember: do your level best to bleed off as much speed in the thin upper atmosphere as possible, because the lower atmosphere will kill you if you are still moving at anything remotely resembling orbital velocity. There is simply that much more air to transfer thermal energy and bleed away the ablative heat shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clear up one point: what would burn your hand faster, near-vacuum at 1000 degrees Celsius, or a pot of boiling water at 100 degrees Celsius? It isn\u0027t the near-vacuum, because there is so little matter to transfer heat there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandermatt","CreatedById":61813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T23:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour problem is that either you have not downloaded DRE version 6.2.1 and/or you are deploying your chutes too early and the air outsided is thousands of degrees Kelvin and they are burning up.
