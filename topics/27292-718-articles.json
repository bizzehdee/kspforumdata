Sadly, some mountains are higher ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then their luck changed. KSC remembered that there was an ore searching rover on Dres. Every rover has a bit of fuel and some small engine, used for final landing stages and hopping over mountains. With almost perfect timing, the rover was put into the path of the station after it burned up all its fuel. Timing was critical. The maneuver had to be done as close as possible to Dres. They docked, transfered fuel and engaged the engine. The additional fuel brought a dV of about 240 m/s.
