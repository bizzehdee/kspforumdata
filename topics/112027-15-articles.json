Why? If the conduction between skin and internals was so poor that it couldn\u0027t conduct as much away as was coming in, then the internal temp would rise, true - but at the same time, the skin temperature would have to go down. But it isn\u0027t, it\u0027s going up, and remains closely matched to internal temp at all times! Whyyyyy?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And what does SkinToIntFlux indicate? The name seems to suggest that it\u0027s flux between internals and the skin, but on the Twin Boar, it has the wrong number for that. If conduction is handled by the internals and radiation by the skin as the patchnotes said, and conduction is the only incoming heat source and radiation the only outgoing heat source, that would mean that SkinToIntFlux would have to have a value similar to either conduction or radiation (or both), give or take a sign. Especially since the Twin Boar here is very close to steady state. But the value is far off. It also doesn\u0027t change with temperature. I\u0027m confused!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from not understanding what\u0027s going on with heat, I did at least glean some minor preliminary insight in radiator performance. Nertea\u0027s radiators appear to outperform stock radiators pound for pound. Two GR-1 conformal radiators weigh 1 ton and keep a MX-L reactor comfortably at just over 800 K, partially depending on how much ship there is, because of course the rest of the ship also heats up to 800 K (minus an applicable gradient) and plays radiator. Meanwhile, four medium stock radiators, also weighing one ton, are already up to 917 K in the screenshot above, and the system hasn\u0027t stabilized yet. This is above the reactor\u0027s nominal temperature, and it\u0027s starting to lose power output. One large stock radiator, also weighing a ton, is slightly more effective but still only managed ~887 K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever there\u0027s a host of things that are less than ideal. For starters, one problem rears its head that you may remember from earlier NFE dev versions: radiator model surface =/= drag cube. In 1.0.2 NFE that problem was kind of glossed over by the fact that each radiator type\u0027s performance was throttled and entirely governed by its ability to ingest heat, which hid the fact that for example the GR-EXP performs far, far better than its visible surface area suggests. Now that all radiators throttle to the same temperature, you suddenly notice that the GR-EXP radiates 2.5 times what it is rated for, while the GR-4 properly matches its rating. The GR-1 is also better than it looks, but not as much as the GR-EXP. It\u0027s due to curved shapes creating a way too large drag cube, causing the game to think there\u0027s way more surface area than there is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of \u0022conformal radiators\u0022 meanwhile is now mostly superfluous other than for flavor reasons... since cooling capacity scales with temperature, the same radiators will perform better on a reactor that outputs more heat, and thus you sometimes don\u0027t even need to mount additional radiators despite the increase in heating. For example, two GR-1\u0027s cool a MX-1, and two GR-1\u0027s also cool a MX-L, even though the latter outputs an extra MW worth of heat. This is also exacerbated somewhat (albeit not primarily caused) by the difference in nominal temperatures between the reactors. The higher a reactor\u0027s nominal temperature, the less radiator area it needs. For example, if the MX-1 had the same 900 K nominal temperature as the MX-L, then a single GR-1 would have sufficed to cool it (at 870 K on my example ship). Futhermore, the larger your ship is, the less radiator area you need, because your ship is also a radiator under this system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above makes saying \u0022you should mount this many radiators to this reactor\u0022 pretty pointless. (Also, obviously the amounts are all wrong anyway right now, since the MX-1 says it needs four GR-1\u0027s but you pretty much can get away with just one in most real use cases.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther things that I noticed that I didn\u0027t like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There\u0027s little to no radiator glow; in fact, often the non-radiator parts of the ship will glow as bright or even brighter than the radiators once the whole ship is heated up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We\u0027re now back to cooking Kerbals alive in their pods at half a thousand degrees Celsius, sustained indefinitely.

You could just go back to a 0.90-type system where instead of a complicated heat mechanism, reactors simply check to see if they have the appropriate number of conformal radiators. If they do, they operate at full power. If not, they get throttled. The radiators don\u0027t actually have to radiate heat (as recognized by the rest of KSP), the reactors don\u0027t actually have to create heat (as recognized by the rest of KSP).
