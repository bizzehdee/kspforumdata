I made this to ask a few questions that I have(obviously). So, if you read on, you\u0027ll see my questions. I hope you take the time to answer them or direct to answers. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.Slow startup-This isn\u0027t loading. This is just getting to loading. I launch the game, and after roughly 10 minutes of black screen, I get the loading screen. Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.Weird framerate behavior-This one\u0027s weird. Whenever I\u0027m looking into the void of space, I have beautiful framerate. But the second I point the camera in the direction of a planet, my CPU shoots itself in the face. I\u0027d just like to know why more than anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.-WORDS CANNOT-This is even weirder than number two. When I drive rovers(on any planet or celestial body), I\u0027ll occasionally hit large invisible bumps that send me ~10 meters into the air, usually resulting in my rover landing upside down and being trashed. This happens even at around one meter per second. It\u0027ll just, like snag a wheel on something and flip over, destroying its own wheels, solar panels, and other necessary equipment. The other problems I can live with, but this is not okay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading, as I said, it would be lovely if you\u0027d answer these questions or point me toward a place that has answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
