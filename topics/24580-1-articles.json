I built it specifically for high altitude scenic flights. However, after noticing how well it handles, I would now like to transform it into an SSTO. In its current form, the plane can achieve an orbital velocity of around 1,3 km/s (surface velocity 1,1 km/s) and climb to 26 km before the engines flame out due to lack of oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the design suitable for such things and what modifications should be done to get it to space?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastodon","CreatedById":57231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T21:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you can add oxidizer and a rocket engine (looks to me like a aerospike or 909 would be more than enough) without sacrificing performance that would be all you need. the torque from your cockpit should be enough to orient the craft in space without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T09:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may not handle so well after you make the significant changes needed to make it an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
