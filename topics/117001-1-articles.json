A few personnel were laid off or left, the accountants adjusted things, and life continued.\n\nThen, they caught murmurs, rumours flying about like they so often do - Kerbin\u0027s population was almost lower than Laythe\u0027s now. Dismissing this as untrue, irrelevant, or otherwise unimportant, the Kerbals of the space program trudged onwards, still building them and flying them as they always had.\n\nThe first signs that anyone cottoned on to were too little, too late; governments moving offworld, countries reloacting into space. Somehow, it happened, despite assurances by some that \u0022a country is huge, their entire population couldn\u0027t be in space.\u0022\n\nIt was when the elder members of the program looked in the mirror, at calendars, and at each other than resignation set in; things were approaching their close. Kerbin emptying, the program growing ever smaller, them growing ever older...\n\nSoon enough, it was only the three of them left, standing just inside the VAB. Talking, just like they always did.\n\n\u0022So... this is it. The last chapter.\u0022 Bill said, trying - and failing - to keep the note of finality out of his voice.\n\n\u0022We did it; spacefaring society, settling other worlds, even starting to explore new stars... we did it all.\u0022 Bob cut in, sounding weary but content. Jeb chuckled quietly.\n\n\u0022So why do I feel like a toy, used and abused and abandoned when it\u0027s not useful anymore?\u0022\n\n\u0022No need to think like that. Look at the upside; we get to retire in that void that we dedicated our lives to.\u0022\n\n\u0022Mmm. Still, seems...\u0022\n\n\u0022Quiet.\u0022\n\nJeb reached over and flipped the switch; as the large doors rumbled closed, they wandered up to their ship, the last one to leave their homeworld.\n\nFor a brief moment, over the space center, night once again became day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T16:28:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The Error**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T21:46:45Z","Content":"Nice - bittersweet but nice."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T22:04:19Z","Content":"Amazing."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T23:19:39Z","Content":"And congratulations on a well-deserved sticky!"},{"CreatedByName":"The Error","CreatedById":58941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T16:25:05Z","Content":"O\\_o\n\nPost a lil\u0027 short story, leave it for a few days, and suddenly, stickied? \n\nHoly booster fuel!
