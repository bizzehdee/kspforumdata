What exactly goes on when you enable \u0022Hack Gravity\u0022 in the debug bar?\n\nI had to cheat to recover Valentina. I accidentally quicksaved rather than reverted, meaning that poor Valentina was stuck in her lander directly reentering Kerbin after a long voyage to Dres and back. \n\nI meant to aerobrake at Kerbin so that I could transfer her to my Kerbin Space Station, but screwed up the aerobraking altitude and ended up reentering in a lander without any parachutes and an LV-909 without enough thrust to slow her descent.\n\nSo I enabled \u0022Hack Gravity\u0022 and recovered her that way. I noticed that it didn\u0027t exactly enable me to \u0027control\u0027 gravity. What it did was basically slow the vessels\u0027 descent exponentially, so that by the time I hit sea level her velocity was basically zero. Does anyone have a better explanation to the mechanics of \u0022Hack Gravity\u0022, based on how it\u0027s coded?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T03:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NASAHireMe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:51:31Z","Content":"Hack gravity sets the gravitational force to 1/100th of normal (TWR 1 becomes TWR 100)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:52:16Z","Content":"\u0022Hack Gravity\u0022 basically disables gravity, kinda, for the most part, as far as I know. If you use it on Kerbin\u0027s surface, it allows you to contend with only the atmosphere when using vessels.
