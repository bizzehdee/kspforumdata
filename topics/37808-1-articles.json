Newton\u0027s third law dictates that there will be an equal opposing force produced on your own craft, though; if your main craft applies 100 kN to a satellite, the satellite also applies 100 kN (in the opposite direction) to your main craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It doesn\u0027t really matter what decoupler you use, in terms of functionality. I wouldn\u0027t use decouplers with the intent of providing force, it\u0027s much better to use engines so you can tune to exactly the orbit you want. You may want low-force decouplers for satellites that need to remain in a particular orbit, though; even the force produced by docking ports can cause light satellites to be pushed out of a geosynchronous orbit. To decouple with zero force, use a docking port and attach a strut to the craft you\u0027re detaching: the strut will dissolve when you decouple, and there will be no force applied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Not really. The usual physics apply; some of the decoupling force will be negated by drag, but that\u0027s mostly inconsequential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T09:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDecouplers add such a tiny amount that I wouldn\u0027t bother with that, they\u0027ll change your orbit a minimal amount.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is not correct!\u003C/strong\u003E Yes, the force is small but \u003Cstrong\u003Efar\u003C/strong\u003E from negligible!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re decoupling a heavy satellite you can ignore the decoupler.
