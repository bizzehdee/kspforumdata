However, I keep reading how many people have serious wobble issues. Now, some of the designs I see are asking for wobbles, what with obvious imbalances in weights or forces, or with severe stress concentrations at wasp-like waists, but most rockets I see that are claimed as wobbly don\u0027t appear to have these problems. In fact, they look much like mine. So for a long time I was puzzled as to why they wobbled and my generally similar rockets didn\u0027t. Was it related to computer horsepower, different mods, different flying styles, or what? Finally, however, I noticed that the main difference I could see between these wobbly rockets and mine was that mine always have tail feathers and these did not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis got me thinking. All rockets require something that generates control forces so they can do the gravity turn during launch. Reaction wheels (unless you have an insane number of them) don\u0027t provide enough torque to turn big rockets in a timely manner. Very few people seem to use RCS during launch, and as mentioned these rockets don\u0027t have tail feathers. So the only thing left is thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 variables affect the control force generated by thrust vectoring: the angle the nozzle points and the throttle setting of the engine. During launch, the throttle is generally wide open (or a hair less to prevent overheats) so that\u0027s really not a variable here. That leaves the angle. I really don\u0027t know how the game moves the nozzle but observations suggest that instead of using fine increments between 0 and full deflection, the nozzle goes from 1 extreme to the other without stopping in between. If true, this means that during launch, thrust vectoring is slamming the rocket with off-center thrust as hard as it can each time it activates. And because of this, thrust vectoring is not a precision control system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lack of fine control becomes critical if you have either SAS or MechJeb running during launch. Both of these systems try to keep the rocket on a precise heading using whatever control systems are available to them. This means they want to make very frequent, very small control adjustments to stay on course. But if all they have to work with is thrust vectoring, they\u0027re going to have big problems, especially during launch. At full throttle, thrust vectoring will almost certainly cause an overshoot, requiring an immediate correction in the opposite direction, which will also overshoot, repeat. Thus, the rocket is subjected to a constant stream of strong, off-center thrusts in different directions, which can\u0027t help but result in significant wobble. OTOH, if the rocket has tail feathers and/or RCS, even if it also has thrust vectoring, SAS and MJ seem smart enough to use them for their fine control needs instead of using thrust vectoring. Thus, no wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: The biggest source of wobble during launch that I\u0027ve found is when you have no control systems except thrust vectoring AND are using either SAS or MJ. If you fly totally manually with SAS off, you\u0027re not giving a constant stream of small control inputs, just making major inputs at long intervals. Thus, you don\u0027t get wobble even if all you have is thrust vectoring. So, it seems to me that to avoid wobbly launches, you should either add some tail feathers and/or RCS, or don\u0027t use either SAS or MJ during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my theory.

My general control strategy is to disable gimbal on most of my boosters except the center engine. This keeps overall wooble to a minimum, but still provides enough control authority. For smaller rockets with no side boosters, I generally disable gimbal as well, but I slap on some canards for aerodynamic control. 4 canards plus the built in reaction wheel is generally enough to keep most designs pretty stable up through around 20,000m and generally I\u0027ve ditched the lower stage by then anyway. Upper stages with lower powered engines the wobble often isn\u0027t a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T14:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Locking gimbling to reduce control authority is a great way of reducing wobble.

However, I find that thrust vectoring is more than sufficient, even for 3000t\u002B rockets with 40\u002B mainsails, for controlling rockets. The only time where it may *need* aerodynamic surfaces is when using gimbal-less engines like the T30. Though disabling gimbals can help, on large launchers it\u0027s usually too much of a pain for me to mess with, and i really don\u0027t seem to suffer too much for it. A few (by which I do mean just a few) struts is really all it takes to keep most of my rockets stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that I find aerodynamic surfaces helpful for on rockets is making launch turns faster, since they can then use lift forces to keep you prograde. Also, if your rocket is (for some reason) significantly drag-heavy on the top, lift surfaces will pull that back to keep the rocket from tumbling. Also, if overcontrol is an issue, you can activate gradual control mode with CAPSLOCK and repeatedly tap the controls to turn yourself very gently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T18:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I launch large and delicate rockets where even the new SAS causes deadly wobble, I just keep vectoring on but turn off SAS and use as little control as possible.
