First issue, I know KSPTOT shows Earth Years/days; not (yet) Kerbin ones (Hope a day will come for a setting to switch among the two systems). Of course UT is used internally, and for transfer of time with KSPTOTConnect, so KSPTOT will always use the correct data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond issue, that is a behaviour I observed as well a number of times with KSPTOT. I want to show a few porkchop plots of that K-Ee transfer shifted in time:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Qvam0uq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Qvam0uq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9EcPAbP.png\u0022 alt=\u00229EcPAbP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Td1QuRP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Td1QuRP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose show 3 solutions for transfer at one synodic period (about 113 Earth days) difference each other. Please note that the optimal departure date (minimum Delta-V) is with the first of the above plots, BEFORE the initial date in Kobymaru\u0027s plot. I guess KSPTOT is giving the correct solution when finds a minimum (in Total Delta-V) within the plotted area, but gets confused when the correct solution is outside the allowed bounds. In that case, the minimum shown on Kobymaru\u0027s plot is on a slope. It is not a correct solution (and could be filtered out if a check for gradient was implemented) and indeed the Delta-V shown is way too high. The plot axis lenghts degenerate to 1.0 as the correct times are outside of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when I see a similar issue, I change dates in the entry boxes until I put a local minimum within the plot area. With the plots shown above, I first went backwards in time as that was the direction KSPTOT was leaning towards in its search. But if limited by a bound, KSPTOT should actually try to find a valid solution in the other direction (with greater departure dates). The third of the plots above shows one such valid solution is found 92 days after the earliest departure date set in Kobymaru\u0027s plot, and I suppose it would have been automatically found and plotted if KSPTOT wasn\u0027t instead trying to find the best possible solution (occurring in the past).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T08:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the latest release, I can\u0027t seem to add my own thruster nor modify existing ones.

Additionally, there are options on the main GUI (Edit Menu -\u0026gt; Options) that allow you to search for multiple synodic periods (any positive integer number of periods I think) and add/subtract number of points per axis.

To be honest I was expecting to see a bit more information about each leg, like the actual maneuver values for the circularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice work! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how to use this in the game. Here\u0027s what I do (of course I use my own software!). I plan the whole mission out ahead of time, just as you\u0027ve done with the mission plan you linked to here. Then, I get into orbit in KSP. Go back to Mission Architect (pause KSP here). Open up the initial state and import the orbit from KSP using KSPTOTConnect (right click on the orbit display, select get orbit from KSP). KSP \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E be running and \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E be in the Flight Scene (where you can see/control your vessel) for this to work. So import the orbit and then save/close the initial state box. Inevitably this will screw up your mission plan, because you didn\u0027t launch into exactly the orbit you specified in Mission Architect the first time around. So go ahead and re-optimize the mission with Mission Optimizer. Re-find a mission solution that gets you to Duna or where ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got this, we can use Mission Architect to import maneuvers directly into KSP using KSPTOTConnect. Select the first DV_Maneuver in the Mission Script in Mission Architect, right click it, and select the Upload option. Hit the big red button on the box that comes up. Now go back to KSP and double check that your maneuver was created properly. It should have been. Unpause KSP, execute maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve executed the maneuver, pause KSP. Go back to Mission Architect. Select the Coast event immediately after your DV_Maneuver in the mission script. Right click the mission script and select \u0022Advance Script Up To Selected Event.\u0022 This will trim the mission script down to just the events after the burn. Now go back to the initial state, reimport from KSP as above, and rinse and repeat for each engine burn in your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if you have any questions! I hope that helps.
