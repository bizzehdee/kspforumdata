I noticed that this mod has not been updated for a while so it is still locked at KSP 1.2.2. Im using 1.2.2 as its the only working \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E solution we can have. I have taken the liberty to fix your Statics as most of them have serious errors. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Problem : When saving new assets , upon game reload the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Terrain mesh takes place for what you originally saved. So if I make a launch complex LC5 and save the Static.....reload the game....the Complex will turn into the huge Terrain filler. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Investigation : The reason for this is that most your static files have \u0022name = Spawnmarker\u0022 .  When this happens the game will find the earliest instance of name = Spawnmarker and find what mesh was used in A-Z order. The KCS Terrian Filler is the first on the list to make the parse pass. Thus the game loads that mesh instead of the LC5 mesh.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Solution :  I went and fixed all the name = errors and the game saves assets like a champ! Is there a way to post this fix to you in a fast efficient way? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So to make a short sto\uFEFFry short your Statics all share a common name, but should have had a unique name. LoL might have been a case of the Find and Replace Mondays ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nAnyway you can drop that config on dropbox? I have no idea what to change but I have seen the \u0022spawnmarker\u0022 names in most of the .cfg files but only a handful of use-able launchpads (haven\u0027t gone in and ticked the missile rows, etc. as possible launchpads) and everything is incredibly spread out for me (using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E so at least most things are level with the terrain, aside from the actual \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E terrain mesh lol)"},{"CreatedByName":"infinite_monkey","CreatedById":185663,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-03T14:52:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/15/2018 at 5:49 AM, Tristonwilson12 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![LC39A.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260476122297401364/445794779163262988/LC39A.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260476122297401364/445794779163262988/LC39A.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nI love it!
