You go to the launch pad. You wait for physics to load.. then BOOM!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket seems sound, but because the physics goes from 0 to on in the space of a frame, the whole rocket decides to act like a spring, and bits start tearing themselves off, despite being strutted up to the eyeballs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how about making it so that gravity is at 0 the moment physics starts, and the spacebar is disabled. Over the course of maybe a second, the gravity could gradually take effect, giving various rocket parts the chance to settle, rather than bounce. The spacebar can come on when gravity has reached 1x normal strength. Of course, this wouldn\u0027t stop a poor rocket design from falling to bits, but it may stop the need for huge amounts of struts to keep an otherwise steady rocket from unplanned disassembly before it even gets off the floor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also stop some aircraft from splashing all over the runway due to having to drop a few feet onto the floor when physics starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay, nay, or does anybody have a better suggestion?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Outlander4","CreatedById":20008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T11:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think inability to handle Kerbin\u0027s gravity when standing at the launchpad will be a sure reason for unplanned rocket disassembly when under acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T12:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Outlander4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Outlander4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think inability to handle Kerbin\u0027s gravity when standing at the launchpad will be a sure reason for unplanned rocket disassembly when under acceleration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot necessarily!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had a couple of different designs which, most of the time, will stay together on the launch pad. Once launched, they stay together all the way up. However, there might be a 30% chance that when physics enables, and that sag happens, the whole rocket will bounce on its launch stabilizers, and bits will come off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving the gravity gradually fade on rather than suddenly be there, would mean that a sturdy-but-large rocket design has more chance of staying in one piece, without having to spam struts. There\u0027s basically no sudden shock to the structure, which is what can cause pieces to detach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for aircraft. I\u0027m sure there are many people who have held their breath as the aircraft gets spawned \u003Cem\u003Eabove\u003C/em\u003E the runway, and drops like a stone the short distance to the floor.

That kind of force could be putting the rocket parts under greater stress than any launch the stack will be put through (well, unless Jeb\u0027s piloting it, of course). If it\u0027s a choice of having the gravity fade-on to at least pretend that the rocket was slowly hoisted into position on a crane or something, rather than spamming an already-straining game engine with yet more parts, I\u0027d very much rather have the gravity fade on. This isn\u0027t about the entire physics engine somehow fading into existance - I know that\u0027s not possible. Just the gravity force. If it fades on, there\u0027s less chance of a bounce, and less chance of an otherwise sturdy-enough rocket stack flexing about like it\u0027s made of bedsprings and having bits come off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure if you took a NASA-designed rocket stack, hoisted it three feet up and dropped it onto the launch pad, there would be damage. Same thing, really. And, as already stated, it could very well help with an aircraft\u0027s tendency to be spawned just that little bit above the level of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, even if the rocket wouldn\u0027t make it up in one piece and is only hanging on by a thread anyway, failures at t\u002B10 seconds are always more awesome than failures at t-10 seconds, wouldn\u0027t you say?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T12:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehehe agreed with that last bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps best would be the ability to turn on gravity in the VAB (with unbreakables and without the ability to edit while its on)? that way when it spawns on the launchpad its already at full gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethinking about your suggestion, what would it do to other loaded parts if the gravity changed wildly (instantaneously going to 0 for example), gravity cant be applied to one craft different to another (as far as i know). try having a rover near the launchpad and hacking gravity in your new vessel. the rover goes flying (or at least up a bit) and then crashes into the ground. so that really isn\u0027t a viable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T13:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehehe agreed with that last bit.\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps best would be the ability to turn on gravity in the VAB (with unbreakables and without the ability to edit while its on)? that way when it spawns on the launchpad its already at full gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethinking about your suggestion, what would it do to other loaded parts if the gravity changed wildly (instantaneously going to 0 for example), gravity cant be applied to one craft different to another (as far as i know). try having a rover near the launchpad and hacking gravity in your new vessel. the rover goes flying (or at least up a bit) and then crashes into the ground. so that really isn\u0027t a viable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m not a Squad developer, I don\u0027t know how they\u0027ve done the physics in the game. However, I\u0027m sure it should be possible to have objects to which gravity is not applied. The same as how some objects (I think struts for instance) don\u0027t have any collision detection. Stuff can go straight through them without causing damage. It may well be possible to fade gravity on, but only for the new objects that have appeared on the launch pad. Once gravity has faded to 1x normal for them, then whatever \u0022part_is_new=true\u0022 or (better) \u0022stack_is_new=true\u0022 flag is used can be removed, and any related parts are affected by the global gravity value as normal. Something like that should be a minimal extra expenditure of CPU resources, and means you don\u0027t have to strut-spam anything over a few hundred parts just to get it to stay together on the launch pad, when it would otherwise be strong enough to survive to orbit without such a high strut count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s not going to take too much time to test it, I\u0027d love to see the results, anyway.
