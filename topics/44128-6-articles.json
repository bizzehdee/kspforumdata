How many of those games involve enough computation that they can\u0027t realistically all be done on the server computer? For that matter, how many of those games would cope with a computer that can\u0027t run the current simulation in real time?

It\u0027s along the same issues as making a single-threaded program multi-threaded. In a single-threaded program, it\u0027s fairly common to do things that assume that the running code is the only thread and therefore requires no locking or semaphores to ensure that things don\u0027t get changed in the middle of a function without that function\u0027s knowledge. Changing code written to run as a single-threaded program to multi-threaded isn\u0027t trivial in the case of non-trivial programs unless you\u0027re doing a half-assed multi-threaded implementation with global locking, because assumptions that are valid in a single-threaded program are no longer valid in a multi-threaded program. The same thing is true between single player games and multiplayer games, assumptions can break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for any limitations placed by unity, the devs have already ruled out changing engines beyond updating to newer versions of Unity.
