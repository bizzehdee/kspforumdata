I have a challenge: Build a Mecha (a large machine controlled by a human/kerbal). As it\u0027s really hard to move things in only stock KSP, I\u0027m allowing the use of mods for movement of arms, legs, and other things. It can be as small as you want or as big as you want, no size rules apply (But no excessive use of TweakScale). Submit your designs below, but more importantly, have fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
