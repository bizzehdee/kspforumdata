I didn\u0027t realise there was a problem with the engine that makes that not happen. That\u0027s a real shame; it\u0027s a fundamental feature of nature... because the perfect alignment of planets mean that there are no seasons on any of them. Which is absurd. That would be the VERY FIRST THING I would change about it. Having an earth-like axial tilt to Kerbin would make a massive difference in interest and challenge to the game overall.... before you can do a transfer you have to align your orbit with the system ecliptic (i.e. the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit around Kerbol), and since as Kerbin moves around the sun that alignment will change over time... and yet, would not make getting into orbit of Kerbin any more difficult than it currently is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the tiny system with improbably dense celestial objects, and its frankly cartoony nature. I mean, it\u0027s a video game, so cutting transfers to Duna (for example) down to a manageable length of time is just fine with me. I use Distant Objects and I have all the flares cranked to max because it aids in the cartoony nature of the night sky. I understand people\u0027s complaints about the sameness of the planets, but I can also understand why it\u0027s like that... making the planets more complex will seriously add to the overall footprint of the game, and the game\u0027s footprint is pretty hyarge to begin with. My thinking on that is that on the ground becomes a load on demand instead of load at runtime sort of scenario, and that means developing a subsystem that can load and unload the resources for that... so in orbit it pretty much is as it is, but once you land on a body then the game starts pulling in more resources to handle what you see going on on the ground. It\u0027s an interesting problem figuring out how to do that without necessarily going into trying to map all of a FREAKING PLANET for the game. How can one make that sort of thing happen deterministically yet procedurally with the level of detail required to make surfaces more interesting without totally driving the CPU into the dirt? Personally, I think that Squad should seriously consider hiring a superstar in numeric computer science to look at ways at making that happen. They should also maybe consider taking a good long look at the Principia plugin implementing Hamiltonian orbital mechanics, fixing some of the orbital resonance problems with the Jool system, and look at using that in the future... it gives so much more to the game like Lagrange points and the ability to really run some of the more arcane kinds of celestial motions like moons in horseshoe orbits and so on... the down side is that Principia and the asteroid belt are pretty much incompatible as they will drive your CPU into the dirt, though perhaps with the improved physics engine in Unity 5 that may not be the case after 1.1 comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reasonable compromise might be setting it up to run on Lagrangian orbital mechanics. The TL;DR is Newtonian (which is what the game uses) is 2-body orbital mechanics, Lagrange is 3-body, and Hamiltonian is n-body. With Lagrangian you would still have SOIs and so on, but when you\u0027re focused on a body in a particular SOI it will only go two deep for it\u0027s orbital calculations... so if you\u0027re looking at a ship orbiting Minmus, it will account for the ship, Minmus, and Kerbin. If it leaves Minmus\u0027 SOI, it will look at the ship, Kerbin, and Kerbol. If you\u0027re looking at Minmus, it will look at Minmus, Kerbin, and Kerbol... and so on, with everything that appears in the map outside of the analysed bodies being on rails like they are currently. You could then do things like give each asteroid an SOI depending on its class, and when your ship is in it\u0027s SOI (which would necessarily be very tiny... down to just a few meters for Class A for example) then you\u0027re looking at the ship, the asteroid, and whatever SOI the asteroid happens to be in at the time. Overall, this would mean you could get some but not all of the features... you\u0027d have Lagrange points, but horseshoe orbits are out. This isn\u0027t a perfect solution but it might be a good compromise solution, if you follow me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne major expansion to the game that would be pretty cool would be to implement a local stellar grouping, with somewhere around five to ten stars orbiting a common centre... with principa you could even set up that common centre to be the barymetric centre of the stars (not sure if I\u0027ve got the term right there, but hey). This would permit setting up LOOOOOOOOOONNNNGGGGGGGG transfers to other stars would be similar to how one does planetary transfers now, and possibly mean that you would have to expand the tech tree to include things like long hibernation, generational ships, and so on. Other fun things to possibly include (even though there are good reasons why they won\u0027t work in the real world) would be things like Bussard drives to permit extremely long burns (boost at 1 g until halfway there, then flip over and boost in the opposite direction until one gets to the rendezvous). Again, the Lilliputian nature of the game would mean the closest system would be about one light year away, which (if I recall my scifi) would make for a trip using the 1g-flip method something along the lines of 2 \u002B log2(2) years transit time, or ~3.5 years for the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of this stuff is trivial to implement, of course, but it would add a great great deal to the game.
