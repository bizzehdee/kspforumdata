You could have hundreds of mods like kerbal engineer while a few part heavy mods like B9 or basically any mod that adds a lot of textures will quickly bring you to the memory limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 might allow you to use a few part mods more if they manage to get rid of the memory leaks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T10:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA 32-bit application such as KSP can only use a maximum of 4GB, even if run on a 64-bit operating system.
