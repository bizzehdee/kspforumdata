Also, what are the actual criteria that differentiate 5 from 6? How much is \u0022some\u0022 or \u0022major\u0022 adaptation? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX seems a bit redundant too, as you could just class anything really odd as 2 or 3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure that 8 is really necessary either, given that Earth life is very well adapted to Earth. It extremely unlikely that there would be an independently evolved ecosystem that we\u0027d be better suited to that the one which spawned us. Personally I suspect that ALL exoplanets would fit into your class 1-4. I really can\u0027t see any exoplanet being hospitable to unmodified Earth life, there\u0027s just too much variation in exoplanets. But I guess we\u0027ll have to wait and see if I\u0027m right about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
