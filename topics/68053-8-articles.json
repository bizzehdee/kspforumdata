Either the auto gravity turn didnt work for me or I didnt execute it right. I might try it some more later as far as the launch goes. It was a fairly vertical launch profile. Maybe thats what you intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I did was encourage it to start turning gently towards 90 after I reached 60 m/s until the nose was over about 10 degrees off vertical. Then I turned on SAS and set it to follow prograde. Thats pretty much my normal launch profile these days. The rest of the launch I did as noted in the manual. That made it so the second stage got me to just shy of making orbit, it plunged back to the surface. I finished orbit insertion with the transfer stage, no problem. Executed everything else just as noted in the users manual for the most part. Went pretty smoothly and the fuel and electric was generous. Easy using that mono though, save that for docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe things I did do different were. I didnt deploy the radiators until after I had done my ejection burn to Duna, didnt notice I guess but the heat was ok on a single burn without them. I recommend using them though. lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I deployed the command ships solar panels fairly early on in the flight.

You should not have to do anything else before 20000 meters. If everything goes acording to plan, the ship will slowly turn to the 90\u00B0 direction. SAS is activated at 20000 meters, not before.

You need to change the instructions as it mentions aerobraking, this cannot be done now without a shield. Good thing too because the solar panels where changed recently and cannot be retracted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy transfer burn was quite good I still have half my fuel left for the nukes. And if you allowed the transfer stage to be re-docked to the crew pod you can get rid of the ion stage. There is more than enough fuel to get there and back. Also, you need to add chutes to the lander. I know it is cool to do a powered descent, which you can still do after chutes. It would allow the lander to be smaller, and you can add more \u0027toys\u0027 for the surface crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I am mightily impressed with this.
