I unlocked some new tech that meant the final version would be slightly different, so I wasn\u0027t going to use the prototype. I decided to evacuate the base and terminate flight, and then discovered I\u0027d been a bit of a moron and blocked a hatch with an RCS port. I did think about docking a craft to de-orbit the station in such a way that it could be recovered, but I\u0027m not sure a single docking port is strong enough for the kind of \u0022oomf\u0022 needed to bring down a station safely, especially as it was never designed with the thought of being de-orbited in mind!
