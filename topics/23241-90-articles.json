I am using a fresh Steam install of KSP (latest version), with only B9 aerospace mod installed. Smaller planes work fine, but on any larger plane the control surfaces flap around like mad as soon as I activate SAS, and, depending on how well balanced the plane is, the nose will tend to drift off course. Sometimes the SAS fights me to the extent that I am unable to manually change direction at all. Turning SAS off I have no difficulty controlling the plane. This problem happens with 4 of the 6 stock B9 planes, only the two smaller ones are exempt (the VTOL and the smaller jet - can\u0027t remember their names). Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LMA","CreatedById":75775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T12:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this mod compatible with Deadly Re-entry?
