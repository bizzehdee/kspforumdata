Just registered but I\u0027ve been a silent reader for a long time. Been loving KSP for months now, but I\u0027m relatively new to MechJeb and I only recently unlocked the LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor. My question is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Does MechJeb have an issue with calculating the Delta-V of this engine? I mean could just be missing something painfully obvious, I\u0027m no pro at the game yet by any means. But whenever I attach the LV-N, it \u003Cem\u003Enever \u003C/em\u003Egets the most Vac. Delta-V of the various engines I try on the ship. Since it\u0027s heavier, I even add enough dry-mass when trying on the other engines to bump the TWR to the same as it was with the LV-N attached. Still no luck. The LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 for example...added dry-mass when trying it on so that both it and the LV-N had the same TWR and the same amount of fuel at their disposal: even with the LV-N\u0027s much higher 800 Vac. ISP it gets less Delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is there something specific I\u0027m missing that is the key to using these Atomic Motors?

The Terrier uses both liquid fuel and oxidizer, so it has the mass of both to use for propellant. The LV-N has only the liquid fuel, the same amount that the Terrier had but no oxidizer. Since the mix is 9:11 LF:O, that means the LV-N is delivering close to the same dV for about 41% the propellant mass. Have a look at how the total vessel mass changes between the two designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a proper comparison, you should add enough tank space to give equivalent propellant mass to each engine (i.e. mass of LF\u002BO for the Terrier equal to the mass of LF only for the LV-N). The LV-N will also do better with dedicated LF-only tanks rather than tweaked LF-O tanks, they have less dry mass per unit of LF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there actually are situations in which the Terrier delivers more delta-V than the LV-N. If the total propellant mass is small enough (less than about 5 tons of propellant mass per engine), the lower mass of the Terrier outweighs the higher Isp of the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed Iron Ninja beat me to it, but here\u0027s some illustrations anyway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fvxr12R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fvxr12R.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hl0AfGH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hl0AfGH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe procedural tanks aren\u0027t the best example since their weights aren\u0027t identical, but as mentioned above, just removing the oxidizer from tanks gives a different mass of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt that size, there\u0027s no real reason to choose one over the other.
