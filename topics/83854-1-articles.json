Using height maps allows for a consistent appearance of planetary terrain when implementing fractal algorithms, it\u0027s not a planet generated randomly through procedural generation (which would make MP impossible). Using fractal algorithms means that a process of dynamic level of detail can be used in place of the static level of detail currently used with quad spheres. Only the areas that are within a certain distance of an object, be it a ship or Kerbalnaut, will increase the resolution of the mesh within the vicinity of their location to a certain distance from the objects POV while everything outside of it will be lower. This can increase the scale of other areas if the object moves position to another area, which will free up memory and other CPU/GPU functions. Additional details can be added too. Vector Data can be integrated on the planet surfaces to allow for artificial structures like buildings to exist, textures can be created on various heights of terrain using perlin noise algorithms, atmospheric scattering can be implemented at various altitudes and with different effects, you can create better and more lush vegetation types like grass, clouds and tree\u0027s with real-time projected shadows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T06:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK KSP does use fractal generation of the surface, beside certain manually designed large scale structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can learn more here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXTxQko-JH0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
