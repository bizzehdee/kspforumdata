Staging is the two jets for ascent to about 8km, then the two aerospikes for leaving atmosphere, then the NERVA. I would\u0027ve had better results from firing the nuclear engine while in the upper atmosphere instead of waiting for the aerospikes to burn out, but see above with relation to idiocy. I think it should be able to make a much higher orbit safely, but the Mun is stretching it. There\u0027s another variant without the heavy NERVA which pipes those fuel tanks behind the cockpit into the aerospikes. Didn\u0027t test that one, but it should orbit more easily due to having more readily available (but less overall) delta v. Once I iron out a few problems (like the jets being barely able to lift the thing) I\u0027ll go for the piloting awards - it\u0027s more than capable of pulling off a runway landing, even as-is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hooligan Labs","CreatedById":45359,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T00:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat to see new designs!

That was a very careful landing for such a big craft, however did you check the periapsis was above 70km during the flight? I went through your video, frame by frame at some points and checked every time there was a periapsis reading and also took craft velocity for both apoapsese (where the climb indicator goes to zero) and plugged them into the KSP calculator for eliptical orbits and came out with a PE about 65km every time. So unless you know different and you cut part of the flight out of the vid, which has a precedent btw, I have a sneaky feeling you might not have made an orbit which was completely in space. So I have tried to devise a suitably good humoured new caption for the gate crashers list for now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E and will revise it if you say that you made orbit or make another attempt successfully. I am certain that you can do it with that craft if you so choose because AP was high enough at 90km and FYI there was room for greater efficiency in the lift off (because straight up then across is not quite the most efficient path to orbit IMHO) so I hope you try again and win the K Prize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuzaku, thanks very much for your screeny record of your minimalist record mission.

You needed fewer wing parts as a result and also upped the ante by dropping ASAS and going with mechjeb which is within the rules and a valid way to cut weight. In this way as your screenshot clearly shows, you were able to make orbit and with a successful landing became the rightful holder of the minimalist record in v17... for now! Congratulations.

I had hoped to figure out a way to get it to the Mun but the AstroKerbal and KosmoKerbal awards seem out of reach atm so I had instead used it to set the benchmark for SSTO size and altitude in 0.17. I\u0027d imagine if it appeared in a Sci-Fi movie the forward facing tail sections would be some sort of weapon (Most likely Laser based but some sort of cool projectile weapon wouldn\u0027t be out of place either, dual rail guns would be a mighty setup indeed, but I digress...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done to Suzaku on creating such an efficient design, I didn\u0027t think a stable orbit was possible with such a limited amount of fuel.

It was my first SSTO design to use a parachute after landing which was lucky considering the size of the island I landed on. It\u0027s a robust design and extremely stable during re-entry - I am yet to loose control of it. KSC2 will have to have it\u0027s first crew assignment delayed somewhat while Mavericks crew are rescued and the ship is refueled. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s powerhouse is 2 turbojet engines during takeoff and a single aerospike rocket for orbital insertion and re-entry.
