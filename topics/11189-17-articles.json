After that, I think I had all criteria. I\u0027m an idiot and landed on the wrong continent.

The NERVA provides a good amount of delta v, but very slowly - it nearly dropped out of orbit. Staging is the two jets for ascent to about 8km, then the two aerospikes for leaving atmosphere, then the NERVA. I would\u0027ve had better results from firing the nuclear engine while in the upper atmosphere instead of waiting for the aerospikes to burn out, but see above with relation to idiocy. I think it should be able to make a much higher orbit safely, but the Mun is stretching it. There\u0027s another variant without the heavy NERVA which pipes those fuel tanks behind the cockpit into the aerospikes. Didn\u0027t test that one, but it should orbit more easily due to having more readily available (but less overall) delta v. Once I iron out a few problems (like the jets being barely able to lift the thing) I\u0027ll go for the piloting awards - it\u0027s more than capable of pulling off a runway landing, even as-is."},{"CreatedByName":"Hooligan Labs","CreatedById":45359,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T00:03:19Z","Content":"Great to see new designs!

Good news is that the delta-V is still there in ample quantities post-fuel-bug-fix. My piloting skill is a little rusty... quickload had a bit of a workout.

Due to the modified physics engine and fuel tank drain, flying wings are now just as unstable as they are in real life and have the tendency to backflip. Though a 11 ton ssto is intresting and as you\u0027ve shown it\u0027s possible. I will attempt a lighterweight ssto later, but keep us up to date on your design."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T21:58:52Z","Content":"Using MechJeb btw is within the rules but landing your craft intact is definitely a requirement for winning the K Prize and the kudos goals, not a requirement for the gate crashers list though ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nArchangel Lucifer, Space Wing is a powerful looking machine with a kind of muscular elegance which would not seem out of place in a SciFi movie. I was particularly intrigued by the creative use of the conical extensions and RCS jets to assist with zero G manoevures. Must have taken quite a bit or work to get all the engines balanced. It is certainly the heaviest to date in v17 and also the highest orbit yet seen, the evidence is clear that your mission is the current maximalist and altitudinalist record holder so congratulations on a holding the clean sweep of all three records for approx 13 hours and 19 minutes, that was until Suzaku made a successful bid for the minimalist record, see below! Thanks to EndlessWaves for measuring the weight of Space Wing at 89.38 tons.\n\nHooligan Labs, thanks very much for your latest bouncy (in a different way) mission report video. That was a very careful landing for such a big craft, however did you check the periapsis was above 70km during the flight? I went through your video, frame by frame at some points and checked every time there was a periapsis reading and also took craft velocity for both apoapsese (where the climb indicator goes to zero) and plugged them into the KSP calculator for eliptical orbits and came out with a PE about 65km every time. So unless you know different and you cut part of the flight out of the vid, which has a precedent btw, I have a sneaky feeling you might not have made an orbit which was completely in space. So I have tried to devise a suitably good humoured new caption for the gate crashers list for now ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) and will revise it if you say that you made orbit or make another attempt successfully. I am certain that you can do it with that craft if you so choose because AP was high enough at 90km and FYI there was room for greater efficiency in the lift off (because straight up then across is not quite the most efficient path to orbit IMHO) so I hope you try again and win the K Prize.\n\nSuzaku, thanks very much for your screeny record of your minimalist record mission. You took the K-17 design down to 4 x 400L tanks undercutting the previous record holder, Archangel Lucifer\u0027s Widowmaker which had tanks numbering 5.5 x 400L. You needed fewer wing parts as a result and also upped the ante by dropping ASAS and going with mechjeb which is within the rules and a valid way to cut weight. In this way as your screenshot clearly shows, you were able to make orbit and with a successful landing became the rightful holder of the minimalist record in v17... for now! Congratulations.

Amazingly, 6 engines were enough to get it off the ground. I had hoped to figure out a way to get it to the Mun but the AstroKerbal and KosmoKerbal awards seem out of reach atm so I had instead used it to set the benchmark for SSTO size and altitude in 0.17. I\u0027d imagine if it appeared in a Sci-Fi movie the forward facing tail sections would be some sort of weapon (Most likely Laser based but some sort of cool projectile weapon wouldn\u0027t be out of place either, dual rail guns would be a mighty setup indeed, but I digress...).\n\nWell done to Suzaku on creating such an efficient design, I didn\u0027t think a stable orbit was possible with such a limited amount of fuel.

It was my first SSTO design to use a parachute after landing which was lucky considering the size of the island I landed on. It\u0027s a robust design and extremely stable during re-entry - I am yet to loose control of it. KSC2 will have to have it\u0027s first crew assignment delayed somewhat while Mavericks crew are rescued and the ship is refueled. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s powerhouse is 2 turbojet engines during takeoff and a single aerospike rocket for orbital insertion and re-entry. I reckon I could make a single stage booster for it so it could go to the Mun or even further but ofcourse then it wouldn\u0027t qualify for the K-prize.\n\nI\u0027d also highly recommend checking out wikipedia and reading about anhedral/dihedral type aircraft configurations and the various type of tailplane designs used on real planes. It helped me make my designs more stable."}]}
