Then a small burn will complete the plane change. But that leaves you in a very eccentric equatorial orbit, and it\u0027s usually quite expensive to get that extreme eccentricity, since it takes nearly enough deltav to escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best plan was scuppered before you landed.

To launch into a given orbit you need to be below it at launch time. Which means the target orbit need to be inclined enough to reach the launch site\u0027s latitude.
