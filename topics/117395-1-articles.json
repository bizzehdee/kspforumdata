I\u0027ve been doing this since .90, but in 1.04 it also works amazingly well and I\u0027m able to pile on tons of mods before hitting the 3.7GB mark.

That\u0027s why any 32-bit OS or program can only use 4GB of memory. So moving up to a 64-bit application gives it 2^64 addresses for memory, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes. As you can see, it\u0027s a huge difference, and the chief reason for moving to 64-bit operating systems and applications. Most programs cap this for obvious reasons, and I believe Win7 Ultimate topped out at 256GB for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running around 70 mods in 1.04, Win7 x64, and it rarely goes over 3.4GB of memory usage. The DirectX-11 mode is MUCH more efficient at purging memory and much more dynamic. Sure, the game still doesn\u0027t saturate the CPU or GPU properly, but those are limitations of Unity 4 and not KSP, as far as I know. For this reason, any decent gaming setup is overkill for KSP, since the game (for now) cannot utilize your resources fully, by a long shot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T20:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would not recommend running the game on DX11, as the game is currently based on the Unity 4 engine, which doesn\u0027t fully support DX11 and will cause issues with certain shaders (i.e. some textures will turn black).
