Cosmic radiation is a real challenging problem in our world. It makes timing EVAs very important, and spaceships need radiation shields to prevent the components from being fried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a really interesting plugin to make, as it will make the whole game more interesting and challenging, both in design and in flight. Also, it would require new parts such as radiation shields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lack the skill to do this, but I hope someone will at least give it a serious thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T08:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an old neutrino plugin that acted like a measurement tool.

I\u0027m already half way by modelling planetary magnetic fields and the amount of charged particles trapped in Van Allen belts but I\u0027m still working on a good way to transplant this into something that might make a good game mechanic. It\u0027s easy enough for electronics but it\u0027s tough to store information about Kerbals, and indeed to have any way of non-lethally penalising a Kerbal if you could.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boosterspice","CreatedById":58629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T11:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, it doesn\u0027t have to lethal to kerbals. As you say, that would be difficult to incorporate. However, as an idea for your wonderful parts, you could add something that would fry your electronics if they get too close to the sun without having been upgraded to be radiation proof.

So, I have an idea. The Tracking Station has a timer for when the next solar flare hits. You can also add a part to keep track of the solar flares. As for protection, you can have either physical shields or already shielded parts at the expense of weight, or you could have energy shields that require power to keep operational. When the solar flare hits, the tracker then tells you have long it\u0027s going to last, which is randomly determined by the plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
