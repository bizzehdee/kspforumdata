Oceans have a lower albedo than dry land, and dry sand higher than wet sand. Water is also a potent greenhouse gas. You can thus make your planet a little cooler by making it a little drier. Don\u0027t make it bone dry. That introduces all sorts of problems on geological timescales, mainly due to water binding atmospheric CO2 to minerals. To further increase the albedo, you can consider either making the crust richer in white minerals or look for something cloud-forming that would add a higher anti-greenhouse effect than greenhouse effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Volcanism requires a large partially molten metal core in the absence of tidal heating. This could be a little tricky to explain depending the ice sheet, as it should have rapidly grown into an ice giant out beyond the frost line. Perhaps a collision between an icy body and a rocky one would result in something reaccreting with a substantial icy crust, or perhaps its orbit could have been disturbed during formation? Or perhaps the hydrosphere is similar in size to ours, but frozen at the surface? Thin atmosphere and dangerous weather don\u0027t sound like a good combination to me. I\u0027d rather make the atmosphere thicker, or subsitute things like toxicity/corrosiveness for dangerous storms. A bit of danger from a (possibly rare) thunderstorm is something you could fit in somewhere. How about a normal atmosphere Snowball Earth instead?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Your largest planet should form in the first position after the frost line. This looks fine to me. Volcanism is only really possible at the innermost moon or two unless they\u0027re ludicrously oversized. And out far from the planet, they likely won\u0027t be. Since this planet must have formed outside the frost line, expect mostly icy moons and captured asteroids outside of the volcanic ones. Subsurface oceans are likely common but very deep down. Smaller moons will be less completely differentiated so the more even mixture of rocky and icy material near the surface is probably more interesting--and more nutritious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10: I\u0027m thinking about all sorts of potental problems with getting it into that orbit depending what you mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re distracting from the story by adding too many planets.

We also didn\u0027t realize how ridiculously thick the Venusian atmosphere was. I doubt there is any way to have a dense atmosphere with reflective clouds where global warming would not run amok. You\u0027re better off thinning out the atmosphere some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, volcanoes spew massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. After they are done spewing out sunlight-blocking ash, the planet heats up. If you had massive volcanic eruptions happening enough to keep ash suspended in the air, I suspect that the atmosphere would be choked with greenhouse gases, probably enough to overwhelm any cooling by the transient presence of ash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re better off just making the planet have a thinner atmosphere with less greenhouse gasses. Either that, or imagine a Venus analog moved far out enough where the surface temperatures start to become bearable. Basically, you might want to move your planet #3 OUTSIDE the orbit of planet #5. Present-day Mars is in the habitable zone, after all; if early Earth were placed where Mars is, it would be quite habitable (though the atmosphere would not be suitable for us).
