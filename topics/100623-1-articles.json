And that in turn requires knowledge of airflow and in what order to place your engines and intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally know how to do this, my point is that people new to building spaceplanes often don\u0027t know that and will have their turbojet/LOX combo craft do an asymmetric flameout at about 23km and 2.2-2.3 km/s, forcing them to go to rocket stage before that happens. At that point you *do* need a lot of thrust to get your plane up into orbit. Igniting from that point, your RAPIER\u0027s suddenly *seem* to be a lot more efficient because you can overcome the gravity losses. That was what I was trying to explain: why new players often think that RAPIER engines are super-efficient, ever though they\u0027re actually not, they\u0027re more user-friendly and forgiving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut again, I wholeheartedly agree that if you avoid an asymmletric flameout, turbojets are vastly superior to RAPIERs. Now, if memory serves me correctly, SQUAD will fix the whole airflow leading to asymmetric flameout thing in 1.0. If that is indeed the case and asymetric flameout will no longer be a thing, then I do agree that Turbojets could do with a serious nerf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in response to the post just above mine: My advice is all stock. FAR has nerfed the turbojet considerably so I don\u0027t know how well it performs under that mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T11:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECirocco,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Yeah, we\u0027re in agreement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpiro,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m talking about stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blondai","CreatedById":80004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T16:01:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if this is actually my issue, my space planes certainly follow the rules that most people abide, but I always get higher into orbit when I accidentally fly too steep, I always that that flying flat as possible is the best way to achieve orbit, but I am beginning to wonder if my launch profile might be too shallow?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T09:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blondai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blondai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder if this is actually my issue, my space planes certainly follow the rules that most people abide, but I always get higher into orbit when I accidentally fly too steep, I always that that flying flat as possible is the best way to achieve orbit, but I am beginning to wonder if my launch profile might be too shallow?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDpends. What is your launch profile exactly? From experience and forum-browsing, I think that the best way is to go steep (45 to even 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 if your engines can handle it) up to about 15-20km, then level out and slowly climb to 25-27. Once you pass 27 km (roughly) you level out almost completely and squeeze whatever delta-V you can out of your turbojets. At flameout (around 30-32 km) you switch to rockets and pitch up hard to 45-60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in order to boost yourself out of atmo as quickly as possible. after that just coast to apoaps (giving small boosts to compensate for drag when neccesary) and circularize as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
