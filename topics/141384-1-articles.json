When a design has been proven to work, change is discouraged, so we\u0027re talking hardware as close as possible to the original Saturn V vehicles as possible. Is it possible today to build a fully functional Saturn V with required infrastructure for a 7th (if my counting is correct) moonlanding? How close would we be able to get to a design indistinguishable from the original? Are there any parts/components/systems that are simply not possible anymore?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T21:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo \u003Cem\u003E21\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T21:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222621159\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465334334\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232993\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022razark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, razark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo \u003Cem\u003E21\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo 18, 19, and 20 were cancelled, and Apollo 20 launch vehicle was used for SkyLab instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T21:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, we do have a couple of fully assembled Saturn V rockets\u00A0which could be scrutinized, disassembled, and copied if need be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T23:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222620936\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465326988\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126888\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jarmund\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, jarmund said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlans, drawings, schematics, and software for the Apollo programme simply doesn\u0027t exist any more.
