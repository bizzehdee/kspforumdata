If we had multiplayer in KSP, what would it be like? I imagine co-op and stuff. But I also imagine giant battles for space!\n\nYou start out with a base, one on each side of Kerbin, player 1 and 2. There\\\u0027ll be cities spread out across the whole planet, which you can take over by helping out, such as delivering supplies, or threatening them! You can also take missions to earn money, which you can use on rockets and spaceplanes. You can outfit these with cargo, weapons, and so on. You can then attack the opposing players base, his cities, or show your own cities that your threats are real. As both players gain money, they take the fight to space! Colonize planets, attack others colonies, intercept supply convoys, make space stations, mining operations, gain enough money to research warp, and take the fight to other systems! As the fight intensifies, Kerbin will no longer be safe, and the players will be forced to relocate to other planets. Maybe they\\\u0027ll relocate to a space station, and make launching easy, or maybe they\\\u0027ll build an underground base on a planet far away, with hidden runway and launch silo! Track the enemy\\\u0027s rockets to their launch platform, and find the enemy\\\u0027s HQ! Annihilate the enemy and win the game! \n\nI do not know if this\\\u0027ll be possible. But you can hope, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T11:02:29Z","Content":"Kerbal ICBM Program?

I would most definitely have massive railgun battery\\\u0027s on the more vital planets, and on less vital planets I would just have some light frigates defending. Stations would surely be a huge resource sink, but be incredibly useful for ships in orbit. If we can add a way to generate fuel, such as with collectors or something to collect particles in space, I would have refueling stations in geosynchronous orbit around planets."},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T17:44:43Z","Content":"yo dawg\n\nheard you like ships\n\nso I put a ship on your multi-ship."},{"CreatedByName":"sting_auer","CreatedById":11073,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T01:23:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yo dawg\n\u003E \n\u003E heard you like ships\n\u003E \n\u003E so I put a ship on your multi-ship.\n\nYou know, it really is better than trying to launch one gigantic ship.
