I actually haven\u0027t had nearly as many glitches and physics hiccoughs in 1.x. For instance, previously, nearly every time I went to Mun, if I did my transfer burn so that my Ap was about 50km, I\u0027d get about 3/4 of the way to Mun and suddenly the game would burps and I\u0027d have no Mun encounter at all.

It\u0027s especially annoying when you\u0027ve struggled to get an SSTO up high enough and now it\u0027s coasting to Ap with heat gauges in numerous places and flickering engines, and then POOF, no game.
