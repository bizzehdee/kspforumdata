I decided it\u0027d be cool to recreate the International Space Station in KSP, something that\u0027s been done by many folk, except I wanted to build and launch each module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGTInm_zIFw?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I tried to stay true to how they built the actual ISS, however, I didn\u0027t like the idea of sending 30 Shuttle missions. So, this is a simplified ISS, and it uses modded parts. I also sent each part as a Shuttle payload, even if the payload was sent on a Proton rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also started getting a bit taxing on the old computer so later modules I had to release from the Shuttle and fly them from ~3km away to stay outside of that 2.5km load zone. Good times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, enjoy the video! I\u0027m hoping I can make more videos that have more of a \u0022cinematic\u0022 feel to them.
