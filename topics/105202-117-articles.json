You are not accounting for the massive amount of water used for purposes other than drinking and food prep.  To quote NASA:\n\n\u0022 The ECLSS Water Recycling System (WRS), developed at the MSFC, will reclaim waste waters from the Space Shuttle\u0027s fuel cells, from urine, from oral hygiene and hand washing, and by condensing humidity from the air. Without such careful recycling 40,000 pounds per year of water from Earth would be required to resupply a minimum of four crewmembers for the life of the station. \u0022\n\nBasically, you got about 32kg of mass used per astronaut per day WITHOUT recycling.  We chop that down for our Kerbals to 16.2 (tho I am looking at dropping it to just over 10kg with 1.2 as part of an overall rebalance).\n\nAnd yes, Kerbal time is scaled down.  But Kerbal distances are also scaled down, so an analogue to an Apollo mission should still feel about right in terms of relative mass and the duration that mass lasts.\n\nBasically - once you\u0027re past a couple of weeks... you REALLY need recyclers.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Note that 1.08kg scaled up to humans (multiply by 4, and divide by 0.64) results in 6.75kg for people.

The stats I had otherwise were ~5kg/day, so that\u0027s a total of 17.4kg... totally in line with your figure for a kerbal in a 6 hour day.\n\n\\*math: 40,000lbs/4astronaut days = 18,143.7kg/365.25 = 49.7kg/4astronaut days = 12.4 kg/day.\n\nThat\u0027s also not what the quote says... the quote says:\n\n\u0022 The ECLSS Water Recycling System (WRS), developed at the MSFC, will reclaim waste waters from the Space Shuttle\u0027s fuel cells, from urine, from oral hygiene and hand washing, and by condensing humidity from the air. Without such careful recycling 40,000 pounds per year of water from Earth would be required to resupply a minimum of four crewmembers **for the life of the station**. \u0022\n\nWhat is the life of the station? My calc above assumes the life is 1 year, and I get 12.4kg/day per astronaut. If the station has a lifetime of 12.4 years, then that number is 1kg/day. ISS has been up nearly 20 years.
