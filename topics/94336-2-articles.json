This is not noticeable if those surfaces are nearly the same color as the exterior of the rim, which is why this first round on the tanks has the same dark grey all the way around that rim section. On SpaceY I mitigated it by making the rims edges use a gradient that starts dark at the edge, and is brightest in the center. But that\u0027s harder to get away with in a smaller model with a lower texel density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing back to this point-- Something I noticed on the newer stock spaceplane parts, is that some of them have a yellow-tan sort of rim color, and what they did is wrap the color to the outside of the rim a little. This helps hide the Z-fighting color-clashing nonsense I was talking about (which actually isn\u0027t that huge of a deal, but still good to avoid if you\u0027re being a perfectionist). Of course, that means letting the color-coding show from outside of the tank, at the ends, by also partially color-coding the rim exteriors. This is doable, but I\u0027m not sure how people feel about little lines of orange/green/yellow/whatever always being visible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr we could color-code the rims inside, and just put up with the fact that a few pixels of it will show from time to time at various distances/zooms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course we can just leave it alone and stick with the grey metal. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NBZ","CreatedById":117892,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T17:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think this was the first mod added to KerbalStuff after the revamp yesterday.
