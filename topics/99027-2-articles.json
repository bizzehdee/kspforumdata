Apollo sends some astronauts to the Moon along with all of the consumables and propellants they\u0027ll need for the mission. Two astronauts land on the surface, but with limited consumables and surface mobility, they can\u0027t stay long or get much exploration done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe traditional plan to go to Mars does things the same way. You send a huge spaceship (dubbed Battlestar Galactica by critics) that hauls all of the propellants and consumables needed for the mission from Earth. Once you get to Mars, you send down some crew members in a lander to do a short \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 visit to the surface. The landing party have limited consumables and surface mobility, so they can\u0027t stay long or get much actual exploration done. To avoid having to wait around for the next return window to open up, the mothership is sent on a high deltaV trajectory to get a gravity assist from Venus to get back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership is far too big to launch from Earth, so it has to be assembled on orbit at massive and insanely expensive shipyard facilities in Low Earth Orbit and/or the vicinity of the Moon. This is handy if you want to justify a space station and/or Moon base programme, as these are considered mission critical to get to Mars. It\u0027s also handy if you want to justify massive spending on zero gravity medical research, advanced propulsion systems development, and so on. Of course, it\u0027s not a lot of use if you plan on actually exploring Mars, because the mission doesn\u0027t do very much of that. You\u0027d be far better off sending probes instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the Apollo missions flew, NASAs crewed spaceflight programme has been kept ticking over in idle mode. The Space Shuttle programme was created to give the astronauts something to do. When it became apparent that the cost of launching satellites via the shuttle was vastly more expensive than launching them on expendables, the shuttle was left without a clear role. Space Station Freedom was therefore conceived to give the Shuttle something to do. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian space agency also needed to be given something to do to keep them from heading off to build missiles for whoever. Henceforth, Space Station Freedom became the ISS, which was deliberately designed to require the most complex on orbit assembly possible, therefore helping to keep the Shuttle occupied for as long as possible. With the station built, the astronauts can literally go around in circles while doing research on the already well understood effects of radiation and zero gravity on themselves. Meanwhile, hardware orphaned from the cancelled Constellation Programme continues to be very slowly developed in case any of it comes in handy later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern thinking about human space exploration revolves around In Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU). Most of the propellants and consumables needed for the mission are produced from local resources. This greatly reduces the size and expense of the spacecraft used to get there. In this regard, Mars has a huge advantage over Earth\u0027s resource poor Moon. Precursor missions are sent out to establish the best location for a permanent base. All later flights land at the base, which acts as a jumping off point for expeditions to explore the planet on a global scale. The base soon develops into a settlement. A very good example of how this approach would be used is Robert Zubrin\u0027s\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcTZvNLL0-w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E mission plan.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T03:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TMS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TMS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor me, if life support is to be meaningful, it needs to have consequences.

I think the advantage to still doing it will become more apparent as they flush out higher level kerbal skills. If for instance you needed kerbals to do an impactor experiment or run a resource processor the advantage would be much more obvious. Its also a reason I think tying experience loss to failing to support kerbals makes sense, as in the future this will be the real reason you have them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SorryDave\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SorryDave\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhatever system is used it should be possible to re-supply and store a large amount of life support. Regenerative systems would be good later in the tech tree, as well as creation from resources. Life support systems should consume the most electricity a space vehicle uses.\u003Cp\u003EThe big question is how much life support by weight would a Kerbal consume per day? Humans consume around 6-10kg per day. Should a ton of LS support a Kerbal for 100 days (without regen tech)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree. I\u0027d been working with 1kg/day as I was thinking it through, but there could be more nuance to this. It seems enough to be considerable over the long haul without being a burden for short flights. To keep things simple and parts count down I thought Life Support could simply be a state that habitable modules have, a slider from green to red. The weight could be considered already factored in to the weight of the existing modules. As Torquemadus suggested different modules could have a larger supply or support kerbals more efficiently. It would have to be easy to understand, I think it could literally be measured in days. What matters I think is the minimum rate of loss even with scrubbers. This will control the need for collecting resources in situ. Imagining that Roverdude is well along in making a single fuel resource system, lets assume there would be a single life support resource, and it could be drilled and processed with the same basic equipment. This resource will have its own tanks, (I happen to like H20 for this, as it could be refined into potable water, LF and O2.) This resource would be consumed by covering life support losses and by greenhouses to make Snacks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EH20\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife support\u003C/strong\u003E \u0026gt; Without scrubbers, H20 is consumed by Life Support at .002t/day.

For flights even to Minmus, scrubbers are a no-brainer, but the break even by weight for a greenhouse would be 900 days for 1 Kerbal, 300 days for 3 kerbals, and 100 days for 6 kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have a nice list of one-way and round trip flight times factoring ideal transfer windows to each body?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal opinion is that there would be a single harvestable resource (water ice) that could be refined into both life support and LF/O, but would require a catalyst that weighed 1/50th what it produced in fuel but cost 5x as much by weight to refine.

Living things need a certain amount of Food, water and air per day- these could all be rolled into one life support resource. Having scrubber units separate from pods does not seem logical, it will just add to the part count. Instead, consider them part of a pod. Air scrubbers, toilet, climate control and food prep systems, can all be abstracted by adding an electrical demand when a kerbal is inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing scrubbers as the life support recycling also seems odd.

The resources that can be used depend on where you are:-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Earth\u0027s (resource poor) Moon, you can get oxygen out of the rocks by crushing, screening, and melting them at high temperatures. The hardware needed to do this is quite heavy duty and power hungry in nature, but the methods required are well understood. This gives you oxidiser (but not fuel) and breathing oxygen. Water exists in extremely cold permanently shadowed craters at the poles, but the probes that detected it were not able to determine whether this was in the form of concentrated pure ice deposits, or in less accessible forms such as (rock hard) permafrost. Probes that can settle this issue through active sensing methods, such as ground penetrating radar, have been proposed, but not yet flown. Depending on what form the water is in, it may be very difficult to extract. Many of the resources needed to run industries to meet basic human needs are unavailable on the Moon and will have to be imported (at potentially prohibitive cost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunar regolith contains trace amounts of Helium 3, which is needed to run clean burning fusion reactors. Fusion reactors currently under development burn hydrogen isotopes in the form of deuterium and tritium. Deuterium is present in moderate amounts in seawater on Earth, and is available in much greater percentages on Mars, making it a potentially lucrative export resource. Tritium is radioactive and needs to be made through nuclear transmutation in a breeder reactor. A deuterium-tritium reactor emits much of it\u0027s energy as neutrons (much as a fission reactor does), which means that they can also be used in conjunction with a breeder blanket to produce tritium. Neutron emissions from such reactors will eventually cause the reactor lining to become radioactive, which will eventually require that it be replaced. This means that early generation fusion reactors will still produce low grade nuclear waste (still a huge improvement over high grade waste from fission reactors). Burning helium3 with deuterium produces an (almost) completely clean reaction that produces (mostly) protons instead of neutrons. This makes it much easier to produce electricity from them, greatly increasing the amount of power that can be produced from a given amount of fuel, and greatly reduces the amount of low grade waste produced. Helium3 is worth orders of magnitude more than it\u0027s weight in gold at current pre-fusion prices. Russia and China have declared their plans to go after Lunar Helium3 in the near future. Helium3 mining falls outside the scope of KSP, but players should be aware of it\u0027s existence.
