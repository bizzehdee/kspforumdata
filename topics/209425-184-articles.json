The AMD chips are beating Intel all over the board, with the exception being the 7700K in specific gaming scenarios. Some would argue that is not even the case, as there seems to be evidence that the higher frame rates come at the cost of lower minimum frame rates and more stutter, yielding a less ideal experience.
