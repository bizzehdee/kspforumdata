Clearly it\u0027s where you go to spend your science in KSP but do you really need \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E9\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E buildings to do so? Of course not! That\u0027s where the science is done! Like in any \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E Research and Development Center, the majority of the space is dedicated to experiments and \u003Cem\u003Eresearch\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eto develop \u003C/em\u003Enew technologies! Now I don\u0027t propose we add a system where you have to calculate or design an entire rocket to unlock a new fuel tank-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do propose- is that you can \u003Cem\u003Eresearch\u003C/em\u003E into vehicles and developments. Specifically being able to run fluid dynamics tests, rover tests (as that has been a recurring request), landing tests, and so on. Needless to say, the majority of NASA (and other space agencies) work is \u003Cem\u003Eresearch\u003C/em\u003E based over flights. In KSP, the majority of the research is in the doing, yet most of real life research is in what we observe and discover in the numbers. Though players shouldn\u0027t need to compute complex equations to find the precise solution to a problem, they should be able to see that massive drag system on their rocket. Or players could drop a frame of their lander and see how it performs on various degrees of slopes (something NASA did quite a lot for the lunar lander) or simply see how a rover fairs on various forms of terrain. With the point being to perform small scale tests in a \u003Cem\u003Elab\u003C/em\u003E environment (the birth place of most, if not all massive scientific endeavors).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that by itself isn\u0027t enough for Squad/Private Division/T2 then this system can be put to use by contracts. Where players can look into the dynamics of a craft\u0027s fluid dynamics and find a way to improve it, or improve the internal functions of a landing leg and make it more rubust and thus, either unlock that part in the tech tree, improve it\u0027s stats, or just provide science. A common recurring complaint is that the science system has too little part in the game\u0027s flow. Science is just a collectathon and some players like it and others don\u0027t. I just think that the science system needs more added to it. Clicking and collecting science by just gathering a soil sample, looking at a few science instruments, crew report, and hopping to the next biome just doesn\u0027t meld with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly I think that having scientists perform said experiments should warrant experience points for them (someone\u0027s got to do the science, and when they do, why can\u0027t they get XP for it?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, what do others think? Would you agree that the various buildings in the RnD Center should get a purpose? Let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DatBoi","CreatedById":185841,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-14T22:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Any thoughts on this great idea?
