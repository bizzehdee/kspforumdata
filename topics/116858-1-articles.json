All went well with the update so I carried on with my sandbox mission, docking another part to my spacestation. I left Kerbin with a rocket of mine which had a KR-2L\u002B \u0022Rhino\u0022 engine strapped to the bottom. The launch went well and my idea was to use this same engine to achieve orbit as I had plenty of deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shut my engine down when I hit my required apaoapsis, set a manouver node and went to fire up the engine again......nothing happened!! I was informed that I had no more ignitions left?? Ive never seen this before so I reverted back to the VAB, right clicked the engine and it said I had 2 available ingnitions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I have noticed is that in the VAB, when I goto the fuel tank builder I seem to have my FASA engines in there too? Ive used FASA for a while now and never noticed this before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I posted these questions I did a full, clean install. Any help would be much appreciated as its doing my head in!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T19:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you have RealFuels and an engine config pack installed...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T20:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds like you have RealFuels and an engine config pack installed...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll check 2morrow.
