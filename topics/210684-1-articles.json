I think the poofing out of existence with firey particles is great for fuel tanks, because they\u2019re filled with explosive liquid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 The plane from the clip I\u2019m talking about was the funny looking one with canards longer than the wingspan. And the poofing out of existence works great for fuel tanks, but seeing the canard just disappear like that upon contact with the ground looked a bit odd. My idea is that longer wings should snap in half. They often do in KSP1, as wings are usually made from multiple parts. But with the procedural wings, it clearly no longer happens as they\u2019re mostly now just one part. This could be a bit difficult to implement with the current system, and it may lower the framerate a bit, but there\u2019s almost always \u00A0a way to optimize things. And besides, in KSP1 there\u2019s already a system for single parts to break into pieces; solar panels do it. Of course, wings won\u2019t shatter quite like solar panels, but I believe snapping them in half would use a similar method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Now I understand many of you will find this unnecessary. And indeed it is not necessary, but a lot of features in a lot of games aren\u2019t necessary. That doesn\u2019t mean the feature won\u2019t add anything to the experience. \u003Cstrong\u003EJust to be clear:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cb\u003EI won\u2019t be disappointed if they don\u2019t implement this, \u003C/b\u003E\u00A0but it would be a nice little bit of detail, just like seeing solar panels shatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Thank you for reading!

One thing I hope for Kerbal 2 is for there to be more debris. Over time it can get a little stale for every part to just disappear once it gets destroyed. Though it\u2019s understandable for them not to do this, It would be cool for a part to break into multiple pieces once it\u2019s destroyed. This would also help to make more interesting crash sites and debris fields. This seams especially possible with the new architecture they have and with them having \u201Ckilled the kraken\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
