Not that I don\u0027t sympathize with yafeshan\u0027s desire to keep the game interesting, but I\u0027m a huge advocate of having access to better-than-chemical rockets for this game (after a hefty science and funding curve, of course, to climb the various eras to space!) that enable the potential travel times and power that we\u0027d need in real-life to do anything of consequence in a human timeframe. \u003Cp\u003EMy personal gameplay preference (and role play preference) is to use those high delta-v engines to get places \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E, not to explore the entire system in one go (in 50 years). I like the idea of a riding fire for a Duna rendezvous in 2 weeks followed by 180 spin, hard braking, and a docking/refuel mission. The VISTA\u0027s were great for that! As long as you remember to put other engines on too for minor maneuvers in close quarters (oops...). I will compromise and say I don\u0027t mind some kind of simplistic \u0022depth\u0022 mechanism to put some long-term limitations on certain parts, as long as they aren\u0027t so restrictive/realistic that they ruin the fun of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best parts of KSP to me are the initial missions, the first lander, the first NERVA drive, the first nuclear turbojet, the first NTJ SSTO, and then the first fusion SSTO that can make it to Minimus (or Duna). Once I get past the NERVA/ion, I\u0027m ready for more.

Like the hybrid pulse-detonation engine I made, where all performance parameters are taken from various research reports. I will release that as an add-on to KSPIE when everything is up and running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even fixed the various stock jet engines, because they made an error in the ISP calculation (not counting the air as part of the fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I have done all the challenging stuff, I want the power to go places and build interesting stuff.
