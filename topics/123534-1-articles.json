As I remember, and I don\u0027t hold my memory to be reliable as I can\u0027t find any clips of it, something turned to liquid in the high G-forces, sloshed around, and threw the rocket off balance. Here\u0027s where are opinions differ:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m of the opinion that the rocket veered off course and broke apart due to aerodynamic forces, considering there was no explosion or anything said about my dad\u0027s theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy dad said that they blew the rocket up themselves to keep the rocket, if it veered off course, from actually \u003Cem\u003Egoing\u003C/em\u003E off course from flipping all over the place and the engines going everywhere. He explained that with every launch because of the tight path the rocket has to follow(Even over the Atlantic NASA and shipping companies are fighting over where the rocket should go to stay out of each others\u0027 way), if something like that happens, as soon as they get the telemetry back that it\u0027s having stabilization problems, they self destruct it so they don\u0027t have a bigger problem of it landing in an unexpected place. Basically, someone\u0027s got their finger hovering over the big red button waiting till something goes wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think? There was no explosion that I remember, all it did was break apart. And, right before it did, somebody said there was a wobble and it was veering and then it breaks apart. Then it goes back to all the directors with them wide-eyed and slack-jawed, and not a word said about purposely self-destructing it, as well as the fact that there was nothing said about that in the press meeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T11:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the book, hm, let\u0027s see...

This changed the volume ration of solid-liquid dramaticly, this process transfomed the protein cubes from a steady solid to a flowing sludge. Stored in a compartment with no leftover space, the now-compressed sludge had room to slosh.
