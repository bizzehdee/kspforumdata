I get that the old way, where you just send a probe and gather all the available science by sending it back by repeated transmission wasn\u0027t optimal, but the current model doesn\u0027t really work either, at least not for me. It greatly incentive\u0027s landers, but at the cost of probes and stations, which are both completely useless at the moment. But all of this is just my opinion, and I want to know what the community wants. So, as far as I can see, these are the options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Science is fine as it is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Probes can scan from orbit, which can be transmitted for full science value (Like the kethane mod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Rovers can take surface samples, which can be processed by the rover for almost full science value (like the mars rover). Kerbals can bring back surface objects, like small rocks and the like, which are hard to find from orbit, but a part can be used to tell if you are near one (which would make rovers useful, as they are a fast way to get around the surface). These would be worth a lot of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Stations gather science over time (let me finish), by gathering science from what is left of the total science pool in a given sphere of influence. So if it\u0027s in orbit over kerbin, it would gather all the remaining science from all the experiments in the sphere of influence. So this would NOT be a source of infinite science, or even a separate source of science, instead it\u0027s a way to gather the science you have somehow left out, because you didn\u0027t bring the science junior in orbit just above kerbin. Of course you can simply set this up initially to gather all the science, but that would take a long time, and it would be much more efficient to simply leave it in the background while you do something else.
