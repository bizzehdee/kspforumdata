Look near the bottom at prefab.solarLuminosity - my guess at what that means is PhysicsGlobals is a set of functions that deals with the actual physics of the universe and SolarLuminosityAtHome, being a function in the library PhysicsGlobals, is a function that takes the luminosity level that Kerbin is supposed to be at and then says what the star\u0027s luminosity level needs to be in order for Kerbin to be normal (most likely to make RSS easier). So, if you move Kerbol several lightyears away and rename it Black Hole, its default luminosity will be recalculated so it can still shine on Kerbin - incidentally, this means all the function\u0027s flaws are exacerbated and ends up burning up all ships. To confirm this, I see what you did to the original Kerbol, in the file GalacticCore.cfg and you turn off its visual lights, but you don\u0027t touch it\u0027s luminosity, so it\u0027s still calculating its luminosity based on its distance to Kerbin, and heating the galaxy appropriately so Kerbal kind can enjoy their lunches in the warmth.\n\nI bet you if you remove your hackish fixes, that is instead of turning off all luminosity, and redo the Core\u0027s luminosity - hell why not all the important sun properties of the Core for safe keeping - I bet you the problem will disappear.\n\nThen again, I\u0027m severely sleep deprived and be making a complete fool of myself. Either way, good night and good luck.\n\nEDIT: Looking at all the other stars in your mod, I really don\u0027t know if the \u0027StarLuminosity\u0027 is a ratio based off of that contrived luminosity number that Kopernicus gives or the default KSP luminosity number. Hopefully the latter or else you\u0027ll have to do some math to reverse the large number Kopernicus will give.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T09:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Budz42**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T11:17:25Z","Content":"Hi [@Budz42](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150433-budz42/)\n\nI apreciate your interest ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nThe \u0022StarLuminosity\u0022 you see in my cfgs is not a kopernicus feature.\n\nIt was used many versions ago to calculate the power curve of stars when ksp still didn\u0027t have the luminosity at home thingy\n\nNow it\u0027s completely useless, I keep it there just in case I need the info in future\n\nRegarding the kopernicus issue\n\nIt seems like kopernicus uses the distance of kerbin from the galactic core to calculate the powercurve but then uses the distance from the closest star to calculate the ec/s generation\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T11:31:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88**"},{"CreatedByName":"j1r2000","CreatedById":163660,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T01:19:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/6/2016 at 6:18 PM, Sigma88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll take a look as soon as the mod is stable enough\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/5/2016 at 5:05 PM, j1r2000 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E is there a way you can make IA revived compatible? when it updates\n\u003E \n\nholy the feedback speeds"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T01:39:11Z","Content":"ok... so if I understand this correctly...\n\nI install this mod, Koperenicus,  sigma binary, and Module manager.

I can install every planet pack at the same time?  or is there some limit on them?  as in these 2 do not work together, or maybe I can only have 4 packs installed or something.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is just a very big change to the core workings of KSP, so I am trying to figure out how it is going to impact my game before I dump it in my save.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh and another thing...  I will have to go back and read up on this but does this work with remote tech?  or will this break my RT game?\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 32 minutes ago, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so there is no configuring or bit fiddling that needs to be done?  just plop all this down in gamedata and your mod will get everything in the right position?\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E well I am just going to dump it all in and see what happens.. I have downloaded all the listed planet packs and have just been waiting to dump them in till I am sure all my craft are either landed or stable orbit.   then I will jump with both feet.  worst case I just restore an older backup I guess.\n\u003E \n\nFirst of all, always back up your saves when adding GN to an ongoing save. GN moves planets around and that has the potential of breaking everything.\n\nthe installation is pretty simple, **Kopernicus** and **ModuleManager** are required while **SigmaBinary** is optional\n\nyou just need to install the mods by putting the stuff inside GameData like you would always do, and then if you want to add planet packs you install them as well. No further fiddling is necessary.\n\nYou should be able to install all the planet packs at the same time, except for **SASS** and **RSS** which are mutually exclusive\n\nThe overheating bug has been \u0022solved\u0022 by removing solar panel generation. you don\u0027t need to do anything since GN comes with the cfgs to do that. Solar panels now work as RTGs so you can still use them, but it\u0027s still not a solution I like.\n\nremote tech should work fine with GN, except for the fact that if you load a saved game you might find your ships have been loaded in orbits different from where they were before adding GN\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Budz42 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Sigma88](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113260-sigma88/) For the overheating bug, I\u0027ve tried a host of different approaches short of making the galactic core a barycenter which I might do next time I\u0027m looking at this mod, but that\u0027s not why I write. ShotgunNinja, the creator of Kerbalism, has a bit more of an elegant solution for solar panels than making them a flat RTG.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ll take a look ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 35 minutes ago, Athur Dent said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E bug report: it seems like after installing real solar system, my KSC is in perpetual darkness (not just night, real darkness where you cant see nothing exept for the lights of the runway)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E can provide screenshots and logs if needed\n\u003E \n\nThis is a known Kopernicus bug, it only affects the KSC scene and has no real impact on gameplay (if you launch a ship the sky will look normal)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 minutes ago, DaMaster\\_Architect said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I believe that\u0027s correct. Your vessels will still have a reference to the same planet or moon, and same orbital parameters, so everything should be fine.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think this is true. Vessels are stored with a reference to the celestial body they\u0027re orbiting, plus orbital parameters. If they\u0027re orbiting Kerbol, they\u0027ll still orbit it if Kerbol gets reparented itself. However, I hereby I assume that reparenting of Kerbol works such that the identifier to Kerbol doesn\u0027t change.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nevertheless, most of your vessels orbit some planet or moon in the Kerbol system, and as these aren\u0027t necessarily reparented, nothing will change for them.\n\u003E \n\nKerbol is a lie (unless you install Kerbol Plus)\n\nthe name of the star is \u0022Sun\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nthat said, KSP works on the assumption that the central body is the \u0022Sun\u0022 and that the ID of that body is 0\n\nso if you install GN the \u0022Galactic Core\u0022 is actually just a cosmetic name change, as far as KSP is concerned that body is the sun\n\nall crafts (Asteroids included) orbiting the Sun in a stock game will be loaded around the galactic core in GN (if you load an old savegame)"}]}
