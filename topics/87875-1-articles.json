There is a sweet spot which you can hit that enables you to keep running on air breathing engines well up to 35km and greatly reduces your need to bring bipropellent along. To hit this sweetspot you need to have got up to around 1800ms before you reach 27-28km. If you hit it then the engines won\u0027t flame out, they will make stuttering noises and slowly fade down \u0027till they look like dying embers.

Your takeoff issues may be caused by several things, but the likeliest is that your rear landing gear are too far back. Try moving them so they\u0027re just aft of the center of mass, this will make pivoting for takeoff before the end of the runway easier. If that doesn\u0027t work, try adding more pitch control surfaces or reaction wheels to give more pitch authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce airborne, climb as quickly as is reasonable to 15km, then start leveling off and building speed. The bulk of the acceleration should happen between 20km and 35km altitude, and you should be able to reach to 2km/s or more.

It pretty much incorporates all the advice folks have already given you on this thread.
