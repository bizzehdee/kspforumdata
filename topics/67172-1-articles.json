So, several issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027ve installed the configs for full-size earth solar system. However, they\u0027re only half working. Kerbin is larger but still looks like Kerbin (Eve/Venus looks like Eve, Jool/Jupiter looks like Jool). However, Duna looks like mars, the Jovian moons are displaying correctly, etc. How the heck does this happen, exactly? More importantly, what do I need to do to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Noobishness here: I don\u0027t really get Realfuels. How do you set up tanks to fill in the correct ratio of fuel to oxidizer? Also, how to you configure engines to actually \u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More noobishness: I think I\u0027ve installed the realism overhaul configs incorrectly, but I can\u0027t figure out how. Some of the rescaled engines are appearing, but the shifted nodes and such that are supposed to be there aren\u0027t.

After that engine is attached go to your tanks in the actions tab, and click on the tank, at the VERY bottom it will give you an option to add \u002233% liquid oxygen and 67% kerosene\u0022 or whatever the mix is for that engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird question...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo clue I am leaving that one to someone with more experience than myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T04:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the third question, make sure you have ONE AND ONLY ONE of the following engines cfgs.
