The community made this thread, with the exact same feedback, **2 months ago**, right here: [KSP 1.0 Discussion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0)\n\u003E Nothing has changed except 2 months of work on an update and a lot of press about games that were released before they were ready, to bad reviews.\n\u003E \n\u003E The answer is still the same as it was: KSP deserves an actual beta period, where the focus is on polish and bugfixing. The fact that you\u0027re still talking about adding new features (at this point, it feels like 6 or 7 discrete new features, more than any other update) means we have never actually left Alpha.\n\u003E \n\u003E If leaving early access because you feel \u0022uncomfortable\u0022 about it is more important than either of the choices you presented (not finishing the bug/polish pass, or postponing the new features) then I guess you should press on with your plans. I just wish you guys could be truthful with us about why 1.0 is mandatory at this point. If its a business thing, we\u0027ll understand. If its just pride, we won\u0027t, and you\u0027ll come to regret it someday.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s been said hundreds of times at this point, but I\u0027ll say it again: Release more beta versions (0.9x) and let your experienced community members test the MAJOR changes and balancing passes THOROUGHLY so you can have confidence that your 1.0 release will be something to be proud of.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s just sad to see years of hard work get kicked out the door so unceremoniously, for reasons no one seems to understand.\n\nThis sums up my thoughts better than I could ever express through a keyboard.\n\nPlease Squad, give us a Beta period, your game deserves nothing less."},{"CreatedByName":"JSD","CreatedById":57153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T21:43:25Z","Content":"I would pick one thing above all: A reason for doing it all. I\u0027ve bin a reasonable long time with Kerbal now. Love the simulation part of the game. The get to know the space thing. But overall, it\u0027s still is a \u0022empty\u0022 kind of space simulation. You build a wacky, wobbly space construction, trying to fly it to the mun. Whole lot of fun. But when you land on the mun, you plant a flag, do some sort of (in my **opinion**) a whole lot of useless sciences report for gathering points for unlocking new tech. Or drive meaningless around on a empty mun in a mun buggy. But overall: That\u0027s it. There is no point in doing it. There is no end game. No reward, or following options in the game. That is the kind of thing that bugs me the most about this 1.0 thing. The game isn\u0027t nearly done for a second! It\u0027s still a empty shell with a beautiful skin. (That has to be said..)

I really don\u0027t want to be saying \u0022we told you so\u0022 a couple of months after 1.0 comes out and flops, that won\u0027t bring me any satisfaction. I don\u0027t know how this community can say it any clearer or louder; An incomplete v1.0 is an utterly disastrous move. \n\nSome of what has been said in this thread is pretty cutting and I feel the analogies with certain vehicular failures are all too apt,....and we are your loyal fan base!! We love KSP, rough edges and all, but if we are expressing such levels of frustration think how much worse it is going to be when the haters and the critics start. KSP has achieved global recognition, that is a blessing but it\u0027s also a curse, because now you have to live up to it. The \u0022I don\u0027t play early access\u0022 crowd will be waiting to jump in a try this thing that we\u0027ve all be raving about, but they\u0027re a much harder group to impress. They\u0027re not going to be understanding and if they get v1.0 and find that it is essentially still early access then that will hit your reputation hard. \n\nThis is about more than KSP, it\u0027s about your reputation as a development house. You get one shot at v1.0 and you have to impress with it. The window of opportunity is small, maybe a month, during which time \u0022the others\u0022 (ie not your loyal fan base) will decide what badge to label you with. If you get slated with bad reviews in that time you will loose out on potential customers, even once 1.1 etc have been released. Once they\u0027ve heard that v1.0 was sloppy, they\u0027ll just assume 1.1 will be too, or at best is a hasty patch to fix the mistakes. We\u0027ll understand that 1.1 is just the next step to greater things, they won\u0027t.\n\nNot only does KSP need to be complete at v1.0 but your other public facing assets will be scrutinised. --\u003E\u003E [http://www.squad.com.mx/SquadSite/index.htm](http://www.squad.com.mx/SquadSite/index.htm) \u003C\u003C-- This!!! This is not ready!!! And it needs to be when you go v1. It doesn\u0027t matter that it\u0027s not about KSP, people are going to go there and it\u0027s not going to impress. It\u0027s not a site that says professional developers live here, and if KSP itself is getting bad press that will only make things worse. (ps site is actually buggy running on chrome, constant CPU load of 30-40% while open).\n\nI\u0027m not saying this to be nasty, I\u0027m saying it cos I actually care, as does everyone else who\u0027s been urging you to hold back on the v1.0 release.

Of the pages I have read, one thing seems to stick out. Why is it necessary for the next update to be considered a 1.0? Does the label 1.0 really mean anything anyhow? I feel those questions need to be answered. I think that would help focus the communities suggestions for the next update. \n\nI like many of the suggestions being made here, like bugfixing, especially those in Claw\u0027s bugfix thread. Optimization would be nice, but is really needed more for the modded games, not the stock. The stock game runs pretty good. I remember how often the old \u0022water fix\u0022 threads use to pop up. I haven\u0027t seen one of those in a while. Aero update seems pretty important. I\u0027d like to see that implemented asap. I think mining could be shelved until the bugfixing and aero is done. The visual improvements are the least important. Gameplay mechanics need to be worked on first. I like games that look nice, but I like games that work as intended even better. \n\nSo in summary, given the lack of explanation from Squad on why the next update has to be a 1.0 and has a hard deadline, I feel like the most important goals are :\n\n1. Include the final model for aerodynamics.\n\n2. Render Claw\u0027s bugfix modules useless by fixing the damn bugs in the first place.\n\n3. Finalize game balance, ie. part prices and tech tree order.\n\n4. All other stuff when time allows. ie. mining, multiplayer, and graphics.\n\nOne last question that\u0027s been on my mind. If Squad puts a 1.0 label on the next release, should we expect no more breaking of saves and/or mods? I guess that ties in with question : does the 1.0 label even mean anything?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:38:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Welcome to the world of software development. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Honestly, you\u0027re reading too much into it.

At 32 pages and limited time to read the forums, I ask your forgiveness.\n\nPlease have something on bodies other than Kerbin to do. Yes, there are biomes, which I am grateful you added to all bodies. This is an excellent start along with the Fine Print mod being incorporated to stock. I think that there should be something about each body (or at least the more visited ones - Duna, Jool\u0027s moons, etc.) that make you do something. I do not have a 100% thought-out solution, but the feeling I get from career mode is that you race to make the game sandbox mode. If I wanted that, I would play sandbox. Perhaps something along the lines of bodies have their own conditions...for an Eeloo mission you would need to include heaters to perform certain science experiments. The gravioli would be useful anywhere, but say the science bay would only operate in a certain temperature range, forcing you to land on the day side or bring heating equipment with you. Vice versa for say Moho. Perhaps different terrain? make it so a rover that works on one body would have to be tweaked to drive in the deep, loose sand of Duna, but works on Dres? I guess what I am getting at is the fact that when I land, I can perform all science within 1 minute and blast off for home without really doing anything - hence my comment earlier about it feeling like a race to sandbox. Do science, fill the tech tree and unless you make up your own reason for being on a planet, there is absolutely no point of going there again. As mentioned on the first page, this is the release reviewers are getting. What\u0027s the point of creating a solar system if there is nothing to do but click buttons? I know this will never become a first-person soil research game. I understand its mostly about the flying. I have no issue with that. My issue is that I sit in the nav screen thinking of what I should do and come to a realization that no matter where I go, I click a few buttons and thats it as far as the game goes. I think an attention to detail about more than just gravity/atmosphere of a body should be modeled. It should be hard to get to Moho due to airframe heating issues, it should be hard to get to Eeloo because its literally colder than humans (and kerbals) can really wrap their heads around and research is required to build a craft suited to it. I want a sense of accomplishment for weathering the ...weather?. The same lander I made for Mun can handle any body in the game provided I account for gravity and atmosphere (IE fuel and thrust)....well not Eve or Tylo...but you get my point.\n\nTL;DR Make each body individual in a sense to make it feel like more of an accomplishment of engineering and piloting. Make something to do while there. That isn\u0027t clicking buttons. The world is watching.

Even though we like to think of Squad as independent, they have a CEO and someone who may very well be setting deadlines for them, similar to how a publisher would be. As a result, we often get buggy software and games because it is a constant battle to implement the features of a game or software and keep it bug free. And moreso, you must know the cycle can be endless. Fixing bugs often creates new bugs. At some point you just have to put the features in, squash as many bugs as you can, and release it.\n\u003E I\u0027d like to see more beta patches, but it may not be in Harvester and other\u0027s control (which it sort of sounds like it based on what they have said).\n\nNot really - as others have also said, adding features is for alpha phase. If you\u0027re adding features *after the final beta test* then you have royally messed up your development schedule. The point of beta is to test new features and make sure they have the least amount of bugs and quirks possible, and that normal human beings can figure out how to use them.\n\nWhile I agree that bugfixes are ongoing in almost all software, it is the act of adding features that is most likely to also add bugs, and this is why you don\u0027t just say \u0022Ok, beta worked, now add 30% more cool stuff and ship it.\u0022 Add features, host beta, fix bugs, release or repeat.\n\nManagement of expectations is key; if players see a feature in the game and it doesn\u0027t work, they get cross and the game gets bad reviews. If the feature is absent, and had never been mentioned as a thing, and the game works without it, then players are happy (and ignorant). You even get the opportunity for a post-launch update with the feature, which draws attention, and may pull back some lapsed players.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do total bug fixes and ONLY what you planed from the beginning, then in 1.1 impress the heck out of everyone with a bunch if non-glitchy amazing features\n\nThat!

If you deliver 110% of planned features and only 80% of them work, then it\u0027s bad.\n\nAlso, 1.1 would mean press releases and re-reviews.
