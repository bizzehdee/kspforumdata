Of the pages I have read, one thing seems to stick out. Why is it necessary for the next update to be considered a 1.0? Does the label 1.0 really mean anything anyhow? I feel those questions need to be answered. I think that would help focus the communities suggestions for the next update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like many of the suggestions being made here, like bugfixing, especially those in Claw\u0027s bugfix thread. Optimization would be nice, but is really needed more for the modded games, not the stock. The stock game runs pretty good. I remember how often the old \u0022water fix\u0022 threads use to pop up. I haven\u0027t seen one of those in a while. Aero update seems pretty important. I\u0027d like to see that implemented asap. I think mining could be shelved until the bugfixing and aero is done. The visual improvements are the least important. Gameplay mechanics need to be worked on first. I like games that look nice, but I like games that work as intended even better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in summary, given the lack of explanation from Squad on why the next update has to be a 1.0 and has a hard deadline, I feel like the most important goals are :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

If Squad puts a 1.0 label on the next release, should we expect no more breaking of saves and/or mods?

At 32 pages and limited time to read the forums, I ask your forgiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease have something on bodies other than Kerbin to do. Yes, there are biomes, which I am grateful you added to all bodies. This is an excellent start along with the Fine Print mod being incorporated to stock. I think that there should be something about each body (or at least the more visited ones - Duna, Jool\u0027s moons, etc.) that make you do something. I do not have a 100% thought-out solution, but the feeling I get from career mode is that you race to make the game sandbox mode. If I wanted that, I would play sandbox. Perhaps something along the lines of bodies have their own conditions...for an Eeloo mission you would need to include heaters to perform certain science experiments. The gravioli would be useful anywhere, but say the science bay would only operate in a certain temperature range, forcing you to land on the day side or bring heating equipment with you. Vice versa for say Moho. Perhaps different terrain? make it so a rover that works on one body would have to be tweaked to drive in the deep, loose sand of Duna, but works on Dres? I guess what I am getting at is the fact that when I land, I can perform all science within 1 minute and blast off for home without really doing anything - hence my comment earlier about it feeling like a race to sandbox. Do science, fill the tech tree and unless you make up your own reason for being on a planet, there is absolutely no point of going there again. As mentioned on the first page, this is the release reviewers are getting. What\u0027s the point of creating a solar system if there is nothing to do but click buttons? I know this will never become a first-person soil research game. I understand its mostly about the flying. I have no issue with that. My issue is that I sit in the nav screen thinking of what I should do and come to a realization that no matter where I go, I click a few buttons and thats it as far as the game goes. I think an attention to detail about more than just gravity/atmosphere of a body should be modeled. It should be hard to get to Moho due to airframe heating issues, it should be hard to get to Eeloo because its literally colder than humans (and kerbals) can really wrap their heads around and research is required to build a craft suited to it. I want a sense of accomplishment for weathering the ...weather?. The same lander I made for Mun can handle any body in the game provided I account for gravity and atmosphere (IE fuel and thrust)....well not Eve or Tylo...but you get my point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR Make each body individual in a sense to make it feel like more of an accomplishment of engineering and piloting.

Even though we like to think of Squad as independent, they have a CEO and someone who may very well be setting deadlines for them, similar to how a publisher would be. As a result, we often get buggy software and games because it is a constant battle to implement the features of a game or software and keep it bug free. And moreso, you must know the cycle can be endless. Fixing bugs often creates new bugs. At some point you just have to put the features in, squash as many bugs as you can, and release it.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see more beta patches, but it may not be in Harvester and other\u0027s control (which it sort of sounds like it based on what they have said).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really - as others have also said, adding features is for alpha phase. If you\u0027re adding features \u003Cem\u003Eafter the final beta test\u003C/em\u003E then you have royally messed up your development schedule. The point of beta is to test new features and make sure they have the least amount of bugs and quirks possible, and that normal human beings can figure out how to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree that bugfixes are ongoing in almost all software, it is the act of adding features that is most likely to also add bugs, and this is why you don\u0027t just say \u0022Ok, beta worked, now add 30% more cool stuff and ship it.\u0022 Add features, host beta, fix bugs, release or repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManagement of expectations is key; if players see a feature in the game and it doesn\u0027t work, they get cross and the game gets bad reviews. If the feature is absent, and had never been mentioned as a thing, and the game works without it, then players are happy (and ignorant). You even get the opportunity for a post-launch update with the feature, which draws attention, and may pull back some lapsed players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo total bug fixes and ONLY what you planed from the beginning, then in 1.1 impress the heck out of everyone with a bunch if non-glitchy amazing features\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat!
