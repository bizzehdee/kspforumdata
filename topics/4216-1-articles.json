Cardboard, glue, aluminium paint and transparent puppeteer\\\u0027s string would be the order of the day. Forget \u003Cem\u003Efunctionality\u003C/em\u003E, it has to \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E the part! This is the area of construction where the biggest savings are made - but don\\\u0027t forget to fit and wire-up the pyrotechnics!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight would be very different. Instead of physics, you pull on the strings. In one small area of the screen you see the \u0027launchpad\u0027 and \u0027ship\u0027, in the rest you have various pulleys to lift the model and switches to fire the pyrotechnics. The more convincingly you pull on the strings, the better the illusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how good are your drawing and airbrushing skills? Producing a convincing, animated Orbital Map with paper, pen, a couple of telephotoes of Kerbin and M\u00C3\u00BCn and an airbrush takes real skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActors can be a pain, but at least they don\\\u0027t need thousands of hours in a simulator to do their job, unlike \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E Kerbanauts. They do need a lot of dialogue coaching so the geeks out there don\\\u0027t pick up on their inability to get technical details right and consistent. Casting is easy: despite his ambition and good looks Jeb has never managed to turn up for a casting session in his life. Bill and Bob are aged child stars who specialised in being \u0027that screaming little kid in cheap alien invasion movies\u0027 who haven\\\u0027t done a day\\\u0027s work since their voices broke. They are desperate, and will do anything to get in front of a camera again... they\\\u0027ll even scream. The main problem is keeping Jeb\\\u0027s ego and libido under control. he will need to earn a lot of cash to give up the idea of another starring role ever, and a lot of \u0027bodyguards\u0027 to make sure he doesn\\\u0027t sneak off-base during \u0027mission time\u0027 to impress the chicks with his new-found stardom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFilming \u0027capsule interiors\u0027, especially during launches, will be surprisingly easy. Jeb is a hard-core petrol-head who owns a very fast offroader. Black out the windows and get him to drive hard-and-fast down a dirt track and you will have all the effects in one - vibration, exhilaration, screams... It\\\u0027s all there. And the zero-G stuff is even easier, just wait until Jeb has flipped the offroader, leave the \u0027crew\u0027 strapped-in and get them to film their lines up-side-down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe M\u00C3\u00BCn itself is the hardest part. Nowhere on Kerbin looks right (it\\\u0027s all so very green) and what with the lack of roads there is a serious deficiency in gravel-quarries to use as stand-ins. (In some ways Kerbin is depresingly backward.) You could use a model set and puppets, but unless you are a VERY good puppeteer then it will look so very wrong. There\\\u0027s nothing for it - you\\\u0027re going to have to accidentally drop a nuke on some desert island and build a set there. You probably can\\\u0027t get the real actors to hop around on irradiated wasteland, but you can use stuntmen and get the actors to do voiceovers convincingly enough, once they\\\u0027ve recovered from the \u0027launch\u0027 and \u0027zero-G\u0027 sequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll-in-all, even with all the minders needed to keep mouths shut, you will be able to divert magnificent amounts of cash from research, development, training and construction; and put them into \u0027entertainment\u0027: in other words, your private little retreat in the tropics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\\\u0027t invite Jeb. He\\\u0027ll steal all the girls and park an offroader in your swimming pool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plymouth","CreatedById":8420,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-28T18:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat\\\u0027s just too complicated.
