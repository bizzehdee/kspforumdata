Only problem is it has 10 degree tilt.\u00A0Also I think your overall timer needs to be near 0 to get to the right coordinates\u00A0(there seems to be some sort of bug with hyperedit coordinates).\u00A0I\u0027ll edit this post if I find a better launch location later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo clarify the rules, launch stabilizers or platforms don\u0027t count towards your overall mass as long as they are separated when or before\u00A0you fire your engines. You can also use an angled launch platform so that you are pointed straight up on a 10 degree slope. It does count towards altitude though; for example you can\u0027t use a 20m platform at 1990m altitude because that would put you 10m over a 2km launch height.
