I have noticed that many people have been a bit critical on several features. Fairing confetti? Be glad we have fairings at all, and I believe Squad has already mentioned they will be improved. No Aero Graph or delta-V? Was said in the AMA that they will both be added in the future, and if I remember correctly Delta-V readouts were not even originally planned to exist! Also on rockets flipping out of control, maybe try and turn them more smoothly, and remember that huge fairings on the top can be bad! These features may seem to have broken things (such as SSTOs), but the truth is that we need to learn to adjust to the new mechanics. Of course it may seem difficult, but only because we have had the broken \u0022aerodynamics\u0022 for so long. Rocket science is not just about having enough fuel and thrust, you need an aerodynamically stable rocket.\n\nThis is just a friendly reminder to not be upset with the devs and enjoy this wonderful update.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:11:01Z","Content":"I think most of us bringing up problems agree that this is a great update.

Obviously we like KSP, but there are some serious problems that need to be fixed, and some very questionable design choices.

I felt some distress when they added a moon that wasn\u0027t \\*gasp!\\* in an equatorial orbit around Kerbin (Minmus.) I worried when they added the need for oxidizer, or electricity... etc. After playing 1.0 for a few hours, I\u0027ve realized I just need to re-think a lot of my old tried-and-true methods for building a spacecraft.
