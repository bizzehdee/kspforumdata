I\u0027ve been thinking about this again though and I still can\u0027t decide if Adventure mode would benefit from or be distracted by an in-game currency besides science/research points, or if the two could be combined in some way. This gets into all kinds of complicated assumptions and we have no idea if all this hasn\u0027t been decided anyway but hey whats this forum for but wanton speculation. For the purposes of discussion Im going to assume Boom events are real and could have additional rewards besides population boosts, and that there\u0027s some (hopefully streamlined) mechanism for employing experiments and getting data back. I\u0027ll say from the beginning that I think both combined and uncombined reward currencies can work and there are pros and cons to each. A few ideas from the outset:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1) Replace contracts with Boom events\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs clever as KSP1\u0027s generative contracts are I think most people have felt underwhelmed by them. I think as a central system of rewards you can just create boom events for a series of milestones and discoveries and let players go out and get them in whatever order they want. There might be some hand-holding at the beginning with tutorials but after that it should be a fully open world. These might include: altitude and speed records, flyby\u0027s, orbits, landings, and flag plantings, discovering anomalies, establishing and growing stations \u002B colonies, etc. The whole administration building could be replaced with an interface tracking your progress on these goals.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Time based mechanics:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is just something to think about. My feeling is that having at least some time-based mechanism is good, but the simpler it is the better. KCT is interesting but injects a lot of extra timers and steps. It\u0027s better if there are just one or two things that take time and require very little player input or micromanagement. The reason having at least one mechanism that takes time could be important is that in a counterintuitive way puts a cap on grind. Right now there\u0027s an incentive for players to grind out dozens of small-reward missions around KSoI in between every launch window, slowly grinding science and money while they wait. There are other ways to cap this--reducing the amount of science that\u0027s available in the early game or placing some other cap until you\u0027ve explored other planets--but you still end up in a herky-jerky pacing where you do a bunch of small missions around Kerbin then time warp for months until your next launch window. Making it so research takes time or using some other built-in delay between missions would smooth things out and increase the number of transfer windows per minute played, speeding up the rate at which most players explore the Kerbolar system. Folks have also often asked for things like monthly budgets, but this creates a host of other problems with time warp and could end up being a pain to manage. To me, keep it simple: do missions, get rewards, spend rewards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) You don\u0027t need money...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA lot of games, especially ones that focus on resources, don\u0027t have a central fungible currency like money. There are a lot of ways KSP could work just on science and resources and not need money at all. One way this could work would be to have a resource plant built-in at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E producing raw materials and fuels the same way a colony would. As your program developed you could spend research on increasing its speed, capacity, and capabilities. It would solve some of the pacing issues above and avoid some of the fail-state pitfalls of other schemes, but its also another thing to manage in an already complicated game. Once you\u0027ve started setting up off-world colonies with their own production systems the game actually gets less complicated though as money just doesn\u0027t exist for you to worry about. It\u0027s just pure exploration and discovery in exchange for tech upgrades.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4) But maybe money is good?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the same time having a secondary currency has its advantages. You could for instance separate out building upgrades from part-unlocks, or have parts that were cheap in terms of raw materials but expensive in money to produce. You could have boom events give money but still require science experiments to advance tech. It would also allow for some creative economies in which rare resources are delivered to Kerbin for cash, which could then be exchanged for other resources, upgrades, etc. There could also be space tourism or other clever income systems. In some ways this is overall a more complicated kind of game, but maybe thats okay?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you all think?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-08T22:21:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2022 10:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-08T17:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a great system, although it probably belongs in the Suggestions section.

There\u0027d have to be some limit there or players would set up a little funding operation and time-warp to infinite money. There are other solutions like giving players bonuses for reaching Duna or colonizing Jool within X days, but this hard to calibrate too. Its difficult to gauge how fast different players will explore in terms of the game-clock. A lot of people like me will probably be sending out probes and crewed exploration vessels and colony hardware on most every transfer window with dozens of active flights at a time. Others might want to play more sequentially--follow their Duna mission all the way to its destination without breaking to do other things while its in transit. I think in the end the incentives of building and growing colonies and having automated supply routes going everywhere will mean most players end up in the former boat anyway though, so maybe there\u0027s nothing wrong with giving rewards for winning an invisible space race.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-09T17:45:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2022 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chilkoot","CreatedById":175911,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-09T17:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224089208\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644402287\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209738\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022intelliCom\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, intelliCom said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve thought of a funny idea: \u0022Congress Difficulty\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhrasing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-09T19:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224089343\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644428640\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve thought about that but it gets tricky because of timewarp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah completely agree.

Granted, while some elements from factorio like games could dovetail well we wouldn\u0027t want the resource system to be anywhere near that complicated. I think its fair to say there probably wont be belts or logic gates, and there will be far fewer intermediate resources. Given all the exotic fuels we\u0027re going to need as end-products we\u0027ll probably have 3-4 basic harvestable resources at least, and converters and storage tanks for each fuel type. It doesn\u0027t seem too crazy that we would also have a few different processed resources that go into making all the types of parts and colony modules. After all engineering and resource management is already a core game element--making sure you have enough fuel and power and radiators to bleed off heat.
