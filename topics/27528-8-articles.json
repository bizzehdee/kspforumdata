The Shuttle was originally supposed to be the equivalent of a light pickup truck, and along with a Saturn V or Titan III derivative, the cornerstone of significant system space presence and transportation infrastructure. When it became apparent that neither the Administration nor Congress was interested in funding those pipe dreams... the Shuttle began to grow and morph into the large one-size-fits-all vehicle that finally flew. (NASA never really gave up on the idea that they would soon be funded at peak Apollo levels again.) Why? Because they were stuck between a rock and hard spot - the Administration nor Congress mandated that the Shuttle would be built, but refused to properly fund it. (Hence the whole mess with the DoD, even though that affected the design less than urban legend would have you believe as the vehicle was already growing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to be fair, even budget limited (but still very expensive admittedly), they did produce a near miracle... a vehicle that carried and returned more people to space than all others to date combined.

It\u0027s safety and reliability is insignificantly different from any other vehicle. It carried out missions that no other vehicle in existence or on the drawing boards could have done.

For those of you that don\u0027t know, the o-ring on the SRBs failed nearly every time, but since it melted and therefore sealed the would-be leak, NASA decided not to toy with it, since it wasn\u0027t creating any problems. Then Challenger happened (or was it Columbia, I always get them confused).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that, some ejection pods would be nice. By ejection pods, I mean some sort of system in the seats whereby upon critical failure of the Shuttle (or manually if need be) a sturdy air-tight shell would envelope the person sitting in the seat, allowing that person to safely survive the thin atmosphere and parachute to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T04:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SFJackBauer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SFJackBauer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t get the point - surely I did calculate that. The OMS were needed to just small orbit adjustements - and they fullfilled that role.
