I play totally stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter relearning some physics I got to orbit and relanded at the base. Further modifications got it so I could carry up satellites. With my latest iteration I am able to orbit the moon, drop a Landing probe onto the surface within 500m of target and fly back to KSC and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure I can probably do a manned SSTO lander to the moon and Minmas with returns and I can probably boost a probe to Duna, Eve, Dres etc from a high Kerbol orbit and it might even be possible to orbit Duna but return would be very tight. Basically those are my current limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027m asking how are people getting their SSTO missions out of Kerbol space and returns to work without refueling?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
