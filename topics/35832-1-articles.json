It is my understanding that the buildup of this acid is what causes your muscles to get sore during heavy work loads. The muscles can easily outpace the bodies ability to remove the acid and they can only have so much acid in the tissue and still function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when you stretch you can get a very similar feeling, my thought was that there is always some acid wrapped up deep in the muscle and that when you stretch it is dislodged and that\u0027s what you are feeling. Thus you are giving yourself an acid bath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably total bs as biology was always my weakest science, there is a reason I like machines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paprika","CreatedById":33999,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T10:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are stretch receptors (special neurones) embedded within muscle tissue that fire off a signal when you overstretch the muscles, it\u0027s that that gives the burn from stretching.
