The project I chose was designing an asteroid intercept mission profile, with launch vehicle, launch windows, payload and technical aspects taken care of. This was fine, but I realized there were a couple of really good scientific papers out on it already, so I broadened my horizons. I figured I would instead tackle the problem of actually \u003Cem\u003Edeploying\u003C/em\u003E aforementioned good plan. So I figured that there would be something that would stand in my way (some loophole or complication) and the result was not too surprising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Outer Space Treaty. This bans the use or travel of atomic devices (nuclear explosives, atomic bombs, thermonuclear warheads, whatever name you want to call them) from earth orbit and beyond. They may not be stationed on the moon, an orbital platform or any other orbital body in space, at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is where we stand... Myself and two other people (my partners on this project) have been trying to find if \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E has tried to address the concerns that signers of the Outer Space Treaty will have with the actual development and deployment of a proper planetary defense strategy. For this to be cost and time effective we need to be able to implement atomic explosives in the design, but currently this discussion does not seem to exist. Everyone seems to be very interested in either end of the spectrum. One end being the detection of the NEOs and the other being different strategies to deflect them (Explosives, kinetics, lasers, gravity tractors, landed rockets etc.) But I cannot find a single instance where anyone has addressed the legal problem of developing an orbital vehicle for planetary defense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems ridiculous, for I am but one in seven billion, someone must have discussed this problem before today. The only \u003Cem\u003Etiny \u003C/em\u003Emention that exists anywhere seems to be another (and I had predicted this to be true) KSP forum post, but that discussion diverted from the actual problem in about three replies and stopped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33208-How-long-will-the-Outer-Space-Treaty-last/page3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33208-How-long-will-the-Outer-Space-Treaty-last/page3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been a long time player of this game, but only just now joined the forums. I know my little brother is here all the time so I will just say hi to him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any ideas as to how to proceed with this discussion, please share them. I also have to find an \u0022expert\u0022 on this problem, and my school is actually chocked full of those (if I were just talking about intercepting an asteroid), but nobody for international law, which is the real problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI frankly find this to be insane, I will leave with the most insane quote I could find on the topic this is during a US Congressional inquiry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022REP. STEWART: ... are we technologically capable of launching something that could intercept [an asteroid]? ... DR. A\u0027HEARN: No. If we had spacecraft plans on the books already, that would take a year ... I mean a typical small mission ... takes four years from approval to start to launch ...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo any commentary that you may have is better than what exists now. I will except \u0022Rileymanrr, you stupid.\u0022 because it is more than what we have right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hey guys, stay focused. There have been simulations showing an intercept of a kilometer sized asteroid with atomic explosives we have right now with a lead time of only 30 days *from detection*. The amount of material that entered earth\u0027s atmosphere was only .1% of the total mass of the asteroid. The technicalities of intercepts isn\u0027t the problem here, we have that down and the strategies should work. We have enough control to keep an object from fragmenting (which is almost always preferable to solid impacts) by detonating the device above the surface. It is less efficient, but completely doable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would post the papers, but I am running off of my campus\u0027s internet, which allows me access to the papers for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-21T22:33:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2014 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rileymanrr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T21:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is we can\u0027t do a thing about an asteroid which to near to Earth.

What then? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the impact zone is in a spacefaring nation, we can be rest assured that said nation will do anything it can to defend itself. Getting the UN to bend the Outer Space Treaty becomes more problematic, as some nations - particularly those with Security Council vetoes, might decide it is not in \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E interests for such self-defense to succeed. If the US was about to be hit, would Russia be willing to sign off on a resolution? Or would they play politics in hopes of getting concessions? Likewise if the scenario was reversed - would American politicians (and the voting public) be willing to aid Russia when the US itself is not threatened? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr what if the impact zone of a Torino 3 to 5 threat is in an \u0022unimportant\u0022 or \u0022hostile\u0022 region?
