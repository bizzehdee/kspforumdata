I created the girders using the original station in the vab to ensure the docking ports line up okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought I\u0027d mention above to point out I have a large number of docking ports on the station!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m half way through putting the tanks on the station but one of the station docking ports isn\u0027t playing ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I have ensured that the docking ports are on the right way around. (the yellow handle is showing on both the tank and station ports)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the docking ports have been created using 4-way symmetry and its counterparts have docked with tanks okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) the tanks have been created using 4-way symmetry in a separate craft and again its counter parts are working fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow when leaving LKO I temporarily put the girders on the station ports (flat packed for transport) as the tanks will be sent to minmus separately and constructed in low minmus orbit. Now I didn\u0027t worry too much about lining the two sets of ports up so some had locked all four ports together while others didn\u0027t but they were pretty light so only getting the one connection didn\u0027t bother me too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit and all the bits together I started disconnecting the end girdles from the station - putting the tanks on the station and then putting the girdle back on. - first side done fine. next side one tank docks while the next one doesn\u0027t. The magnet doesn\u0027t even kick in! I get the tank lined up using the transport ship - come in at 0.10m/s - aligned perfectly - but they just bump each other and drift off. I\u0027ve saved and reloaded which normally kicks undocked ports alive if they are less than a metre from each other but nothing. I\u0027ve even reversed out 3 metres and come back in - nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum below shows the first two pictures of the two docking ports showing that they are the right way around. 3rd picture shows the docking ports lined up and closer to 1 metre and not locking. 4th picture shows me constructing the station - the two tanks at the top of the image pointing vertically is the side I\u0027ve already done - as you can see the cap is on top of it and all ports have docked perfectly. on the right you can see the cap connected directly to the station as all of them was prior to transporting to minmus and the transporter is currently moving two of the tanks in to place - I managed to get the first tank in which is currently being done in that screenshot but once that was in and I started moving the other one in to place did I have problems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 5th image shows the tank docked with the opposite port to the docking port I was trying to dock with - these ports were all created in 4-way symmetry.- just tried to dock the transporter to the problem port and it just bounced off too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/53ys4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
