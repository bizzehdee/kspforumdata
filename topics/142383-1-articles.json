hi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to share with you what has been, for me, quite the learning experience.\u00A0 Not to mention a mission filled with plotting, thrills, and all the normal kinds of things that happen when you mess with things beyond mortal ken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all started out as most of these crazy schemes do, with an over ambitious plan.\u00A0 My plan to land a mining platform on Ike and put refueling stations in Ike and Duna orbit was going along swimmingly, with a vast fleet of ships in Low Kerbin Orbit, when suddenly... without warning, the orbital trajectory planners down in the labs realized that the next window to launch a mission to Dres was going to happen \u003Cem\u003Ebefore \u003C/em\u003Ethe next window for Duna, not afterwards.\u00A0 Our engineers immediately scrambled to start assembling a space craft, including some never before tested rover designs.\u00A0 (The winning design was the one that didn\u0027t explode, so I figured we were good.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rocketcar_test.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

pre-flight test.\u00A0 Moments after cutting the main engine, about to safely land on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictured below, you can see the behemoth craft in orbit, ready to slooooowly boost the entire mining operation into Dres orbit.\u00A0 I thought docking all those modules together was a pretty impressive feat in its own right, considering the time pressure we were on to get everything out the door on time.\u00A0 Yes, we knew wobble would be an issue, but we planned to take it nice and slow.\u00A0 After all, why launch six ships once, when you can launch one ship in six orbits?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wobblecraft.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

entire thing wobbled apart while mission planners looked on helplessly.\u00A0 After about 5 minutes of thrust, we noticed the first signs of wobbling, so we cut engines and planned to pick up again on the next orbit, but the wobbling didn\u0027t stop.\u00A0 So then we cut \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E too, thinking that might allow it to settle down, but the wobbling only got worse.\u00A0 After several more minutes, with no control inputs or thrusting of any kind, several of the modules on the extremities converted themselves from space ships into fireworks.\u00A0 Luckily, I was able to rescue the crew.\u00A0 And thanks to the good work by our legal department, their contracts still required them to go on the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022shotgun_launch.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

fleet toward the mid-course plane change points.\u00A0 (I learned a very important skill during this mission: making very precise adjustments to my encounter trajectory with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters while at the ascending/descending node, rather than during the initial burn.\u00A0 Also, estimating orbital angles by eyeball is hard.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictured below, you can see one of the surface-to-orbit fuel tankers making its capture burn into orbit around Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tanker_capture.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

it was time to start launching my Duna/Ike mission.\u00A0 With my experience launching the Dres fleet, I was able to launch the eight vessel Duna/Ike fleet in less than two days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ike_refinery.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

boosters, about to be launched with a big interplanetary nuclear booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the second fleet was out the door though, I had to switch back and make sure the first fleet made it into orbit alright.\u00A0 Lucky for me, I had at the very least, two hours between intercept maneuvers.\u00A0 Most of them were a few days apart though, so it all worked out.\u00A0 You can see the Dres orbital refueling station here, just after it finished parking itself in a roughly circular orbit around 99,000 meters above Dres\u0027s equator.\u00A0 Still needs to have the refueling rig land before it can fill those tanks though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dres_orbital.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

equatorial region, in hopes of finding an ideal flat spot for the refinery, I noticed a little flag icon appear on the scanner.\u00A0 With curiosity at maximum, Gralyn (the tire repair expert) set the rocket car down to take a closer look.\u00A0 Driving approximately 3 kilometers from the touchdown spot to the point of interest, she managed to avoid flipping the rover even once.\u00A0 She might have made a good pilot as well as an engineer. (I still need to work on precision landing without the aid of targeting beacons from already landed craft.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022the_best_spot.png\u0022

the very first mission to Dres I had made, all those years ago.\u00A0 The mood at mission control was celebratory, little did we know what waited in store for us.\u00A0 Instead, with this historic landing accomplished, the Ike crew wanted their shot at the spotlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, we really needed to get some rocket fuel up to the orbiting tanker, because somewhere along the line, the Duna survey probes\u0027 engines turned on and they drained all their propellant.\u00A0 And since we had to drain some propellant out of the Duna lander\u0027s tanks to get the probes on their way, nobody in mission control was willing to send Jebediah and company down to the surface until the refueling mission was complete.\u00A0 Believe you me, Jeb was none too happy about having to wait.\u00A0 I think.\u00A0 It is really hard to tell, he always seems happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ike_dualtrucks.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

could find near Ike\u0027s equator.\u00A0 We all had a bit of a scare when one of the techs pointed out, \u0022Hey, did anyone realize that one of the docking nodes never latched down properly?\u00A0 That\u0027s probably why it\u0027s dancing about so much.\u0022\u00A0 But we were able to set them down after only a couple false starts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, this is when disaster struck.\u00A0 When I focused back on the Dres mission, Grelyn\u0027s lander craft was nowhere to be seen!\u00A0 It had just vanished, possibly a victim of the once notorious Space Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gralyn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

project got a second lease on life just now.\u00A0 Or at least a one point five~th lease on life.\u00A0 In order to build a ship under budget, I\u0027m going to have to take the ore refinery and

about 100 meters up onto an incline so that the angle was better.\u00A0 Thankfully, the landing legs were able to handle the strain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith everything squared away in

Kerman shut down the mining gear, folded up the solar panels and radiators, and turned out the lights one last time, before making the long walk to the Dres Escape Vehicle

the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system was out of electricity the entire time.\u00A0 (Or maybe because of that, it was a textbook liftoff, considering the way the rest of this mission went.)\u00A0 As you can see above, the DEV is coming in for docking with no electricity, but still some monopropellant to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that we had some assurance that we could actually refuel on arrival, I called in the mission planners to start talking about launch windows.\u00A0 We still

our attempts at plotting a course left us arriving on or after the 44/17.\u00A0 We knew that the margin of error in our burns would be much smaller than we were used to, even though the rescue craft

we were eyeballing the ejection angle, fudged the ejection angle to narrowly avoid a Mun encounter, and then didn\u0027t quite pull off the main burn correctly, I\u0027d say we did pretty well on the Delta V budget overall.\u00A0 Sure, the rescue craft had about 1.8 times the suggested propellant that all the interplanetary maps suggested, but we probably could have gotten away with 1.5 if someone

to be arriving at Dres, and they even managed to get there a few days ahead of schedule.\u00A0 Of course, considering their velocity, they were even more thrilled to discover that the rescue ship had

things went according to plan.\u00A0 Docking with the Dres orbital station went smoothly.\u00A0 We did another double, triple, and quadruple check of all the spare compartments to make sure there were

on a single nuclear booster.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it is still easier, even when one of the pilots does a repeat performance of the freefall snack experiment, and all maneuver
