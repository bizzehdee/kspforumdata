I have played KSP on Windows.... And well.... I have a voracious appetite for mods, and 32bit just wasn\u0027t cutting it anymore. After hearing rumors that Linux supports 64bit.... And as many mods as 16 GB of RAM can handle..... Well, I am here now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly kinda picked a distro kind of at random. I am a complete newb and I know next to nothing about Linux other than it is based on Unix... (which I got some training courtesy of Uncle Sam a little over a decade ago). I digress a little though. I picked up a copy of Debian 8 with the Cinnamon desktop (I am guessing that\u0027s a reference to the desktop enviroment?) through OSdisc.com.... I also have a copy of Mint-Debian on a thumb drive though I think I need to burn a DVD of that before I can install it... If I wanted to. I think I know just enough to get myself in trouble. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that my question is, what do I need to know about using Linux with KSP and vis versa. Perhaps this could become a thread of what to consider when migrating from Windows over to Linux, what to consider etc for someone who knows nothing about it.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I\u0027ll contribute, through trial and error is, that Debian 8, GNOME and ATI don\u0027t mix well for performance. I didn\u0027t really try playing the game per se, but just the initial menu screen was really choppy. In trying to get updated drivers for my video card, I learned that ATI recommends using the drivers that came with the OS. I\u0027ve been using my HD TV as a screen, but the \u0022Free Radeon\u0022 drivers limited me to 1260 by 440 pixels (I could be remembering the last number wrong.....) Fortunately for me, I had an nVidia 560 Ti as a backup. Other than the base drivers have told me that my 40\u0022 TV is really a 72\u0022 TV, it seems to work better. (I\u0027ve downloaded the updated drivers but I haven\u0027t installed them yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve kinda lept in with both feet, but if I had this to do again, I might run a dual boot system and preserve my MS Office documents and iTunes. I kinda thought that I could use Windows programs with Linux.... and I guess you can with an emulator named Wine. That said, there are music players in Linux that will play the non DRM files in my library so the iTunes thing might be a brief headache while I get that sorted out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what other concerns and considerations are out there when switching to Linux? Which distro is the most newbie friendly one? This doesn\u0027t apply to me, but if the person\u0027s machine has 4 GB of RAM is it worth it to switch to Linux, and if so what are the arguments for (or against)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final note, I started this thread to help information to be passed to users who are considering switching from Windows or OSX to Linux as to the benefits and/or pitfalls of the switch. I would appreciate it if the arguements are made with this in mind. I would appreciate it if when people contribute to this thread, they refrain from bashing other OS\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your comments and suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy copy of Linux is, according to the disc,: Debian Live 8.0 Cinnamon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T00:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo not pick a distro based on rumors of guesses.

Stick to a well supported, active distro and stick to a common configuration. Since you are going to Linux for a single program (KSP), look at what\u0027s recommended for it. It\u0027s a transition to jump OS (anyone who tells you it\u0027s just like Windows is lying through their teeth), so don\u0027t make it harder on yourself by picking one with less help resources or by running a noval configuration.

The next thing you need to do is add proprietary drivers for your video card. The open Source drivers that are installed automatically are no good for 3D Gaming.

If you can switch the nvidia card do so, nvidia has very good linux support, but for KSP even Intel HD graphics will do.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be more precise, Debian per default installs only open source software, but it does ship closed source software as well. That\u0027s especially important for users of AMD graphics cards and broadcom network cards, as the open source radeon and broadcom drivers requires non-free firmware. So, to get the open source radeon driver to work with 3D accelleration, one needs first to enable the contrib and non-free repositories in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esources.list\u003C/a\u003E, update the list of packages (there\u0027s a refresh button in synaptic, or on the command line run \u0022apt-get update\u0022 as root), and install the firmware-linux-nonfree package (\u0022apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree\u0022, again as root).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As said, if you have a Southern Islands card, forget the open source radeon driver on Debian 8 until \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774784\u0026amp;archived=False\u0026amp;mbox=no\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis bug\u003C/a\u003E gets fixed, as it will crash regularly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnabling the contrib and non-free repos will give you extremely easy ways to install the proprietary drivers as well. For AMD you\u0027ll then have packages named fglrx-driver and fglrx-control available, and for nvidia there\u0027s nvidia-driver (or some nvidia-legacy-*** packages for older drivers for older cards).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor AMD cards it might be necessary to run \u0022aticonfig --initial\u0022 as root after installing the proprietary drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA word of warning: On all distributions that have their own package managers, it\u0027s in nearly all cases the best to install software from the repositories, even if it\u0027s older than software found on the vender website. The reason is, that if you install software from the repositories, there\u0027s usually a way to cleanly uninstall it again, as it uses the native package format of the distribution. If you download an installer from somewhere on the web (ok, let\u0027s be clear here: I\u0027m talking about the AMD or nVidia graphics driver installers) there might be (for the graphics drivers: there is) no clean way to uninstall the software again. This might (for the graphics drivers: will definitely) cause issues when upgrading the distribution to a newer release.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T14:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
