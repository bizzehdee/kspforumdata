Which is better than giving it to us a day before the holiday season, then not being able to support all the bugs in it :) On the other hand, I\u0026#39;m jonesin\u0026#39; for some KSP and I play pretty slowly, so I was wondering:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#008080]What would I need to do in a 1.0.5 career such that nothing stops working in 1.1?[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B]I suspect the antennae thing will come into play, but I haven\u0026#39;t really paid any attention to it. Would it just mean there must always be an antenna on every ship? Would I need to use a certain size to cover a certain distance?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny further aero/heat changes anticipated? I\u0026#39;d hate to send out return-vessels that completed a 2-month real-time voyage, only to burn up in an atmosphere that\u0026#39;s suddenly harsher than they were designed for at launch...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdvice appreciated :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:34:12Z","Content":"\nYou\u0026#39;re potentially going to lose control of anything uncrewed. From the release notes, I gather that they\u0026#39;re going to be implementing something much like RemoteTech, but slightly more forgiving.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom reading the release notes, I gather that to control an uncrewed vessel, you need an antenna; it has to have enough range to reach either Kerbin or the next link in the chain to Kerbin; and if you\u0026#39;re not connecting directly, you need to have a continuous unbroken chain of relays back to Kerbin. Plus there\u0026#39;s some provision for crewed ships to serve as remote-control sources (i.e. you can link back to them instead of linking all the way back to Kerbin), though the exact details of that are unclear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheir [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350\u0022]release notes[/URL] don\u0026#39;t mention changes to game physics (such as reentry heat)... but Squad has a track record of tinkering and rebalancing with each major update, so it\u0026#39;s best not to count on everything staying exactly the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll in all: It\u0026#39;s going to be an extremely heavy-hitting change. I don\u0026#39;t know how reverse-compatible it will be; it may be that career breakage is unavoidable. I doubt that there\u0026#39;s any really reliable way to know, prior to 1.1, whether you\u0026#39;re guaranteed to work. It\u0026#39;s also highly likely that many if not all mods will break, so if you use career-affecting mods (e.g. new parts, etc.) then that would make breakage more likely, I would think.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally, I plan on starting a fresh career with 1.1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would suggest one of the following:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Plan on starting a new career with 1.1. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]If you have a pre-1.1 career that you really can\u0026#39;t bear the thought of ditching when 1.1 hits: Before 1.1, copy your whole KSP install tree to a new folder.

For probes that are already in place, it probably won\u0026#39;t be an impact except that you\u0026#39;ll have to go back and add in communication nodes to get back to controlling them.

If it\u0026#39;s out of communication range on the way to another planet, you\u0026#39;ll probably not be able to do the capture burn at it\u0026#39;s destination.
