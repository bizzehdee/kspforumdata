I\u0027ve recently been having several problems with KSP crashing (in the form of a BSOD) on Windows 10. I just started having this problem about 1.5 weeks ago, and it normally happens after around an hour of playing or so, and the BSOD says the error was UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Version: 1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/4fM3ZV1E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pastebin.com/4fM3ZV1E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jammer-TD","CreatedById":173970,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-17T13:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not seen a bsod caused by this game 1.22,1.3,1.3.1 or its mod\u0027s, for the most part BSOD is usually a hardware failure. I would recommend temp monitoring as it obviously doesn\u0027t happen at loading(1 hour would strain parts getting hot) also\u00A0memory\u00A0chips can get hot and cause this as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou don\u0027t mention the use of x64-ksp.exe so make sure you use the 64 version.
