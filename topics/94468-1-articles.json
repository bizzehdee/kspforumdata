Today I spent about 6 hours on a craft, a car really. I was nearing completion of it, when all of a sudden, I get what I have dubbed as the \u0022Vessel Name Bug\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts catalog won\u0027t load, the mission flag changes to some weird kerbal, the stage won\u0027t show, none of the buttons besides exit work, when I hit launch it says \u0022Craft size not found!\u0022, and lastly it doesn\u0027t load the name, rather it says \u0022Vessel Name\u0022. It seems to be happening in both 64-bit and 32-bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qyHTdRu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qyHTdRu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the log: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/i3hhujk5d7i5gh6/KSPlog.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELOG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand here\u0027s the craft file if needed(it\u0027s really big so I doubt anyone will look at it): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/inx73ir6h8dp62d/HornetCraft.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECRAFT\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not entirely sure what mod is causing this, but it\u0027s so strange. The craft appears to be normal(Aside from one time loading the craft everything that went flat similar to how my craft bended on my last launch), it just won\u0027t let me edit it or use it.
