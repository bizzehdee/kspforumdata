An extinctor-class asteroid has struck Kerbin, mauling it beyond recognition and scattering toxic compounds into the atmosphere such that Kerbin can no longer support life. But in Kerbin\u0027s dying moments, it managed to launch one final rocket carrying it\u0027s brightest engineers and bravest pilots. This is where you come in. You begin your journey as the last starship, adrift among the debris that was once Kerbin. You must hunt for fuel, ore, and science to advance your colony until you can eventually carry crew to a distant star with the next habitable planet, where your colony can begin the Kerbal race anew. This is the end, but it is also the beginning. You have only 10 pilots in your colony, so guide them well, as you won\u0027t be getting any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think?

This mod/game mode would pretty much just change Kerbin and remove the KSC, making you start the game in the tracking station instead. Most of the elements already exist across current mods, such as Karbonite and Extraplanetary Launch Pads. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the most direct way of making this would be a mod-package that sets you up with those two mods, a planet way out in the distance, and somehow disables KSC, making you get to the tracking station and science page through the pause menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimberWolffe","CreatedById":119811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T01:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of a mod that would do that, but with Unity\u0027s current physics processing and the way KSP currently has to handle graphics, it would require far too much RAM and be far too laggy to be playable.
