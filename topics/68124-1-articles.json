(aka me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new structural integrity maybe we could get a 5x or 6x phys-warp maybe so the ion engines can be 1/4 less powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etry and optimise anti-aliasing, it actually produces tons of lag....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas ?

And it will take time for the game to be adapted to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf possible tho. I would like an option (default off) to use time on rails time acceleration in low orbit under map view at full rate. This will mean I don\u0027t have to waste fuel to burn into a higher orbit just to move time. Or even have a window to jump ahead by orbit or time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T02:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-Water is just another planet, you can\u0027ty remove it from under the terrain without completely redoing how it\u0027s being created/handled/rendered.

Normally this would be managed by your GPU, but given the amount of stuff Unity offload to the GPU is minimal, you will get some very increased lag because your CPU is already bottlenecked with KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are things that could be done do speed things up, but as said above, a lot of them are Unity dependant. I don\u0027t think those are the right path to explore to try to optimize KSP on our side. I think putting on rails loaded but inactive crafts that cannot move (looking at you space stations) would be a god first step IMO. But I don\u0027t feel it should be a priority now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
