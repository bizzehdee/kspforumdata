After\u00A0two large car crashes happened less than a kilometre\u00A0ahead of me. I thought I\u0027d be stuck there for days. A couple hours\u00A0later the traffic began moving again. Then it rained, which was lucky because the traffic was moving again. I have been in another country for a couple weeks visiting family for the holidays. I left this morning. Oy\u00A0vey, I am lucky to not still be there. They had to airlift something out. Also, it was something like forty kilometres from a shooting range, so we heard that every few minutes the whole time. This wasn\u0027t even the first thing I did in 2k16. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T08:30:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n40\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ekilometers\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0from a shooting range and you heard it?
