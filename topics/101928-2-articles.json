I was trying to move the half-ton mass track parts. I\u0027ll ask about that over in the KF thread though since it\u0027s not directly KIS\u0027s fault.\n\nMost certainly installing it correctly.

So, maybe it\u0027s something planned, but how about a way to view the volume of things while in VAB? Theres going to be some parts (such as the two track parts I mentioned in an earlier post) that are light enough, but are too big volume wise and might not be obvious that they don\u0027t fit.\n\nEdit: Just had something wierd happen. While leaving it in the SPH for a couple minutes while KSP not being the active window, the camera stopped working and when I exited SPH, the KSC camera was screwed up, tried reloading save, still screwed up, trying KSP reboot. I had been noticing some camera wierdness earlier, but I thought that was just KSP.\n\nEdit2: It\u0027s fine after a KSP reboot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T16:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"Celann","CreatedById":126376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T16:26:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What mods do you have?

It\u0027s also unclear to me how exactly KAS\u0027s KASModuleGrab (the module added to parts to allow you to grab them) coexists with KIS. From looking at the OP and the Wiki, it seems like parts no longer need a \u0022grab module\u0022 to allow Kerbals to grab/attach/manipulate the parts but I haven\u0027t played with the mod yet.
