A more efficient turn will start no later than about 10km, and possibly even lower. Don\u0027t allow your ship to exceed terminal velocity (see wiki for an altitude chart). I would try to be at a 45 degree angle around 15-17km, hold it for a few seconds and then very gradually lower it all the way to the horizon. You can even point below the horizon a few degrees toward the end to help with the circularization (though this is most useful with an apoapsis of 100km or higher). The best way I\u0027ve found to judge the success of your gravity turn is to see how much DV you need to complete a circular orbit once you get out of the atmosphere at your apoapsis. The lower this is, the better in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you might try is to use MechJeb\u0027s ascent autopilot tool.
