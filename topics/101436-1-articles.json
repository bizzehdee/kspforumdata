If you have less than that, turn initially toward 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0-70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and continue slowly turning toward 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 - as your craft burns fuel, it\u0027s TWR will increase, making it easier to not start falling down again. If you have much more TWR, throttle down a bit (or get a smaller engine) - if you get your desired Ap (and shut off engines) but you\u0027re still at 25 km altitude, the atmosphere is going to drag you back down to Kerbin.\n\nYou can do two things for extra points:\n\n - don\u0027t go too much above terminal velocity in atmo (generally when you start getting reentry flames/mach effects, you are going too fast... Or you can get a mod that tells you the terminal velocity for your current atmo pressure, like KER). This one is for efficiency.\n\n - during the 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 climb, try to keep Ap about a minute in front of you - if it gets under one minute, nose up a little. If it\u0027s rising too fast, throttle down a bit (or nose down... but only if your nose is up by a lot, **DO NOT** put your nose below the prograde marker). This will ensure that you can easily inject into a nice orbit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ... should be tilted at roughly 30 degrees.

These are vessel altitude reading.\n\nThis is a very high altitude for each of these steps. Remember that attaining orbit is not about going up so much as it is about going sideways very fast. With the path you are taking you will be going way too slow by the time you get your apoapsis where you want it and you will have to do a much larger burn to circularize.\n\nThe only reason to point straight up at all is because of the atmosphere and this is only a big problem at low altitudes (\u003C10km). A more efficient turn will start no later than about 10km, and possibly even lower. Don\u0027t allow your ship to exceed terminal velocity (see wiki for an altitude chart). I would try to be at a 45 degree angle around 15-17km, hold it for a few seconds and then very gradually lower it all the way to the horizon. You can even point below the horizon a few degrees toward the end to help with the circularization (though this is most useful with an apoapsis of 100km or higher). The best way I\u0027ve found to judge the success of your gravity turn is to see how much DV you need to complete a circular orbit once you get out of the atmosphere at your apoapsis. The lower this is, the better in general.\n\nAnother thing you might try is to use MechJeb\u0027s ascent autopilot tool. Even if you don\u0027t plan to use MechJeb for this regularly, it can be well worth the time to try it a few times and see what the ascent profile looks like. It may not be perfect, but I find that it yields reasonable results and you have several options to fine tune it. I highly recommend it for testing this stuff out, and then afterwards you can go back to doing manual ascents."},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T19:56:40Z","Content":"At this point; I love watching the launch but, I don\u0027t feel a need to be at the buttons at every second, anymore.\n\nNow, I just hit \u0022Engage Autopilot\u0022 and sip a tasty, tasty beer Pepsi."},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T21:30:59Z","Content":"Oddible,\n\nAre you using FAR or stock aerodynamics?\n\nIf you\u0027re still using stock aerodynamics, I suggest installing FAR and forgetting everything you know about optimal gravity-turns. Gravity-turns should be performed much sooner in FAR, and become limited by how aerodynamically stable your rocket is (try to turn too fast and you\u0027ll spin out of control). Ideal TWR (to minimize Delta-V to orbit) also becomes much higher when you get rid of the unrealistic stock soup-o-sphere...\n\nStock aero is getting replaced with a more realistic and FAR-like aero model in 1.0, so I strongly suggest getting used to realistic aerodynamics now before SQUAD forces you to do so... Who knows, you might even like FAR better, since in a few ways it looks like FAR will actually be easier than stock aero (it has body-lift, which will be absent from the new stock aero AFAIK, for instance...)\n\nRegards,\n\nNorthstar\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T21:33:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T01:14:05Z","Content":"Also, you\u0027ll have to relearn everything when 1.0 comes out again.

Ideally you want to turn slowly and gradually along your entire launch however that\u0027s not always possible, especially with experimental craft.\n\nMy advice would be to throttle up to max until your spacecraft reaches 150m/s, then throttle down to about 2/3rds or slow enough so you don\u0027t accellerate away from 150m/s too fast. Now wait till you reach 200m/s and then throttle back to stop going any faster. Once you reach about 9km then begin to slowly tilt over, once you reach 10km you should be at around 15 degrees. At 12 km roughly 20~30 degrees, now throttle up to max and slowly pitch over to past the 45 degree mark. I personally like to stay in around the 65 degree mark but your craft might not have the TTWR to sustain that so just keep your craft accelerating sideways and gaining apogee. Once you\u0027ve reached your desired altitude for your obit, cut the engines.\n\nOf course, this is just what I would do, many people have different opinions and its a debated topic. I would say that if your craft can get in orbit, its a successful launch and if you don\u0027t have enough fuel just add more boosters. Scott Manley has a great video on youtube discussing this topic. He recommends that as a rule of thumb, start turning at 10km. \n\nHope this was helpful!"},{"CreatedByName":"Montag","CreatedById":62945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T17:20:38Z","Content":"The wiki has terminal velocity versus altitude for Kerbin, Eve, Laythe, and Duna. You want to follow that curve for your velocity. Scott Manley has a video speaking to gravity turns. The easy for Kerbin is roll to 45 at 10km then gradually decrease the angle after that. The advice from GoSlash just seems wrong. Once you get past the atmosphere penalty you want to throttle up to get in orbit as fast as possible to not fight gravity anymore. I am guessing that Max Q should typically occur at 10-12.5 km and throttle up could be 15k. Above 20k, I think you would have to be at extreme (re-entry speeds) to not want your max acceleration."},{"CreatedByName":"Jikahn","CreatedById":107137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T20:34:50Z","Content":"What you want to do is be thrusting along the horizon at the earliest opportunity with a low amount of atmospheric drag.
