The wonders of something new, the trials you went through, it\u0027s as if they never happened. This journal is about my first try at this\u00A0amazing game, Kerbal Space Program, on hard difficulty, no mission restarts. My lessons will be learned using cold hard Funds, errors paid for with\u00A0lost reputation and lost Kerbonauts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy skills coming into this\u00A0are based on doing the\u00A0first three tutorials,\u00A0a quick run at moderate difficulty before\u00A0I realized I could revert\u00A0flights, and some sandbox play with airplane designs. I had never been to orbit, and I don\u0027t read guides except for the in-game encyclopedia. I hope people can enjoy reading these entries, I will finish the game where-ever events\u00A0take me. If you give me hints about errors I\u0027m making, please, like an advanced civilization,\u00A0give them\u00A0vaguely to we\u00A0undeserving Kerblings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, let us soon get started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-04T11:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/200952-kerbie-z/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022200952\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/200952-kerbie-z/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KERBIE Z\u003C/a\u003E.

I\u0027m not into such things actually...instead...i simply try to raise the scale of my missions and trying to do it better than most people, even then...i always play in Sandbox, as well as Science mode a bit, i gain experience by seeing how veterans do it, and try outdoing them, yet i did enable reverts as i don\u0027t want to leave or lose the big 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Dressian Exploder","CreatedById":191542,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-13T19:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s see how this goes!
