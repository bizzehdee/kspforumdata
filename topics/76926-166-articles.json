It would launch a small unmanned vessel rendezvous near a satellite and then fire a barrage of ball bearings. Like an orbital shotgun. The idea was to at the very least take out the solar panels and then the satellites batteries would simply die. Only thing was this would introduce a ton of space junk Making future mission more dangerous. Then they came up with lasers and that pretty much rendered it obsolete. That was one of my more useful weapons platforms actually, 1-3 lasers and a compliment of HEKV\u0027s. Lasers are powered by solar panels and you now have an infinite supply of orbital destruction.
