Same goes for elevons (but less important).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWing aspect ratios don\u0027t matter much without FAMod, the same wing pieces give the same lift. Only thing that changes is your plane is harder to roll.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWing sweep does matter in KSP, but not like in real life. Stock KSP wings only produce lift from air flow perpendicular to the part (not the plane!). This has two effects. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1) If you rotate wing panels 90 degrees, they won\u0027t do anything.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2) If you make swept wings, with wing segments rotated, your plane will have less lift when going straight, and yaw-roll coupling (when it goes sideways, one wing side will generate more lift than the other, rolling the plane). Due to this, swept-forward wings are actually more stable in KSP!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWinglets and Canards apply force at their mounting point (not their apparent center), so canards-on-wings can act like almost perfect rudders (no yaw-roll coupling)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe most common complaint about tricycle landing gear is \u0022why does my plane swerve off the runway\u0022. The answer: \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1) Your rear gear isn\u0027t straight or\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2) your plane\u0027s rear is lifting off first, putting all the weight on the front wheel (wheelbarrowing).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat explanations though!
