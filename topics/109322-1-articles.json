I designed a multi-mode turbojet that could run using condensed air, effectively having the same fuel efficiency. I had to explain it in the description though... \n\nAnyway, I thought it was cool being able to essentially create a whole new engine, and I figure:\n\nWhy not let us all make our own engines? I\u0027d imagine it\u0027d be a daunting task for something like this, especially since so many things could go wrong, but I have some restrictive ideas:\n\n-Each engine model is selected from a library of prepared models, as well as textures, but the user may upload his/her own model.\n\n--If user does upload his/her original engine model, then a custom texture is required.\n\n-The player must select X out of (X\u002BR) options. Say, he/she selects fuel type. This would limit the options further.\n\n--Isp and combustion pressure have a limited range depending on the engine size, fuel type, and engine modules.\n\n---If liquid fuel is selected, then you can choose what the Isp and combustion pressure [Vac or Atm] would be, then the game would automatically calculate thrust, and temperature.\n\nIf LFO is selected, basically the same options. If Xenon is selected, then you can choose what the Isp would be, then the game would automatically calculate thrust and power consumption would be.\n\nI don\u0027t really know what could be done for monopropellant, but I\u0027m sure you could come up with something. The same could be said for solid fuel.\n\nNext you could decide whether or not it is a multimode engine, and run through the previous process again for the secondary mode.\n\nAfter all that, optionally you could be given the opportunity to test your engine for tweaking purposes. Not really required, and I guess a calculator would substitute, but it\u0027d be interesting nonetheless.\n\nI wasn\u0027t really sure to suggest this here or the addons, but I figured here would be better. What do you all think? Any other ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T07:26:14Z","Content":"Maybe you would look at Near Future Propulsion.

Quite good, in fact. Maybe like a built in application for 3D modelling and texturing, as well as the prepared ones. Maybe if these two worked together, maybe even something to let you make new fuels.\n\nName\n\nDensity\n\nCost per unit\n\nHSP\n\nFlow mode\n\nTransfer method\n\nIf it\u0027s tweakable\n\nPerfect!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would be very interested if an idea such as this could be implemented in game. \n\u003E I would love to be able to mod the game myself but simply don\u0027t have the knowledge needed and as such I rely on the fantastic work of the modding community.
