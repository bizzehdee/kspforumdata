The reason this works is what is called the Oberth Effect (look it up on wikipedia if you are interested). The Oberth effect essentially states that you get more energy out of your fuel when you are in a higher energy orbit (Larger orbits have higher energy). Therefore, even though you waste fuel by burning out to the high apoapsis and back in, you gain a huge amount by turning the orbit while that far out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see simply how much less fuel it takes to turn to polar orbit by your velocity at apoapsis compared to at periapsis (say, Kerbin altitude). For example, the maneurver I used this for was to go into a reverse Kerbol orbit at Kerbin altitude. To do this by brute force takes about 18,000m/s of delta V (twice kerbin\u0027s velocity), which is very difficult to achieve with stock parts (The highest I have managed is around 15,000m/s). However, burning out to 100 billion meters requires about 3600m/s delta V, and the same to return. At apoapsis your velocity is ~1000m/s, and so it takes 2000m/s of delta V to reverse the orbit. Adding these up, the total delta V for the bielliptic maneurver is about 9200m/s, just about half of what it takes by brute force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the polar orbit case, the most efficient brute force burn (single burn at 135 degrees to orbit plane) requires ~13,000m/s of delta V. Doing the same adjustment at 100 billion meters requires ~1500m/s of delta V. After acounting for the two transfer burns, the bielliptic method requires 8700m/s of delta V while the brute force method requires 13,000m/s, a gain of ~4300m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, use the bielliptic transfer for most non time critical missions in kerbol SOI!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-31T19:58:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2012 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Bluejayek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T00:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a graph showing the delta V required to attain a polar orbit at kerbins altitude as a function of the apoapsis of the bielliptic transfer.
