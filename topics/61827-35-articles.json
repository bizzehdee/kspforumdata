I\u0027ve seen this ages ago but the cause for me was running into the 3.8GB 32-bit program memory cap. What\u0027s happening if you see the black-screen launchpad is that KSP itself was unable to finish loading the terrain data for the planet Kerbin (which it didn\u0027t need while you were in the VAB). Going to launchpad causes a jump in memory usage so it\u0027s often the place where bugs due to the memory cap manifest. In my case it happened with the ages-old bug in kOS that caused the program to loop slower and slower over time, which was also causing it to use more and more memory each update tick, and the memory it was wasting wasn\u0027t being wiped when reverting to launch. But that bug has been gone for a long time now, so if you\u0027re still getting the black-launchpad then I\u0027d guess there\u0027s a different memory issue (maybe caused by kOS, maybe not?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lexx Thai","CreatedById":102954,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T21:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I\u0027ve post screenshots and /output_log.txt later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, i\u0027m getting not black-launchpad, but empty ship construction except probe core (with kOS) on normal launchpad (after reverting after flight).
