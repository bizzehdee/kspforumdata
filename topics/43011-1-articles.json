I have simulate in background turned on, but I can tell that when I tab out, everything runs at about 1/4 speed. Its particularly noticeable when I am scanning for Kethane on other bodies, as the detector tone pings about once every half second, while it usually rings about 8 or 10 times a second. I\u0027m just asking, so i can scan for Kethane while doing other things on my computer.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T19:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETabbing out is known to cause issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindowed mode seems to work okay, but I rarely do much on my other screen while I have my game running.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ledogen","CreatedById":78740,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T19:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETabbing out is known to cause issues.\u003Cp\u003EWindowed mode seems to work okay, but I rarely do much on my other screen while I have my game running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had issues, I\u0027m running KSP on a pretty new machine, things just happen in slo-mo in the background. What I\u0027m saying is that my scan-patterns are still normal and the craft is in one piece when I come back, but things just happen in slow motion when I\u0027m away. I was wondering if anybody knew anything about program throttling in the config files, or maybe it\u0027s a Windows setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T05:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehave you tried messing with the process priority in the task manager? set the kerbal space program task to \u0022Realtime\u0022, that may help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
