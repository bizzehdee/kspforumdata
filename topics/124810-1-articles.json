Set up the hierarchy so that the last panel is nested under the second to last, etc up to the first. So if you rotate the first panel, the others swing with it, down the line. It helps to offset the faces of the mesh from the transform node, so that the center of rotation for each object is at the edge of the panel / at the hinge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t actually know how to use the animation tools in Unity (I just animate in Maya) so you\u0027ll have to figure that out somewhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joco223","CreatedById":92530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T19:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.

There are a lot of special rules for naming, orientation and hierarchy when dealing with solar panels so if that is what you\u0027re up to make sure to check the solar panel stuff in the thread I linked.

Blender can be daunting but it\u0027s a good program that has a bigger toolbox than Wings. Personally I use Autodesk Maya for modeling and animating, and I use a plugin called Nightshade UV Editor to unwrap. I\u0027m not sure what the restrictions on it are but you can get a student non-commercial license of Maya for free. Use whatever is comfortable to you, and don\u0027t be afraid to learn new programs. Each has it\u0027s own strengths and weaknesses, and you\u0027ll never have one program that excels at everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
