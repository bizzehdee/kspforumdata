So I was wondering if it would be more fuel and cost efficient to carry it as vapor, ice, or as liquid... Maybe a few launches and rendezvous to the interplanetary stage in orbit, a little at a time... I don\u0027t know.

Mars soil contains about 2% of chemically tied water. Haul refinery and nuclear reactor there, and you will have constant supply of water. And it\u0027s not accounting for water that probably is frozen at Mars poles. But if you insist - carrying water from Earth is horribly cost prohibitive. You would be better off finding an asteroid containing water (dead comet perhaps) and transporting it to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T19:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that really matters when transporting stuff throughout the solar system is mass. More mass = bigger payload fraction = less delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when transporting water the state only influences what container it needs. A ton of water weighs the same whether its gas or solid after all. This means storing it as steam is completely out of the question, that means you need a huge (And therefore heavy) container with powerful heating equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solid - liquid difference is a bit harder to determine. If you transport it from earth to mars liquid is probably best. Liquid water is denser than ice so you can fit more in the same tank. If you go out farther it probably shifts in the favor of ice. That\u0027s because ice is stable in a vacuum if it\u0027s colder than -55 degrees Celsius (or something in that order, going from memory here). This means that you don\u0027t need a container at all as long as you stay far away from the sun. Just glue a engine to a block of ice and push it around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for sending it all up at once vs multiple launches. It is best to send it all at once. This is because rocket engines are single use and really expensive, if you send up the water in 5 launches it\u0027ll take the same amount of fuel but 5 times the engines. Besides, a few tons isn\u0027t that much in terms of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T19:10:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil humans find a way to extract \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eextremely low\u003C/span\u003E amounts of water in Martian soil (we\u0027ve already discussed it at length, it is drier than Sahara sand), water will have to be carried along, and it will be quite some time before such need vanishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid water is the best because its density is greater than ice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaebn","CreatedById":76969,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T19:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENuke a comet into a collision cource with it, simples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T19:48:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vaebn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bradley101","CreatedById":39760,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T20:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUntil humans find a way to extract \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eextremely low\u003C/span\u003E amounts of water in Martian soil (we\u0027ve already discussed it at length, it is drier than Sahara sand), water will have to be carried along, and it will be quite some time before such need vanishes.\u003Cp\u003ELiquid water is the best because its density is greater than ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you read any data? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com/22949-mars-water-discovery-curiosity-rover.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.space.com/22949-mars-water-discovery-curiosity-rover.html\u003C/a\u003E A liter of water per cubic foot.
