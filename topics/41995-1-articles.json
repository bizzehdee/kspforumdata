It does not matter where you put it, but keep staging in mind. If you only need it on the boosters for an asparagus launcher (like me) slap them on top of those and they drop with the boosters so you don\u0027t over torque. Just be sure you don\u0027t accidentally drop them in staging before you mean to. That will ruin your day to make your rocket suddenly a pig.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T18:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo basically the SAS torque will always be applied from the center of mass and not where the actual part is?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T18:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget guys, SAS is just the computer, reaction wheels are the bit that does the work, it\u0027s going to take ages for the distinction to settle in with everybody but it is kinda important that we don\u0027t confuse them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T23:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn SAS part does not exist anymore. Your talking about reaction wheels and YES it does matter where you place them. Reaction wheels near the center of mass are a total waste unless its a small craft. For large craft I place reaction wheels as far from the center of mass as possible. It\u0027s a leverage issue. I put a wheel at the very bottom in between an engine and fuel tank and then at the top on the command pod. Now these pods have their own torque, but its too minuscule for large craft.

I see your logic but reaction wheels don\u0027t work like levers. To move an object with a lever the other end must be \u0022pushed\u0022 like when using RCS. Reaction wheels, however, rotate around the part\u0027s center, not the ship\u0027s. So to get a rotation about the center of mass, the part must be at or near the ship\u0027s center of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo visualize this, imagine grabbing a long piece of rebar and trying to rotate it with one hand. Grabbing one end and rotating it is hard and is offcenter, but rotating the rebar at its center will preserve the position of the center of mass and make it easier to rotate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bean","CreatedById":70878,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T14:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a big moonbase module with rocket lander stages at the edges, with RW, they almost tore the ship apart, like twisting a straw from both ends in different directions.
