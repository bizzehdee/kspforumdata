With each word, I start by comparing its beginning to each verb root(2). If I find the right one, I take out the root and add it to output, then see if the next fits any of the verb endings, and add its translation to the output as well(3). Then it does step (2)\u00A0with nouns again, and then it tries to find prefixes and suffixes. The program also saves whether we already found a verb or noun in this word, for purposes of negation of pre and suffixes.

Another door banged open and three more soldiers prodded their captives over to join them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs that all of them?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYessir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short, stocky-looking soldier, wearing three chrome bars on his collar, nodded in satisfaction. \u201CGood work. Take them over to the crane.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ragged group of scientists and engineers needed no further prompting. Eyes downcast, they formed up into a line and marched off, hands clasped behind their heads. Their assailants walked alongside them, keeping a wary eye on their surroundings as they went. Mac glanced up and his heart sank still further at the sight of another, much shorter line of captives being marched in from the opposite side of the Site D compound. They assembled at the crane in front of an older, care-worn kerbal, wearing much more elaborate insignia on his collar. The officer watched them gather, engineers, scientists, and sullen and bleeding guards. Lieutenant Lenger stepped forward and saluted. \u201CSite is secure, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery good, Mr Lenger.\u201D The officer whirled and pointed at Mac. \u201CYou! Where is the entrance to your underground facilities?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeeling every eye on his back as he did so, Mac lifted his head. \u201CThe bunker behind you,\u201D he said. \u201CSir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent, Mr\u2026?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMacbus, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMr Macbus.\u201D The officer\u2019s lip quirked upwards. \u201CWe assumed as much from a simple process of elimination but it\u2019s pleasing to see that you don\u2019t intend to tell any tedious lies. May I presume that the interior of that bunker is merely a changing room and storage area?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe officer made a beckoning gesture with one hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sigh. \u201CCome, Mr Macbus. A little more information if you please. What can we expect to find downstairs? More guards?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, sir. Just the rest of the science team.\u201D Do exactly as they say, Mac. Exactly. \u201CLevel one is the reception, lounge and catering area. Level two below it is for offices, labs and meeting rooms, level three is the for the main test area and waste storage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery \u003Cem\u003Egood,\u003C/em\u003E Mr Macbus!\u201D The officer rubbed his hands together. \u201CYou will escort myself and my troops down to level three. Your colleagues will come with us, naturally, as a precautionary measure in case any of your\u2026 science team decide to get creative.\u201D He winked. \u201CI fear they may not be as trustworthy as you, Mr Macbus.\u201D He glanced at Jorgun standing in his underclothes. \u201CBesides \u2013 I can hardly leave them all standing in the midday sun. I am not a monster after all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe officer pointed at three of his soldiers. \u201CSecure the bunker and the top of the stairwell.\u201D He waited for their answering salutes before turning back to the hostages. \u201CMr Macbus, you will lead the way down to level one. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHading crouched behind the curved reception desk, pistol drawn, eyes fixed on the bank of monitor screens suspended before the receptionist\u2019s seat. He watched three black-and-white figures burst into view, rifles sweeping back and forth. One of them darted forward and kicked open the storage room door before leaping to one side, his two companions covering him with their weapons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHading watched them inspecting the doorway to the stairwell at length, before turning the handle. They stepped to one side, holding the door ajar with the butts of their rifles, before heaving it open. Hading\u2019s eyes flicked across to another monitor just in time to see the first soldier charge through, search the top of the stairwell and retreat. Gritting his teeth as the bunker filled up with soldiers and terrified scientists, he saw Mac being pushed onto the stairs at gunpoint, watched as a uniformed kerbal followed him, the details of his collar insignia blurred by the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe heavy security door blocked out any sound from above. Dry-mouthed, Hading watched the queue of figures shuffling into and then out of camera shot, ears pricked for the sound of a turning door handle. There was a click and a faint creak of hinges. The ringing of boots on steel steps filtered around the edge of the door, then grew abruptly louder. He heard footsteps passing by on his left and risked a glance around the side of his hiding place, heart hammering against his ribs as he saw a pair of sandaled feet go past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat will do Mr Macbus.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHading\u2019s head swivelled, tracking the heavier footfalls of the unknown officer across the room. He flicked a last look at the monitor showing the, now empty, top of the stairwell, gathering himself as one set of footsteps after another filtered into the room. Glancing one last time at the black button set into the underside of the reception desk, he surged to his feet, snub-nosed pistol whipping up and round before settling unerringly on the officer\u2019s forehead. The blur of movement from the corners of his eyes told him that every other gun in the room, apart from one, was pointed back at himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA chuckle broke the sudden silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhhh, very \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E, Mr Macbus. Either your acting talent is quite wasted out here in the desert, or that slack-jawed look is entirely genuine.\u201D The officer cocked an eyebrow. \u201CTo whom do I owe this unfortunate situation?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHading Kerman. Kerbin Nuclear Standards Agency.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe officer raised both eyebrows. \u201CReally? You handle that pistol well for a bureaucrat.\u201D He gestured at the soldiers by his side. \u201CBut I fear you are rather outmatched. Why don\u2019t you put the gun down before somebody gets hurt?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAfter you shot our guards in cold blood?\u201D Hading\u2019s voice hardened. \u201CI don\u2019t think so.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe officer flinched. \u201CWe ordered them to stand down!\u201D he snapped. \u201CIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Hading Kerman, we are at war and those guards were impeding access to vital war materiel. As are you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWar materiel? High grade nuclear waste is not, and never will be, war materiel.\u201D Hading saw the look of surprise on the other\u2019s face. \u201COh, come on. Why else would you be here?\u00A0 It\u2019s hardly rocket science \u2013 and believe me, I know rocket scientists.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo end the war and bring peace for the Regionality I swore to defend.\u201D The officer\u2019s cheek twitched. \u201CTo salt the earth and keep us soldiers apart until wiser heads have time to prevail.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh, dear \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u2026 Hading\u2019s expression mingled horror and pity in equal amounts. \u201CIt won\u2019t work,\u201D he said quietly. \u201CDo you think we haven\u2019t been thinking about this ever since the war began? I won\u2019t insult your intelligence by insisting that you wouldn\u2019t get away with it, but the cold truth is that we simply don\u2019t have enough nuclear material here to make a difference. I can show you the calculations if you like?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNevertheless.\u201D A shadow passed behind the officer\u2019s eyes. \u201CThis war has taken too much \u2013 from me, from everyone. I cannot forego a chance to end it, no matter how small.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I cannot stand by and allow you to take that chance.\u201D Hading\u2019s voice was curiously gentle. \u201CI swore an oath too, you see.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWith respect, Mr Hading, I don\u2019t believe you have a lot of choice in the matter.\u201D The officer\u2019s cheek twitched again. \u201CCome now \u2013 under the circumstances, standing down can hardly be regarded as oath-breaking. In fact, I shall advise\u2026 whomever you swore that oath too, that you upheld it to the end. You have my word on this as an officer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHading shook his head. \u201CMy choice was made when I stood to face you.\u201D He jerked his chin at his hand clutching the edge of the reception desk, other hand still aiming his pistol squarely between the officer\u2019s eyes. \u201CUnder this desk, I\u2019m holding a button. If I let it go, it will trigger the emergency lockdown system.\u201D A very level pair of eyes stared at the officer. \u201CThat system was designed to permanently seal this facility, as a last line of defence in the event of a catastrophic nuclear accident.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bead of sweat trickled down Hading\u2019s cheek and dripped onto the desk. Silently, the officer watched it fall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTake your troops and go. I\u2019ll shut down this facility in good order and we\u2019ll all walk away alive. Please \u2013 just go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wonder if it\u2019s something in the air, or just the desert sun?\u201D Hading watched in disbelief as the other began to applaud. \u201CYour acting is very nearly as impressive as Mr Macbus\u2019s. But I fear I must call your bluff.\u201D An edge of steel cut through the whimsy. \u201CTake him down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstinctively, Hading\u2019s finger tightened around his pistol trigger but the officer was already in motion, diving under his shot. The tight knot of scientists and engineers by the door, clapped their hands over their ears against the deafening report. Hading threw himself to one side, one hand still clamped around the edge of the reception desk, yelling at his stunned colleagues as he fought to bring his weapon to bear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGet to the back door! Go \u2013 for Kerm\u2019s sake \u2013 GO!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother shot rang out. Hading\u2019s face contorted, nails scrabbling on the edge of the desk as he fought to keep his grip. A third shot crashed against his eardrums, punching a white-hot needle through his shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly his arm no longer seemed to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrying out in desperation, Hading collapsed to the floor, dragging his nerveless arm behind him. His fingers skated over the black button under the desk, twitched once and let go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteel shutters slammed down behind the crowd of researchers milling around the Site D emergency exit, making them jump. Wernher rushed over and zipped his security card through the lock. A baleful red light glowed back at him, accompanied by a harsh, metallic buzzing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh Kerm\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe walls shook to a series of heavy, echoing booms.

Jorely first \u2013 that exit hatch is heavy. Quickly now.\u201D He was answered by tremulant nods. Jorely made his way through the huddle and disappeared up the spiral steel staircase in the corner of the room. One by one, the others followed him, leaving Wernher standing alone by the shutters. He zipped his card through the lock again, and again the buzzer sounded harshly in his ears. With shaking fingers, he fumbled his security card back into his pocket and followed his colleagues up the stairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe climb seemed interminable, a never-ending spiral into stifling darkness, broken by the panting of his colleagues and the slap-slap-slap of sandals on steel. Trickles of sand fell into his hair and the occasional pebble skittered off the steps and struck him, dislodged by a climber from further up. Wernher glanced down at the circle of dim light far below his feet, clenched his jaw and kept going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe screech of un-oiled bolts being drawn echoed down the stairs, making him wince. Hot white light spilled in, throwing jagged, moving shadows across the stairwell walls. The last of his colleagues vanished into the sunlight and Wernher followed, heaving himself up a short ladder and over the rim of the emergency exit shaft. Blinking, he climbed to his feet, brushing his hands against his poncho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entrance block to the main bunker stood on an island, surrounded by vast subsidence pits. The raw concrete and steel foundations of the crane and surrounding blockhouses stood exposed, revealed by the collapsing sands. Here and there, irregular patches of concrete could be seen at the bottom of the craters, vestiges of the much larger structures beneath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher sank to his knees amidst the devastation, tears scoured away by the pitiless desert sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the top floor of an unremarkable office building on the outskirts of the Capital, a kerbal sat at his desk, telephone in hand, staring out at the evening sky. He nodded in response to a particularly emphatic comment from the other end of the line and then froze at the sudden buzzing against his leg. Quietly, he stood up and removed the pager from his suit pocket, already turning to the small, and very private, telecopier in the corner of his office. With a soft purr, a sheet of paper emerged from a slot and dropped into the in-tray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWould you excuse me please. Madam President.

In the distance, in the centre of a ring of Blighted vegetation, stood the blackened ruins of what had once been a kermol village on the outskirts of Foxham. Yawning gaps in the skyline marked the sites of Kerm trees that had been uprooted and left to rot where they fell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, the mourners walked through into the next field, handed their stone to one of the black-clad villagers by the gate, and were ushered to their places by another sombre villager, dressed in a dark grey poncho. They stood in their hundreds, half-circles of hushed figures around a ring of stripped white poles erected in the exact centre of the field, a lectern set up in front of them. The occasional wails of the youngest kerblets were the only thing to break the silence, those standing by the parents of the distressed children only too glad to take a moment from their own thoughts and help to soothe the young ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last of mourners filtered through the gate, followed by the funeral officiant and a trio of pipers, each clad in traditional Kolan dress but carrying a set of Spierkan pipes, blowsticks raised to their lips. As the officiant made her way to the ring of poles, the pipers struck up the Lament for the Lost Explorer, its mournful notes skirling up the field ahead of her. She reached the ring of poles, paused at the lectern to steady herself, and turned to face the silent crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals. We are gathered here today to celebrate the lives and mourn the passing of all those taken from us by the war. They were kerbal, and as they came forth from their Groves so, in the presence of us all, shall they return.\u201D The officiant wetted her lips. \u201CToday, you have brought stones, each inscribed with the name of a loved one lost. We will use those stones to build a wall around these poles, and within those walls we will plant a garden. A garden of remembrance and contemplation. For even when the stones have crumbled to dust, the flowers will stand for those who fell. And so we shall remember them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe officiant\u2019s gaze swept over the rows of mourners. \u201CBut, for today, we shall observe the old ways, with music, stories, seeds and poles. So, I invite you all, good kerbals, to step forward if you wish and to share your memories. We would be honoured to hear your words.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand raised. \u201CI would speak.\u201D His companion raised his hand too. \u201CAnd I would speak also.\u201D They bent down to embrace the two kerblets standing beside them, before making their way to the front. Bowing to the officiant, they made their way to the lectern and leaned towards the microphones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy name is not important. But I am here today to remember the brave sailors of the Second Fleet. Most especially, I am here to remember the captain of the Shield of Kolus, who left me with two fine kerblets whom she\u2019ll never be coming home to again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I am here to remember my life partner, whom I left on Humilisia. A wonderful Keeper, who stood with his Grove to the very end.\u201D The speaker swallowed, looking out over the crowd through blurred eyes. \u201CG..good kerbals, we give you this song in all their memories. The words have been kindly printed on page twelve of your orders of service and if anyone would wish to join us, we would be honoured in turn.\u201D They waited until the rustle of paper faded away, before taking a deep breath, heads lifted high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COur flowers of Kolus - when will we see?\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour likes again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou fought and died for.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOur homes, our Groves, our friends.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou stood against all.

Then, one of the pipers picked up the tune with impeccable timing, the mournful skirl and drone of his pipes echoing across the field. Hesitantly at first, then in growing numbers, the mourners joined in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSo, we fought against them - and to our lasting shame.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe sent our brothers.

Remember the Shield.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy knocked on the laboratory door and went inside. He found Halsy at his workbench, bent over a length of open pipe, packed with earth. A collection of similar pipes lay on racks around the room, each closed over with a transparent lid and sprouting a bewildering array of sensors and soil probes from either end, all plugged into an electronics rack via the, seemingly traditional, tangle of multicoloured cables. The rack, in turn, was plugged into the back of Halsy\u2019s computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking more closely at the nearest pipe, Gusemy made out a swathe of bright green through the fogged transparent lid, interspersed with overgrowing patches of darker green. The handwritten label stuck to the side of the pipe sported an extensive set of Old Kerba botanical names, some of which he recognised as mosses and liverworts. He tapped Halsy on the shoulder. \u201CCome on. Time to go, if we\u2019re going to catch that train.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy straightened up, glancing at his computer display as he stripped off his gloves.\u00A0 Gusemy saw the resigned look on his face. \u201CStill no luck?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo.\u201D Halsy sighed. \u201CGive me a minute?\u201D He disappeared into his office, returning minutes later with his hair combed, dressed in loafers and a fresh poncho. \u201CWhere were we? Oh, right.\u201D He gestured at the racks. \u201CIt was a good idea of Erlin\u2019s but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s going to work.\u201D He followed Gusemy out of the laboratory, locking the door behind him. \u201CWe can get a reliable signal in the lab and Erlin is pretty sure that Obrinn would be able to interface with a field version, but the signal propagation velocities are hopeless. Even if we could run a pipe from here to Barkton, I can\u2019t see Obrinn and Elton having any sort of sensible conversation. It\u2019d be like trying to talk to you from Eeloo. Worse probably.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E bad?\u201D Gusemy walked out of the laboratory block and saw Mallas waving at him from the window of his car. \u201CHow consistent are those velocities?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot very,\u201D admitted Halsy. \u201CAnd we haven\u2019t had time to do any optimising but even if we pull off a hundred-fold improvement \u2013 which I don\u2019t see us doing \u2013 it won\u2019t be enough. Hi Mallas.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEvening, boss. Latest lot of speaking tubes going well, I take it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout as well as the rest of them.\u201D Halsy got into the back of the car. Gusemy threw Mallas an apologetic look and climbed in after him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a subdued start the drive out to Olbinat passed pleasantly, the conversation avoiding work, or the reason for their journey, by unspoken consent. They arrived at the railway station to find all but a handful of parking spaces taken and, Gusemy was pleased to see, their platform was crowded with passengers, many of them carrying cold boxes or with placards tucked under one arm. The train doors thumped open and they followed the flood of passengers aboard, as a raucous voice from the public address system announced that the express train to the Capital would shortly be departing from platform 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time they\u2019d made their way past the jostling throng of passengers all looking for their seats, Halsy\u2019s temper was beginning to fray. He stepped into their own compartment, staggered as the train lurched into motion, and dropped unceremoniously into the nearest seat. Scowling he watched Olbinat station slide past the window, as Gusemy and Mallas found their own seats, Mallas stowing his own cold box in the luggage rack first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s a bit busy isn\u2019t it? Do you think they\u2019re all going to the vigil?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hope so,\u201D Gusemy replied. \u201CIf tonight is big enough, I\u2019m minded to petition the Chief Ambassador to call for a Grand Conclave. Although that will require a quorum of Kolan ambassadors and support from a majority of the other Chief Ambassadors. Each of whom will need quorate support from their ambassadors.\u201D He sighed. \u201CSo, tonight really needs to be big enough to get the media involved, ideally without the Children of Kerbin or the neo-Kerman stirring things up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas snorted. \u201CYour average neo-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E won\u2019t have a clue, unless they took a radio to whichever Kerm free patch of wasteland they\u2019re holed up in. And if the Children turn up, the whole thing is off anyway so there\u2019s no sense worrying about them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know, I can\u2019t honestly blame the neo-Kerman, given everything that we\u2019ve learned \u2013 or relearned \u2013 about the Kerm.\u201D Gusemy\u2019s expression darkened. \u201CThe Children on the other hand\u2026\u201D He clenched his fists then slowly released them. \u201CAre why we\u2019re going to support the ceasefire tonight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas nodded. He watched the fields rolling past outside the carriage window for a while before speaking up again. \u201CIt\u2019s a crying shame that Erlin\u2019s idea looks like a non-starter. We could have the Kerm talk everything over between themselves and then tell us what they think about all of this. That could\u2019ve put the Children right back in their place.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy raised his eyebrows. \u201CAnd what would be do if it turns out that they agreed with the Children?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe they would but\u2026\u201D Mallas\u2019s voice trailed away. \u201CI guess that going neo-Kerman would get a lot more popular. Or we throw a lot more money at Starseed.\u201D He lifted his hands. \u201CIt\u2019s all academic anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually \u2013 it might not be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey turned to see a transfixed Halsy, staring back at them. \u201CMallas \u2013 do you still have those soil injectors lying around?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFrom the chemotaxis work? I didn\u2019t throw them out, so they\u2019ve got to be around somewhere.\u201D Mallas saw Gusemy\u2019s questioning look. \u201CBack in the early days of the Kerm crisis, we were trying to find a way of deflecting or blocking Kerm roots \u2013 or Kerm fibres. We tried everything we could think of, including injecting plant hormones into the soil to lure them away.\u201D He cocked his head at Halsy. \u201CWhat are you thinking?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m thinking that we strap an injector to the side of one of Erlin\u2019s gas samplers and hook them both up to a vacuum pump.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas frowned, turning the idea over in his head, then sat bolt upright. \u201CRun the pump efflux through a GC to get an output signal and use the input signal to pulse whatever we\u2019re running through the injector?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly! No need to use the whole GC either - too slow. Just use the FID; it\u2019s not like we\u2019re separating anything here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrue.\u201D Mallas chewed his lip. \u201CForget about strapping them together though \u2013 we\u2019d end up sucking back whatever we put into the soil. Have one effector node as the listening node and put the injector there, have another node as the talking node \u2013 which is where the sampler goes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201CThat would work! I was thinking we could put them both at a single node and split the input and output streams by chemokine type but your way would be easier!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo\u2026 no we still use multiple chemokines but use them to increase our bandwidth. Two would do to start with\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwo? Telegraph code?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep. We\u2019ll need to teach it to the Kerm first, of course.\u201D Mallas scratched his head. \u201CThat\u2019s after we teach them to read.\u201D He grinned. \u201CBut I know a young lady and her father who should be up for that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy stared at them both in bemusement. \u201CSay that all again. Slowly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe detect soil chemicals near one Kerm using one instrument. We transmit the output from that instrument, over the telephone network, to a second instrument, which releases the same chemicals into the soil near the second Kerm. Then we teach both Kerm telegraph code using microbursts of one chemical for a dot and microbursts of a second chemical for a dash.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd they can send messages to each other.\u201D Gusemy blinked. \u201CThat\u2019s\u2026 ingenious. But the logistics of setting it all up\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas glanced at his watch. \u201CPlenty of time till we get to the Capital. Don\u2019t know about you good kerbals, but I\u2019d prefer to spend the time figuring out some of those logistics than talking over the state of the world.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe others agreed and, by the time the train pulled up at the Capital, had roughed out Halsy\u2019s initial concept into the outlines of a plan that even Gusemy was beginning to be convinced by. Then they stepped onto the platform and put their nascent plan firmly to the back of their minds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals clad in dark ponchos cleared the platform in short order, ushering the passengers into queues, through the station turnstiles, and past long rows of temporary tables where they were patted down and their luggage was checked. Gusemy handed his bag over without comment, noting that everyone around him was willingly submitting to the inspections too. Two uniformed border guards stood watch behind the tables, one of them tensing up at a raised voice from another queue. Mallas turned to see the commotion, only to see the erstwhile complainer receiving a muted, but pointed, dressing down from his companion, who then apologised to the helpers at the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside the station, a line began to form. Placards were raised, some of them depicting a stylised grouping of sixteen sweetblossom poles. Others were painted with the international nuclear warning symbol behind the cross-and-hexagon signifying prohibition. Still others displayed a simple list of names, with Hading Kerman at the top of the list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last of the demonstrators from Olbinat emerged and the procession began to move; up the wide marble steps leading up from the station, before crossing the Boulevard, turning onto City Avenue and marching towards the Capital building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMourners and police lined the Avenue to watch the twilight procession pass by and sometimes to join them. The steady tramp of feet was the only sound to break the silence, the words and images emblazoned on the placards more eloquent than any chant or song. The marchers entered the park surrounding the Capital Building, past a squad of Capital Guards at the gates, before spreading out and finding a place in the great ring of figures surrounding the Capital Building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcross the park, Halsy saw a white banner planted by the nearest Council building, the stark \u201CDoren for the Ceasefire\u201D message across its top visible even in the gathering twilight. The regularity of the long column of script underneath, gave it away as a list of names. Halsy turned his head and saw another banner, its \u201CKolus for the Ceasefire\u201D message angled away from him but still legible. If anything, its column of text was even longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy retrieved a blanket from his bag and unrolled it over the grass. He, Halsy and Mallas sat down, the crowd a shadowy yet comforting mass around them. The first stars began to appear as twilight faded into night then, at some unseen signal, the pinpricks of light above were matched by a ring of lights around the Capital Building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe light swept towards them and then past them in a great wave, until the whole park seemed ablaze in candlelight, each flame in the darkness a silent plea to the watching Twelve Pillars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3620516\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 98\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3646887\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 100\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T15:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
