I\u0027d like to be able to control which mods are \u0027active\u0027 in one game over another. it changes up the experience. KSP2 has a menu option where you decide which mods are active in a game. Does anyone know if KSP1 can do that, or do I have to manually delete/add the mod folder on startup? For that matter, is there a \u0027mod selector\u0027 mod I can add?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UltraJohn","CreatedById":15008,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-14T13:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best option is probably to set up two individual instances of your game each with their own set of mods. You could do this by copy pasting your KSP folder and renaming it.

That way, you don\u0027t need to have everything twice.
