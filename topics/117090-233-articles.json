Instantly fixes power problems the moment it is unlocked for craft that you would be using at that stage in the career.  It might be small\u0027ish by station standards, but is more than overkill for any probes, landers, or general orbiters.  The larger stock panels are only ever needed (in stock) for running ion engines or science labs.\n\nI fully agree though -- the situation with the stock tech-tree is absurd in quite a few areas.  Power generation being one of the large ones -- there is no power generation available during the first half of the tech tree at all -- both solar and fuel cells are way further in the tree than they logically should be if following a true-to-history type of progression.  Some form of power generation needs to be available directly from the start... whether that is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar, or fuel cell, doesn\u0027t really matter.  This is even more important when playing early career mode with LS mods installed (as they also use/rely upon EC).\n\nPerhaps the progression for those parts needs to be re-examined from that perspective.  What are those parts used for?  Why is it beneficial to the player to lock them behind tech-tree unlocks?  What is gained by denying the player those parts for so long in career?\n\n1.) Is obvious -- used for power generation on early spacecraft so that you don\u0027t have to spam batteries and rely on throw-away spacecraft that are effectively dead when their batteries expire.  \n\n2.) No clue -- absolutely nothing beneficial is done for the player.  Forcing them to consider \u0027throw-away\u0027 spacecraft designs might be a possibility... but only if the rest of the stock battery/probe-core-ec-draw stats were balanced to allow for reasonable designs.  As is, in order to pack enough batteries for their mission duration, using stock probe cores, the probes must be mostly battery even for simple Mun missions, anything beyond Minmus is nearly impossible.  \n\n3.) Same as #2 -- nothing is gained by denying the player access to simple quality of life parts.\n\nAbout the only reason I can think to have the solar and fuel cells hidden halfway down the tech tree is to force the player to consider less-than-optimal designs, to make them happy when they are finally unlocked, and to delay specific parts of career progression until that point.  It should be player choice if they want to design an ultra-optimized \u0027throw-away\u0027 spacecraft that relies on just enough batteries for its mission, not something that is forced on them without the tools to do it right and without the balance in place to make it usable (e.g. mission-duration calculations for EC use, proper battery power density, proper probe-core EC use)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-15T16:55:29Z","Content":"The first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
