I\u0027ve balanced the COM and lift, and made sure thrust is centered as well on the fore/aft axis. \n\nHere\u0027s the trouble - I can get it up to 20k meters, at 600m/s and accelerating. From there, all it wants to do is flip around. The same on Re-entry. I have RCS installed on it, and up until then it flies very stable. I\u0027ve gotten it to orbit once (strapped to rockets, which defeats the purpose), and once in space it accelerates just fine as well. \n\nSo why, at between 40k and 20k meters, at speeds exceeding around 500m/s, does it want to just flip around?"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T06:07:33Z","Content":"I\u0027d have to see the plane to be able to help, but as you describe it, it\u0027s because it\u0027s tail heavy.

A good rule of thumb I use is to space them with about 5% of the length of the plane.\n\nFor more info, post a screenshot with CoL and CoM shown. I can help you further."},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T07:31:10Z","Content":"Sometimes the structure of the spaceplane generates too much lift at a certain angle.
