From there, all it wants to do is flip around. The same on Re-entry. I have RCS installed on it, and up until then it flies very stable. I\u0027ve gotten it to orbit once (strapped to rockets, which defeats the purpose), and once in space it accelerates just fine as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why, at between 40k and 20k meters, at speeds exceeding around 500m/s, does it want to just flip around?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T06:07:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d have to see the plane to be able to help, but as you describe it, it\u0027s because it\u0027s tail heavy.
