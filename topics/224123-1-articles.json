in what someone really thinks a challenge is.\u00A0 Are experienced players going to have an easier time of things in KSP2 than new players?\u00A0 You bet your booties.\u00A0 And that\u0027s because they already understand builds, launch windows, gravity turns, transfers, and all the good things that come from having played the previous game.\u00A0 They already get the physics part of it, which is a pretty decent learning curve.\u00A0 But that doesn\u0027t mean that there aren\u0027t challenges for experienced players.\u00A0 It just depends on what they did in KSP1, and what they expect out
