Then I gave it high thrust for a brief period and managed to lower my incoming speed greatly. The rocket swung back and forth. I managed to apply thrust at critical points and land on my landing gear at a pretty high speed. Probably around 50m per second. My landing gear consist of long structural beams that radiate out and down and are nearly as wide as the rocket is tall so the rocket bounced and settled down. I destroyed a few short segments of my landing gear but its still usable. Due to high gravity I was unable to exit the craft as I\u0027d never be able to climb back up and the jet pack isn\u0027t powerful enough to get me to the capsule. I found that out on a previous crash. I took off after awhile and I don\u0027t think there was any damage to the engine nozzles or the fins. However, the rocket flew bizarrely. I think the atmosphere is unusually thick because the rocket heated up really fast. I had to throttle down and I had a lot of trouble going in the direction that I wanted to go. The rocket kept swinging around. Is this caused by gravity from Jool? Jool is very close,\u00A0quite huge and moving. I managed to get out of the atmosphere and right away the rocket started to behave itself so i think the atmosphere and the game engine are to blame for all the bizarre behavior.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-06T14:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2019 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Chik Sneadlov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Escience\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space boy","CreatedById":200084,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-06T14:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223682659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188709\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221570366946\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268474\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chik Sneadlov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Chik Sneadlov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to land on Laythe and I\u0027m using the infinite fuel and electricity cheat.

So if you have a rocket that has lots of fins at the bottom then it wants to \u0022fall\u0022 nose first! (Or more scientifically phrased: the aerodynamic forces tend to turn it nose-first.) This is fine for lift-off when you want it to go nose-first, but not so good if you want to land bottom first. In theory you can counter-act the aerodynamic forces with enough control authority - e.g. from engine gimbaling, reaction-wheel torque, or even aerodynamic control surfaces (as long as they can rotate far enough to actually provide control) - but this is a bit like trying to drive a nail into a wall head-first. My suggestion would be to remove the all (or at least most) of the fins at the bottom of the rocket, add some high-drag devices at the top (like airbrakes as suggested by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/200084-space-boy/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022200084\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/200084-space-boy/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Space boy\u003C/a\u003E) and maybe change to engines with more gimbaling range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also suggest that you have a look at a tutorial about aircraft design, e.g.:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/47818-basic-aircraft-design-explained-simply-with-pictures/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I know that you don\u0027t want to design an airplane, but the physical realities are the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223682659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188709\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221570366946\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268474\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chik Sneadlov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Chik Sneadlov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut Space X has similar aerodynamics and they\u0027ve been landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at the Falcon 9 boosters, then you see that they don\u0027t have any fins at the bottom of the rocket, but do have grid fins (which provide high drag when unfolded) at the \u003Cstrong\u003Etop\u003C/strong\u003E of the booster.

Its my first time running with cheats and a rocket that has 0 fuel weight. With the mammoth engines it accelerates like crazy. Pulling like 29gs at times. I\u0027m pretty sure it would kill astronauts. No blood in the brain. The lower part of the rocket has also started to heat up badly even in deep space. In a vacuum. How can that be?

You have to know how to use them or do a lot of trial and error. That\u0027s what I did with the small wire frame beam. Tried to attach it to the side of an engine, but it doesn\u0027t let me. It attaches to the center of the engine. You can\u0027t stack this way. You have to stack vertically from the bottom of a fuel tank or a capsule and then you can break it off and attach it radially to a fuselage. Then you can magically bend all 8 of your assemblies, which is great but also not like anything in reality. You just bend these beams at 90 degrees and they stay welded together and incredibly strong.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a save before eeloo.

You can do the latter by adding high-drag devices that can be triggered like airbrakes of parachutes to the top of the rocket. Moving the center-of-mass can be done by selectively using up fuel or pumping it around. But getting this right on a rocket is quite hard because the center-of-lift that the editor shows is only close to the center-of-drag in typical airplane situations. (Where there are lots of lifting surfaces, in dense air, and at low-ish speeds.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion for you would be to leave out most or all of the fins. That will make your craft harder to control during ascent because it will not automatically point itself into the airstream, but it will also not automatically fight you when trying to go backwards during landing. It also helps a lot to not point too much away from prograde or retrograde (during landing) while in atmosphere. That way the turning moment of the aero-forces is small and you need less torque from engine gimbalig or reaction wheels to keep it pointed where you want to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chik Sneadlov","CreatedById":68474,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-07T16:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fiddled around with the ship back on earth. Took the fins and 3 radially mounted fuselage pieces off and tried it with fins near the top pointed down and again pointed up and finally just took off all the fins and put all the lights down under the rocket where the engines are attached. That worked the best, but if you come blazing in in reverse on kerbin and then you apply a lot of thrust to where you hover your computer will go nuts and pointing at retrograde won\u0027t mean pointing up, the rocket will tend to spin like a top and swing side to side like a pendulum.

I was going to make it very squat, but just putting on the science stuff and payload and it was already getting taller.

I noticed the ship constantly rocked, which is not realistic as it\u0027s on a tripod of landing gear and tripods do not rock. I thought I\u0027ll just move it a few feet and see if I can stop that rocking, but I was careless and oh, I lifted the landing gear thinking it wasn\u0027t necessary, but no.
