View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter seeing so many SSTO\u0027s and Mothership-launched spaceplanes, I figured I\u0027d give the old X-20 Dynasoar concept of a rocket-launched spaceplane some love. This design works admirably, it is now my go-to for delivering crews to interplanetary missions or stations in orbit. Yes, an SSTO would probably be easier/better, but at the time in my career run I didn\u0027t have Rapiers unlocked yet and this just...well...worked. Only mod present is Procedural Fairings for the interstage between the booster and spaceplane. I\u0027m working on an all-stock version in sandbox using structural panels as fairing sections...but I\u0027m just starting to get into the art of manipulating stock parts into semi-realistic looking large rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you guys think, I\u0027ll post a .craft after I do some last minute tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"milbournosphere","CreatedById":81059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T03:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the twin boom design. I\u0027ve been looking for a cool SSTO to move crew/experiments off of an interplanetary ship i\u0027m working on, I think I\u0027ll play around with your idea.
