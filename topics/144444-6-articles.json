In more detailed posts I have said much the same. heck, one of my first posts here said that I though science should be broken into 3 types, rocket science/engineering, medical/kerbal factors, and planetary/space science. The tech tree unlocking would then use a point system, but there would be 3 different point types, and different parts unlock with different combinations. The Mk 1-2 pod might take 100 rocket science points, and 50 medical, 10 planetary (engineering dominating, but with some crew factors and save science thrown in). Lander parts might include more planetary science, as might certain science instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds a bit overcomplicated. I think that could be done with experiments that are related to the next mission\u0027s objective/topic of the research (need to know what kind of conditions are present when at supersonic speeds to unlock the Whiplash engine example). The less resources there are to deal with the better. I like the idea, but science points are pretty ridiculus to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I would like to apologize to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E for bringing his attention here for no reason.

Progressing through it can be summed up as \u0022unlock more parts to allow you to do more fun stuff, which again allows you to unlock more parts.\u0022 At least conceptually, it seems to be a decent idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it seems like the problem many people have is that the tech tree starts out identically in every playthrough, and in practise you\u0027re hampered by the same limitations every single time. I can understand and share this frustration. Having to go deep into the tech tree to find parts you need for a varied play style means you can\u0027t have that variation until certain conditions are met.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I like the spirit of the beginning of the tech tree. You have a capsule, a parachute, and a rocket engine (with its own fuel, so you don\u0027t have to worry about that for your first flight). The first flight in Career is and should be a very short one, taking off from the launchpad, gaining altitude until your fuel runs out, after which you coast along on the velocity you gained (just observing this little detail is an important and effective introduction to mechanics). After a while, you stop going up and start going down. At the end of the flight, you activate the parachute to land safely, or realise you\u0027ve forgotten it and watch your rocket slam into the ground. You keep unlocking more parts until you can achieve a stable orbit, and from there you can set your sights on the other bodies in the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that conceptually, any tech tree or replacement solution should encourage a gameplay progression like that. Starting with ballistic, suborbital flights, progressing with more controllable flights higher up, and eventually letting you get into orbit. It represents the learning curve of new players, as well as that of real-life space agencies, so the basic jist of it should be kept in the game. I hope that opinion isn\u0027t too controversial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, some people dislike that you start by putting Kerbals in capsules and sending them away. Manned spaceflight took a while to develop in real life, after all. On the other hand, developing remote-controlled craft before manned craft is also not quite right. And in a game about Kerbals flying spaceships, you really ought to see the Kerbals from the get go (my suggestion to address this issue - having the Kerbal portrait screen show a Kerbal in Mission Control for unmanned flights - is off-topic, but I couldn\u0027t help but mention it here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, I think it is a good idea to have multiple starting points for the tech tree. You could start manned or unmanned, and keep picking strategies from there. Want to focus on satellites or go for the Mun? Will you develop heavier lifters or vacuum engines? Build a space station or better landers? I also think a \u0022tech web\u0022 should be considered, rather than a tree. I think I have an as-of-yet unmentioned suggestion here: \u003Cstrong\u003Ehave the same parts appear in multiple tech tree nodes\u003C/strong\u003E. That means starting with the \u0022Flea\u0022 regardless of what route you pick. Develop ladders as hand-holds for space stations or for planetary landers - or just to get back into aircraft after landing on Kerbin. Get your first probe core to assist manned flight, or have it from the beginning as an alternative to manned flight entirely. Drogue chutes to stop fighter planes or slow down probes during atmospheric descent.\u00A0 Developing 2.5 m fuel tanks separately because of focused research on fuel tanks, or alongside a 2.5 m engine because of focused research on a basic 2.5 m lifter? Unlocking a part in one node would remove its cost from other nodes with the same part. Maybe you would even find some nodes on the far side of the tree unlocking themselves as you get all their parts from other research paths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how to pay for new nodes... I think the Science system is decent enough, but it could be made clearer that you sell the fruits of your research, to get funding for other research projects. I\u0027m not sure if specialized experiments for specialized parts is the way to go. Then again, boiling it all down to Funds isn\u0027t that realistic either, so I\u0027m actually not sure either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I think some parts could feasibly be unlocked outside the tech tree. Upgrade the Tracking Station to get access to telescopes. Return surface samples from, say, Duna, to unlock a more efficient battery. Find all Monoliths (and/or the Kraken on Bop) to unlock the Kraken Drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, the gist of this post: Have multiple ways to progress through the tech tree. Have those multiple ways sometimes unlock the same parts, albeit in a different order. Your first flight should generally feature the same mission profile, with or without a Kerbal in the pilot seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
