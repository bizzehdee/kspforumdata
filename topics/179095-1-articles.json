As I have spent hours on just one ship for the story, and I will need some hyper-advanced looking craft in the near future (but at the rate I write it may still be several months!), I thought I would ask here, based on the overwhelming number of responses I got in my previous craft request thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will be credited in the chapter if you make a contribution, and \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E you can request a reference or cameo in the story, but I\u0027m not completely sure on that part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules/guidelines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAny amount of sci-fi is okay. In the story, there are several different alien species, although only a few are important. They are all at different levels of technological progression. Some have warp drives, some still use conventional or nuclear.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe aliens also come in many different shapes and sizes. Some may be tiny, some huge. In addition the homeworlds of these species are varied. All ship sizes are welcome unless it gets outrageous.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn general, the more sci-fi, the better.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMost of the ships should be peaceful ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut I need a few warships. These should be the most futuristic and ominous of all of the ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThese are aliens, not necessarily Kerbals, so mods are not only allowed, but encouraged.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUse as few stock parts as possible,\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0actually, now that I think about it.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EUse the most unique and futuristic looking mod parts you can find.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat being said, try to keep the part count relatively low.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThese craft do not have to function well if at all, their main purpose is to look good and maybe get blown up at some point. Sorry in advance for blowing them up!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf need be, especially with the super-high tech warships (the ones I need the most) you can handwave the propulsion systems and say they run on magic or something.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance for your help, this will take a long time if it\u0027s just me doing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-20T22:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223470953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179095\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539924713\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/19/2018 at 12:51 AM, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse as few stock parts as po\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Essible\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut I like my stock parts.......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres a scifi-ish ship to start off with.
