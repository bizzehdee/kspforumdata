TAC is more robust than my tool\u0027s resource capabilities, and is used to balance a ship\u0027s COM using fuel transfers (in flight COM management). It also supports multi part feeds to a single part, drawing from each source equally. Ship Manifest does not yet support multiple part resource transfers. I will not ever support COM balancing or many of the other features of TAC.
