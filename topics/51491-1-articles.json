My question is how would I go about making the cargo bays to be able to open and close using the action groups in the space plane hanger like the bays for B-9. Do I need to edit the part or is that plugin based would I need firesplitter to do that. And Id like to add this is just for my own use to help me build without the bay doors getting in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
