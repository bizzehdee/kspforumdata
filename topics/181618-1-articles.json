When, why and how did you start writing code or making\u00A0new parts for KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought KSP in early 2014. I had a NetBook at the time. It got so hot while playing I was a little worried. I looked around and found a few mods that could put a hard limit on FPS, but I didn\u0027t like them for some reason. I read the code, and found that limiting FPS was pretty easy. So I installed MonoDevelop (Debian Linux user here) and made my first working mod in an exhilarating short time. It was called FPSTool. It doesn\u0027t work anymore, because of GUI API changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany, many months later, I was watching a\u00A0GameplayReviewUK Pure Stock Replicas video on YouTube. Can\u0027t remember if it was a Lunokhod or Chang\u0027e replica, but the\u00A0lander had a rover on top and a movable ramp with stock hinges to roll the rover to the surface. It dawned on me that a simple rotating joint would have made the whole thing much easier to build. And the same rotating joint could be used for a lot of cool stuff. I was aware of Infernal Robotics, but I like to play with stock parts, and\u00A0IR seemed a little too much for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I asked:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9484249214\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/168129-a-modest-proposal-for-lightweight-robotics/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:223px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... and no one answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I remembered I already wrote a mod.

Like Snark, my primary motivation was to fix issues for myself but also to make the game easier for myself (I kind if suck at it) by changing parts specs and creating new parts. For instance I embedded things like tanks, batteries, MechJeb modules, small nuke reactors or Hydrogen cells, etc into landers to lower the parts count and make them more interesting, I made engines more powerful and more efficient or created new engines. Or, to avoid constant mining and ore hauling, I created a Space Dust resource which can be collected in-flight and I created parts to collect it and process into Hydrogen. Another reason I never released anything is that I reused parts from other mods since I don\u0027t know how to model in 3D.\u00A0 I moded games before for the same reasons.
