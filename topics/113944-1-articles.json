It was supposed to do this by bringing back the most valuable part of the rocket: the engines. Recovering payloads or cross-range were secondary goals. The rest of the vehicle, the spaceplane design, the infrastructure, the clumsy SRB design, the disposable tank, were only super-complex solutions to the sole problem of bringing back the engines. So, it achieved the goal of bringing back the engines, but it failed to do so economically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Russians knew that the US Shuttle made no sense economically, so they figured that there must have been another secret military reason for building it.
