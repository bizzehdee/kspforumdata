Developing an earlier smaller design would require more funding. Maybe it\u0027s the better way as you said but hard to decide. Landing techniques and technologies could be practiced on an unmanned mission. As far as I remember the Chinese are thinking about doing one before manned missions. In a space race environment I bet they would consider doing it the way you portrayed. The competition for the domination of lunar surface exploration is going to ramp up again soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
