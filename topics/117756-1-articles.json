I dont see problem in my pc (i5 4460, 8gb ram, radeon r9 280).\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T10:17:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E .. **every few sec it freezes for 0.1s** but it is so annoying like when alligning the orbit or specially building the ship. in stock KSP there was no such problems even on highest setting.

Look [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129339-Serious-answer-to-the-stutter-issue) for more on this.\n\nEither that or, as ColKlonk suggests, something is spamming the log. Have a look in said logfile, or pull it up in-game with the debug menu.\n\nA heap of exceptions in the log usually indicates that there\u0027s something up with a mod... and should be investigated further.

I\u0027ve seen similar reports about the ISRU (mining) parts where the ore tank randomly fills up after switching vessels.

Some mods do make the problem worse, however this does also happen in the stock game but there are a number of factors that affect how noticeable the effect is.

Also i was thinking about stuttering problem is with scansat, antena range (i doubt is mechjeb as it is constangtly runing normal.\n\nFor eva i will check again since there is one dll added with mod antena range, evamanager.dll or something and i think that added eva proppelant part as well EC so kerbal have EC in space (or is it KAS), i will investigate further but some mods really mess game up and without them, game is no so much fun :/\n\nthanks for fast response\n\nEDIT: i deleted EVA manager.dll (i get it with antena range and tought it was required) which i dont know how it enchances but deffinently destroys game. i delted Toadicious Tools so what it does if someone can explain, thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T18:45:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 06:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by phoda**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T22:59:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: i deleted EVA manager.dll (i get it with antena range and tought it was required) which i dont know how it enchances but deffinently destroys game. i delted Toadicious Tools so what it does if someone can explain, thanks.\n\nBoth are required for AntennaRange to function correctly.\nI\u0027d strongly suggest that you try removing MechJeb, even if just as a test...
