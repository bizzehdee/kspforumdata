If you didn\u0027t see [this post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121651-Starting-a-BIG-Orbit-Assembled-Jool-Mission), my friend and I started a huge mission to Jool. We are assembling a big ship in Kerbin orbit, which will visit every moon in the Jool system, and attempt to get basically all of its science points. It was a lot of work to plan!\n\nIn the first video we accidentally forgot to move a few supports we used to balance the ship. So, here\u0027s our correction in part 2. There\u0027s some pretty neat docking maneuvers with our trusty tug. And, we continue to make fun of each other ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ASxp81UXjw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou can visit our channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmAVWm58KaBuFdRa04KauXw).
