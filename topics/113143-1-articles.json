So, I finally decided to use Real Solar System 1.0.2 and it works perfectly, however after 2 failed attempts to get into orbit and an hour reading about RSS on the net (which ive found that what ive read is way too technical for me to understand) I really could do with a couple of questions answered in very simple (idiot proof) ways. BTW, I can get to other planets, land, return etc in the Kerbin system, so not a noob to the game, just RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, how much fuel do I need to get into a good position to set a manoeuvre node for orbit? I know on Kerbin it takes around 4550dv but when I launch from Earth, I get to about 200k, set the node then seem to run out of fuel using all stages of my rocket which is FASA\u0027s Apollo Nova. I have at least 2600m/s still to burn before I can get into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, once I understand how to get into orbit, is there a dV map for RSS? I have one for the Kerbin system but not in RSS. If not, can anyone recommend an \u0022easy to understand\u0022 way to calculate dV needed in RSS or do I have to learn what ive tried to read before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to sound like such a noob but the difference between stock and RSS seems huge but im loving even my failed 2 launches!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be awesome, however I\u0027m going to keep trying to achieve orbit even if it takes me weeks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo problem, everybody starts somewhere! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not using Realism Overhaul, or at least RF Stockalikes, you\u0027re going to have a bad time.
