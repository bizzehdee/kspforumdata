Lots of plants, little to no visiting cats, sometimes some bird-food, nearby trees.\n\u003E \n\u003E Do you haven any tips for luring them?\n\nI provide food throughout the year. Apart from that though, as long as the box is reasonably appropriate in its dimensions, I think there\u0027s a lot of luck involved.\n\nI consider myself very lucky to have a bird not just roost in the box literally the day after I put it up, but also raise a brood in it, especially since this was the first time I\u0027ve tried a nest box.\n\nI think the size of the hole is of quite significant importance, as if it\u0027s too big they consider it unsafe as larger birds would be able to gain access and a cat could even get its paw in there.\n\n25mm is recommended for blue tits, however I sanded mine out to 28mm which is recommended for great tits, being slightly larger birds, as I wanted to increase my chances.\n\nMy box\u0027s floor is 6x6 inches, which looks quite excessive at this stage, but once there are about 8 fully grown chicks in there it will surely be quite cramped.\n\nThe entrance is about 5 inches up from the floor, preventing cats from being able to reach down to the nest.\n\nI don\u0027t know if the birds pay this any attention, but it\u0027s a good idea anyway:\n\nI fitted that aluminium plate over the entrance which I got for a couple of pounds shipped from eBay. This prevents things like squirrels and crows from enlarging the entrance to gain access.\n\nI have heard stories of people having a variety of boxes up for year after year with no luck. I think Bill Oddie said he has yet to have a robin nest in one of the many robin boxes he has in his garden, despite his garden being, as you can imagine, quite a paradise for birds as far as food and safety is concerned.\n\nSo:\n\n- make sure the entrance is 25mm to 28mm in diameter and at least 5 inches up\n\n- make sure the floor is roomy enough for 8\u002B fully grown birds (they will be the same size as their parents a good while before leaving the nest)\n\n- place the box at a decent height above the ground (mine is about 3 meters up)\n\n- provide food whenever you can - I strongly recommend sunflower hearts, a variety of birds will go for them\n\nBut most importantly I think, just persist.\n\nMake sure you have it up in good time each year. I put mine up in January, but apparently they will start using them as early as Autumn.\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E By watching the cam, I have observed some things that school websites suggest pupils watch, no matter how gross. For example, why do the parents eat the fecal sacs? What do they do with the ones they don\u0027t eat? What else will they take away from the nest? (Egg number nine I am looking at you...)\n\nI always thought they took all of the fecal sacs out of the nest. I was very surprised to see them actually swallowing them in this case.\n\nI can guarantee that won\u0027t happen once the chicks are fully grown however, that would be far too much turd to ingest.\n\nThey are taken out of the nest and dropped, where within a fairly short space of time, the membrane casing dissolves.\n\nI am not sure if the final egg will be taken out or not.\n\nI think they will give it a bit more time anyway, just in case. Remember, that egg could have been laid up to 9 days later than the first one since she laid one per day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T16:42:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Winston**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:35:27Z","Content":"I have 2 families nesting currently in the birdhouses I\u0027ve put up.
