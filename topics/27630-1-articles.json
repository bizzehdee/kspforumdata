So I got to the Mun and landed there (after a few hiccups and redos because I wasn\u0027t happy with the landing accuracy) and then I returned to KSP... and nearly messed it all up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off I forgot to do a quicksave so it was a definite booboo. I remembered when I was in atmosphere and of course you can\u0027t save while you are in atmo. So it was slightly worrying. To make matters worse I was coming in with a ship with no lights and a night time landing. And I misjudged the ground. So I hit a bit hard. AND KERBOOOOOOOOOMMM... Loads of explosions. But My Kerbs survived somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the sun came up I saw this.... and went \u0022WOW!... lucky Kerbonauts there!\u0022.
