What I\u0027m trying to do is to recreate the Soyuz 4-Soyuz 5 mission and dock two Soyuz spacecrafts. The launch site is Baikonur while the orbit\u0027s inclination is 51.7\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo achieve orbit I\u0027m using MechJeb2 with Powered Explicit Guidance. When trying to launch the second spacecraft to the same plane as the first one I can get at minimum a 0.77\u00B0 of difference between the two, difference that requires to much delta-v to take care of (105m/s, the Soyuz only has 172m/s). What can I do to perform a precise rendezvous? I\u0027d prefer to not have to fly by hand as it seems extremely difficult. What about kOS?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-25T03:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, MechJeb can only do as good as 0.77 degrees... I can\u00A0get 0.1 degrees on occasion if I\u0027m lucky, but I usually do better than 0.7 (although the orbit\u0027s inclination is 27 instead of 51, so you have it harder). I\u0027d suggest (against your wishes, unfortunately) to try manually flying it at least once, it\u0027s just like a normal KSP rendezvous, but a bit bigger (and you don\u0027t usually do inclined rendezvous in normal KSP). If you have a tool (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E) that tells you your angle to the ascending or descending nodes, launch when it is at about 1-0.5\u00A0or so (right before it) and make corrections during ascent to make the nodes get as close to zero. That\u0027s the method I use, at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is another way. In vanilla KSP, we\u0027re a bit spoiled, being able to have huge margins because of the small planet size. As a result, we fly with a certain degree of inaccuracy knowing we\u0027ll have fuel to fix it. In IRL this isn\u0027t really the case, most spacecraft margins are very low. So, in your case, if you really don\u0027t want to fly it manually, I\u0027d suggest clipping an extra fuel tank into the Soyuz spacecraft. It doesn\u0027t have to be huge, even a smallish tank could double your Delta-V. Although in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E I usually give my service modules at least 400m/s because I\u0027m a bad precision pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also a third solution. Split the plane change burn between both spacecraft so it\u0027s only 52m/s per spacecraft. That will leave 120m/s for rendezvous and return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, welcome to the forum! I hope you enjoy your stay!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-25T03:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not too fond of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E full-on autopiloting, hence have zero experience with how it behaves in recent versions.

It might take a few attempts to get it right, but that\u0027s only an hour or two of exercise. Programming your own autopilot will definitely take longer than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pand5461","CreatedById":172084,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-25T16:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like MechJeb\u0027s PEG is in essence the Apollo-level version, which can do only coarse plane matching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a thread on Space Shuttle PEG implementation in kOS here on forums:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4010962674\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142213-pegas-powered-explicit-guidance-ascent-system-devlog/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find download links there and give it a try with your rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
