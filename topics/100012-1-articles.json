I\u0027ve had an SSD for 2 years, which gets about 20-30GB written to it daily (system hibernate mostly), and shows no errors or signs of failure. Kerbal save files are rarely more than 10MB, and autosaves every 5 minutes lead to about 120MB per hour. Even at 24 hours per day, this is 2.8GB, and well within the drive\u0027s rewrite specification. Windows likely does more write activity with the swap file than KSP will in a typical day, but you\u0027d be a to \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have swap on SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople saying \u0022Oh, but SSDs wear out\u0022 is the equivalent of \u0022Oh, I bet your Ferrari needs a lot more fuel than my Tata Nano\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the answers, its good to know there is nothing to worry about \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may try it anyway next time, just to see if it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
