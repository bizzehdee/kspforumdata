When it landed it had no oxidizer left, about 100 units of liquid fuel for the jets, and I\u0027d depleted all the xenon and nearly all the RCS. Falling into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere from the outer edge of the SOI meant the plane came in with a ridiculous velocity; I\u0027m amazed it didn\u0027t tumble or anything on the way in. But Jeb landed successfully, so hooray for luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the course of that trip, I found a half-dozen things I wanted to tweak on the design, like how it oversteered at low speeds, or the need for a bit more xenon for its ion drives. (Sure, the burns take several hours to complete, but x4 physics acceleration means I can go watch a TV show and come back to find it nearly done. And a few thousand free delta-V is nothing to sneeze at.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I decided to do a major redesign. It\u0027s not done yet, but here\u0027s the preliminary design for the \u003Cstrong\u003ESleazy Weasel 5\u003C/strong\u003E (replacing the old 4b model), designed mainly for long-distance interplanetary travel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e1DuaJu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e1DuaJu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not ready for a full flight test yet, and bumping its weight up to 33 tons (from the old 27) might just be too much for having only 2 turbojets. But it gives me something fun to tweak for the foreseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T10:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt a Mun probe, in dire need of science, RT is holding my probe program at a short ranged leash. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas enough dV left for a hop to another crater, then I have enough to stick some needles into Duna and Eve - finally!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot overdoing it can keep you busy in career mode for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T14:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode - decided to try for a Tylo intercept with my Jool probe since I was out to it\u0027s orbit at apoapsis.
