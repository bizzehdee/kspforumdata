As the feature was in 0.9 and there still are ways to modify drag multiplier of the part on the go. Just like landing gear for example. And as in real life the front part of the intake might not contribute much to the drag, but overall the air inside the duct will surely make more drag than if it were just a pointy cone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again changing current drag values would mean increasing drag alot when they are open, and making it slightly more than a cone when closed.
