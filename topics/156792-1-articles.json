Skewness is a thing, and most of us could not afford to blow the amount required to buy a house, or send kids to college on a 15 minute joy ride, but we might spend even a few hundred dollars with a chance at a life-altering experience, particularly if we feel our own skill is somehow involved.\u00A0So I\u0027m fine with that. Selling it as a service (training, etc) might be legally required to avoid laws that prohibit private lotteries (anyone here a lawyer?). Still, unless the training is vastly more expensive than most of us could imagine (maybe it includes hours of flights in jet aircraft, or even a private \u0022vomit comet\u0022), it seems like they\u0027d need to replicate this enough times that the profit for the founder is less than we might assume from a quick look at the numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-21T20:04:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2017 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
