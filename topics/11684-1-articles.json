By my figures, that stack has a Delta-V of 4537 m/s. I don\\\u0027t know of anyone who\\\u0027s managed to reach orbit with this stack after adding a parachute. Adding the chute lowers the Delta-V of the stack to 4291 m/s. Presumably this is an indication that the limits of what is possible is somewhere between 4291 m/s and 4537 m/s? I\\\u0027d be interested to be proven wrong on this one. \n\nAlso, DayBlur posted in the [Mini-challenge: max altitude with this supplied spacecraft](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7161.msg200548#msg200548) that he was working on calculating the optimal profile for an orbital launch. I\\\u0027m sure many of us are looking forward to reading his results."}]}
