By my figures, that stack has a Delta-V of 4537 m/s. I don\\\u0027t know of anyone who\\\u0027s managed to reach orbit with this stack after adding a parachute. Adding the chute lowers the Delta-V of the stack to 4291 m/s. Presumably this is an indication that the limits of what is possible is somewhere between 4291 m/s and 4537 m/s? I\\\u0027d be interested to be proven wrong on this one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, DayBlur posted in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7161.msg200548#msg200548\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMini-challenge: max altitude with this supplied spacecraft\u003C/a\u003E that he was working on calculating the optimal profile for an orbital launch.
