Or if you use RealChute, you can use fewer bigger ones. It also depends VERY MUCH on the altitude of your landing site. Duna\u0027s air is so thin that a difference of a few hundred to a thousand meters of ground height makes a huge difference. There are a few depressions on Duna that have altitudes of 0-1000m. However, about 80% of the surface is endless dune fields that average 2000-3000m. A lander chuted to land in a depression will splat out in the dunes so it\u0027s vital to design the thing for a specific landing zone and be sure you hit it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd hitting your LZ depends a lot on your descent profile. It\u0027s a lot easier to hit a specific point if you come down steeply, but that minimizes your passage through the air so your chutes have less time to work. OTOH, if you come in shallow, your chutes can do a lot better job for you, but then landing within 2-3km of your intended target is about the best you can hope for (although this is usually good enough unless you\u0027re trying to dock with something on the ground). Personally, I favor the low, shallow descent. Start from a 50km orbit, deorbit burn about 1/4 of an orbit away, and drop your trajectory about a finger\u0027s width east of your LZ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note: If you\u0027re using stock chutes on Duna, be SURE to tweak their values.
