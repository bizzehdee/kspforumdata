Could it be related to a memory thing, though? In 0.90 one I got ATM compressing files like crazy (around 1,300-1,500 mb in Task Manager on load) as well as in a near-stock 1.0 install, it isn\u0027t an issue. In 1.0 without ATM helping me and now pegging 2700-2,900 mb RAM in Task Manager (and Sentinel going off yellow every scene change), I\u0027m also losing my graphics and joystick axes settings after every game quit. It could also be related to plugging in the joystick (I play with the joystick on and off at times), but having the joystick config\u0027d wasn\u0027t an issue with the near-stock 1.0, or the ATM\u0027d 0.90 for that matter (though a few times in 0.90, I\u0027d lose the saved settings anyway, but not after every game quit, IIRC). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe they\u0027re not related (I can get that running a little heavy on the memory should have no effect on the setting configuration file at all), but I decided to share this (admittedly amateur and not well-considered) observation just in case.

Then you\u0027ll have to delete the settings file and replace it with that backup each time you want to start the game and then, in-game, you just rebind all the joystick stuff.
