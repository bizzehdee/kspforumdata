The game will start in fullscreen like it\u0027s supposed to, but after it finishes loading, the music will start playing (which I\u0027ve turned off), it asks me if I want to send data to Squad (or whatever that thing did), everything under Graphics is what it normally defaults to (and it will change to that if I click apply/accept), controls go back to default (though one time there was a situation where it was mostly intact and only a few joystick controls were not bound). Basically I would have to do the first-run setup every time I start the game.\n\nInitially I thought it might be caused by the settings file from 0.90.0, but after recreating those settings in 1.0.2 the problem didn\u0027t go away.\n\nI think it started when I switched to 1.0.2 from 1.0.\n\nMods installed: \\*sigh\\*\n\n(Semi)Saturable Reaction Wheels\n\nAction Groups Extended\n\nActions Everywhere\n\nAuto Action\n\nBahamutoD Animation Modules\n\nBanana for Scale - small\n\nCollision FX\n\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\nContract Window \u002B\n\nControl Lock\n\nDistant Object Enhancement (default config)\n\nDMagic Orbital Science\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\nEditor Extensions\n\nEVA Parachutes\n\nEVA Parachutes by default\n\nEVAManager\n\nFairing With Mass\n\nField Experience\n\nFinal Frontier\n\nFlight Manager for Reusable Stages [FMRS]\n\nHullcam VDS\n\nHyperedit\n\nIn-game notepad\n\nInfernal Robotics Model Rework - Core Pack\n\nInfernal Robotics Model Rework - Expansion Pack\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nKerbal Flight Indicators\n\nKerbal Inventory System\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nKerbal Renamer\n\nkOS: Scriptable Autopilot System\n\nKSP AVC\n\nMagic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics\n\nModule Manager 2.6.2\n\nNavball Docking Alignment Indicator\n\nPlane Mode\n\nPlanetShine (Default configuration)\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nRasterPropMonitor Core\n\nRealChute Parachute Systems\n\nScience Funding\n\nSensible Screenshot\n\nSequencer for Infernal Robotics\n\nStage Recovery\n\nTAC Life Support (stock config)\n\nTaurus HCV\n\nTextureReplacer\n\nThermometer\n\nToadicusTools\n\nToolbar\n\nTweakableEverything\n\nTweakScale\n\nUniversal Storage\n\nVanguard Technologies Core\n\nWaypoint Manager\n\nVessel Viewer\n\nAnd now for those not listed in CKAN:\n\nJDiminishingRTG\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nA tiny Module Manager config I made myself\n\nSmartParts\n\nStock Bug Fix Modules\n\nThat should be it.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStart KSP\n\nWait until it finishes loading\n\nHear music play\n\nGo to settings\n\nEverything is defaulted\n\nRage.\n\nLog:\n\n[output_log.txt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9jlrslxtjyvzggg/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nSettings file (the one I want to use), just in case:\n\n[settings.cfg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jsh373ep36vionq/settings.cfg?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterBennock","CreatedById":111444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:04:44Z","Content":"Yes, I have this issue too - since today.\n\nAt first I though it might have to do with some updates and newly installed mods, but even after uninstalling from Steam and reinstalling, it keeps happening - with a 100% vanilla install.\n\nEdit: System is Win7 x64.

In 0.90 one I got ATM compressing files like crazy (around 1,300-1,500 mb in Task Manager on load) as well as in a near-stock 1.0 install, it isn\u0027t an issue. In 1.0 without ATM helping me and now pegging 2700-2,900 mb RAM in Task Manager (and Sentinel going off yellow every scene change), I\u0027m also losing my graphics and joystick axes settings after every game quit. It could also be related to plugging in the joystick (I play with the joystick on and off at times), but having the joystick config\u0027d wasn\u0027t an issue with the near-stock 1.0, or the ATM\u0027d 0.90 for that matter (though a few times in 0.90, I\u0027d lose the saved settings anyway, but not after every game quit, IIRC). \n\nMaybe they\u0027re not related (I can get that running a little heavy on the memory should have no effect on the setting configuration file at all), but I decided to share this (admittedly amateur and not well-considered) observation just in case.
