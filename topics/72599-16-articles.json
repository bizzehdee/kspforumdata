It transcends time and space because it is able to pull on us to do things that we wouldn\u0027t normally do. It gives Cooper the will to survive and to save the Earth where he may otherwise have given up, losing his humanity like Damon\u0027s character did by relying on technology and reason and logic - the movie actively dispels ideas of faith in the \u003Cem\u003Esupernatural\u003C/em\u003E but not faith in \u003Cem\u003Eemotion.\u003C/em\u003E Notice how there\u0027s a load of religious symbolism about Damon\u0027s character and those missions (it\u0027s even called Lazarus - pretty blatant) - Damon is a sort of Christ-figure, sacrificing himself for the good of the world and then returning from the dead, but he is a false Christ-figure. People put faith in him and he fails them. Cooper and Murph treat the \u0027ghost\u0027 of the first act like something supernatural, but it ultimately has a non-supernatural explanation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also willing to bet that if you\u0027d watched it on a 70mm IMAX screen the first time you would have had a much more positive reaction to it. Seeing the raw, visceral power of the universe evoked on that scale, in that immense clarity, with Hans Zimmer\u0027s beautiful score in the background was probably the best cinematic experience of my life. Watching it on DVD at home was a disappointment. In IMAX it was probably a 9/10, on it\u0027s own 7.5/10, and that\u0027s boosted by the fact I\u0027m a space geek in general. To the average person probably a 7/10 would be reasonable. Certainly I don\u0027t think you could say it sucks. Considering the amount of thought and effort that went into it it\u0027s elevated above the majority of films made these days. You can read into it a huge amount. I think it definitely thinks that it\u0027s cleverer than it really is, and lacks the impact it tries to have in some places, but it isn\u0027t a \u003Cem\u003Ebad movie\u003C/em\u003E.

I have literally yet to see that whole scene, after at least two viewings of the movie. That just leaves the tesseract. Obviously the black hole in the movie is not a purely natural one. The film is not implying that black holes have tesseracts. Wormholes are very much not natural either, and are specifically stated to be artificial, and implied to be created by the 5D descendants of humankind. So just as a skyscraper is not something any reasonable space entity would think to find on Earth, the tesseract is built in the wormhole because the 5D descendants of humankind needed there to be one there. These beings can manipulate space, time, and gravity, for Kraken\u0027s sake!

Maybe the blackhole is counteracting the planet\u0027s gravity. Maybe, in non-curved spacetime, the gravity of the planet is ridiculously strong and the effect of the blackhole makes it bearable. That isn\u0027t a niggle for me. Put it down to artistic license if you must. The movie gets a whole lot less practical if they have to lug a Saturn V around them. It would probably have been better just to have them SSTO in the first place, but that\u0027s less dramatic.

What does that mean? It\u0027s part of the setting. The setting is that people have neglected space travel. One of the messages of the movie is STOP NEGLECTING SPACE TRAVEL IT\u0027S IMPORTANT.

She\u0027s trying to convince them. Doesn\u0027t mean she\u0027s right or the movie thinks she\u0027s right. As I pointed out before, the movie\u0027s message is overall against faith in the supernatural, but pro faith in emotion. Just because following emotions is ultimately the correct route it doesn\u0027t mean that the movie is saying that love is a transcendental force.
