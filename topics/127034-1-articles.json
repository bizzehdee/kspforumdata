If there are one or two \u0022M\u0022s in the bottom left try pressing the \u0022R\u0022 key to switch back to radial symmetry. Also, I think radial symmetry won\u0027t work on parts that were attached in mirror mode, it will always default back to mirror symmetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: NVM I just reread and saw that it is affecting craft files that were previously saved with appropriate symmetry.
