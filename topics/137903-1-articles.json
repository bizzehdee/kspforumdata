There are crew inside, but they don\u0027t show in the cutaway. I can\u0027t figure out how to shut off the cutaway view and restore the crew portraits. I also can\u0027t seem to find the in-game manual. Don\u0027t snark, please.

Apparently that cutaway was also the crew. I clicked on the hatch and had Valentina exit the capsule.
