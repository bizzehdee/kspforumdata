I mean, I think that option is \u0022Navball always hidden\u0022 or something. Anyway, the default is to hate yourself or always have it hidden or whatever, but you can toggle that to visible and be good from then on out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T21:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my only complaint about 1.2 so far - incredibly annoying default setting that you can\u0027t change without going back to the main menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad I found this post, however, because it was driving me up the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal101","CreatedById":157058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T22:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222800529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476307587\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n..because it was driving me up the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts getting crowded near that wall, just saying. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
