But if you wanna know what that language says to me, is that there was an exception, as explained by Thunder, but it was technically caught. The program probably just instructed it\u0027s runtime that it needed to close. This is basically just a debugging feature, A generic error handler that encompasses the entire program and is there really to just provide some kind of error reporting (such as dumping to a log file) before closing out. When there\u0027s an error unaccounted for in a program it\u0027s almost always better to close it out than to try and plough ahead without knowing what kind of state it\u0027s actually in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T04:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/app/236850/discussions/0/622954747290788623/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/app/236850/discussions/0/622954747290788623/\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T08:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHe preferred to ask here, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recently upgraded to Win10 and have problems i want run rapier windows or make clean install maybe that would help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to make a bootable windows 10 USB drive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you shouldn\u0027t need to do a clean install.
