An exception is a problem that comes from the program that can be caused by a TON of different things. an \u0022Unhandled\u0022 exception is an exception that the programmers didn\u0027t foresee could happen.\n\nvery simple example in vb.net:\n\nyou do a simple program that asks you for two numbers, X and Y, and will display the result of the following operation: x/y.\n\nIf you enter x:10 and y:0, and you don\u0027t do something to handle this, you will get an unhandled exception. More precisely a \u0022Divided by 0 error\u0022. As the programmer you have 2 options to handle this. option1: do something like this:\n\n    If y \u003C\u003E 0 Then  msgBox(x/y)Else  msgBox(\u0022The value of y cannot be Zero(0)\u0022)End If\n\noption2: let the division run but catch any exception:\n\n    Try  msgBox(x/y)Catch(ex as Exception)  msgbox(ex.message)End Try\n\nThat\u0027s more than you were asking but that gives you an idea of what can cause those problems. Thats just one example, there are thousands of reasons why an exception can happen. Its basically errors that makes your program unable to continue to run.\n\nThere are usually not much you can do about it, other than try it again and hope you don\u0027t get the error again. in the case of my example, just dont try to use 0 for y lol. in the case of a real program, it gets way more complex, there may be hundreds or thousands of variables in the program, and those exceptions might occur only when a bunch of those variables get in a very precise state. I\u0027m trying not to get into too much useless details here, but yeah. Those are mostly out of your control...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T20:01:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thunder\\_86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T23:29:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In case you haven\u0027t noticed it, there\u0027s a search engine out there called \u0027Google\u0027 that answers this kind of question much faster.![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHe preferred to ask here, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that."},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:52:17Z","Content":"Yeah, searching Google is a better option if you want to find a solution for your problem, as it pertains to a very specific example (Europa Universalis 4). But if you wanna know what that language says to me, is that there was an exception, as explained by Thunder, but it was technically caught. The program probably just instructed it\u0027s runtime that it needed to close. This is basically just a debugging feature, A generic error handler that encompasses the entire program and is there really to just provide some kind of error reporting (such as dumping to a log file) before closing out. When there\u0027s an error unaccounted for in a program it\u0027s almost always better to close it out than to try and plough ahead without knowing what kind of state it\u0027s actually in."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T04:28:41Z","Content":"[https://steamcommunity.com/app/236850/discussions/0/622954747290788623/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/236850/discussions/0/622954747290788623/)"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T08:18:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E He preferred to ask here, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that.\n\nFair enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:10:39Z","Content":"I recently upgraded to Win10 and have problems i want run rapier windows or make clean install maybe that would help"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:20:06Z","Content":"You need to make a bootable windows 10 USB drive. \n\nBut you shouldn\u0027t need to do a clean install.

We still try to catch everything we can think of, but when we do get an unhandled exception, it actually gets handled by the application which logs as much info as we can before we crash the program. We also automatically receive the exception message along with the stack trace by email in the IT mailbox so we get EVERY error that was return by our application, from all 4 of our locations.
