modding isn\u0027t easy, and people tend to enjoy the results. \u00A0If someone else wants to contribute to your mod, or hell, take it over it you\u0027re unable to continue developing it,\u00A0be happy that someone enjoys your mod so much their willing to contribute their time to it\u0027s development. \u00A0If you see forks of your mod running about and you\u0027re intent to centralize your mod for compatibility\u0027s\u00A0sake (basically what i did when KopernicusTech was around), figure out\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EWHY\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0people are forking and having multiple versions. \u00A0Kopernicus\u0027s reason was because the planetary configuration was in one file which belonged to the mod (System.cfg). \u00A0This sparked the idea to fully support (and require) ModuleManager, which enabled multiple independent planet packs to peacefully coexist in one installation. \u00A0I went around to the most popular planet packs whose developers would open a dialog with me about supporting module manager, and also consolidated all the Kopernicus forks when the PQS modding system was completed. \u00A0From what I could tell at the time, none of the developers were upset at this, and it made Kopernicus just that much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR - we\u0027re all supposed to be doing this for fun. \u00A0Be happy someone enjoyed your work so much as to contribute to it or attempt to continue to improve it when you\u0027re unable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this is a very relevant article in this scenario -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/forking.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/forking.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-18T22:27:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2016 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Teknoman117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kenobi McCormick","CreatedById":57254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T05:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I were a mod creator I would encourage it, hell, I may roll that patch into the official thing.
