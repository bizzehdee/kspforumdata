It\u0027s possible for certain mathematically ideal starting conditions (particular alignment of the magnet\u0027s field and a perfectly circular orbit), but the one case I know of is unstable and I suspect the other options are worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big difference between this and a gravitational or electrostatic orbit is the fact that magnetic dipole fields fall off as 1/r\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, not 1/r\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, and the force on a dipole is not proportional to the field strength. Two permanent dipoles (think two fridge magnets) will exert a force on each other proportional to 1/r\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E. A magnetic, but not permanently magnetized, object (think a little iron ball near a permanent magnet) feels a force that falls off even faster -- 1/r\u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003E if you approximate its magnetization as linear in the external field. That force also depends on how the magnetic moment is aligned relative to the external field -- it\u0027s attractive if they\u0027re parallel, repulsive if they\u0027re antiparallel, and zero if they\u0027re perpendicular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if we take the simplest version of this situation -- two permanent magnets, aligned so as to produce maximum attraction (and zero torque), starting in a perfectly circular orbit so the magnetic force provides the centripetal acceleration -- it falls apart as soon as you breathe on it. The perfectly circular orbit works, but the tiniest deviation from circularity causes the orbit\u0027s eccentricity to grow exponentially (it also quits being elliptical, so eccentricity is a crappy term to use, but whatever), until the periapsis goes low enough for a collision. That happens for any central force that falls off as 1/r\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E or faster, and we have 1/r\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/Newtonhtml/node45.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E a reasonable description of why if you\u0027re not afraid of calculus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more complicated versions, where the magnets don\u0027t stay at a fixed relative alignment, are probably unstable in more complicated ways. Rotation of the magnets comes into play, because they exert large torques on each other and can exchange spin angular momentum for orbital angular momentum, and now you have more degrees of freedom to worry about. Somebody with too much time on his hands could probably solve for a few example cases, but I\u0027m not that bored right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can\u0027t \u0022orbit\u0022 the magnetic field sideways, magnetic force will always follow the field\u0027s direction, so really, that\u0027s not possible because the magnetic force is not a force that just attracts the other body but it creates a field that can interact with the other one\u0027s field.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThat\u0027s not true.

A magnet that\u0027s aligned parallel to an external field will be attracted to regions where that field is stronger.

Now this is not a sphere, so unfortunately it doesn\u0027t completely answer your question, but it is an orbit that exists thanks to electromagnetic forces acting on the satellite by the parent body. The system is even experiencing zero g-forces thanks to it being in orbit. Orbits like this can exist (although they seem to be highly unstable) in a controlled environment. However, such an event would be nearly impossible to find in nature as gravity would quickly destroy the balance between momentum and the electromagnetic forces in the system and it would either end as a satellite guided by gravity, or a solid object bound together by electromagnetic forces.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, pretty neat video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T22:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Natsarugiy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Natsarugiy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks to the International Space Station and the curious astronauts on board, we have an example of magnetic orbits that you can watch by\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DM3VVkykbA0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.

Some similar physics applies, particularly since the attractive force is mostly due to the water droplet being polarized by the rod\u0027s electric field, which gives you 1/r\u003Csup\u003E\u0026gt;=3\u003C/sup\u003E behavior for the force (depending on whether it\u0027s near a uniformly-charged section of rod, or closer to the end or some other nonuniformity) and unstable orbits.
