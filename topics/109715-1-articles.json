Right now, catching an asteroid isn\u0027t a big deal. Yeah, you get science. But it\u0027s a lot of effort. If you decide not to catch the asteroid it will either fly past Kerbin, or impact it. Both of these things have the same consequences. If it flies past kerbin, you don\u0027t notice. If it impacts kerbin, you don\u0027t notice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWhat I\u0027d love to see is a consequence to Asteroids colliding with Kerbin.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A few contracts saying that the world is at stake and that an asteroid will hit kerbin would be great. The consequences could differ depending on their size/class. A class asteroids would just lower your funds and/or reputation. E classes would end your Career mode. If they collide, that is. Or even if there was some more love given to our neighboring space pebbles, such as Station contracts on an asteroid or landing an asteroid somewhere. I don\u0027t know how much of this is possible. That\u0027s why it\u0027s a request and not already made.
