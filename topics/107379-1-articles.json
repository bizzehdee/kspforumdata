(also the cost of upgrading can increase since theres a LOT of science spare) Other parts can have their functionality increase so solar arrays become more effective, batteries hold more power, mining and ISRU more efficient (wouldnt say more fuel in a tank though as stacking that with better engines might be a bit too much)\n\nan example of the diminishing returns in action:\n\n1=5%\n\n2=2.5%\n\n3=1.25%\n\n4=0.625%\n\n5=0.3125%\n\n6=0.15625%\n\n7=0.078125%\n\n8=0.0390625%\n\n9=0.01953125%\n\n10=0.009765625%\n\n=9.990234375% for 10 upgrades. Not game breaking and I might be wrong but because the value always halves I dont think you can actually reach \u002B10% bonus, just fractionally closer each time.\n\nI think that would be a good representation of improvements to technology through scientific discovery as a 300isp engine being improved to 330 isnt a huge leap.\n\nAnyone think this is a good idea and can anyone implement it?"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:22:30Z","Content":"I really like the idea of being able to spend science this way, but instead of doing it on a part-by-part basis (which seems a bit tedious), I think it\u0027d be better to implement a separate tree that contains nodes which can be researched multiple times. For example, one node might be \u0022LFO Efficiency\u0022 which would represent your increasing ISP you mentioned above, except it would affect all LFO-based engines equally. Successive researches would increase in cost nonlinearly while benefits would be diminishing. The same approach could be applied to anything: \u0022Energy Dense Electrics\u0022 could increase electric charge storage capacity of anything that can store EC. \u0022High Temperature Aerodynamics\u0022 could increase max temps of wings/tanks... and so forth."},{"CreatedByName":"PeterCFB","CreatedById":117634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:06:18Z","Content":"I just fielded the basic idea. If anyone wishes to refine and implement it in their own way, its all thumbs up. I\u0027d just like more late game things to drive towards and a reason to keep doing the science besides a \u0022gotta catch em all\u0022 mindset.\n\nI suggested part by part because it would give you more things to individually purchase just because of the sheer glut of science available and having uber pricey nodes would seem unbalanced vs the cost of purchasing form the regular tech tree\n\nHeck this could be made to play nice with other mods like life support.. more efficient converters and energy dense foodstuffs to make food last longer etc..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:11:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PeterCFB**\n  \nrealised was just rewording prev post"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:23:19Z","Content":"I\u0027ve always wanted to break into modding... maybe this will be my thing.
