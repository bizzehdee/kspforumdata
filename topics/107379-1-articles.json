(also the cost of upgrading can increase since theres a LOT of science spare) Other parts can have their functionality increase so solar arrays become more effective, batteries hold more power, mining and ISRU more efficient (wouldnt say more fuel in a tank though as stacking that with better engines might be a bit too much)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ean example of the diminishing returns in action:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1=5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2=2.5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3=1.25%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4=0.625%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5=0.3125%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6=0.15625%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7=0.078125%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8=0.0390625%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9=0.01953125%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10=0.009765625%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=9.990234375% for 10 upgrades.

For example, one node might be \u0022LFO Efficiency\u0022 which would represent your increasing ISP you mentioned above, except it would affect all LFO-based engines equally. Successive researches would increase in cost nonlinearly while benefits would be diminishing. The same approach could be applied to anything: \u0022Energy Dense Electrics\u0022 could increase electric charge storage capacity of anything that can store EC. \u0022High Temperature Aerodynamics\u0022 could increase max temps of wings/tanks... and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterCFB","CreatedById":117634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just fielded the basic idea.
