Unfortunately, I live in a fairly light polluted part of the world. Spotting anything beyond planets, some moons and bright stars is out of the question.

Mind you, still inhabited, but enough to see the bright band of the galaxy with the naked eye. Opportunities like that should provide a fair shot at seeing the slightly dimmer objects in our sky. Until now, I have had little luck though. I have a fairly accurate chart and am able to pinpoint the exact spot the objects should be, know what the objects should roughly look like, what shape they are and how they are oriented and the skies are clear. Downsides are the lack of any real scope (just very simple binoculars) and a very slightly hazy atmosphere. No matter how hard I look at the spots I know the objects to be, nothing definitive seems to resolve into an object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are good tips and tricks to finally spot the elusive objects? Obviously, waiting for new moon and finding a spot locally with the least light are both a good start.
