Unfortunately, I live in a fairly light polluted part of the world. Spotting anything beyond planets, some moons and bright stars is out of the question. For a long time I have been wishing and attempting to view objects like Andromeda M31, but it is not to be.\n\nLuckily, I sometimes travel to parts of the world that are much less bright. Mind you, still inhabited, but enough to see the bright band of the galaxy with the naked eye. Opportunities like that should provide a fair shot at seeing the slightly dimmer objects in our sky. Until now, I have had little luck though. I have a fairly accurate chart and am able to pinpoint the exact spot the objects should be, know what the objects should roughly look like, what shape they are and how they are oriented and the skies are clear. Downsides are the lack of any real scope (just very simple binoculars) and a very slightly hazy atmosphere. No matter how hard I look at the spots I know the objects to be, nothing definitive seems to resolve into an object.\n\nWhat are good tips and tricks to finally spot the elusive objects? Obviously, waiting for new moon and finding a spot locally with the least light are both a good start. Bringing the best optical device you have, knowing where to look and starting with the brightest objects out there are additional plusses. What other tips and tricks are there to be employed?"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:44:06Z","Content":"I life in a big city, and with binoculars I can just make out M31.

A tripod, a monopod, even an upturned broom will help.

This is a big one. General light-pollution you can put up with but if you\u0027ve got a streetlamp or a lighted window shining on you it\u0027s going to really spoil your night vision.
