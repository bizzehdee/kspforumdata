Its more than just the mask texture -- you also have to setup your diffuse and specular textures properly, as well as split the AO off into its own separate texture.\n\nIn short:  probably more work than most people would want to invest; and that is just the texturing end.  There is also a ton of plugin code needed to make it all work (load shaders, assign shaders to models, handle persistence of data, GUI code), as well as the corresponding configs to define all of that stuff (texture files, model and mesh names, etc).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-06T16:42:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2017 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T19:26:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looks like I\u0027m a couple 100 miles north of the path; so I might get a partial eclipse?\n\u003E \n\nSounds like you\u0027re in the same boat as me.

Didn\u0027t think things at work could become worse than they were a month ago, but somehow, somewhere, someone discovered a way to make it so.\n\nBut, I\u0027m also still working on SSTU when I can.  This week I have finished off the initial recoloring textures (masks, diff/spec rework) for the SC-A (Soyuz) parts.  Also made up a new emissive shader that can be used for the pod windows and such, so as to not lose the window glow animations (due to the differences in texturing, I couldn\u0027t use the stock emissive shaders).  Have a bit of config work to do to enable the recoloring for those parts, but that is relatively minor compared to the texture updates.  Really hoping I can put the wraps on these over the next day or two and push out an updated release over the weekend.  (Will also be several other bug-fixes in this release, will be noted in the change log when available)\n\nUpper-stage SRBs sadly have not made any progress recently; still some modeling/texturing work that needs to be done, as well as potentially a bit more code-side work to clean up/finish as well.\n\nAdditional SC pods have been delayed indefinitely, until I can sort through the scaling/sizing issues on the parts.  Some are obvious/easy to work on (Mercury, Dragon, VA to some extent; might continue on those sooner), others are much more problematic (Gemini).  I intend to return to working on these as soon as my schedule at work becomes less insane and I have time (and brain power) to think through the problems.  \n\nAlso, I have made a couple fixes in KSPWheel (KerbalFoundries) code this week that should clean up several \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E compatibility problems.
