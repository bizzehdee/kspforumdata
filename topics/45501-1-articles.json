Thus, there is no real poverty on Kerbin. Sure, some kerbals can afford shinier trinkets but all of them can feed, house and clothe themselves. Once you take the basic necessities out, that means you don\u0027t need to earn as much and what you do earn can be spent on non-essential stuff. If you\u0027re not earning as much, you don\u0027t need to work long hours, which means that you have more spare time to work on projects for the sheer heck of it.
