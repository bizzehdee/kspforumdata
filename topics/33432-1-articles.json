If you set a known circular orbit, say 100Km. Then at a certain point above the ground, looking at features, do a burn to set your trajectory a certain distance east of KSC.

You can deorbit whenever over KSC and just fly back. Landing right on the runway is a bit hard though. ( not if u have a real well built plane ) What I did was I set a marker like capi said. I took it a little farther though. I used 3 small rovers. Because not only did I want to see where KSC was from orbit I want to see which way the runway is facing as I descend. So I park one probe at the beach lined up with the runway. Then the second is parked out past the runway about a 100 meters. And finally the last rover is parked way out west about the length of the runway. So now I have 3 evenly spaced markers I can see from orbit drawing a straight line right over the runway. Best thing I\u0027ve done to help me fly home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for anything else its trial and error. If your looking down on the north pole and KSC is at 6 o clock I start my deorbit burn at about 8 o clock. I usually shoot for a 100km orbit so I set the nodes trajectory in the center of that sea past KSC to account for drag and planet rotation. Now this is where the skill comes in. The best thing you can hope for is a hole in one after your deorbit burn. I have yet to accomplish that. I usually put small radial engines on so that I can adjust as I\u0027m coming in. I tend to under shoot KSC alot. So I have to make a last minute burn to get me closer. Don\u0027t under estimate drag. If you\u0027ve already burned through rentry and your skeptical if your gonna overshoot into the water.. your not. Horizontal velocity gets scrubbed off very quick. Especially if you pull your parachutes. Which in case if you know for a fact that your gonna over shoot you can pull them early to kill your velocity and start falling down straight. I try to not open my chutes until a few thousand meters and let the air kill my speed. Best landing I\u0027ve managed was right at the end of the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is cool because I was just talking how it\u0027d be great to have some sort of building to bring the landers too that actually \u0022completes the mission\u0022 Menu music plays, awards, medals, hurrah! Lol...instead of just manually ending the mission and role playing. I already have a nice truck/crane that runs out and brings my landers back. Be cool to make a VTOL to pick them up out of the water in case of a splash down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-17T18:54:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2013 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T01:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is the thread that was mentioned above with the charts and such.
