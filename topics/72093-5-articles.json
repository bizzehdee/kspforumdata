As long as you don\u0027t try to take too much payload at once with a single tractor medium (\u0027light\u0027 as was) it\u0027s quite capable of ferrying all the other things anywhere in the system; just dock extra fuel to it. The old \u0027medium\u0027 carried so much engine mass for its extra thrust and was so time-consuming to assemble in orbit that I pretty soon stopped using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what you mean about sending Cartographers on a one-way trip too. The satellites never worried me as I knew they were doing a job but it always seemed wrong somehow to deliberately crash the transfer vehicles when I\u0027d finished with them. Such waste is the impetus for fully-reusable vehicles in the last chapters :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve avoided the claw because I think anything that\u0027s intended to refuel should have a docking port - see SciSat and Science Module in the new Chapter 6. Simply stabbing them with the claw always seems a bit vicious so I only use it for asteroids and, to be honest, there just doesn\u0027t seem to be a logical place for such a one-time mission in the flow of the campaign. Personally, I think the rendezvous requirements are harder than for interplanetary too, so it\u0027s somewhat beyond the scope of this as a tutorial. In the early drafts I toyed with making a \u0027Cartographer Jewel\u0027 to deliver satellites to all Jool\u0027s moons in one go but that got quite large compared to the other vehicles in the early chapters and suffered from the same one-time drawback. Of course, the same could be said for the Tylo and Laythe landers here but I think it\u0027s safe to assume someone will want to land several times, in different biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T16:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a breath; sometimes it\u0027s hard to remember to breathe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes a document downloaded (and presumably read) by tens of thousands of people, including 2 who were specifically proof-reading it, can still contain the most embarrassing errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case I\u0027d messed-up the distinction between breath/breathe, as above and only spotted it a week or so ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other changes are minor typographical ones and not nearly as cringe-worthy.
