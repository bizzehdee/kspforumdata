Lets just examine this.

This comes out to about 1.3 E 36/8E32 per passing per square meter at 200,000 m/s. Or about 1600 hydrogen per 200,000 cubic meters outside the earths magnetic field. 1/40th of a hydrogen per cubic meter. Thus means you need how much volume behind the drive to generate thrust. 1E-26 moles of gas per meter, sometimes as high as 1E -21 sometimes lower depending on the direction of the plasma in space. Lets take the higher number,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6x-6 /1E-21 you would need a volume of space 1E15 cubic meters in size to achieve the acceleration. What is the minimum radius of that volume? 130 kilometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is my prediction if the Cannae drive is working off of electron resonance generated by the electron cavity to produce a 5 micronnewton of thrust it would have to be, on average resonating electron out 100km in deflection path that is a million kilometers in an orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy prediction is that in space, the thrust production saturates very quickly, in the nanonewton-micronewton range with rather low power utiliization. On the bright side it will not need alot of panels, because utilization is comparably low and blowing out parts will also not be a probem, and so lightweight designs will be useful, but instead of being able to make Hohmann transfers it will have to spiral to its destinations over years. Will likely not be able to break low earth orbit. I should point out that resonant electron orbitals have no confined range, they can act over great distances, but the probability that they can act over great distances diminishes with distance in most situations that im aware of. A bigger lighter-weight cavity, a lower wavelength and we might be able to magnify the distances, but at what cost to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, lower is the enemy here. They can in a graphene sheet act over a near infinite range, but given no dimensional facilitation for such a cavity resonator outside the cavity, the distance of interaction is probably going to be a small multiple of the wavelength and the shape of the cavity. An electron travelling through such an open expanse of space may find no atoms to interact and return back with most of its departure energy intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-31T17:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2016 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T12:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully it\u0027s not forbidden to dream.
