The light blue dots close to the centre of the galaxy are supposed to be Neutron Stars - which could be explored or even mined to collect super-dense materials to research in career mode. The green rings around the galaxy are the orbits of Rogue Planets - i.e, planets without a parent star. These, if implemented, could be quite interesting, and along with neutron stars, could potentially be mined for new, advanced materials for research. Procedurally-generated wormholes could appear occasionally in the galaxy also - I\u0027m thinking gateways across the galaxy to make pan-galactic travel easier, and possibly (with a sufficient tech level) even be modified to create portals to other stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this is nowhere near official, and the devs may have something entirely different in mind to my model, but this is how I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E a possible galaxy would work.
