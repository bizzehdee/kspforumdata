The greatest Mission planners created grueling competitions, and a cut throat review board ready to ensure only the most worthy off all Kerbals was selected. All of which was promptly dispensed with when Cerly Kerman from Accounts Payable, getting herself a cup of water at the fountain, mentioned that all current pilots were on mission. \n\nWhat tragedy that such an undertaking could be lost simply because of so much other greatness in action. However all was not lost, for at that very moment a hero had arrived. Obler Kerman, resume in hand, standing between a fire extinguisher and the least imposing photo of a great kerbonaut spoke up asking a passing worker where the recruitment office was. \n\nAnd thus the mission could begin.........\n\n![3QV01UJl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3QV01UJl.jpg)\n\nObler: \u0022KSP control, this is Obler, I have seperation of Stage 1 Kickers beginning rotation for circularization\u0022 \n\nControl: \u0022Roger that Obler everything looks good from here\n\nObler: \u0022Oh by the way, those Kickback SRB\u0027s came pretty close to clipping my main engines when they separated did the seperatrons not fire?\u0022\n\nControl: \u0022Ummmm...yea....we had to remove those before launch turns out the engineers forgot about the weight limit on the crawler that delivers the craft to the launch pad.\u0022\n\nObler: \u0022Wait, the engineers didn\u0027t take that into account so you just ripped them off to make room! **with out even testing it**!\u0022\n\nControl: \u0022Roger that Obler let us know when you separate for transfer\u0022\n\n![gXVcxD7l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gXVcxD7l.jpg)\n\nObler: \u0022Beginning transfer burn, Might be a little lonely up here but at least you guys designed this with plenty of space.\u0022\n\nControl; \u0022Well initial plan was to have 14 kerbonauts but by the time we admitted we couldn\u0027t figure out how to get a return vessel to handle that many, the main rover was already built.\u0022\n\nObler: \u0022Exactly how much of this actual mission isn\u0027t how it was initially designed?\u0022 \n\nControl \u0022Roger that Obler, let us no when you start your capture burn at Duna.

Macvin won the last poker night and would like to get some survey sats deployed in that orbit, and they don\u0027t have enough fuel to make that big of a correction themselves\u0022\n\nObler: \u0022Is my mission plan being dictated by the outcome of a POKER GAME!\u0022\n\nControl: \u0022Roger that Obler, keep us updated\u0022\n\n***To be continued***"},{"CreatedByName":"aleis","CreatedById":62823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T21:57:57Z","Content":"**Space Bus Duna Rover.....2** continues\n\n![pY6Emx6l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pY6Emx6l.jpg)\n\nObler: \u0022Control this is Obler, Separation from transfer stage and decent to the surface is proceeding smoothly.
