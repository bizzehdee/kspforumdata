I\u0027ve been creating monsters all night and I have an issue. I\u0027m trying to attach a spaceplane a made to a rocket I created in the VAB. I haven\u0027t figured how to do this yet. I\u0027ve tried importing or merging both from either the VAB or the SPH and they just will not attach. I\u0027ve tried using sub assemblies as well. Perhaps I\u0027m just using subs incorrectly. Anyone have instructions on how to do this? Thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:27:05Z","Content":"when you want to use subassemblies make the attachment node the root part, drag it into subassemblies and \u0027import\u0027 it to your other craft.

Use the Root tool to set that tank as the root part (click on any part, then the desired root part) and grab the entrie plane without the root part. Save it to subassemblies. Go to the VAB and load your rocket, grab the subassembly and attach.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNinja\u0027d"}]}
