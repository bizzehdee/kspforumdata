Sometimes the burn time it gives you is totally wrong and I have no idea where it actually gets these times from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, I just did a TMI transfer. I used my engine to burn around Kerbin, and when I got to the Mun, I set up a maneuver node to circularize. The time it gave me said 1m and something seconds. However, when I started the burn the time rapidly dropped to 20-something seconds, simply because at the very end of my maneuver around Kerbin, I had throttled down the engine to make final adjustments. As such, the maneuver node around the Mun figured I was going to, I don\u0027t know, thrust at minimumal power to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature is nearly useless as-is since the times are completely unpredictable. There is no capability to adjust the times to consider 100% power without obviously altering your current orbit and wasting fuel (via throttling up and pressing X). I\u0027d rather have *NO* consideration for less-than-100%-power-burns and have it totally reliable for 100% power, than I would to have it currently have very little practical use due to sheer uncertainty in the method of calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T09:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that one\u0027s annoying.
