Why do all of my planes turn to the left while going down the runway when it\u0027s built perfectly symmetrical. and right as they start to get lift they they all try and roll clockwise. I\u0027ve tryed with different engine type with and with out vertical tail fins in case they had a \u0022Lift\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T09:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the landing gear vertical?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Pics? craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T09:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll planes do it...
