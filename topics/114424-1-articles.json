It appears that I\u0027m running out of memory but I reduce the running software to reasonable minimums (no browser running, no email client, unnecessary TSRs stopped, etc.). The error occurs regardless. The game has been removed and reinstalled and I\u0027ve tried playing without and with ATM Aggressive and Basic in attempts to reduce the memory load. They don\u0027t seem to help at all but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d see a difference.\n\nThis is a fascinating game and I really enjoy it but the crashes are annoying and will prevent me from trying longer missions in fear of losing valuable progress (I don\u0027t have *that* much free time!). I recently played it on another computer (Windows 7 64-bit, 16GB RAM) and it *never* crashed after 30 hours of gameplay over several days. I\u0027d upgrade to 64-bit and add memory (not just for this game ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) but I\u0027ve seen posts that suggest 64-bit KSP isn\u0027t stable. Do I run 32-bit KSP on a Win 7 64-bit?\n\nI was hoping that 1.0.x versions were going to solve this. I keep hoping.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"gerishnakov","CreatedById":147128,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T23:55:00Z","Content":"I have this exact same problem.

The stock game has all its texture converted to DDS already.
