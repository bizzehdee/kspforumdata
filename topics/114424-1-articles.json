It appears that I\u0027m running out of memory but I reduce the running software to reasonable minimums (no browser running, no email client, unnecessary TSRs stopped, etc.). The error occurs regardless. The game has been removed and reinstalled and I\u0027ve tried playing without and with ATM Aggressive and Basic in attempts to reduce the memory load. They don\u0027t seem to help at all but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d see a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fascinating game and I really enjoy it but the crashes are annoying and will prevent me from trying longer missions in fear of losing valuable progress (I don\u0027t have \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E much free time!).
