But due to the lightweightedness of the parts in the Probodobodyne parts mod, it makes this thing extremely easy to maneuver around. So if I want to point it at Mun then as long as it is visible to the scope I can point that way. What I was thinking of when I built and launched this is that I wanted to have a satallite that could maintain a visual on anything that I wanted launch into space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
