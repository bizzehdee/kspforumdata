Lower a cable from a station in geosynchronous orbit and anchor the cable on the ground. This means being able to build the anchor, too. Now add elevator cars at the bottom and ride up to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf we can get new buildings on other planets could I make a railgun that fires cargo into orbit?

Even a small one. I\u0027d build the pieces on a planet with really low escape velocity and fire them into orbit, timed so they\u0027re evenly spaced. Once they\u0027re all up they\u0027d connect with grappling hooks of some kind. Space tape on a rope. I\u0027d put the ring around the equator and spin it the opposite direction of the planet to cancel out variations in the planet\u0027s magnetic field. Of course it would be visible from the planet surface after that. A few thousand launches, easy enough for a dedicated team with a shared save file. They\u0027d have to link up within minutes of each other or things would get really interesting. There\u0027d need to be a real-time clock, too, so I could work out at what time to launch so each piece gets in the right \u0022parking space\u0022 for the link up. The same cable technology for the space elevator could be used in orbit. (Kerbin Maps will go ape**** over dat realtime feed. So will the Kernspiracy theorists and the KBI. The ring project will pay for itself by selling satellite service and cheap GSM phone service. The Kerbin children will hear \u0022long distance call\u0022 and think it means \u0022to Duna\u0022. Exploring THAT new world would be interesting.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnce I\u0027ve built a ring in orbit, can I add the existing planetary buildings on the ring itself, and then build vehicles of almost arbitrary size? Maybe even a vehicle with the other buildings stuck on it\u0027s hull. Then I could send it to another solar system and establish a base. For that I might need a x1000000 fast forward. You know, only for vehicles at least 5*10^11km from Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn the subject of mining, when can I mine the asteroids? I\u0027m looking to develop a gated community in high Dres orbit and I need to hollow a chunk of rock about 6km across. I don\u0027t want to put down a pump on the surface and suck out minerals - always hated that magical resource generation in RTS games. I want to carve it to look like the Death Star. I may even put engines on it later and move it around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo make the dough to pay for all this I\u0027ll probably need to float collection machines into a gas giant and \u0022mine\u0022 it for rare chemicals.

Proper base building will probably come in a later update, but it is likely to be the kind where you haul components from Kerbin. RTS style base construction on other planets would be for DLC at best, I would think, because it takes the game a long way from its present focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Not possible due to the 2.5km physics limit. Even if you had something strong enough to support its own weight over hundreds of km, the game would need a new sort of \u0027on rails\u0027 modelling for objects connected to the elevator cable that were further than 2.5km from your current position. Also space elevators, once built, rather trivialise the business of getting into orbit and that\u0027s a very big part of the game, so I think it is unlikely to be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. This probably won\u0027t be added as stock either, for many of the same reasons. A modded one might well be possible though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Definitely not with the current engine. The scale of even the smallest planetary ring would be far FAR beyond the current physics and part-count limits of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I can however imagine a day when Squad might add a stock, hard-code ringworld, possibly with optional base construction facilities. Since nothing has ever been hinted at in this regard, it wouldn\u0027t happen for a long time yet though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The current engine doesn\u0027t support terraforming and the scale of the game isn\u0027t really compatible with what you want to do. Even with Minecraft ease of mining it would take a ridiculous amount of time to shape an asteroid. Flying one is completely impractical. See the Scott Manley video where he talks about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. This will almost certainly be possible as soon as resource mining is implemented. Version 0.21?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. This could very well be part of a dedicated base building update but it isn\u0027t possible right now and nothing has been announced. You could probably build an unpressurised dome from stock parts now though. And since kerbals don\u0027t take their helmets off even on Kerbin, and never run out of air, who\u0027s going to know?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T08:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany of these things aren\u0027t just impossible for the engine to run, but arguably impossible or ridiculously impractical in real life, too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a Vsauce video that discusses what would happen if you put a ring around a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T10:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a game about the current and near future levels of technology.
