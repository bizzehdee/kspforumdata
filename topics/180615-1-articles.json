I have the latest update 1.5.1\u00A0and currently running into the game crashing while in loading screens from buildings to launch pad or back out or loading a quicksave, etc...My PC is running Windows 10 with the latest updates, GTX 970 with latest updates, 16GB memory DDR4 2133MHz, i7 5930K 3.5GHz\u00A06 core processor etc...I recently updated my BIOS and audio for my ASUS X99-A/USB 3.1 motherboard. My temperatures are all stable and\u00A0games such as PUBG, play just fine. This game runs smoothly however, it keeps crashing when trying to load to the launch pad or switching between buildings. I\u0027ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, including deleting the actual folder. I do not play with any mods and have not downloaded any previously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen some forums suggesting running 64bit due to memory limitations which I have verified I am running 64bit. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a hardware or system issue. The game seems to have a problematic history. Just curious if anyone is having similar problems and had an easy fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T00:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoilerAviator13","CreatedById":194018,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T12:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the output log if needed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ovn65wn1kcke1z/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9ovn65wn1kcke1z/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is the error log if that\u0027s what you really need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/smhx9guiijr1x8c/error.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/smhx9guiijr1x8c/error.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T13:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see anything in the logs that imply there is a problem with the game.
