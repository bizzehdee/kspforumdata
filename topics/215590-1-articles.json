And all these crafts are distinguished by the feature that they are all covered with heat-protective tiles in reality. I propose to add in the game to all wings, control surfaces and fuselages (yes, there are many of them, I agree), the ability to add the texture of heat-shielding tiles. To make the shuttles look even more cool! Moreover, we cannot know in advance what kind of fantasy the players will come up with. Will it be a copy of Starship Elon Musk or Dream Chaser? Therefore, the tile textures should be of three types: only the lower part of the wing, only the upper part of the wing and ... completely covering the wing from all sides. The same goes for the fuselages. Tiles only on one half of the fuselage, on the other and full coverage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes... maybe the fuel tanks need to add this feature too.
