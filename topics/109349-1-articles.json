Unfortunately there is no way to work around this in stock, because it will always reset them on scene changes, loading, etc... So even if you edited the .craft file, it will still revert the action groups.\n\nIf you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons, I\u0027ve recently added this to my stock bug fixes.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Uzric","CreatedById":102098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:52:21Z","Content":"Yea, it\u0027s actually a real hassle for me. I wanted to make an alien-like atmospheric ship without wings, only using the airbrakes for everything and I couldn\u0027t because of this bug.\n\nThen Claw saves the day. Again.\n\nThank you Claw."}]}
