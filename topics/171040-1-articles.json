Used to really be involved in these forums, kinda miss those days. any way, I want to get my old save back up and running, I saved my save on my desktop and deleted the game, and now im re installing. I also made a copy of the 15 mods i was using, stuff like mechjeb, and some graphical enhancements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan of action is to reinstall the game (just did), paste my old save in the saves file of game, install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E, and one by one install the old mods. I want to make sure ships that have the mechjeb module on them dont get broken. will I be okay just putting in the newest mechjeb and other mods and not have issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks guys, looking forward to being back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-19T09:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, the best way is to just try it. Even if the copy of your savegame in the new install ends up losing vessels, you still have the original savegame, so you can always restore where you were until you find the mod that is the culprit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod changelogs are also a useful thing to read.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-20T04:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarning that some of the old mods might no longer be supported and thus causing your old saves to not load correctly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
