Overheating in an ISRU is linked to the part\u0027s heat, but not in a way you would expect. This is the behaviour as it appears to me:\n\n- When the temperature goes above 500K, the ISRU is throttled down until the temperature goes below 500K.\n- When the temperature goes below 475K, the ISRU is throttled up until the temperature goes above 475K.\n- How fast the throttle moves depends on how low the throttle is, i.e. it moves exponentially. If it\u0027s running at 1% efficiency, it will take about 50x as long to reach 2% as it would from 50% to 51%.\n- The \u0022overheat\u0022 display is nothing but 100% minus the real throttle value. So really 100% overheat means the throttle is at 0.\n- During timewarp, the temperature can overshoot by a long way before the converter can throttle down. If you\u0027re timewarping, the temperature could hit 510K before the throttle kicks in, in which case it will take some time to cool down to below 500K, and the converter will be throttling down exponentially the entire time, even though the converter is cooling.\n- \u0022Nerv\u0022 engines tend to produce temperatures significantly above 500K, so firing them can heat any nearby ISRU units to the point where they begin throttling down, thinking they\u0027re overworked, even though they\u0027re not processing any ore.\n- Due to the nature of the exponential throttling, the longer it spends unnecessarily throttling down, the slower it will throttle back up.\n- Due to the nature of the floating-point math used, there is a certain point where the throttle becomes so low that rounding errors take over, and it becomes stuck at a very very small value, and it can\u0027t throttle back up.\n\nIf you\u0027re not a geek and don\u0027t care about all that, basically all you need to know is to avoid overheating these units for extended periods of time. Using \u0022Nerv\u0022 engines to do long burns is a good way to make sure you won\u0027t be able to process any ore when you arrive at your destination."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:29:38Z","Content":"My ISRU was reaching over 99% (but less than 100%) overheating in a couple of seconds though.

One possible workaround (use at your own risk, I haven\u0027t tried it) is to open your save file in a text editor and find the ISRU part that\u0027s overheating. Each ISRU \u0022MODULE\u0022 section should have a setting called \u0022heat throttle\u0022 (I forget the exact label). Change this value to 1 on all the modules.

I can run the ISRU as well but only if Ore tanks are empty and the ISRU is sucking off the drills directly, if there is excess ore the ISRU goes to fast and overheats to 100%.
