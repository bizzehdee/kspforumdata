For the thermal generators, the lower your radiator temperature, the more efficient the generator will be (heat engine efficiency gets better as the high temperature gets higher and the low temperature gets lower- the radiators are the low temperature, and the reactor temperature is the high temperature). Solar panels aren\u0027t thermal generators, though; they don\u0027t care how hot your radiators are. As long as your WasteHeat is below the 95% or so level at which you start to have problems, you\u0027re fine.\u003Cp\u003EIf the text on the Thermal Helper is green, that means that the heat generation on your vessel is less than the maximum heat that can be radiated from the radiators currently mounted on your ship, and thus you will never reach dangerous levels of overheating. For generators this will apply everywhere (their max power output is their max power output), for solar panels the heat (and power) they generate increases as you get closer to Kerbol- a ship with a single tiny radiator that would never overheat in Kerbin orbit might have problems if you put it on a sundiver trajectory. You can adjust the distance from Kerbol in the Thermal Helper to see if you\u0027ve got enough radiators on your solar-powered ship; the default distance is Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not diving down real close to Kerbol, a single tiny radial radiator is going to be enough for all but the most absurd arrays of solar panels (as you\u0027ve noted, the maximum dissipation from that single radiator is enough for more than 900 EC/s worth of solar power). They just don\u0027t generate enough heat to really notice, because their power levels are so low compared to the thermal reactors. Fusion or antimatter reactors, now, those need lots of radiators, especially if you don\u0027t have the upgrade that lets you run said radiators at the higher maximum temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell i guess knowing that if the text is green it\u0027s ok will be enough.

The only other factor you need to consider is the generator efficiency number on the thermal helper. This only matters if you\u0027re using a nuclear reactor of some sort with a generator attached. If that\u0027s what you\u0027re using, then you should know that the generators are modeled after thermal generators in the real world, so their efficiency is related to the difference between the reactor\u0027s core temperature and the radiator\u0027s temperature. If your reactor\u0027s core is 1677K and your radiators are at 1600K then the difference is very small so your generator will produce very little power. You can increase their efficiency by adding more radiators... the extra radiators will dissipate more heat so they will not get as hot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice this only really matters for unupgraded fission reactors. As soon as you start upgrading them the reactor temperature will be way hotter than your radiators so you\u0027ll always get decent efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can ignore the generator thing if you\u0027re just using solar panels or the radiothermal generators thingy. 10 EC/s is 10 KW/s which is 0.01 MW. The tiniest \u0022small radial radiator\u0022 will do 0.013MW each before they\u0027re upgraded.

It might be the NaN errors from other resources rearing its ugly head because it\u0027s a KSPI part, unless WaveFunction has fiddled with something that might explain the problem. I bring it up because the problems we\u0027ve seen prior with NaN values didn\u0027t seem to stem from ORS, but from KSPI\u0027s code, as it was previously mentioned in the thread (as far as I\u0027m aware anyway) as appearing in reactor fuel values.
