I can open the sub menu fine but when i press MMB nothing happened. I looked further into this and found that the MMB on my mouse is somehow linked to the left control button when I tried to bind MMB to another key. This only happens in KSP though, on my browser or my desktop it works normally. Any information about how to fix this problem will be greatly appreciated.
