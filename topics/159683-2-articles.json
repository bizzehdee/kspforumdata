LV cost, crew vehicle cost (all 3 designed to be reused though, so you only use a fraction of the total uses), plus module cost (which might be able to come down to a couple hundred million, say, perhaps cheaper). We\u0027re still likely cheaper than a single shuttle launch by a wide margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the argument about astronaut launch cadence is a good one, but assuming we have someplace to go to, cheaper access can only make that better, right? (obviously you need someplace to go to).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSticking on an arm (assuming one is needed) is not really all that difficult, it\u0027s not like they would be inventing it from scratch, it\u0027s fairly mature at this point, and telepresence is improving constantly. The big shame would really be deorbiting something that useful.\u00A0Remember the bar for this discussion in some ways is \u0022can you do the same thing for under 1.2 billion $ for that particular mission?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGO back to the original STS concept. What if we actually built a crew vehicle for space? A tug, and that has the RMA on it, and an airlock, etc? At some point, we need orbital refueling (the Chinese just tested that on their station, BTW), so the tug gets refueled when the crew is delivered to it (capsule docks with tug, tug and capsule do work, capsule returns to Earth).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-01T22:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223041659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493676534\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no doubt that one could manage to find a way to keep a small crew in Dragon or CST for a week or so, just like the old days (Apollo, Gemini, etc.).
