I humbly suggest either \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- separating the categories, with practical, reusable single-piece SSTOs in one and exotic unrestricted multistage designs in the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- adding additional restrictions to all spaceplane designs (i.e. must be able to achieve orbit with the payload missing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think as long as being multistage means you\u0027re inherently throwing away parts (since spent stage recovery is impossible without mods), I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a big problem that you\u0027re making clever use of the payload as structure. It would be a much more complicated and difficult to adjudicate challenge that considered how many tons or what cost was recoverable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering the cockpit as \u0022payload\u0022 is more of a thorny issue, because in my mind, \u0022payload\u0022 implies some degree of arbitrary-ness, where you can specify a size, shape and mass of the payload, but not that the front 1/5th of the payload must be a particular cockpit, or else the launch doesn\u0027t work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the cockpit counts, why bother separating the engines from the front half of the \u0022payload?\u0022 It\u0027s all mass in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any great suggestions, but thankfully this group doesn\u0027t seem too inclined to rules-lawyering. As a spectator, I\u0027d be perfectly happy seeing a short note next to any entry that might have a counterintuitive idea of payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still going to read all about more than the current winning entry, because the intermediate ones are often a lot more approachable and instructive than the ones where I couldn\u0027t fly the right profile even if I understood it. The new drag and mach dynamics are still mostly a mystery to me, and it\u0027s often easier to figure out what\u0027s going on with the less clever or optimized entries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei","CreatedById":139058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T10:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdded another great entry of yours to the leaderboard, tewpie.\u003Cp\u003EYou raise an interesting point.

But, I\u0027m definitely against requiring enough fuel for landing as part of the scoring flight - minimizing that sounds like a very boring game of 69km aerobraking passes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor defining \u0022reusability\u0022, I think being able to *land* from orbit without a payload more closely tracks practicallity - an exposed payload design could still be useful for stocking fuel depots or with payload fairings, and I\u0027d certainly expect them to fly less well without a payload, but as long as they don\u0027t disintigrate or incinerate on reentry it could still be used. Reusability with only refueling is too strict for planes - recovering and rebuilding is easy on Kerbin, and jets hardly work anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about rockets, maybe SSTO and multi-stage are more interesting as separate challenges there.
