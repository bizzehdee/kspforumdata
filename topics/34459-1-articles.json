As long as the thrust vectro is aligned so that it points through the centre of mass you\u0027re fine. What does matter is the positioning of the centre of life. This needs to be behind the centre of mass for the plane to be stable, however too far behind and you\u0027ll have difficulty controllign the plane and it may have a tendency to nose down. Essentially you want your centre of life to be just behind your centre of mass, and your thrust vector to point through your centre of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T17:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Storm1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Storm1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am not new to KSP but I need to ask this question.
