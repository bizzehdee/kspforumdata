As I said before, the science points you can get from a probe compared to a manned mission makes probes almost useless right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas of your own?

A probe is much lighter than a manned ship, and no provision to return it must be made to protect your reputation; probes will have a longer reach than manned craft at the same cost, or be much cheaper for the same reach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the transmission rates low and limiting surface samples to EVA kerbals gives incentives to follow up probe missions with manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while I agree that more usefulness for probes would be a good thing, I want to see how 0.24\u0027s economics affect their use before buffing them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T02:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just \u003Cem\u003Ereally want\u003C/em\u003E a camera part for probes.

You just get less science in one go, and there\u0027s something remaining for a follow-up mission, but you never ever loose any science by sending probes. I like current system because it encourages you to send a follow-up manned missions - only problem is that reasons to send unmanned mission are very sparse and now where costs will actually be a factor - there will be even fewer of them as the best way to do science will be by doing as much as possible in one go - and that can be achieved only with manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultraflight\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ultraflight\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.
