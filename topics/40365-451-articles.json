There are ways to mitigate this though; Mods like Active Texture Management will compress and help manage textures and can enable you to run lots and lots of modes, I run the aggressive version on my 32 bit game, the KSP folder is just at 4GBs, it loads over 1900 MM patches at start up, aside from taking forever to load it runs fantastically on my 3 year old laptop and I\u0027m sure there are people running way more stuff than me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey Akira, I want to thank you for responding to my question. I know its been roughly a week (I\u0027m terrible at keeping track of forum posts), I invested a lot of time researching potential causes of my game crashing and ultimately got it to work. Once I popped Active Texture Management in there, everything started up like a charm (after a lengthy load process of course) and have since added a number of other mods to enhance my gameplay. As a result, I\u0027ve been spending a lot of time playing and trying to master kerbonautics. Slowly but surely I\u0027ve progressed, at times with a very high risk of causing sudden traumatic hairloss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods I have added I ensured were compatible with .24 prior to booting up and those that did not specifically call-out the version, I tried to dig through comments to see if someone else asked and answered the question of compatibility. Lastly, the lengthy process of booting up the game with the new mod added (1 at a time) to make sure I know which mod broke what (if at all) and I have had no issues!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI purchased the game via steam and suspect it loaded the most up-to-date version of .24 but I\u0027m not entirely sure how to determine whether its 32 or 64 bit.
