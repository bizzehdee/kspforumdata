I cut my teeth on the demo and eventually bought the full game. Throughout this time I\u0027ve always played stock. I wanted to \u0022learn\u0022 the game and mechanics before adding anything extra to the game. Now, I did utilize some on-line \u0022helps\u0022, the parachute calculator and the interplanetary guide for example. Lately I\u0027d been finding myself getting frustrated by having to \u0022guess\u0022 so much on making my rockets. It was getting frustrating playing for a couple of hours only yo realize the mission you\u0027ve been on the whole time was always going to fail because I didn\u0027t have enough fuel (ie dV) to make it home again. So earlier this week I relented and installed not 1, but 2 mods for the game. Still trying to rationalize my decision as not having a direct impact on the game play. I installed Engineer Redux, and Kerbal Alarm Clock. I kept telling myself that they weren\u0027t changing the game, just giving me information I should have already had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already noticed a big difference running these mods. First and most noticeable, I\u0027m finally starting to build small. I\u0027ve always been afraid of not having enough fuel, enough thrust to finish a mission, so I\u0027ve tended to build big. With Engineer giving me the TWR and dV of my rockets as I build them, coupled with the excellent dV charts I\u0027ve started to strip down my builds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer has also helped me make my landing more efficient. I always wasted a lot of fuel coming down by slowing down too early. By placing a maneuver node on the surface set to basically zero out my velocity to show me the needed dV and estimated burn time, coupled with Engineer\u0027s terrain altitude and time to impact, I can better plan my landing burns to be later and use less fuel than before. By needing less fuel to land, I can build smaller landers. Smaller landers can be launched using smaller rockets. Or, smaller landers can be sent to farther places with my current rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can stop at just 2 right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, am I Doomed? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there cookies?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T12:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) you can probably hold out for quite a while, but I\u0027m afraid the lure of the darkside is strong.
