Oh wait, game pod, no \u0027fluff\u0027 or anything. No \u0027Titanium-A\u0027 shared by armor of supersoldiers and mecha. It happens to be a pod, weighing unknown units and made of unknown composition. Oh and that fuel?

I\u0027ve read the above posts, and while it seems like elitism to me; they do make great points. Sure, the fuel cannot be stored under compression in liquid form, but why would you store the fuel in liquid form? The only thing a liquid fuel engine requires is that the fuel be liquid before it gets to the engine, not that the fuel actually be stored in a liquid.\u003Cp\u003EAnother great point is the heat in space, or lack there of. What is the ambient temperature of space exactly? Because I\u0027m sure that too would increase the density of most liquids, even though liquids are technically \u0027compressible\u0027. You\u0027d still save... ~5% or something? Just a guess, but I remember from science classes that when a substance loses energy, its molecules stop repulsing each other as strongly; and hence would be \u0027compressed\u0027 to a definition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t claim to be a PHD in anything, I only have basic university level courses, everything else is still high school level; including math and science.
