The question is, doesn\u0027t splitting up your stuff into 16 different inventories end up as a usability nightmare? Especially if you can\u0027t even see them at the same time, once the containers are spread around some space station or base.

I like to slap them around interplanetary ships and space stations to represent supplies and such. Of course, I do use the contents practically as well, but you\u0027re right in that you\u0027d rarely need to bring up that many containers, and that it would be a minor usability nightmare.\n\n![B405410B78F3BBB62E1085800DA56A1B912AB520](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/68997312950958635/B405410B78F3BBB62E1085800DA56A1B912AB520/)\n\nAnd moving the containers around was a great excuse for some engaging EVA gameplay.\n\n![FD20F4821EB2B7056326AAED441B56470F1D6915](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/68997312950956676/FD20F4821EB2B7056326AAED441B56470F1D6915/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T08:55:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bomoo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T14:12:32Z","Content":"Sorry for bumping in here, but I just wanted to say THANK YOU for this mod!

But here\u0027s how you gotta perceive the situation: pod inventories are actually Kerbal\u0027s pockets. If there\u0027s no Kerbal inside, then there are no pockets.It\u0027s gonna be user unfriendly if you won\u0027t be able to stuff seat inventories in the VAB until you actually fill that place with a Kerbal.

I recommend to try it on the launchpad first...\n\nTo capture a free floating part i recommend to get in range and match up speed with soft touches of the control. Bring up your inventory with \u0022tab\u0022 and press \u0022r\u0022 to disable the EVApack. Then press and hold \u0022g\u0022 hover cursor over the part and drag\u0026drop it to your inventory.\n\nTo get a snap for surface mounted part you need to use the electric screwdriver - then press \u0022r\u0022 - its not possible with the wrench.\n\nhope this helps to use one of the best mods properly...\n\n[Edit: spelling]\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi KospY!
