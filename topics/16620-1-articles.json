The first thing I noticed were all of these epic space stations and ships, and they had links, so that I could get them. All of them were in .craft files. My question is this: If I have the demo, do I need to get the bought versions to get these ships? If not, then how do I insert them? I put them in my \u0022Ships\u0022 file, but when I open that file up in-game, it\u0027s empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks buches!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESneeze\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T14:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFile compatibility was broken at least once since 0.13 (I\u0027m speaking of .craft compatibility only), due to the added parts and other changes.
