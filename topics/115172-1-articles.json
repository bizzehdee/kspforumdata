In that case the drag of the payload compared to drag of the required number of parachutes is of order of 3%, and such is the error in calculated speed. The calculation could easily assume the payload is dragless and come up with a worst-case scenario which would be likely within 5% of the real thing - at these speeds drag of the craft itself is really minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it would be much harder if you were to calculate e.g. with spaceplane abort sequence: can an MK3 cockpit be slowed down under 70m/s (of its impact durability) by a single drogue chute? In this case the cockpit\u0027s drag is comparable to the drag of the chute and can\u0027t be neglected. But if you want that cockpit land at neat 6m/s, you must attach four radial parachutes, and once again, whether the cockpit drag is 0.1 or 10, it\u0027s nothing compared to the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T08:29:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
