It settled into extremely-tight circles as it gently glided back down to the launchpad area. VERY stable, but unfortunately still too fast to land survivably without power (I don\u0027t think it\u0027s even possible to manage a safe landing without power or a chute).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CarolRawley","CreatedById":4627,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-21T03:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow my glider works is that you turn on SAS, Fire the boosters, then as they run out, eject the boosters and SAS module then turn SAS off. The glider will tumble, and then level out. Wait a while, then as the glider starts rapidly losing height, reposition the glider until it stops tumbling, then turn SAS back on. If it loses more height, turn SAS back off. If you get it perfect, then it will slowly drift in a direction, losing height at 1m/s. It will land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
