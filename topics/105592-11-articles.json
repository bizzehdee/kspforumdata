My CPU lists 8 cores, though it is a quad, I\u0027m assuming, because of the 64 bits. It was my assumption that this would allow all my CPUs to process the game as well in 64. This mod does not affect CPU affinity, or the ability to run the processes in 64 bits through the CPU? It only affects RAM amount recognized? \n\nI wonder if it\u0027s possible for someone to write a mod that calculates all physics for connected parts as one unit.
