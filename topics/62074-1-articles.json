Such a refueling mission would seem to take away from the (will be) increased cost efficiency of an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can just launch a craft via rocket that has the same interplanetary capabilities as my SSTO once the SSTO has been refueled (via a slightly less massive rocket mission), is it going to be all that much worth it to make interplanetary SSTO if they will need refueling before doing a mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, obviously this is going to be almost 100% dependent on the specifics of the craft and the rocket, but I would like to know what people think about this. Once money becomes an issue in the game, skilled players will try to make everything a single-stage-to-whereever, but (IMO) most of those are going to be something along the lines of either RAPIERS with one or more LV-Ns, or turbojets with one or more LV-Ns, which means that the players will have to spend all that extra money to refuel the craft, which may have been better spent on a single rocket mission to launch a nuclear powered, not-so-plane-like interplanetary craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, on average, will space planes that need refueling once in orbit to do the mission still be more cost efficient then a (possibly) larger single rocket launch, or not? Or is this far too case-by-case to really make any solid predictions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T20:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome SSTO\u0027s can orbit with like 3000dv, and another smaller ones can orbit with less percentage of fuel yet require less fuel to fill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting 500l for the SSTO might not be that expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can only say for sure that they will be deffinitelly worth if you already have a refueling station setup in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut specific refueling missions just for one SSTO will deppend a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T20:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tetryds\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tetryds\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can only say for sure that they will be deffinitelly worth if you already have a refueling station setup in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d still have to re-supply that station though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T22:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do think NASA went back to capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace planes may look cool but they come with some huge difficultys and limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T22:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy do think NASA went back to capsules.\u003Cp\u003ESpace planes may look cool but they come with some huge difficultys and limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as NASA never made an SSTO in the first place, I don\u0027t see your point.

And of course in the final game everything costs money. A space plane will be reusable, if you can land it, you can refuel it. So efficiency certainly increases at low kerbin orbit, or even orbiting bodies. There are some videos on the internet where people have made large deliveries to duna and joolian moons with ssto\u0027s without refuel. It isn\u0027t impossible. So if you got the skills.
