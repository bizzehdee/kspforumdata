What I usually do with the front landing gear is set the spring strength to a small number (typically .2 or .3) and increase damping. This allows the front to sink down and absorb most of the pitching moment. The distance between the tail tip and the rear landing gear is important and there exists\u00A0a true risk of tailstrike if I don\u0027t pay attention to these\u00A0parameters.

Turns out, the struts I put inside the engine (to hold the different parts into place) get \u0022open\u0022 when the engine is attached to the Skylon. They generate a lot of drag and induce that nasty-looking Mach effect. I also made the mistake of autostrutting the engine components to their grand-parent part,which in my case were the mirror parts attached on the other side of the Skylon. This means the engines weren\u0027t attached to anything except the wing tip which is a very fragile joint. I decided to strut them to the heaviest part of the airplane which is that massive orange payload in the cargo bay. All of a sudden, the Skylon could tip its nose up right after take-off and reach high accelerations (~ 5 Gs) without a sweat and most of all, in one piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also decided to remove the control surfaces I artificially clipped inside the fuselage in order to move the center of pressure upwards. I felt like the dihedral angle did not do much in ensuring roll stability and I thought I had to do that. It felt like cheating and not only does it not feel realistic, this \u0022solution\u0022 also adds quite the amount of drag. All in all, having open struts in my aircraft and clipped control surfaces inclined at a high angle did not help at all. Thankfully, removing these clipped surfaces didn\u0027t seem to negatively affect roll stability, at least to an extent that would make my plane crash.\u00A0In order to counterbalance the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E moving downwards, I moved all the tanks and the engine nacelles down as well. I did observe a very slight tendency to nose down during roll though, as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is significantly lower than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. But the plane remains flyable and I dare say it flies much better than ever before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can now consistently reach orbit with a comfortable amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E left (somewhere in between 300 m/s to 900 m/s depending on whether I fly without paying much attention to the controls or if I turn off the rocket mode early on and follow an optimal flight profile). Even better, as the Skylon doesn\u0027t need to have oxidizer leftovers in the tanks upon re-entry, I can decrease the amount of oxidizer and get less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E once in orbit but more liquid fuel for atmospheric flight in the eventuality of a suboptimal re-entry profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll probably release the engine and the craft file when I manage to land it consistently. I haven\u0027t tried any landing this evening because I was already busy with ensuring structural integrity against aerodynamic loads, but I guess the bird can withstand the accelerations of touch down now that the wings and nacelles are strutted properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes,\u00A0I\u00A0also had to remove\u00A0the Whiplash engines because despite the very beautiful blue color and small increase in Isp they provide, they were occluded by the wing tip and became a dead-weight when implemented on the Skylon. But now that the engines are attached to the central fuselage, I think I can safely place them back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s also note that I have added three sets of big-S wings. Wings don\u0027t generate as much drag as fuselage parts so I figured that I could get way more lift without a strong impact on my net thrust (thrust - drag). Now I get approximately as much lift as drag and my net thrust often reaches values\u00A0up to 2500 kN. Plus now the Skylon looks more like the real model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-29T03:42:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2020 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Kerburettor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerburettor","CreatedById":194580,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-29T23:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nSorry for the serial-posting but I\u0027ve got to give some updates:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nI\u0027ve managed to land a Skylon which contains two Mk3 passenger modules.

If one doesn\u0027t manage to land successfully during their first attempt, loading a quicksave prompts the game to reconsider its former choices. Because the RAPIER modules are enveloped inside an open fairing (nozzle), the game now somehow makes the fairings heat up. They subsequently explode which can jeopardize your second attempt, especially if you are in the transonic regime and undergo asymetric explosions. A workaround is to set the throttle at full thrust to blow up both fairings on each side of the aircraft at the same time.
