How to accurately make nodes get you where you need that involve no maths but would allow you to see exactly where your craft will be in relation to other bodies and craft in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA time slider for when you are making nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou make your first node then move time forward in the map screen until you are near your target, obviously all bodies in the system would show their future positions so you can see whether you are near an encounter. Your distance to your target would be shown so you can see the effects of changing your node. Maybe time in the flight could pause for this to make the code easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh no, you will be at the right point but no encounter as your orbital plane is not the same as your target but you can see you are above it so you add another node and change planes at the An, and now you can see you have an encounter (you could also see where your craft would have been with no node and the first node too). A lot easier than trying to guess the right point on the orbit to hit. Maybe a line could be drawn from the craft to the target that shows the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPreviously there would be a lot of guessing and you would have no idea even if you were going to be near the body until you got an encounter. Not very good if you wish people to experiment, experiment needs results given even if you do not succeed rather than a digital 1/0 situation where you either do or do not get an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR I think it would be much better if you could see the future positions of both your craft and the target so you can see how close you are (on your current path and all node possible paths) without the need to be on the same plane or get an encounter to get any information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferrer","CreatedById":161724,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T13:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems like a great idea, and I\u0027d be interested in hearing from modders whether\u00A0there are any practical concerns that would make implementing it more difficult than it seems at first glance.

I\u0060d like to set the time for intercept to about 9 years and see if I can reproduce the new horizons mission so I wanted to place the check point 9 years (or so, whatever time they actually took) in the future then adjust my node to intercept then. Having the ability to warp the whole system forward to see the positions of the craft and bodies at that time would be much more useful for more cases than the limited case of purely getting an intercept with a single target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you have other craft and want to see their positions when the craft in focus is at a certain position for satellite networks or something. Having the whole system move forward gives you a great deal more info than seeing a single position of a single body/craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you already have a craft launched and you are trying to get an intercept for a body before the first craft gets there so you need to see the relative positions of both the body and the other craft relative to your craft at a particular point in time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I would still like to be able to warp the whole system forward to see the positions of all the craft and bodies in the game, it would be very useful for that 10% of the time you need more than to know only the closest intercept to a single body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-31T12:17:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2016 12:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hurric","CreatedById":150872,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T15:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you make maneuver node from say Kerbin orbit\u00A0\u0026gt; Duna encounter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo it as per normal then while in map screen *FOCUS* on duna ... zoom in or out and your flight line will show up as a short orange line showing your angle of approach ... you can alter this by moving the nodes (or) when you have done the main burn use your *thrusters* to fine tune the encounter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-31T15:59:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2016 03:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by hurric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T05:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222609860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464710178\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150872\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hurric\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, hurric said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you make maneuver node from say Kerbin orbit\u00A0\u0026gt; Duna encounter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo it as per normal then while in map screen *FOCUS* on duna ... zoom in or out and your flight line will show up as a short orange line showing your angle of approach ... you can alter this by moving the nodes (or) when you have done the main burn use your *thrusters* to fine tune the encounter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if you want to do a Kerbin\u0026gt;Kerbin slingshot to get to Duna?
