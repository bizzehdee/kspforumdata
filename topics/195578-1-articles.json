As a layman, i have no idea how to program and create a mod that do that. I am trying to learn a litle bit of the C# language but i think it will take a long time, so, maybe i can get some help. The mod would be very simple, just having a UI that allow you to switch from the elliptcall spanload to bell spanload, and vice-versa. This bell lift distribution create an effect the as you aply aileron to generate more lift on one wing you also generates more trust, thus yawing in the same direction of the turn. For understanding more of this you can search for the prandlt-D project that is made by NASA. I want to reproduce this effect on KSP to make better flying wings projects, i hope you can help me with this project! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHere is a link for the NASA\u0027s\u00A0Prandlt-d project:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-106-AFRC.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-106-AFRC.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
