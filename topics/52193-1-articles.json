In my recent ike visit (haven\u0027t landed on Duna yet) I got on the ground, did science, then back to Kerbin. I thought I had set up a midflight burn to get ~40,000 m periapsis to Kerbin. However, I had to do a HUUUUUUGE burn (~1500 m/s) to pull the orbit off, because something happened between my spot-on preflight burn and getting into the SOI. I was 1.5 million out\u002B and almost ran out of gas to get in atmo.

So tweaks in the 1st half of the trip are best used just to get an encounter at all, like to change your inclination to meet the target if you left Kerbin in its plane. But don\u0027t expect more of them than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get fine control over what you\u0027ll have when you change SOI, you need to wait until you\u0027re at least 3/4 of the way there, maybe more. It depends a lot on the total length of the trip. Like for Jool, I usually wait until I\u0027m close enough that the remaining length of blue line before the SOI change is about as long as the orange line through Jool\u0027s SOI, but with Duna, I can do such things earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even this is still just close enough for government work. You really can\u0027t set your Pe in stone until you\u0027re in the SOI and fairly close to the planet (which varies by the size of the planet). But tweaks this close in cost more, so you don\u0027t want to have to do but very minor final adjustments.

Head down to Eve first, use Eve to slingshot you back to a more agressive Kerbin intercept, and use Kerbin to slingshot up to Dres.
