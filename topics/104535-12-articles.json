Watch my video, you get the arm close enough for the magnet to engage but not close enough to dock. undock cargo from station and float the cargo to the arm. same with arm to station. just float the cargo and allow 2-3 seconds."},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T02:19:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Granted, that link is broken due to a typing error on his part, but it seem like it should go to the old MSI Infernal Robotics thread which then redirects to this one from its last page as it\u0027s closed.
