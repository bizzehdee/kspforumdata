Since venus is already so dam hot and water vapor is a great greenhouse gas, all the water would simply add to venus\u0027s atmsphere and increase it mass by ~9 times, I would assume conditions would get much worse on venus, not better. You need to reduce venus\u0027s solar flux, drop it temperature, get rid of all the CO2, then dump water and even then bringing back venus to it normal solar flux would still put it perilously close to not being habitalble. If venus was a black body radiator (no atmsophere, made of some kind of perfect black material that absorbs all light and re-emits all energy as infrared) it would have a surface temperature of 55 C, compare to earth\u0027s theoritical black body surface termperature 6 C. Venus would thus need a global cooling effect, very little heat retention! Either it surface, or it atmsphere would need to reflect back more light, especially infared light, then it lets in. The best solution I can think of is a gigantic sunshade in Sun-Venus L1, it would need to be ~4 times wider then venus out at that distance so that its shadow completely covers venus. Then venus would cool down. Assuming you did dump all that water and you bring venus\u0027s temp down so then it can become liquid you would then need to let the water and the carbon dioxide react with sodium and other metals in venus\u0027s soil to form carbonate minerals, pulling out all the CO2.
