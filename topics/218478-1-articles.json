Instead it is something closer to 80 degrees.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is without editor extensions installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am now going back through and uninstalling the mods mentioned above, but figured I would ask about it here since it is such a strange issue. Was hoping somebody else may have encountered this and knows what exactly it is that causes it. Or perhaps that I just completely forgot about some user option or key that could cause this. I mean it\u0027s not the end of the world and I can still use shifts and fine tune snap by 5 degrees. But\u00A0 of course with how often I find myself just hitting a or d to rotate 90 degrees, this can be a bit of a pain.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyhow, like I said I am going through and uninstalling the mods I mentioned 1 by 1 to find out if one of them is causing it. But this is such a strange issue that I can\u0027t imagine being caused by any of those mods so figured I would post and check if there is something I am forgetting and have caused this problem myself with a user option or something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSPNerd","CreatedById":156193,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-20T21:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you ever figure this out?
