Civilian aircrafts, such as these, are very much easy to fly, and fun to fly around if you ever have that good vibe when flying in a sweetspot not-to-slow and not-too-fast speed. These aircrafts are designed to cruise in the air and let you take all the time you need to get that good glimpse view of the landscapes, or if that\u0027s not your cup of tea, then there\u0027s the kerbalization alternative that lets you launch off your favorite kerbals off some remote place and never return, in air!\n\n* * *\n\n![Gxx4yup.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Gxx4yup.jpg)\n\nThe Cessna 150 is a two-seat tricycle gear general aviation airplane that was designed for flight training, touring and personal use. Development of the Model 150 began in the mid-1950s with the decision by Cessna Aircraft to produce a successor to the popular Cessna 140 which finished production in 1951. The main changes in the 150 design were the use of tricycle landing gear, which is easier to learn to use than the tailwheel landing gear of the Cessna 140, and replacing the rounded wingtips and horizontal and vertical stabilizers with more modern, squared-off profiles.\n\nBecause of its low requirements for flight operation, the Cessna 150 doubles as a funplane in the areas of the space center, usually brought upon to endure stress relieving breezes in the sky or for new area reconnaissance when used in missions. The Cessna 150 is a staple, multipurpose two seater plane, for all your flight-easy endeavors.\n\nControls:\n\n1 - Toggle cockpit systems and ladders\n\n2 - Toggle engines\n\n[![6LVlhQU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6LVlhQU.jpg)](http://www./download/ce9whwv1m4mgnwj/SHA_Replica_-_Cessna_150.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : 90, 573\n\nPart Count : 78\n\nMass : 9.2 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 4.3m\n\nL : 11.4m\n\nW : 11.7m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n1 J-33 \u0022Wheesly\u0022 Basic Jet Engine\n\n2 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n* * *\n\n![82aaurE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/82aaurE.jpg)\n\nThe Cessna 150 Patroller in real-counterpart is a variant of the Cessna 150 designed for longer ranges. In this replica though, the Cessna 150 Patroller is a variant of the Cessna 150 that features an added E.J.E.C.T.O.R.S. system installed in the aircraft, complete with mapped controls, blow-off roofs, ejecting seats, and all the more what you would need to send your Kerbal flying off of the thing that got it flying in the first place.\n\n![XY7paOl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XY7paOl.jpg)\n\n![1DdoZsO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1DdoZsO.jpg)\n\n![zzibfXs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zzibfXs.jpg)\n\n![qlm7Qdo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qlm7Qdo.jpg)\n\n![BQut9gP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BQut9gP.jpg)\n\n![mLrys2L.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mLrys2L.jpg)\n\n![XL06wEJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XL06wEJ.jpg)\n\nControls:\n\n1 - Toggle cockpit systems and ladders\n\n2 - Toggle engines\n\n3 - Blow the roof off\n\n4 - Eject Seats\n\n[![LSgjciq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LSgjciq.jpg)](http://www./download/q77i6cyahr86p8v/SHA_Replica_-_Cessna_150_Patroller.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : 177, 656\n\nPart Count : 114\n\nMass : 9.9 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 4.3m\n\nL : 12.6m\n\nW : 11.4m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n1 J-33 \u0022Wheesly\u0022 Basic Jet Engine\n\n2 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n* * *\n\n![GYbziH2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GYbziH2.jpg)\n\nThe Cessna 208 Caravan is a single-engined turboprop, fixed-tricycle landing gear, short-haul regional airliner and utility aircraft that is built in the United States by Cessna. Capable up to nine seats of crew, The Cessna 208 Caravan is a reliable short A-to-B hauler for most Kerbals, having a rather relaxed and easy flight profile than a fast-paced one. With cues and design signatures coming from its little brother, the Cessna 150, the Cessna 208 Caravan ensures a relaxing fly-by over the faces of Kerbin, along with friends! Much like a flying RV, the Cessna 208 Caravan could be used to bring you almost anywhere given it\u0027s in Kerbin and within range of the Cessna 208\u0027s mileage.\n\nFunny enough, the Cessna 208 Caravan is a lot cheaper than the full-options Cessna 150 Patroller, so there\u0027s that to take not when putting side by side these models.\n\nControls:\n\n1 - Toggle cockpit systems and ladders\n\n2 - Toggle engines\n\n[![HX4vPnM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HX4vPnM.jpg)](http://www./download/4y0vas365crw45q/SHA_Replica_-_Cessna_208_Caravan.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : $113, 276\n\nPart Count : 141\n\nMass : 17.4 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 6.4m\n\nL : 18.9m\n\nW : 15.5m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n2 J-33 \u0022Wheesly\u0022 Basic Jet Engine\n\n2 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n* * *\n\n![c6CPW4p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/c6CPW4p.jpg)\n\nThe Cessna 208 Grand Caravan in real life counter part is supposedly an extended version of the Cessna 208 Caravan. You would guess, that in this replica, the Cessna 208 Grand Caravan is a variant of the Cessna 208 Caravan with features like the added E.J.E.C.T.O.R.S. system installed in the aircraft, complete with mapped controls, blow-off roofs, ejecting seats, and all the more what you would need to send your Kerbal flying off of the thing that got it flying in the first place. Talk about lazy description making, basically it has more \u0022fun\u0022 in it. Why launch only two kerbals off a plane at a time when you can launch **nine**?\n\nAlthough keep in mind, the Cessna 208 Grand Caravan is more expensive than say, all of the three other models combined. Get your priorities straight.\n\n![3Q8q4Pz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3Q8q4Pz.jpg)\n\n![l5qKQTZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/l5qKQTZ.jpg)\n\n![4C32ao3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4C32ao3.jpg)\n\n![e3p1Wo1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/e3p1Wo1.jpg)\n\n![2z6tF6x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2z6tF6x.jpg)\n\n![jI7L8NW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jI7L8NW.jpg)\n\n![Lzi2o4W.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Lzi2o4W.jpg)\n\nControls:\n\n1 - Toggle cockpit systems and ladders\n\n2 - Toggle engines\n\n3 - Blow the roof off\n\n4 - Eject Seats\n\n[![kMdhudS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kMdhudS.jpg)](http://www./download/ipgfdoho144h9u5/SHA_Replica_-_Cessna_208_Grand_Caravan.craft)\n\nClick on the image above for download!\n\nCost : $459, 102\n\nPart Count : 279\n\nMass : 20.1 tons\n\nDimensions \n\nH : 6.4m\n\nL : 20.3m\n\nW : 15.5m\n\nPowerplant : \n\n2 J-33 \u0022Wheesly\u0022 Basic Jet Engine\n\n2 PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoeletric Generators\n\n* * *\nCheck out more of Sparrowhawk\u0027s Products at :\n[![wyv8VDw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wyv8VDw.jpg)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81506-SparrowHawk-Aeronautics-HIRING%21-JOIN-NOW%21)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T10:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 10:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SHiftER2O**"},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T13:17:34Z","Content":"So the Caravan was the prettiest plane you could find to make a replica off? ;-) My god I was captivated by the ugliness of that machine last month, it really looks like somebody at cessna thought.. so caravans.. everybody kinda likes them, but we could improve it by eh.. making them (only slightly) quicker and maybe add some wings.. whaddaye think guys?
