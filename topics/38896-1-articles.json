That gave me the idea to try to set my 360 controller up in a similar fashion for KSP. However when I assign the throttle axis to the right trigger, it only ranges from 50% to 100%, which can be a little problematic. I assume this is because the trigger only reports from 0 to 1 rather than -1 to 1 like any other axis would. Is there any way to have KSP interpret a value of 0 as a 0% throttle rather than 50%? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather not bind the two triggers onto the same axis like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24874-Workaround-for-Xbox-360-controller-Triggers-and-DPAD-mapping\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWorkaround-for-Xbox-360-controller-Triggers-and-DPAD-mapping\u003C/a\u003E suggests. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did notice in the settings.cfg file that there is a scale factor setting under AXIS_THROTTLE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAXIS_THROTTLE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = Controller (Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows) 9\u003Cbr\u003E\tid = joy0.9\u003Cbr\u003E\tinv = False\u003Cbr\u003E\tsensitivity = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\tdeadzone = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tscale = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\tgroup = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tswitchState = Any\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If there is any way to change the offset too, I assume I could set the scale to 2 to get the full throttle range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
