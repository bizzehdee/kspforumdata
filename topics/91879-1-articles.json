But it just makes this game become more \u0022grinding\u0022, because people know that you can unlock them all without going further from the mun/minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when i have already unlocked all the technology tree in day 2, i feel like this is not right. I started to browsing the forums, watching some youtube, etc. because i know i have the feeling that this game has reaaaaaly reaaaly lot things to offer with hundred hours of gameplay. why all i do is just build rockets, try to land in mun and fail miserably, repeat, and get all the technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, to be honest, at first i didn\u0027t even know that you can build space stations, refueling stations, rovers, etc until i saw some youtube and start to browsing the forum. Hell, i didnt even know docking, or asteroids (and the fact we can bring asteroid back home) until someone point that out. Then, looking back on the spaceship parts, i\u0027ve came into realization. This is because i unlock all the spaceship parts too fast that i didnt even know what they are for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some people have little incentive to do all of these things (landing on farther planets, building space stations) because they think that they can get more science without too much hassle by landing on mun/minmus. For me, it is not quite much problem because i will to all of these anyway. But for some people, they wont bother looking further, and they will think that this game is only about recreating Apollo program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless we can use the excess science for other things (Or greatly diminish the science point gained from repeated contracts around the same planets/moons), then people will start looking around to get more science, and get their mind blown by the amount of what this game has to offer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, even with Fine Print integration on the next patch, if the amount if science gained from contracts is ludicrous, people will rather \u0022grind\u0022 the contracts because its just more convenient way to get science rather than trying to haul big vessel with science lab and all of those science instruments equipped, plus 4 skilled kerbonauts in operation with the risk of never coming back to Kerbin because of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edont get my wrong. i still really love this game. My post looks like a ramble, but im actually not (and trying not to). I\u0027m just excited with the thoughts of what this game will become when it goes on beta becaause i know this game will eventually get much more better than this. So i just want to know if i miss anything about any future plans on science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR : do i miss the dev news about science points rebalance at some point later? because i personally think that science point can be easily \u0022grinded\u0022 on contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T15:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot as such right now, at least nothing announced.
