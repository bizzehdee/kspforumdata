My question probably doesn\u0027t matter for a bare minimum colony (loading Kerbals one by one would work)\u00A0but for cases where players want to build massive colonies it would matter (in the event Kerbals don\u0027t reproduce).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-28T09:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals do reproduce.
