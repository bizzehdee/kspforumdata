Got the second ship into orbit, got all the way to touching each other, and they won\u0027t link. I\u0027ve turned off SAS on both ships. I\u0027m using the APAS-69 docking port (I believe that\u0027s an add-on). The 2nd ship ran out of electrical power before they made contact. So, my question is, can a ship dock with no electrical power? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have to revert and put some panels on I can do that.
