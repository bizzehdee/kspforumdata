While observing the interesting view from the ship\u0027s bridge, one of the lieutenants calls you over to look at a funny meme image he found in his social media feed. The lieutenant sits at his hyper futuristic computer screen, approximately ten steps in front of you. This also happens to be the very exact direction of the ship\u0027s movement.\n\nNow, the question is, how easy is it for you to just walk over there? It seems natural to me to assume that because the crew - by being on the ship - is already coasting through space near the speed of light... even a small increase in velocity (such as taking a small step) would require near infinite amounts of energy/effort. Even when accounting for momentum (you move forward, the ships moves backward) it seems strange.\n\nThe second alternative I can imagine is that relativity somehow makes it seem to the captain as if he is strolling around effortlessly at very sub-light speed on a stationary ship in essentially a flat universe because (if I recall correctly) light in vacuum always travels at c regardless of the velocity of the observer. \n\nEither way, I am confus, pls halp"},{"CreatedByName":"XIRA","CreatedById":42509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T07:12:39Z","Content":"You should be able to walk just fine.

Have you gone to university to study science or as I am mainly googlcated (how\u0027s that for a term we all need).\n\nThe reason why going faster than the speed of light is considered impossible is due to time dilation. Time dilation is the affect of time slowing down due to either being in a gravetational field, such as the earth, or by traveling at a velocity relative to something else. So as you travel faster or deeper into a gravity well time appears to slow down for you, or another way of putting it is that the rest of the universe appears to speed up. So lets say that you are traveling along at 100m/s below the speed of light to an outside observer. Due to this immense speed time dilation makes it so that every second that passes for you a year passes for the outside observer (made up numbers, I think the discrepency would be larger but I\u0027m no expert). Let\u0027s say that when you startred your journey your acceleration was 1m/s/s, now if you started thrusting with the same acceleration while traveling at 100m/s below the speed of light to you it would only take one second of thrusting to achieve 99m/s below the speed of light, however to the outside observer you have been thrusting for one year not one second. And as you travel faster the effects of time dilation become pronounced, so one second for you becomes two years for the observer. And we know that time dilation is a thing due to experiments done with identical clocks, one on the ground with another in an aircraft, the experiment showed that the one in the aircraft did run slower due to time dilation."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T14:20:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Mass is human construct, we can measure force between two objects, but we can\u0027t say are they pulling each other or are they pushed towards each other.\n\nMass is a quantity that represent how hard an object affect another object.
