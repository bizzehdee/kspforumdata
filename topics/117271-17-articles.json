The real plane is a transonic (mach 0.7 to 0.99) fighter with a single jet engine and has a max turning G of 6. This mock-up simulates that fairly close. The major difference is that the real plane had 6 single barrel machine guns (unsure of the calibre) and this mockup has twin Vulcans. I figured that was a good compromise.\n\nThe only added bit of options were a single box of flares and chaff. So she\u0027s so lean it\u0027s anorexic.\n\n31 points total\n\n-2X hidden Vulcans\n\n-3X 20mm rounds\n\n-1X Chaff\n\n-1X flares\n\n[http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/503746/CF-86%20Sabrejet.craft](http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/503746/CF-86%20Sabrejet.craft)\n\nEDIT: Wrong picture. My craft file has 3 boxes of 20mm rounds and two vulcans, not the 4 boxes and 4 vulcans in the picture and the main wings are different. Sorry about that.
