If it was just a matter of hitting enter to confirm that would be ok, but most of the UI is mouse driven and not keyboard sensitive so that\u0027s a more annoying interaction. \n\nI agree KSP\u0027s save system is a bit simple, which is partly why I wrote [Jebretary](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72212-Jebretary-Automatic-Version-Control-%28backups%29-for-craft-and-saves-v0-4-0) - automatically adds all quick saves and autosaves into version control, so you could do several quicksaves in a row and then go back to which ever one you wanted. You can also load any past autosave as a quicksave. It also does the same sort of thing for craft so you can rewind a craft to how it was at any past version."}]}
