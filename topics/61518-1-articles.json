This is a 1.25 meter part, yes? It appears to be mounted to the stock 1.25m Liquid Fuel fuselage, anyway. So, okay, think about it: If a Kerbal were to sit inside of a 1.25 meter diameter hollow pipe, that would be a pretty fug snit, especially if he\u0027s wearing his helmet. Now, visualize trying to cram that same head with helmet up into this tiny little narrow canopy... see my point? Now go one step further, think about where the rest of his body would be, stuffed into that pointy little nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying that everything in KSP has to be absolutely 100% properly scaled, heck, Squad\u0027s own cockpits aren\u0027t much better about this. But, if we have an opportunity to make changes now, why not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my first thought after examining the pics was that the proportions of the canopy and nose would be much better if this were scaled up to 2.5 meters. Then the cockpit area would look to be a better fit for a Kerbal pilot. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And the air intake would be bigger too, as a bonus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn balance, however, I think this is a pretty good-looking part.
