I am sad to report that i have a problem in ksp that is close to pushing me to stop playing. it is so bad that I just can\u0027t play the game! What happens is this: I launch a plane or rocket, and it flies ok. after a couple of seconds, it just spontaniosly explodes! When i look in the flight log (F3) it says that *random part of my rocket* hit \u0027panel\u0027 and was destroyed. After the crash I can see this Solar panel, but it is not considered debris and is not affected by gravity, it just stays there, floating. I happens even if my craft has no panels of any kind! HELP! I think it might be a bug with the quicksave feature, but I do run mods, but this never happened to me. What should I do!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPIC of when I found something suspicious in the log. the problem starts with the probe core crashing into \u0027panel\u0027 (pic don\u0027t show it because i messed up at time of pic, \u002B when I went to get good pic the log changed.). the rest of log seems to work out what happened in the vessel destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/viSqkvP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022viSqkvP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-28T15:54:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2014 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SaplingPick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Easnwered!
