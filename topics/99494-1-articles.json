Each time you do one of these things you get science, but when you repeat the action you get exponentially less science, in addition there seems to be a maximum amount of science you can get from a specific action. When you write a report or perform an experiment you can choose whether to store the data or to immediately transmit it back home for a reduced value, and the Mobile Processing Lab that can partially negate that penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can \u0022collect\u0022 the data from an experiment during an EVA, and deposit elsewhere, (usually a command pod).

It depends on which science instrument you have taken the data from. Mystery Goo containers and Science Jr.\u0027s are single use, so when you take the data from them they are not reusable unless you clean/reset them with the mobile science lab. The thermometer, gravoli, seismic accelerator and barometer do not require cleaning and can be reused immediately after the data is removed from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. They increase the science gained from transmitting. They also increase the effectiveness of the mobile lab(gives a higher % to transmitting) and the science gained from recovering craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As far as I\u0027m aware you can carry as much as you want, I\u0027ve never come across a limit. But I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Yes, if you transmit the data, however your science yield will be much lower. You can only carry 1 version experiment from a biome in a command pod at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile lab is quite heavy so at least for me personally, I very rarely attach it too craft and just take several versions of the experiments(usually 2-4).

Also, you don\u0027t have to bring the lab to the surface - you can place it in orbit, and then take a lander with ONE set of experiments, land, use the experiments, return and then clean the experiments (after storing the results in one of the pods). Minmus has 8 equatorial biomes and the Mun er.. 10-ish?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is I usually send single-shot ships to the non-equatorial biomes (Poles, Polar Lowlands, Polar Crater, Northern Basin, Southern Crater). That nets me enough science to make a nice Mun station and reusable lander, which I use to hit the rest of the biomes. (Similar process for Minmus, only with a much lighter lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a similar plan for far away planets, only usually the tree is completed by then, as it\u0027s like 10-11k long, and you can get well past that within Kerbin\u0027s SOI even without contracts so... :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
