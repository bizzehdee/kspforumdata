The first 10 minutes is just a demo of how it navigates, but the rest shows the actual machines, workstations, processes and people who hand-made things like the plated-wire ROM memory. Dry stuff, but if you\u0027re a tech-history fanatic like me, well worth the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIBhPsyYCiM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viccie211","CreatedById":96654,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T22:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s weird to see how it\u0027s operated, now it would all be done with gui\u0027s and probably commandlines too, but only typing in numbers and then having to remember what those numbers mean?

And why, when they weren\u0027t doing routine procedures that were written out in the checklists, the exact sequence of keystrokes required were worked out on the ground, then transmitted up to the crew to transcribe, then the crew would read them back to the ground to verify that they had transcribed the correct sequence, and then corrections would be sent up, then the crew would read back the corrected sequence, etc. etc., until it was confirmed that they had the correct sequence of keystrokes written down. Yes, it was an awkward procedure that was hated by the crews. Yes, there were originally plans to include a teletype on the Apollo spacecraft for sending such strings of numbers and keystrokes without the chance of transcription error by the crew (this was deleted for weight reasons). Yes, this is why the Shuttle originally flew with a teletype, and why it was later refitted with a fax machine (same purpose, but broader capabilities for less weight), and why the ISS has a printer on board to print out emails from Mission Control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, this IS the same procedure used for instrument flight clearances to this very day in the aviation world...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T15:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might not be intuitive, but as a piece of minimalist engineering it was art at its finest - and its simplicity was absolutely necessary, given the weight and computing limitations of its time. Not to mention this sort of keyboard interface was at its infancy at the time - most computers were still switch/punchcard driven when this was designed. Its interface is actually pretty damn logical in comparasion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
