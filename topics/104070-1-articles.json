This leads to comments about the mod not working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to include a check in the action that starts the drive, whether the physics loop/OnFixedUpdate() get called and if not then start it. However, I have not been successful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be really appreciated, and thanks in advance for your help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T21:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnStart, OnUpdate, and OnFixedUpdate (in PartModule) run only when the part is active.
