It does the same thing for me; I tested it with both a 0-star and a 1-star engineer. Same result each time. Then I loaded up an older save where I had a surface science setup on the Mun, and there, both solar panels correctly showed 2 units produced. Mind you, those panels were set up in an older version (1.11).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo either 1.12 bugged out the display of newly deployed surface solar panels, \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E this effect happens if you set it up on Kerbin. Not sure which it is right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, it\u0027s a display issue only, and on the solar panel only. The rest of the parts appear to work just fine, and the solar panel does produce power if it was set up correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pCwu4DQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022108.25\u0022 height=\u0022678\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pCwu4DQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-27T08:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read a bit further and it says I need a power unit for each experiment.
