Yours performs similar to the Q6600 at 2.4GHz.\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s weird about the docking. I tried this once and it worked ok. My method, I think, was to EVA a Kerbal over, detach the docking port from the adaptor first, then activate the stack separator, open the docking port and dock using the command module. It worked fine for me. However, I have had problems before when detaching a docking port in-flight like this. It seems that it can cause the docking port to get stuck. They behave like you describe when this has happened to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can check if this is the case by opening the persistence file and searching for \u0022state = acquire\u0022 without the quotes. If you find a docking node with that line you can just change it to \u0022state = ready\u0022 and it should fix the problem. I\u0027ve had this happen many times, but I\u0027ve never been able to reliably replicate it on a stock install. Hopefully you\u0027ve stumbled onto a way to make this happen. I\u0027ll look into this later and if I can recreate it then I\u0027ll submit a bug report. This is one of the docking port bugs that\u0027s been giving me problems for a long time, so it would be great if this could help find a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely I did something wrong on trying to get the lander\u0027s docking port available.

An i7 4650U (basically a top-of-the-line ultrabook CPU) sounds like it should be better than an i5 3470. But the two are really no where near each other. Of course, the 3470 is a 77W part while the 4650U is a 15W part, so this is really no surprise. But TDP, and even clockspeed to some extent, are not immediately obvious when looking at just the model number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good resource for this kind of basic CPU information is Intel\u0027s database (this is usually the first result in a Google search for any specific Intel CPU): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ark.intel.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ark.intel.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022earth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022earth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been reading the thread, and i must say you have gathered very solid data!
