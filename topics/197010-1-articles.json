This is my words to give to people on how to get from Explosions to success:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I started playing KSP I got the inspiration to do so via Matt Lowne\u0027s amazing SSTOs. I was amazed by them, I dreamed about making my own fleet of SSTOs making cool names and going all over the Kerbol system!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that was the burning point to via a Christmas sale, grab a copy of KSP via steam and start playing. I fired up the game, got ready to go,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAND then I was like... UM... HOW DO YOU BUILD ROCKET?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoogle was the ally of the day and I was able to find out the basics to add parts and delete them too. So I built my first rocket \u0022The Cheetah!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, a command capsule, and a parachute...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t make it far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd at that point there was that part of me saying that I was going to go down a bigger loophole then what I have thought. And the next following rockets fell to the same results, now this is where I start to just look at the tutorials. And they helped quite a bit. But it didn\u0027t get me into orbit. And I was starting hours of frustration, I didn\u0027t realize at the time that at that point this is where most will throw the towel and stop. On the first day after playing for an unhealthy 15\u00A0hours, I did it. with 8 SRBs and a big first and second stage, I was able to out of control get into a high elliptical orbit. It was the worst rocket you could have thought, it had no control, barely worked, and well... sucked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had screenshots but lost\u00A0them but here is the first thing that you should try doing if you get stuck getting into orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Evaluate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the biggest things that we humans fail to do is to evaluate on what just happened. And that is something that helped make progress was to look at went wrong. I remember at one point where I was looking at the prograde and realize that is what I am using to know where I am going. It\u0027s important to observe the failing points of any craft. I still do this today, my first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is a good example and you can watch that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRf1bOmUeec\u0026amp;t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere and see how many revisions I made \u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still see this problem all over the place and am guilty of the same thing. If you go deep into my forum activity you can find some posts I made about trying to do the Expedition Dres mission THAT STILL HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the timeline, ok I got to orbit, but it was a sucky one. so I decided the best way to go was to make a science save and start learning how to fly, this was a starting point of when I wanted to learn parts of KSP better. I had a very old video but I don\u0027t want to share it. But something I did wrong here was that I didn\u0027t do much that help make progress. But I discovered something when I went back on track for getting into the Mun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Tutorials help, but won\u0027t do all the work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found that tutorials on how to get to orbit and how to get to the Mun where very useful (like how I used ShadowZone\u0027s tutorial [and was actually how I discovered SZ].) And one thing I realized is that when you use all tutorials, they help at first, but using them in the long run actually puts you down. Because I learned orbital mechanics easier from the tutorials but I also copied the designs, making all the learning possibilities little to none. The latest I felt like this was when I was learning to fly and Eve lander, it took me over a year and that was because I wasn\u0027t really experimenting with designs (and some cheats that where useful wheren\u0027t\u00A0out.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo back to the story. Four days after I got the game it finally happened after two attempts at landing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002272.00\u0022 style=\u0022width:300px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022682\u0022 alt=\u0022crewmuns-first-landing-1.png?w=682\u0026amp;h=\u0022 src=\u0022https://kerbalanders.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/crewmuns-first-landing-1.png?w=682\u0026amp;h=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the only screenshot I still have of it today. It was an amazing milestone, and the crazy part was I did it on vacation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there was some kind of nerve I had with it. To get here, I lost a kerbal, and I didn\u0027t keep my quicksaves so he was gone. I felt bad about it at first tbh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\none of the easiest things that you can mistakenly do is to get sidetracked. I feel like I lost my progress from here on out. I tried making taller and wider and better landers after this design was used 3 times, but I never got it to work. It would take me four months to do another Mun crew mission successfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is where I feel like it\u0027s important to realize about one of the worst things you can say to yourself: I can\u0027t do it. That\u0027s what I told myself every single time I tried. And one time I remember telling myself okay this is the day. And after trying one hour trying to land on the mun I said it was impossible and only if you are lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso two months later after playing around in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, I decided I should look at another destination. Minmus. I did it!

Generally failure is frustrating especially if you put hours of work into it. I felt exactly like this when doing a Duna mission, before my first Duna mission I had around 5 failure attempts. All of which I put tons of effort into. Something I didn\u0027t realize at the time is that you learn from each without noticing and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKDe094o-Q8\u0026amp;t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere is a good video of why\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes failures will cause me to cancel missions like my Comet Camp but sprout into new ones of what I learned which lead me to make Vall Mobile and Private Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut after a few attempts of trial and error I finally made it.

At this point it\u0027s where I made a quest to explore Kerbol system for my ownself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI later did an Ike mission and after that, I joined the Forums... which is kinda cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to timeskip my first return of crew, my first base, and some other things to skip to a mission I have never really revealed to the public. Huoxing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuoxing-1 became my literal nightmare for crew missions. I call it: the mission that never came back. Because this mission had one final problem, return to Kerbin. And I was able to do everything great from this point. Just that one return to Kerbin problem, where I didn\u0027t think about aerobraking and thought I could circulize. I didn\u0027t have enough fuel and a year later if I only realized I could have just aerobraked I would have completed the mission.

Which is important to highlight that if you never want to try again, you won\u0027t. sometimes you just have to take that risk and hope that it works out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I decide to take it easy and go with probes.

Was that I was stubborn a lot to try a new lander design, and hope for the best with the current one. I then finally thought of possible ideas and after flying three whole missions to laythe, I finally got a lander that worked. I tried 4 times with number one, 17 with two, and once with three. Now with more current cheats I am able to change my lander a lot faster (which made Eve Crew Lander mission easier.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually I got that to work but the biggest challenge yet was by far Eve Crew Mission. It took me another whole year of KSP to successfully do it. Which is honestly probably the hardest process I took on over September 2019 through August 2020, relearning KSP. I tried to learn better efficiency, better launch profiles, d/V savers, and of course no more clipping habits.\u00A0\u00A0One of the hardest things you can do in KSP is to relearn how to play it. I had redeveloped how I played KSP and abandoned all my inefficient habits. So the last tip I have for new players or players that are stuck is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E6. Small things make big missions\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started last year doing The Doodling Adventures which focused on making more efficient spacecraft and make them WAY smaller. I learned new tricks, got better, and even made memories. I still think the craziest one to me at least was the Moho Lander which surprisingly took a whole lot less than I previously thought. Starting with small missions to develop better skills is important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;-\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s where I am going to leave it off, I hope this tutorial and guide helped you with your current issue or if you just started.
