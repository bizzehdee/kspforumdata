Debug menu is basically the only solution that works well for this. Editing the save file is possible but it takes much longer and the chance to mess up your entire save is also much higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not\u00A0cheating to use the debug menu\u00A0since you did do the mission and are using the menu to fix a bug (it would be cheating if you did not actually complete the mission correctly in the first place, but then it\u0027s a single player game so you can do whatever you want really).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
