People always are complaining about how ASAS uses too much RCS, how the various docking assistant mods use too much as well, etc. etc. At the same time, others complain of the difficulties of unbalanced RCS while docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never understood any of these complaints. I learned to dock from only watching a couple of Scott Manley videos- and no tutorials at that. I\u0027m not bragging: it was a stupid way for anyone to learn. It took me literally 4 hours and 41 launches to rendezvous and dock a single 2 ton station module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of my learning troubles, however, I\u0027ve never used ASAS or any of the mods. I gratuitously abuse timewarp\u0027s magic ability to violate the law of conservation of angular momentum, but that\u0027s really my only mechanized assistance. I don\u0027t find docking unbalanced modules particularly difficult- even the heaviest things I\u0027ve docked which come in somewhere near 120 tons really don\u0027t pose an issue for me. If you just go slowly, it\u0027s just a question of adjusting for each translation and watching the navball closely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose my question is two part then. The first would be, why do people find docking with unbalanced RCS so difficult, and the second would be, after learning to dock this way, would using ORDA or even just ASAS be worth it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only ask because I\u0027m designing a second- generation command vehicle and don\u0027t know whether I want it to have alot of RCS (in this case, 2.5 tons of it for a 15 ton craft) or just enough for a docking or two (.5 tons of it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~WWTI?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRabbit","CreatedById":58249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T00:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t find that ASAS uses all that much RCS.
