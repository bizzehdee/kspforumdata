I only mentioned it because you said your shuttles were huge. And they are compared to things like a kerbal truck, but that\u0027s because kerbals are small. I imagine if we were to be placed in a version of one of your shuttles they\u0027d be quite cramped for us. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sorry for the confusion. I\u0027ve seen the shots you posted of the original KSO with the interior in place and actually stumbled upon them awhile ago when the S25 was still in development.
