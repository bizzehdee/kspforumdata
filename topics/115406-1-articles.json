In case you\u0027re wondering I\u0027m playing on a 21 in monitor typically @ 1920x1080 but sometimes 1680x1050 for a performance boost if needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother complaint i have is that you cant choose what missions are being shown. This would be nice bc they tend to get in the way of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the camera would be great if you could set it into chase mode. The zoom also never seems to go in far enough when fine tuning trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone else has suggestions to ease my pain plz plz hit me with them cuz orbital tuning is such a pita atm for me(mehbe im lazy?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else think a little Orbital view overhaul would be nice?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, first; welcome to the forums!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and second, this would probably be better if posted to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESuggestions section\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I can suggest is that if you click on the Ap/Pe markers then the values displayed with them will remain without needing to hover the mouse over them. They are visible through the planet so with the values shown you can make adjustments and not need to change view to see them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean a camera chase mode while in map view? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get better view on maneuver nodes by using the tab key, that will cycle through what you are focused on and you can focus on the node rather than the craft, in some cases (particularly with nodes that are a long way off) that helps (backspace while in map mode will reset your focus back to your craft, off course it\u0027s also the abort shortcut key when in regular view so....caution). Another thing is just to double click on the planet, for adjusting nodes that are near to a planet I find that can help quite a bit (again backspace will return focus to the craft).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not using PreciseNode, you\u0027re just asking for frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EContractWindow is a great mod that can manage your display of contracts (grouping, hiding, showing rewards, order by, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bigtimbers","CreatedById":147721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T02:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant I will check out those mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I am familiar with the orbital controls but I just find everything overly difficult.
