And yet we\u0027re still stuck with super simplistic IVA\u0027s. Not that this is the modder\u0027s fault. To my understanding IVA\u0027s aren\u0027t the funnest thing to put together compared to parts, and this is worsened when we want more than just MFD\u0027s or stock style toddler buttons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to procrastination and many life issues, I never really got started short of thinking up all the features I\u0027d want to include by the end of it.

I\u0027m an idea person and all this crap is distracting. So I\u0027m going to vomit it all up here. And I do humbly request that I be spared the usual \u0022You\u0027re planning too much stuff when you haven\u0027t even installed Unity yet Gth\u0022 type stuff. I don\u0027t expect much of this to be within reach anytime soon, but they are things I want to shoot for eventually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 0:\u00A0 Convert/Create a series of MAS props to cover the entire range of NASA IVA\u0027s from Mercury to Apollo.\u00A0 This will be relatively simple, just a time consuming process. I\u0027m doing this as in order to properly replicate the real interiors, a set of props will need to be created specifically for this purpose, and as MAS is set to replace RPM, there\u0027s no reason to try and create a bunch of props for RPM. (originally some of the initial ivas would have been half and half or even full RPM)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have set up an excel file documenting each and every single switch in all four vessels (those being Mercury, Gemini, Apollo CM, and Apollo LM) to track my progress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 1: Creation of IVA\u0027s.\u00A0 This is going to follow a simple pattern. Once I complete a set of props for the IVA, I will put the IVA together and release. So this means Mercury will come first, then gemini, and so on. Plan is for Lunar Module to come stock with emergency 3 seat option. Whether it will just be an open 3rd seat (and the module only configured for 2 kerbals obviously) or some kind of IVA switch mechanism is unclear at this time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 2: Re-model of Apollo Command Module IVA. The Initial one will be set up to work and have something for it, but a re-model is something I\u0022ll have to tackle and that will take time. So instead of leaving the set incomplete I will put out a basic one using hte model we have, then release a revamped version once the new model is finished and set up. This may also be accompanied by a Hammock mode for the LM to roleplay those rest periods on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 3: ETS specific IVA\u0027s for Apollo. With new model, it will be worthwhile to create these properly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 4: Features.\u00A0 This will likely be a split from this specific mod, but this is where things like simulation mode will be researched and developed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n___\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace where I thank all the people that helped me through the nonsense:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinetic Sloth - for helping me work through the kinks of working with unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoarDV - for being the holy grandfather of IVA stuff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-21T04:34:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2018 04:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0026#039;th\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-14T12:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223354104\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523692547\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298595\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0027th\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, G\u0027th said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom general knowledge, may have to reach out on how to get certain props converted over to MAS so as to ensure I have all props necessary.

Figured this would be easier than PMing you given this question kinda goes both ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m running into an issue that, while for now I can work around, in the future is going be rather problematic. And that is the sheer amount of analog switches that the CM has. Placing them isn\u0027t an issue, but what I\u0027m concerned about is having these switches actually do something. In the prop packs I can find -some- switches that are already designated as things I can use for certain functions (Like an abort switch, and a staging switch for instance). But there is also a lot missing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is most apparent as what I\u0027d like to do is have analog style switches for all of the control functions (Like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, direction holds, etc) and unless I\u0022m just missing them, they\u0027re not already set up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to get to the point, is it possible to place a blank switch, and then configure it for these functions, or is going to be a matter of setting up an entire new prop? Neither one really bothers me (because either way its a matter of messing around with configs from my understanding), but I\u0027m not sure how to approach it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the stage I\u0027m at now with the IVA much of whats left to populate is just switches. And while most of them will just be blanks (as not every switch in the CM has a gameplay counterpart in KSP), where applicable it would be good to have some of the switches be functional.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for everybody else, here\u0027s a picture of where I\u0027m at.\u00A0 The locations are a tad bit more accurate now for what I\u0027m working with with this model. And I\u0027m also aware the scaling may be...off on some objects. This will be tweaked and fine tuned as I go along. Right now I\u0022m mostly concerned with getting stuff into the IVA and approximately where it should be. Then I\u0027ll tweak from there to get it as perfect as it can get before its time to make a new IVA model altogether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AtRBflt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022573\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AtRBflt.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we\u0027re looking at is essentially the left section of the Instrument Panel and part of the center section.

GameData/MOARdV/MAS_ASET/Switch_Toggle_Modular.\u00A0 These are all of the toggle switches I\u0027ve configured for MAS (not a lot, since I\u0027m currently working in a modern IVA design with few mechanical switches).\u00A0 Copy any one of those to your own props working directory.\u00A0 For the sake of illustration, grab MAS_toggle_IMP_Power.cfg and open it in your favorite text editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick tour of the MAS prop config: At the top is the name.\u00A0 That\u0027ll change, obviously, to reflect what the switch does.\u00A0 The next few entries are MODEL nodes.\u00A0 Refer to the ASET Modular Toggle Switch Manual, and you\u0027ll see what each of these components are, and what options you have for changing them.\u00A0 These control a) how the model looks, and b) which parts you can click on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this prop\u0027s case, you have the TgglBase, which is used on every prop.\u00A0 The TggleBase includes the transforms for adding labels to the switch, as described in the manual.\u00A0 Next, there is TgglLever_Type_5, which is a conventional toggle switch.\u00A0 For an Apollo-style toggle, you may want to use Type 1 or Type 3.\u00A0 After the lever, there\u0027s TggleBase_Bcklt_12, which is a simple rounded square border.\u00A0 There are several options here, depending on whether you use a guard on the switch or not (the IMP Power switch does not, but the manual shows you toggle guards,\u00A0and MAS_toggle_Abort uses a guard).\u00A0 Lastly, there\u0027s the collider model, TgglCollider_SNGL.\u00A0 You can select between 1, 2, or 3 colliders, depending on the action the switch will perform.\u00A0 For an action group toggle, for instance, a single collider is sufficient.\u00A0 This prop does not use a switch cover, but the abort switch does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these switch component options may seem overwhelming, but remember that you don\u0027t have to customize every single switch\u0027s model.\u00A0 If you get a particular combination you like, you can copy the config, change the name, label, and actions, and that\u0027s it.\u00A0 Maybe 1-2 minutes per prop once the basic style is done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, let\u0027s assume we\u0027re making the Action Group 1 toggle.\u00A0 In your copy of the file, change the name to something like MAS_toggle_AG1 (and change the file name so it is easier to find).\u00A0 Beneath the MODEL nodes is a single MODULE, the MASComponent.\u00A0 This module is the guts of a MAS prop.\u00A0 In this particular IVA, it consists of four subcomponents.\u00A0 Some props may have more, some fewer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe COLLIDER_EVENT determines what happens when the prop is clicked.\u00A0 Since this prop has a single collider (per the MODEL node), there is only one COLLIDER_EVENT.\u00A0 The name in the \u0022collider\u0022 section corresponds with the one collider named in the manual for the single collider prop.\u00A0 Right now, its onClick function is a little bit complicated, but you can ignore that for now.\u00A0 Change the onClick to \u0022onClick =\u00A0\u003Ca

nofollow\u0022\u003Efc.ToggleActionGroup(1)\u003C/a\u003E\u0022.\u00A0 This means every time the switch is clicked on, it will toggle AG 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeneath the COLLDER_EVENT is a ROTATION node.\u00A0 This node rotates part of the prop.\u00A0 The \u0022transform\u0022 that it rotates is the controlled transform for that lever style.\u00A0 You will want to change the variable to \u0022variable =\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki/MASFlightComputerProxy#fcgetactiongroupdouble-groupid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efc.GetActionGroup(1)\u003C/a\u003E\u0022, so the switch position updates when the action group is toggled.\u00A0 The range / blend / cycleRate entries here are used so that the switch doesn\u0027t instantly flip on and off, so it looks a little more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe TEXT_LABEL has a lot of fields in it.\u00A0 As it is configured now, it works well for the IVAs I build.\u00A0 You may want to tweak some of those, like font size and transformOffset.\u00A0 The down side to TEXT_LABEL is that it is not visible in Unity - you will have to launch KSP and enter IVA to see how it looks.\u00A0 At the very bottom of this node is the text - you\u0027ll probably want to change it to \u0022text = AG1\u0022.\u00A0 If you wanted a label on the bottom of the switch, you would add another TEXT_LABEL node, changing the transform and anchor, and possibly transformOffset.\u00A0 The \u0022variable\u0022 entry and \u0022blend\u0022 do\u00A0a couple of things - first, the blend allows the brightness of the text label to change smoothly like it is connected to a dimmer switch (which is exactly what the prop\u00A0MAS_swRotary_InstrumentLight is).\u00A0 Second,\u00A0fc.Conditioned() allows MAS to cut off the value when there is no power on the vessel, or randomly when g-forces exceed a limit.\u00A0 Those details are configured in the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki/MASFlightComputer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMASFlightComputer\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 The active color is the emissive color of the text when the backlight is fully active.\u00A0 The passive color is the diffuse color of the text when the backlight is off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast is the

I\u0027m doing this as in order to properly replicate the real interiors, a set of props will need to be created specifically for this purpose, and as MAS is set to replace RPM, there\u0027s no reason to try and create a bunch of props for RPM. (originally some of the initial ivas would have been half and half or even full RPM)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have set up an excel file documenting each and every single switch in all four vessels (those being Mercury, Gemini, Apollo CM, and Apollo LM) to track my progress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 1: Creation of IVA\u0027s.\u00A0 This is going to follow a simple pattern. Once I complete a set of props for the IVA, I will put the IVA together and release. So this means Mercury will come first, then gemini, and so on. Plan is for Lunar Module to come stock with emergency 3 seat option. Whether it will just be an open 3rd seat (and the module only configured for 2 kerbals obviously) or some kind of IVA switch mechanism is unclear at this time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 2: Re-model of Apollo Command Module IVA. The Initial one will be set up to work and have something for it, but a re-model is something I\u0022ll have to tackle and that will take time. So instead of leaving the set incomplete I will put out a basic one using hte model we have, then release a revamped version once the new model is finished and set up. This may also be accompanied by a Hammock mode for the LM to roleplay those rest periods on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 3: ETS specific IVA\u0027s for Apollo. With new model, it will be worthwhile to create these properly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 4: Features.\u00A0 This will likely be a split from this specific mod, but this is where things like simulation mode will be researched and developed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-21T15:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds great.
