Game crashed today for a second time and honestly this type of crash is not uncommon even from the past. This is a new clean install that I have done yesterday. I decided to ask for some help, if it will be at all possible. It happens usually when I am moving from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to the Launchpad and it can happen randomly and sometimes with the exact same rocket/spaceship. It does not matter if I use 30 pieces, 100 pieces or whatnot, it just happens at times. 1.3 makes me feel the game runs much faster, although it could be cause I removed a lot of mods I did not need, but I do not feel the game is chocking (except the random hickups, which I guess it is something like cache cleaning).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, you can find all the logs and pictures I have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=11_Wp1BYrHJXbc43MwtEECAs_bUhvGie6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to install my modules and the only things I installed manually are,\u00A0Stock Visual Enhancements v1.2.7.0 with medium textures,\u00A0Environmental Visual Enhancements v1.2.2-1,\u00A0Scatterer\u00A0v0.0324 and manually added the textures from\u00A0Stock Visual Terrain in Texture Replacer along with a custom Galaxy texture box. I use MemGraph\u0027s padheap and have it set to\u00A0total\u00A0: 3072. On the Scatterer I have Ocean: accurate Sky reflection off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if I install my mods through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, I run my game through Steam - \u0026gt; Launch KSP 64 Bit. Some extra info if needed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows 7 Home Premium, Intel Core i5 2310 @2.9GHz, 12GB RAM, ATI Radeon R9 280X 3GB. I run my game at 1536X864, 2x Anti-Alising, V-Sync Every Second V-Blank, 30 FPS limit (forcing it through external app).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be grateful for any help!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
