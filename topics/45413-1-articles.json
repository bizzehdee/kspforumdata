Attaching one to the fueltanks and one or two more stacket on top of the attached plate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reinfoce it i also put on some nova punch struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i launch now on the runway the whole hull just pops off the ship under the weight of the ship. (it is laying on the hull if it\u0027s on the ground)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell it is heavy, so i turned off gravity. All ok it flew around in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, if i touch the ground with 2-10 m/s the same happens. It literally blows/explodes off every single plate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same if i hit it with some light parts thrown at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese struts should hold in my opiniton. I used the 220000 strenght struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug or do i miss something? Or is there a problem with clipping these through each other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t put up some screens, i\u0027m at work right now. but maybe tomorrow if they are really needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  _ _\u003Cbr\u003E/    \\\u003Cbr\u003EO    O\u003Cbr\u003E\\_  _/\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell this is the structure.
