You could launch satellites, probes, etc. and have them move in real time when you are offline and set up an actual calendar for launches, landings, etc. I know this could be done with time warp, just thought it would be cool to have your persistent world move forward at 1x when you are away from the computer. Once a rocket has reached orbit of another body, the user would schedule a maneuver so if they are away from the computer the spacecraft would be in an orbit they set up during their last log on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could also incorporate into the VAB by adding time segments to parts so you have to wait for rockets to be assembled before they are launched. You could then have multiple launch pads and/or VAB buildings to construct rockets and launch at various assembly windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, i think that would be remarkably easy to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand the advantages of the rails system, which EVERYTHING goes into when your not controlling it, is that you can give it a time, and it can figure out the place where that object will be quite easily. So if they save the time you logged off, then load the time you logged in again, compare, and add the difference to the in game clock, they could do this. Then move everything accordingly, and done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what, if I send a rocket somewhere, and have other things to do while it\u0027s suposed to arive it\u0027ll crash because I had real life things to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, that wouldn\u0027t add anything since we have timewarp.

There are both good and bad parts to this, I think. The primary worry being that you would always have to make sure that any craft are either landed or in a stable orbit before you quit. This being a game, however, people may not always have time for that. In addition, I expect most people would want everything to be where they left it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really wanted to, you could almost certainly code a plugin to do this, I think. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somewhere Simulated","CreatedById":88550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T23:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo what, if I send a rocket somewhere, and have other things to do while it\u0027s suposed to arive it\u0027ll crash because I had real life things to do?\u003Cp\u003ENo thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, that wouldn\u0027t add anything since we have timewarp.
