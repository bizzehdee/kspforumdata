And i guess if it\u0027s considered as a kerbal in the game, it can be recover from the center ?"},{"CreatedByName":"JonDahm","CreatedById":145757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T02:50:43Z","Content":"It\u0027s absolutely possible; in fact, there are already mods out there that do just that! I believe the [Infernal Robotics Model Rework](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65365) has an experimental part for taking surface samples. I recommend looking at their work."}]}
