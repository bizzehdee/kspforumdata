As for the Learstar, I had to do a lot of manual thrust balancing to make it fly straight on the way up, but it got into orbit alright. However, on the way down it made the \u0027flying brick\u0027 Space Shuttle seem graceful and crashed into the ocean...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T10:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a video of launch, orbit and landing of the Stearwing. Must take some very careful flying to stretch out the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched the Learstar straight up with SAS on, until it began to get unstable. I cut throttle, dumped the SRBs and big tank then managed to glide it to land on the ground near KSC. \u003Cem\u003ENearly\u003C/em\u003E crashed into the ocean before getting it to pull out of the dive. If KSP had effects for air/water interaction it would have thrown up a rooster tail from the woosh. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Had no mods installed in .90 yet, I was intending to just let it crash but decided to see if I could glide it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried a few times but could not get the Stearwing to do anything but act as a lawn dart without being under power. Stick on a couple of canards and it will glide unpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have with bringing spaceplanes down from orbit is losing altitude fast enough, while not getting too low and hitting that pesky mountain range. MechJeb\u0027s landing guidance is not at all suited for spaceplanes. It might work to get down to a starting altitude and distance to switch over to Spaceplane Guidance with the right target coordinates. I have used Ascent Guidance to get various planes to orbit, though usually after a manual takeoff and several times manually flying quite high before engaging the autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
