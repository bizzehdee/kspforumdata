This is also why NASA hasn\u0027t gone anywhere in the last 40 years (and probably won\u0027t be going anywhere in the next 40 either), because they keep on concentrating on the next shiny vehicle that has no mission instead of focusing on a feasible mission and then on the equipment they need to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is it that we want to accomplish here, and why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering the realities of the Martian... ok, let\u0027s call it \u0022atmosphere\u0022, although in Earth it would be more like a low-grade industrial vacuum... yeah, rockets probably are much more efficient than airplanes. And considering ISRU for fuel and the size of a lifting surface designed for Mars, yeah, probably MUCH less mass to be taken to Mars.

Like I said before, the whole goal seems to just be to get there, plant a flag, and say \u0022We did it!\u0022. While I do like the attitude of it: \u0022We have the technology, so lets stop trying to muck with politics and make this thinkg happen!\u0022\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it does only seem to be a short-term plan. One example of this is the rockets. Directs uses a Big Dumb Booster, while SpaceX focuses on reusability to make spaceflight cheaper in the long run. It will be much cheaper to send hundreds of people a year to Mars if everything is reusable from the get-go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars Direct is designed to be more than a \u0022plant a flag\u0022 mission, after all it would be a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/craft/marirect.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E555 day mission\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eon\u003C/span\u003E Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also designed to create momentum for colonization missions, because it would be using the same hardware as the early missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother benefit of Mars Direct is that you can use it\u0027s hardware for the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T20:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that internet web that SpaceX said they would build?
