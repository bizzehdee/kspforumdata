There is no reason today to launch such a huge effort to go to Mars.\n\nDespite last mission in mid 70s the lunar samples still produce science, not just for the US but for many countries. The primary limitations on our space program is that during the 1980s our government started taking a backward quasi-luditic view of science and medicine. They started a highly targeted view of science in attempt to undermine things that disaggreed with thier life-perspectives on religion, etc. So we get highly targeted stuff (Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes) and alot of science gets mocked. Its all a justification so that the richest in our society can find ways of not paying the same proportion of income as their workers. \n\nIf the government came to me-space program director- a just gave me a ton of $s, in an instant I would do the following\n\n1.

But that takes a huge investment.\n\u003E Wait, is that 50 *mega* tons? Isn\u0027t 50 gigagrams or something? Man that is huge... \n\u003E \n\u003E There are a lot of ways to go about doing a lot of things. Do you mean using a bunch of smaller transfer stages strapped together to act as a big one?\n\u003E \n\u003E And here\u0027s another thing: Why is payload per launch so important? I mean, for the cost of one SLS launch you could launch almost the same payload with other launch vehicles, all in one year. So, maybe payload per year is better? In that case, SLS would be about 70 tonnes/yr, (the average person eats about that much mass of food in his/her whole lifetime, woah!). If we used the average estimates for SLS launch costs, or about 2.75 billion US dollars per launch (wikipedia data), and assuming one launch per year at 70 tonnes per launch... Then you could launch about 7 DIVHs for that cost. That\u0027s 201 tonnes/yr! Of course, this is dependent on future data, which we don\u0027t have. And I doubt the DIVH facilities are able to handle that much use. But what if the money used for developing SLS was used instead to allow the much more economical option of revamping the logistics to allow for almost 7 DIVH launches per year? We would be on Mars in a decade, by my estimate.\n\nOh, a mean *metric* Tons, mT for short. With so many people from all around the world, it\u0027s nice to point out you mean 1,000kg when you say \u0022ton\u0022. Other than that, yeah, we concur, only I would measure the output in \u0026/kg, not kg/year. Mostly because the more kg you launch in a year, the less they will cost.\n\nBy \u0022using many transfer stages\u0022 I meant that to move a 50mT payload, if you need a mass ratio of four and each of your stages is 50mT, you slap three of those to the payload. As to the launcher comments... yeah, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m saying, pick the existing launcher with the best $/Kg rating (within a minimum payload weight, otherwise you burn a big percentage of the mass in docking systems), and mass-poroduce the hell out of it. Seeing that kind of market working for a few years, you can be sure the money to develop cheaper future alternatives will appear by itself.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That would be an amazingly inefficient and dangerous way of exploring the planet. I would go with unmanned quadcopter drones or even blimps. But then if they\u0027re unmanned, why build a base on the surface in the first place?\n\u003E You see, people are going about this the wrong way. Instead of thinking \u0022I want to build a base on Mars, now let\u0027s find a way to justify it\u0022, the rational way of doing it should be \u0022Let\u0027s figure out what we want to accomplish, and then figure out how to do it\u0022. This is also why NASA hasn\u0027t gone anywhere in the last 40 years (and probably won\u0027t be going anywhere in the next 40 either), because they keep on concentrating on the next shiny vehicle that has no mission instead of focusing on a feasible mission and then on the equipment they need to do it.\n\u003E \n\u003E So what is it that we want to accomplish here, and why?\n\nConsidering the realities of the Martian... ok, let\u0027s call it \u0022atmosphere\u0022, although in Earth it would be more like a low-grade industrial vacuum... yeah, rockets probably are much more efficient than airplanes. And considering ISRU for fuel and the size of a lifting surface designed for Mars, yeah, probably MUCH less mass to be taken to Mars. And also, considering you are already using sophisticated autopilots to precisely land propulsively on Mars, airplanes would actually require more development anyway. \n\nSee, a 1/100 Earth\u0027s atmospheric pressure means you need 100 times the lifting area, or 10 times the speed (giving terrific landing speeds, especially for unprepared terrain), or a combination of both. In any case, planes on Mars are scary hypersonic things, and the engines are also a big issue (no handy oxygen atmosphere present to use as oxidizer). And just forget about blimps, they need about 50 times more envelope volume... if envelope mass didn\u0027t go up with it\u0027s size.\n\nAs to objectives, I though we were discussing exploration of the red planet for scientific purposes (NASA\u0027s goal since like, forever), as is the assumption in mission plans like Mars Direct. But yeah, I agree, the world\u0027s space agencies could benefit *a lot* from a focus and leadership infusion of clear-cut objectives. But no one dares utter the word \u0022colonization\u0022 in a serious political discussion, of course.
