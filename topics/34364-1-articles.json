This is why I want to expand it and make it more detailed with more pictures and elaboration \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E . I have already done a slight description which goes more in depth on the assembly capability in ksp and some basic flight info. Lets get a good world impression on Kerbal eh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T02:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI revised the article a while ago, and it is indeed in need of quite a lot of work. It doesn\u0027t just need more description of the game itself, but also more meta-information; what\u0027s so special about the game, what have people been saying about it? With proper citations, of course. The article actually inspired me to actually try out the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
