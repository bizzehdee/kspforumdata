In order to overcome this in macOS, follow these steps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. In the Finder, choose the KSP application so it\u0027s highlighted, but don\u0027t open it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u00A0Choose Get Info from either the File menu, or right clicking\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.
