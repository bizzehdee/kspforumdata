And it -doesn\u0027t- look like RealPlume is installed.  This very well could be causing the errors you are seeing.\n\nIf you -dont- have real-plumes installed, try installing it (both smokescreen and realplume); it might just be that the patches for these are running improperly even when RealPlume is not installed. \n\nLikely some patch is improperly defining a FOR[RealPlume] somewhere, triggering the rest of the effects patches to get processed improperly.

Submit a bug-report to Contares to tell them to fix their patches;  They should not use  FOR block unless they ARE that mod; their real-plumes patches need to be ran in a BEFORE block, or some other method, that does not rely on a FOR[RealPlumes].  This is not a problem that I can solve; their patches are just wrong.  Anytime a mod uses a FOR block on a patch, it triggers module manager into thinking that the mod in that block is installed; which can cause other patches to run even when they shouldn\u0027t.  The proper method is to run their patches in a BEFORE[RealPlume]:NEEDS[RealPlume] type setup; this ensures that the patches only get ran when RealPlume is installed (the NEEDS part), and ensures that they get ran at the right point in time/right order (the BEFORE part).  \n\n2.) Install smokescreen and realplume to fix the problem until Contares can update their patches.\n\n3.) After Contares has fixed their patches you can remove smokescreen/realplume if you don\u0027t want them.\n\n[@blowfish](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/)  is the one who pointed this out to me originally, as SSTU was causing the same problem for other mods.

Fuels added to a part through a RESOURCE block are unsupported as far as I know, the resource needs to be added to the/through the RealFuels ModuleFuelTanks, in whatever method it is that allows you to do that.  You\u0027ll have to ask around the RealFuels thread for info on how to do that, I really have no idea.\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t think the RESOURCE thing I\u0027m encountering is due to RealFuels.  RF has a number of locations where a static RESOURCE block is used.  I was even told by NathanKell to use a RESOURCE block along side ModuleFuelTanks if I wanted to add a Hydrazine tank to a MFT that can\u0027t support Hydrazine.  If you look at the PR I\u0027ve been working on, look at the ICPS and HUS (part of the SLS\\_Upper\\_Stages.cfg).  Both of those have an added RESOURCE block which works fine.
