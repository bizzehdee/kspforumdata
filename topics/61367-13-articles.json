If you choose to make a trailer, you will need to be clever with use of landing gears and little wheels for your connection, forcing you be much more creative but ultimately ending up with a truck with a much lower CoG.

No cheating!

You may have a European, American or a Hybrid design - or anything you can think of really, as long as it looks like a truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.3f There are no restrictions on Vanity Parts - visual parts which serve no function other than to add weight and coolness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4 Wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4a You may have 4 or 6 wheels - 6 wheels are better for spreading 12 tonnes around on and give you some extra power, but 4 wheels will be much easier to handle in the corners so it sort of naturally balances out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4b You may use motors in all wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4c You must only use front wheels for turning. To help reduce wheel friction and chassis stress load, you are allowed to have a limited turn angle on the back axle - UP to 0.35 on the back axle/s (you can have less to smooth it out more). Front wheels/axles are NOT limited, you may have the full x2 angle \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4d You are not restricted to the layout of your wheels - just to spice things up. Any layout is permitted. Wheels must be arranged into Axles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4e You MUST use TR-L2 wheels only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4f Your truck must be fully powered by wheels ONLY.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
