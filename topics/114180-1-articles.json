It burns ethanol and liquid oxygen. But part of the commercial crew contract is that the vehicle can stay on-orbit for the duration of the expedition, which is several months, and liquid oxygen is mildly cryogenic, and will boil off over time. That\u0027s why Cold War-era missiles (which had to be kept in silos for months at a time) quickly switched to (storable) solid or hypergolic fuel!

(so either the rocket work and you make it almost to orbit - and then you use the pusher LES as a OMS for circularization / orbital manoeuver, or you use it as a launch escape system if there\u0027s a problem with the rocket during all the phases of ascent.
