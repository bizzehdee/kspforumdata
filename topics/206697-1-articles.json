However, when I reparent using \u0022keep transform\u0022 the transforms are not preserved. Initially, they appear to be preserved (the model looks exactly the same as before reparenting), but when I export the model and re-import it, the model looks as though I reparented without \u0022keep transform\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it helps,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MacKenzieHnC/KipardSkylon/blob/master/BrokenWheels/SkylonNoseGear.mu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is the model I\u0027m working on.

I use BforArtist 2 version 2.7 (equivalent of Blender 2.93alpha) which is a fork of blender and the last version I know for sure will accept the plugin. The plugin was never finished and it falls down in many areas. I get around them when I can and learn to live with it when I can\u0027t. I always have the problem when I drag parts in from a different .mu, into the part I am building. So I have learned to drag the parts in without manipulating them at all, Export the file, start a new session and then import the export back in. Now that it is back you can see which way around the export put them and work from there. When you manipulate them in the new import, they will stay that way when you export it next time. Always create a new export so that if anything stuffs up you don\u0027t lose everything. You can clear out old ones once you are sure things have gone right. I have no idea how to create animations from scratch, so if you do, I would love some info.

I don\u0027t think it has anything to do with KSP and is just a Blender issue. For reasons I haven\u0027t yet figured out, it\u0027s not adjusting the translations to be relative to the new parent.

However, when I reparent using \u0022keep transform\u0022 the transforms are not preserved. Initially, they appear to be preserved (the model looks exactly the same as before reparenting), but when I export the model and re-import it, the model looks as though I reparented without \u0022keep transform\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it helps,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MacKenzieHnC/KipardSkylon/blob/master/BrokenWheels/SkylonNoseGear.mu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is the model I\u0027m working on.

I have seen that \u0022keep transform\u0022 does not work with skew transformations, but I don\u0027t think deformation of any kind is occurring with these models, and that does not appear to be the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: So far, the only clue I\u0027ve found is that I can get the same effect as the error by manually rotating the object around the root into the position/rotation I want and then selecting \u0022clear parent inverse\u0022.
