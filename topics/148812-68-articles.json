Some twenty years before the game takes place (2018 in Strangereal), an asteroid called Ulysses made planetfall. Despite a network of massive totally practical railguns and superweapons to defend Earth, fragments of asteroids still landed and wreaked havoc on civilization... Not sure how no one thought how shooting asteroids with railguns would make a bunch of fragments, but Ace Combat is not realistic by a long shot anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game\u0027s main character and player\u0027s character Trigger is a pilot of the Osean Air Defense Force. He was a rookie pilot when the war broke out. You see, an Osean president named Vincent Harling commissioned the construction of the International Space Elevator, nicknamed Lighthouse. The ISEV was built close enough to Erusea that they felt as though Osea was doing it as a show of control. They declared war on Osean and shipped advanced drones via shipping containers to Osea to strike military and naval bases across the country. Trigger participated in a few missions with the International Union Peacekeeping Force engaging in missions against drones and this massive flying wing airborne aircraft carrier drone thing called the Arsenal Bird, before participating in an attempted rescue mission to rescue ex-pres Harling from the elevator and accidentally fired a missile at his liaison aircraft and killed him. Whoops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re then sent to the 444th Air Base penal unit \u0022Spare Squadron\u0022 as Spare 15 and will do a few missions as well as meeting some new squadmates like Count and Tabloid (those are callsigns). Trigger also duels with an enemy ace pilot named Mihaly\u00A0Dumitru Margareta Corneliu Leopold Blanca Karol Aeon Ignatius Raphael Maria Niketas A.\u00A0Shilage (I\u0027m serious). Mihaly ends up escaping, but the mission was considered a success. You\u0027re then pardoned and transferred to the elite Strider Squadron of the Long-Range Strategic Strike Group and become Strider 1. You take down one Arsenal Bird with the help of your squadron and also that massive planetary defense railgun I talked about, do a nighttime canyon run, and finally invade Farbanti, the capital of Erusea and engaging Sol Squadron (Mihaly\u0027s elite experimental squadron) before Mihaly gets away again but it\u0027s not really your fault because some geniuses as Osea and Erusea\u0027s high commands decided to engage in a full on anti-satellite attack, which led to the entire continent (Usea)\u0027s satellite network being destroyed by the Kessler Syndrome that followed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one can contact HQ or other forces, friendly fire is common now because the IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) systems were satellite-based, Erusea is plunged into civil war between conservative and radical powers, nothing makes sense...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou provide air cover for a betraying Erusean general who tells you that you didn\u0027t in fact kill the president, and it was a drone built of Osean parts, giving it an Osean IFF ping, making it seem like friendly fire. Speaking of friendly fire, some Osean fighter accidentally shoots down the general\u0027s aircraft due to misinformation and stuff. In the next mission, your air base crew is focused on just surviving. You raid some Erusean supply depot at Shilage Castle and then engage Sol Squadron and Mihaly in his advanced X-02 Wyvern, equipped with forward swept wings and a railgun for air-to-air combat. What\u0027s with this game and railguns? You then defeat him for real this time, and he manages to transmit to you, asking for forgiveness and telling you to stop the drone production. It turns out Mihaly was supplying flight data to the Erusean drones, and his data was successfully uploaded to two advanced ADF-11F drones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou and an allied force of Osean and Erusean fighters launch an attack on the last of the two Arsenal Birds, hoping to just end the war. You end up managing to take it down, but then the two drones attack and you are forced to retreat. You then come back with what\u0027s left of the air forces and defeat the two ADF-11Fs, but it turns out one of them managed to use its escape pod unit and is still flying. It dives into the space elevator\u0027s underground maintenance tunnel. You and Count follow it through the claustrophobic tunnel. After shooting it down in the Space Elevator\u0027s internal chamber, you fly directly vertical through the hollow elevator and escape, and then there\u0027s a nice outro cutscene and happy ending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, really good game, very engaging storyline, and I would recommend it to any enjoyer of fighter jets and unrealistic aviation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img%5D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OEzXN0Z.png%5B/img%5D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nSpare Squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img%5D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k35S57o.png%5B/img%5D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nStrider Squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img%5D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TuvvyGE.png%5B/img%5D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022The Three Strikes\u0022 Independent Squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-27T18:30:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2024 06:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 27\u0022\u003EApril 27\u003C/time\u003E by TwoCalories\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abel Military Services","CreatedById":219257,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-03T05:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224383058\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714233466\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228871\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TwoCalories\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/27/2024 at 11:57 PM, TwoCalories said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve only gotten the Top Gun: Maverick DLC because it was bundled with the base game on sale on Steam and it was cheaper than the base game or Season Pass at the moment.

Some twenty years before the game takes place (2018 in Strangereal), an asteroid called Ulysses made planetfall. Despite a network of massive totally practical railguns and superweapons to defend Earth, fragments of asteroids still landed and wreaked havoc on civilization... Not sure how no one thought how shooting asteroids with railguns would make a bunch of fragments, but Ace Combat is not realistic by a long shot anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game\u0027s main character and player\u0027s character Trigger is a pilot of the Osean Air Defense Force. He was a rookie pilot when the war broke out. You see, an Osean president named Vincent Harling commissioned the construction of the International Space Elevator, nicknamed Lighthouse. The ISEV was built close enough to Erusea that they felt as though Osea was doing it as a show of control. They declared war on Osean and shipped advanced drones via shipping containers to Osea to strike military and naval bases across the country. Trigger participated in a few missions with the International Union Peacekeeping Force engaging in missions against drones and this massive flying wing airborne aircraft carrier drone thing called the Arsenal Bird, before participating in an attempted rescue mission to rescue ex-pres Harling from the elevator and accidentally fired a missile at his liaison aircraft and killed him. Whoops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re then sent to the 444th Air Base penal unit \u0022Spare Squadron\u0022 as Spare 15 and will do a few missions as well as meeting some new squadmates like Count and Tabloid (those are callsigns). Trigger also duels with an enemy ace pilot named Mihaly\u00A0Dumitru Margareta Corneliu Leopold Blanca Karol Aeon Ignatius Raphael Maria Niketas A.\u00A0Shilage (I\u0027m serious). Mihaly ends up escaping, but the mission was considered a success. You\u0027re then pardoned and transferred to the elite Strider Squadron of the Long-Range Strategic Strike Group and become Strider 1. You take down one Arsenal Bird with the help of your squadron and also that massive planetary defense railgun I talked about, do a nighttime canyon run, and finally invade Farbanti, the capital of Erusea and engaging Sol Squadron (Mihaly\u0027s elite experimental squadron) before Mihaly gets away again but it\u0027s not really your fault because some geniuses as Osea and Erusea\u0027s high commands decided to engage in a full on anti-satellite attack, which led to the entire continent (Usea)\u0027s satellite network being destroyed by the Kessler Syndrome that followed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one can contact HQ or other forces, friendly fire is common now because the IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) systems were satellite-based, Erusea is plunged into civil war between conservative and radical powers, nothing makes sense...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou provide air cover for a betraying Erusean general who tells you that you didn\u0027t in fact kill the president, and it was a drone built of Osean parts, giving it an Osean IFF ping, making it seem like friendly fire. Speaking of friendly fire, some Osean fighter accidentally shoots down the general\u0027s aircraft due to misinformation and stuff. In the next mission, your air base crew is focused on just surviving. You raid some Erusean supply depot at Shilage Castle and then engage Sol Squadron and Mihaly in his advanced X-02 Wyvern, equipped with forward swept wings and a railgun for air-to-air combat. What\u0027s with this game and railguns? You then defeat him for real this time, and he manages to transmit to you, asking for forgiveness and telling you to stop the drone production. It turns out Mihaly was supplying flight data to the Erusean drones, and his data was successfully uploaded to two advanced ADF-11F drones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou and an allied force of Osean and Erusean fighters launch an attack on the last of the two Arsenal Birds, hoping to just end the war. You end up managing to take it down, but then the two drones attack and you are forced to retreat. You then come back with what\u0027s left of the air forces and defeat the two ADF-11Fs, but it turns out one of them managed to use its escape pod unit and is still flying. It dives into the space elevator\u0027s underground maintenance tunnel. You and Count follow it through the claustrophobic tunnel. After shooting it down in the Space Elevator\u0027s internal chamber, you fly directly vertical through the hollow elevator and escape, and then there\u0027s a nice outro cutscene and happy ending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, really good game, very engaging storyline, and I would recommend it to any enjoyer of fighter jets and unrealistic aviation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OEzXN0Z.png%5B/img%5D\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img%5D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OEzXN0Z.png%5B/img%5D\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nSpare Squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k35S57o.png%5B/img%5D\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img%5D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k35S57o.png%5B/img%5D\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nStrider Squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TuvvyGE.png%5B/img%5D\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022img%5D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TuvvyGE.png%5B/img%5D\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022The Three Strikes\u0022 Independent Squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust finished Mihaly with CFA-44.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m playing Blue Archive these days, it\u0027s a really good game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game takes place in \u003Cs\u003EFlorida\u00A0\u003C/s\u003EKivotos, a city full of female superhuman students with guns.
