It\u0027s also quite common to have strange forces applied to your vessels when EVA constructing, if your engineer is moving relative to either vessel then clicking to attach a part can clip it slightly inside it, potentially allowing it to briefly exert a force on the vessel it\u0027s being attached to before the game realises it\u0027s attached; though 24m/s seems pretty excessive for that. It\u0027s a good idea to have your engineer grab on to something like a pod or ladder to stop this from happening, and to dock/grab the two vessels together to stop them drifting relative to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"imWACC0","CreatedById":21584,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-22T17:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224095201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221645551314\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot all parts can be used for EVA construction\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthough 24m/s seems pretty excessive for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...engineer grab on to something like....a ladder to stop this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew they could not landed, but I thought in free fall it was unlimited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrust me, I was quite surprised by it too.
