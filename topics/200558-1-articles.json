This is the second time in 6 months that when starting the game, it gets stuck on the main selection screen, music playing, but nothing happens. The game is unresponsive. I was so close to getting all the trophies unlocked. I had a Jool, an Eeloo mission going. It is a relatively new install (November) on PS5.\u00A0The enhanced edition is a faulty product. Why is it so unstable? You just can\u0027t complete missions anymore. Where is the fun?

KSPEE is optimised for PS4/XB1 and not for 8th gen consoles. It is unstable thanks to the maker of your $800 console, just remember that fact. If it was easier to port over and the port company wasn\u0027t stonewalled by Sony/Microsoft by their console game updates being known as one of the hardest to pass. And because the port company has to worry more about the patch passing the procedures/processes required, and because it takes a significantly longer time because of the rewrite of code, and testing phase. It is fun, on a more basic level, but that\u0027s all because of your favorite console devs.... My advice is, either petition them to relax on their updating games proceedures, or sit back and do nothing. Unfortunately, most PS players feel the same way, and I hear that Sony can be worse than Microsoft with that stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MZ_per_X1","CreatedById":199474,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-22T20:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223930421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200558\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614000728\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196142\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikenike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Mikenike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not a faulty product, but a very buggy one for sure.
