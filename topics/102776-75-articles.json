If you running low on inspiration, its fine with me. Here\u0027s a cool idea: Derso was recently hit by the asteroid, and would have a bunch tiny sub-moons, smaller than Gilly, orbiting it. I know sub-moons are unstable, but these would have formed recently from the impact, and while unstable would be too young to be deorbited. The sub-moons could either be actual bodies or a swarm of asteroids. Make it look like that instead of a hit a thousand years ago, as it used to be, it was hit in the last 50 years. You could have a lava lake where the asteroid hit, and the planet could have a cloud of ash from the impact.\n\nHey but no rush. We\u0027re all still getting over the huge amount of content released in the 2.0 update, I doubt anyone will really care if Derso took a bit of time to be made. Your mod is amazing, and we can all get over a small moon not being finished.\n\nAlso, the Sonnah in the title screen is a weird shade of pale yellow? Rings are normal, and so is in game, but do you know what the cause is?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-25T11:40:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2016 11:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by BashGordon33**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T16:54:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/24/2016 at 7:43 AM, BashGordon33 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the Sonnah in the title screen is a weird shade of pale yellow?

This is probably a bug from the new Kopernicus version not New Horizons 2.0, so don\u0027t worry, and keep up the good work ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nDoes anyone know if this is still an issue or if it\u0027s been resolved?

There is a work around though: Make a save. Copy and paste the persistent file from the save folder you normally play and paste it in the new save, replacing the persistent in the new save. Play this save folder as soon as you open KSP. The orbits will be messed up, but you have 2 saves so it doesn\u0027t matter. You must go to the tracking station when you open the copy save. Then exit and play your regular save as normal. The bug only affects the first save you open, and only affects it once, per every game launch. It\u0027s an easy but annoying workaround. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-03T04:36:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2016 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by BashGordon33**"},{"CreatedByName":"PT","CreatedById":154223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-03T12:32:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, BashGordon33 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I unfortunately have to upgrade because I have steam and can\u0027t downgrade.\n\u003E \n\nBrace for next update:\n\nGo to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common (or wherever you have it) and just make copy/rename of KSP directory to protect it from Steam.\n\nExample of KSP protected from updates:\n\n![gFaipF6.png](http://i.imgur.com/gFaipF6.png)\n\n\u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 is where Steam puts KSP.

Kopernicus is for KSP 1.1.3 and NH is for 1.1.2 (I know, confusing version numbers for Kopernicus).  NH is the only Kopernicus-related thing I have in this game.\n\nMy problem is that my stuff in orbit around Kerbin won\u0027t hold still.  Everything\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E decreases and its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E increases.  The lower the orbit, the faster this happens and the bigger the changes.  In fact, it\u0027s so bad that orbits below about 300km are essentially useless.  This happens by itself when the ships are on rails, not on physics load.  IOW, I put something in oribt, go do something else, and when I look at it again days later in the tracking center, the orbit has changed.  This happens whether the ship got to the original orbit via rocketry or HyperEdit--makes no difference.\n\nSo questions:  Is this a known bug?  Is this happening for anybody else?  Is this a result of using an obsolete version of NH?  Thanks.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n[![NH Decay 1](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/28059147755_2021310fde_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/JKut4z)\n\nThe station in question was originally in an 80 x 80 orbit.  In a few hours, this had become 72 x 90 so I moved it up to 100 x 100.  And then the above happened.\n\nSo then I moved the station up to 150 x 150 orbit.  That didn\u0027t last long, either.\n\n[![NH Decay 2](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7104/27445232573_815664631b_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/HPeZt4)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-03T15:50:36Z","Content":"What you\u0027re seeing looks a lot like the old Mun orbit bug, only around Kerbin. Which IMHO makes it a bigger practical issue because you can just ignore the Mun but you can\u0027t ignore Kerbin.\n\nFrom what I\u0027ve read the issue at Kerbin is new to KSP 1.1.3 and Kopernicus 1.1 and later. Kopernicus has a hard version lock, so it\u0027s not straightforward to even attempt using an older Kopernicus on the latest KSP or vice versa, something I might otherwise do to try and isolate the issue."}]}
