In this context, \u0022more quickly\u0022 doesn\u0027t quite mean \u0022in less time\u0022; the exact amount of time depends on a lot of factors, such as (in real life) the processor speed, that we really don\u0027t care about -- we care about the sort of thing that depends only on an algorithm, not on how you implement that algorithm. To do this, what we do is look at how much longer it takes a computer to solve the problem if you plug in larger numbers. With some problems, like adding, adding 2 10-digit integers takes only twice as long as adding 2 5-digit integers. With other kinds of problems, like sorting, the time goes up by more - sorting a 10-item list takes more than twice as long as sorting a 5-item list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith many problems, the time it takes to solve them goes up like a polynomial with the size of the input (i.e. if the input is n bits long, there\u0027s some function n^c for a constant c that increases more quickly than the time it takes to solve an n-bit case of the problem). We don\u0027t care exactly what the polynomial is; as far as we care, 2n and 100000n grow about the same rate, because n^1.1 grows faster than both of them. Adding is in this category - it takes around n steps to add n-bit numbers. Sorting is as well - it takes fewer than n^2 steps to sort an n-element list. This group of problems is called P, and it\u0027s essentially the group of problems that computers can solve quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another group of problems called NP. These are problem for which a computer can quickly check that an answer is correct. Anything in P is also in NP - if a problem is easy to solve, it\u0027s easy to check the solution by solving it again. But there are other problems that are easy to check, but we don\u0027t know if they\u0027re easy to solve. Things like factoring numbers into their prime factors are easy to check (just multiply the factors together and see if they make the number in question; checking whether the factors are prime is, surprisingly, in P), but we have no idea if there\u0027s a fast way to actually solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what P vs. NP is about. If P = NP, it means every question for which you can easily check the answer can also be easily solved. On the other hand, if P != NP, it means there are problems that are easy to check but not to solve. A CS professor described P = NP as being pretty much that there is no difference between appreciating a good symphony and being able to write one. Basically everyone would be shocked - utterly shocked - if P = NP; we\u0027re pretty much certain it doesn\u0027t, we just can\u0027t prove it yet (incidentally, PROOF - i.e. \u0022is there a proof of this statement shorter than N characters long?\u0022 - is in NP; if P = NP, a computer can very quickly prove theorems.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T15:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s one, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s actually an unsolvable math question, or just a paradox.\u003Cp\u003EDoes a set of all sets include itself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no such thing as a set of all sets, for basically this reason.
