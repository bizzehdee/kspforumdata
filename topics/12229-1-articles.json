My old characters, have been put on a more serious personality, Jeb is just very brave, hence the smile of determination on takeoff (Usually). Bill is very cautious. Bob is the safety manager, hence the worrying of it being unsafe. Desvan is the Commander, and is very serious. Geoffrey is the pilot, fun loving, but very VERY cautious. And overpowered Bill, might you say. Buzz is the Co - Pilot, and is more fun loving, like Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeoffrey sat back and looked at Escar 5. The massive ship had been docked in the KNSP (Kerbal national space dock) , and was thrusting the engines to warm them up. The year was 0.50 , and scientists had just invented Manned Inter - Stellar travel. The five other Kerbalnauts stared at the ship is amazement too. \u0027This thing\\\u0027s as big as the World Bank building in Avia!\u0027 Exclaimed Jeb as he looked on a giant holographic ruler, from his Killor Tech pad. \u0027Mmm,\u0027 Said Desvan. \u0027Sure hope she\\\u0027s safe..\u0027 Said Bob, checking multiple clipboards at the same time. Bill sighed, \u0027I remember the first rocket we launched. I almost miss the old fun loving Jeb. At least they have KSC. Sort-of.\u0027 KSC was now the KSM (Kerbal Space Meuseum. \u0027First ones that were brave enough to be Kerbalnauts. Back in the year 0.4.\u0027 Said Jeb, looking homesick. \u0027Mmm, we came after you, the Thomprey, Charlie, Mark....\u0027 Said Desvan. The engines died out one more time. \u0027ALL KERBALNAUTS PLEASE BOARD THE SHIP.\u0027 Said a loudspeaker of the wall. They all took one last look at Kerbin. When they got back, everything would be different. The light speed warp drive sped up time for them, but not for others. They then boarded, some crying, some holding back tears. Some kissed their wives at children one last time. As they boarded the ship, the ramps slowly slid back into the ship. And the doors closed. One final time. When they all got to their stations, Bill sniffed, \u0027A-all engines are s-stable.\u0027 A low groan started up, as the habitable area started spinning, creating artificial gravity. Then the whole space dock turned, and the tunnel they were docked in started spinning. Faster, faster, and faster. Until finally Jeb throttled back\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/USLTQVt8QyA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 years later.
