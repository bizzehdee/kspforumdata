You can zoom way out if you lose sight of your destination tag. \u00A0I suspect this may have something to do with them trying to walk in low g situation. I don\u2019t recall if this is a problem\u00A0on Kerbin. Of course the best fix is to unlock the Probodobodyne RoveMate and build a Rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adenosine Triphospate","CreatedById":197303,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-26T11:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using time warp? Even in the stock game, warping whilst moving can create all sorts of wobbles, jittering, flipping, shaking, blending... And not just to Kerbals on EVA, but whole planes in flight (resulting in stalling and even rapid disassembly), landed planes, rovers, anything with wheels, on any celestial body, low g or not.
