I finally decided to\u00A0not aspire to anything like that and just continue and explore KSP in my own way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy team on Duna had yet another day off. Mission Control turned off the feed from their R\u0026amp;R lounge when it was discovered that everybody was in their underwear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it was another day of development work for Dr Horst and Jebediah (who now holds the official title \u0027Chief Development Astronaut\u0027). Since Ikaros_H was considered finished, attention switched to Kronos_C. A Kronos expedition to Laythe is planned to be the next major mission, so some work should be put in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKronos_C received\u00A0a lot of small sheduled\u00A0fixes and planned improvements. A late-minute addition to that was equipping it with two rovers. The new long-wheelbase version, of course.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut then it also got three new features, deviced and executed on the fly. First it got a similar surgery as Ikaros_H, replacing the Command-Habitat complex with a new one, assembled from spaceplane Mk3 components. It\u0027s quite similar, but not identical, to the one adopted for Ikaros_H. Then all the frontal, ejectable, heatshields were removed. This is controversial, since it means that Kronos_C will not be able to do any atmosphere-braking. Kronos_X13 and Kronos_A had to do that, as well as the forrunners, the two ancient Banshees. But Kronos_B performed its mission without having to resort to\u00A0any aero-braking, so Mission Control believes that it\u0027s just a matter of getting the approach to Jool and Laythe right. And Mission Control also feels much have\u00A0been learned, and doubts that Kronos will ever aero-brake again (even if it could). It\u0027s also not a matter of safety. If it fails to get into landing orbit around Laythe, it will still have more than enough fuel to abort and fly home again.\u00A0So the tandem, cruciform stabilizators could also be removed. Finally, solar panels were removed and replaced by a nuclear isotope reactor. This change reflects the long times in shadow behind Jool as well as the distance from the sun. Ultimately, it converts into a weight reduction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new Kronos_C weighs in at 8,425.1 t, representing a weight reduction of 21.5 t from Kronos_B, despite the rovers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe number of stages is also down. Now 48. I think Kronos_B had 51. Toggles are the same, 8.\u003Cbr\u003E\nParts count is up though, 1004 from previous 987.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah spent like 3 hours climbing up and down the ladders, testing. There was in particular one section which proved a considerable problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut testing of the Kronos_C is by no means considered finished. More work remains.

station in 100km LKO. It\u0027s mostly there to refuel SSTOs. Ever since my career game decided to drop every contract, I\u0027ve turned back over to the sandbox side of the force where I build gigantic and fairly useless bases and stations more on aesthetic than function that make my poor potato macbook cry. But building them still gives me good feelings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one thing I can\u0027t seem to figure out is how I licked the asteroid dry so fast. D class ~300 tons. Was at 93% resources when I grabbed it. The transporter took about 10k units of ore and it said that it was at about 80%. So I should have only used 1/9th the resources getting it into position. Got the station hooked up and started mining it. Only got about another 10k units of ore until it ran dry. (That main tank holds about 30k liquid fuel and 30k oxidizer.) I\u0027ve got about 5K in there now. Pretty much just a puddle in the bottom of the tank. That or maybe that percentage is proportional to the \u0027roid\u0027s total mass and not linear. (BRB doing the maths) uhm... yeah... must be, that makes sense based on my rough calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Checked the Wiki, 300T is on the low end for D

\u00A0A partial abort was called - the lander would not land at all, but Mellin Kerman was permitted to transfer to Minmus orbit, take science readings, complete a test contract for the lander engine slated to take place in Minmus orbit, and return home - landing and reentry were scrapped. \u00A0Shortly, a well-proven Mercy III rocket was launched to rendezvous with the Cardinal I in orbit, and

rocket passed into the shadow of the Mun. \u00A0Contact was reestablished shortly after they returned to sunlight on the other side, but they had already missed a Munar orbital insertion burn because the automated guidance was out. \u00A0While solar powered, the onboard systems\u0027 batteries simply didn\u0027t have much capacity. \u00A0With \u0022plenty of spare fuel\u0022, they made a late
