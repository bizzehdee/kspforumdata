It\u0027s on a 2.5m plate/tank end, but the engine itself looks like it would fit on a 1.25m base. If I saw it and didn\u0027t know what it was, I\u0027d expect Skipper-level thrust. There\u0027s not really that much need for a 2.5m engine with more than about 1500 kN outside RSS, so I\u0027m fine with leaving the thrust where it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp is weaker than the real-world counterpart, but balanced fairly well against the engines in KSP 0.23 and below.

That\u0027s a satisfactory TWR when you\u0027re in the stock-size system comparing with stock engines. Upgrading to realistic TWR would go well with RSS, but I don\u0027t think an engine that good would be fun outside RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ruifung","CreatedById":102010,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T00:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-snip-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) The Magnetic Nozzle currently has gaps between the model ends, and the nodes.

The less dense the exhaust gasses, and the thicker the atmosphere, the smaller the engine nozzle. The Raptor would also work on a much more advanced fuel cycle (Full Flow Staged Combustion), which reduces the total size of the engine by eliminating the need for certain components, and allowing others to be smaller/thinner. Part of the reason its TWR is supposed to be so high for a rocket engine is because it would produce a lot of thrust.

Then just add some fuel destined for your orbital fuel depot, or some small probes, as secondary cargo. Also, start to get in the habit of stacking multiple payloads onto one rocket...
