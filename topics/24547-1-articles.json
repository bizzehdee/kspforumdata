Currently if I am sitting on the launchpad I can click the resource panel and it works fine, but as soon as I have launched (assuming I DID NOT open the resource panel before launch) the resource panel button becomes unclickable and appears to be slightly \u0022warped\u0022 (the word \u0022Resource\u0022 looks ever so slightly \u0022italic\u0022). As a secondary consequence, I then also am unable to transfer fuel from one tank to another in that \u0022Alt-click\u0022 does nothing. It\u0027s not a game breaker since I just have to remember to click it before launch but I was just wondering if anyone else ran into this as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T18:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I\u0027ve had this problem too.
