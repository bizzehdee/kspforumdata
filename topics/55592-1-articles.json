I did not practice speaking english for a long time now. But I will come into it again...dont worrie^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope the quality of my english is good enough and the overall quality is okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I post the Link to the Playlist-Container which has actually 4 playlists (2 english and 2 german tutorial series). I want to say that I record the stuff in German language and then record and synchronise it with english audio. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to keep the timing at the point. But it of course is not 100% correct and so for it has some parts in the video where I had some spoken pause where no pause should be...same for mouse movement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to upload more stuff today...but as it is a pain in the arse to edit and mux audio content with Cubase, Eidus (I accidentely overwrite a save in Eidus...so I had to demux and re-mux the audio again to not being used to encode the already encoded video (quality-wise)). But now that Im in the flow of using the programs (long time ago that I used them^^) it should be easy going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk..here we go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/Duke49th/videos?shelf_id=9\u0026amp;view=50\u0026amp;sort=dd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/Duke49th/videos?shelf_id=9\u0026amp;view=50\u0026amp;sort=dd\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(More Videos coming up in the next few days..I hope to upload at least 1-2 videos in both languages everyday.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments would be nice. And please keep in mind...Im german, not an english language native. And in the next videos I will probably record each video in both languages individual. So the sync is not a question anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you completely hate it...tell me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s.: Sorry for the microphone-touching sounds in the english video.
