It\u0027s normal in the sense that that\u0027s what\u0027s supposed to happen.\u003Cp\u003ESide note: I\u0027d always thought Chatterer was a silly mod. It\u0027s pretty much useless and the memory could be used for other things. But since downloading this pack, I have to say.. it adds so much to the experience! I like the immersion even if it is just nonsense noises they make. It\u0027s like Final Frontier - doesn\u0027t do a lot, but what it does do adds so much to the game. From now on, I shall never have a bad thing to say about Chatterer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProot added it in because it\u0027s not a default Chatterer sound. I have to say the audio in this mod is absolutely fantastic. Adds so much to the experience in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T09:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do I only get a few hundred kB/s on the download?
