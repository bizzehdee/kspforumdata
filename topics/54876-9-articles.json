Great work there, really awesome!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, if you are open to suggestion, there was one feature I would love to have in it, nothing major.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In my quest to make my current screen space as efficient as possible (only display windows when it is required to do so), I was wondering if it was possible to have the option to hide a specific resource when it is empty. Right now we can do that with the alert system however I have found one specific situation where I cannot do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ox/liquid fuel. I want it to alert me once I get below a set amount, that is fine here. However I cannot make it hide when I run out of fuel as having the alert for the low values makes the resources stay on screen when empty. My line of thought with this is that I want to be alerted when I am about to run out but once I am empty, well I don\u0027t need to be alerted / to see that resource anymore as there won\u0027t be any use for it again until I refuel it. So I was thinking about a simple checkbox to hide a specific resource when empty, configurable per resource. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Another suggestion would be to have the panel display all resources, even those that were configured to be hidden, under a specific situation. As an example again, say I want to check my TAC air/food/water reserves but I configured them to warn me only once it reaches 55%. However I want to quickly check them to see how far I am before I reach alert levels. An option to have it display all the resources for a second or two could help with that. I don\u0027t quite know what could be used as a trigger, mouseover the panel maybe? keyboard shortcut? something else?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESV\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T20:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bit Fiddler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bit Fiddler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes your mod check versioning on startup to see if there is an update for us?
