That mesh is animated to move back/forward, but there is no rotation (for that mesh) as part of the keyframing. Anybody experienced anything like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how do I make the initial position of the part the \u0027end\u0027 of the animation? I\u0027d like it to be retracted in the VAB/at launch, and I\u0027ve read that animswitch=true in the cfg can accomplish this, but it doesn\u0027t seem to work. Am I missing something in Unity? I could just reverse the keyframes in Blender, but I\u0027m assuming I\u0027m going to come up against this issue in the future and a quick switch would be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~M\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazari1382","CreatedById":62013,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T23:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry zeroing out the rotation and position for the mesh in blender with ctrl-A.
