It\u0027s not like Majiir\u0027s abandoning the project, just might be a week or two until KAS is updated officially. I\u0027ve never come across anything with that sort of functionality.

I\u0027m 99% certain that KAS pipes, struts and so on all use the same mechanic (struts), \u0022just\u0022 with different attributes and behaviors. In the long run, probably i\u0027m going to look into this for personal use, because i don\u0027t want to continue relying on KAS for something this basic. It\u0027s like killing a fly with an LGB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways - as i said, modifying quantumstruts might be your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SGCam","CreatedById":112418,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T19:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can build an arm using Infernal Robotics and stick the mini docking port on the end...as long as you never want to move that arm again after the port is docked to (bug).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
