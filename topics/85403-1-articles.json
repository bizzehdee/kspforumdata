When I do high-g manoeuvres, the interior view shakes around, it becomes misaligned with the outside of the cockpit. The second problem is that the window and frame turns green when I hover over it with the mouse. Does anyone know why this happens?

The empty GameObject spawned to place the IVA model in is just set to it\u0027s default orientation. And the IVA model is rotated 180 degrees. Do you mean I have to first rotate the empty GameObject 90 degrees, then rotate the IVA model -90 and 180?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T02:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethese might help with orientations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Vd2Zn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The exterior getting highlighted is normal I believe. You can cover up the windows with simple trigger colliders, that might the highlighting.
