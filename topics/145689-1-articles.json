It will have a circular depression some ways north of the equator, and I\u0027m not sure how to draw it correctly on a projection so that it is circular in-game. I\u0027d also like to know how to make a normal map of it, so that the crater can have a slope.

I\u0027m also now starting on the world-making scene and also doing my own hand-made planet texture(s). The normal map needs to be grayscale, with white for highest elevation and black for lowest. Then in Kopernicus you can amplify the scale of deformity to make the peaks and crater incredibly tall \u0026amp; deep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T23:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--Update--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter what I do, the Spherical Mapping Corrector doesn\u0027t make the crater circular.
