I think mine may be a twist on what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re as old as me, you may remember the old Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy and similar games where you walk around on the world map and have random encounters with enemies. This is kinda like that. I\u0027d like a mod that can spawn asteroid fields randomly. But I don\u0027t mean a fixed belt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how it would play out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re flying your interplanetary mission to Duna, Laythe, Dres, wherever... You leave Kerbin SoI and start time warping towards the SoI of your destination. The asteroid field mod might randomly place an asteroid field somewhere along your path. As you timewarp close to the field, your timewarp goes down to 1x speed, and a warning message pops up that there\u0027s an asteroid field dead ahead, and you\u0027re about to plow right through it! The asteroids should be somewhat close together (maybe something that can be changed in settings, along with number of roids and sizes) and their paths are all in orbit around the same body as your ship (likely the sun) with near and direct intercepts with your orbital path. Once you make your way through the field and you\u0027re clear to start time warping again, the mod would remove all the asteroids from space to prevent KSP having to track more and more objects every time you encounter a field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would radically change how you need to design your ships! No longer can you just have some hulk of an interplanetary stage that takes 2 minutes to rotate and has nothing but a super low TWR nuke. Your ship would need to be able to somewhat maneuver itself relatively fast in order to avoid the roids. Or alternatively, you can place engines facing sideways on the sides of the ship to do emergency lateral burns. Or, you can build up some structural shielding and make your ship be able to withstand hitting the smaller asteroids, hopefully without breaking! This would also stop the \u0022timewarp to before SoI and go make a coffee\u0022 gameplay. And lastly, it would be the most exciting way to fly your ship manually in space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said before, this isn\u0027t just a \u0022please add an asteroid belt\u0022 request. This is a functional intelligent mod that adds some random gameplay and challenges to any interplanetary mission. You could visit several planets and never encounter an asteroid field. But that one time where you\u0027re low on Delta-V and trying to get home, BAM! You hit a field and have to do some maneuvers, using up some of your precious last drops of fuel, or try using only MonoPropellant to get through it alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to my request is: RANDOMNESS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T14:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, in real life Wikipedia estimates about 1.5 million asteroids in the main asteroid belt that are larger than 1 km (about 0.6 miles).
