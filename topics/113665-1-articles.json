I have a problem with my SSTO\u0027s. Whenever I actually manage to break orbit with one of my spaceplane designs, I have a terrible time reentering the atmosphere and landing back on the runway - even without the hassle of the temperature system. More to the point, I can\u0027t perform the famous \u0027S\u0027 brake maneuver to slow down \u003Cem\u003Eat all... \u003C/em\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003Eteeniest\u003C/em\u003E deviation from my prograde vector results in a wild spiral into the ground at terminal velocity. Because I can\u0027t even slow down to anything below 300m/s, I can\u0027t even come anywhere close the the KSC, as I\u0027m unable to pick my landing destination. I\u0027ve a long-time fan of Scott Manley, and in his Interstellar Quest series, I see him pulling off crazy maneuvers at high altitude - even while his craft is on fire \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E - in order to slow down, and he makes the landing almost every time. I used the Ferram Aerospace Research stability tool while making my designs to ensure that they\u0027re stable during ascent and descent - with and without fuel - and yet I fail endlessly. If you could offer me some help in this matter, I would be very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schinxz","CreatedById":146724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T03:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott Manleys interstellar quest was pre 1.0.0, so the atmosphere was totally different then (don\u0027t remember if he used \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EFerram Aerospace though).

Also, he was definitely using Ferram Aerospace Research since the first episode. And as for the centre of mass vs centre of lift, that\u0027s the very first thing I check for all of my designs. Additionally, I use Ferram\u0027s stability calculation tool (as mentioned above) to ensure that my craft has enough yaw, pitch and roll authority. Essentially, I have ensured that my spacecraft designs are able to fly straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whovian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whovian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHaven\u0027t done much with NuFAR, so I probably won\u0027t be able to help much.\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem somewhat recently with an SSTO of mine.

I usually have swept wings to ensure that my designs don\u0027t deviate from the prograde vector, and I usually just simulate the effect the vertical stabilizer by having my tailplanes vertical. So would adding another tailplane nearer the centre of mass help? If so, I should get on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
