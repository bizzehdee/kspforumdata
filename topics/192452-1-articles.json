Even today there are those who try to exhort new \u201Cfirsts\u201D in spaceflight which have become more narrow, obscure, irrelevant, and sometimes downright ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the so-called \u201Cfirsts,\u201D the phrase \u201Cspace race\u201D has persisted long after any such space race existed. Today, \u201Cspace race\u201D is often used by two groups: journalists who need a shorthand way to describe space activities and/or are too lazy to come up with something better, and advocates and politicians with agendas, trying to provoke a reaction and hoping that they can spur Western space activities by warning of a threat from China. Neither group may have even put much thought into whether a real race is occurring, and neither group may actually care if it is not. Both groups don\u2019t know what they mean by space race, but want a term that they think applies to competition between countries in space, whether there actually is any competition. They know that a space race occurred in the past, and assume that it is happening now, even if the actual events and motivations are significantly different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-16T12:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with this.
