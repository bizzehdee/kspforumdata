I\u0027m a KSP veteran, I\u0027ve been there, done\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat. I\u0027ve planted flags on pretty much every body in the system (in what I called proper\u003Cbr\u003E\nCareer Mode in that all you had to unlock were parts). But Career Mode in 1.1.1 makes me feel\u003Cbr\u003E\nlike\u00A0 a stupid noob, and I hate it. I can\u0027t even get a friggin ship into escape velocity for\u003Cbr\u003E\none simple mission. The aerodynamics make this damn game impossible. It\u0027s not fun. It just\u003Cbr\u003E\nisn\u0027t fun. I don\u0027t play games for \u0027realism\u0027; I play games to escape reality. Do I have to have\u003Cbr\u003E\na PHD to play this damn game now? How am I suppose to do anything when even the damn radial\u003Cbr\u003E\ndecouplers don\u0027t work properly? They detach on their own leaving behind the empty tanks they\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere attached to! I\u0027ve checked 3 damn times in the VAB to see that the tanks are aligned\u003Cbr\u003E\ncorrectly on the decouplers, and they are. So if it\u0027s aerodynamics doing this, why do they\u003Cbr\u003E\ndetach on their own and leave the boosters? Is that my fault, or the game\u0027s? I haven\u0027t a clue,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand it\u0027s annoying as hell. This game has gone from fun and exciting, to damn right\u003Cbr\u003E\naggravating.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have had to cancel so many missions because I just cannot fulfil them. It just isn\u0027t fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes I know I don\u0027t have to play Career Mode, but I preferred it when you just had to\u003Cbr\u003E\nunlock parts, and maybe I\u0027ll go back to that mode instead. What is now called \u0027Science Mode\u0027 I\u003Cbr\u003E\nthink?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway Squad, please tone down your \u0027realism\u0027. It just isn\u0027t fun.

You can enjoy the two-body simulation and dig out your freshman college level textbook, or you can lean back and eyeball with a manoeuvrer node, mechjeb and alexmoons transfer planner.

you\u0027re having trouble fixing it on your own, there are plenty of helpful people on the forums to answer your questions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve noticed a not-super-friendly reaction in this thread thus far:\u00A0 it\u0027s because your original post had some issues with it.\u00A0 In general, you will get a much better response in the forums if you follow a few basic principles when posting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t rage.\u00A0 It may feel good to vent, but it doesn\u0027t actually help anyone help you.\u00A0 In fact, it\u0027s likely to make people \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E want to try to help you, as you can see by the foregoing

game\u0027s fault because it sucks.\u0022\u00A0 Bear in mind that the people who can help you are the ones who are old hands for whom this is straightforward stuff, so the latter reaction is unlikely to get sympathy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAny time you have a \u0022here\u0027s my problem, what am I doing wrong?\u0022 post, it\u0027s helpful to provide specific details (for example,

issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to bear in mind is that the whole point of KSP is that it\u0027s not \u0022just\u0022 a video game-- there\u0027s quite a bit of physics-based challenge in there.\u00A0 This does not mean you \u0022need a PhD to play\u0022... but it also means that a \u0022random\u0022, trial-and-error play style will often lead to frustration.\u00A0 The physics-based nature of the game means that there are a lot more ways to be \u0022wrong\u0022 than there are to be \u0022right\u0022.\u00A0 Lots of factors are interacting, so guesswork is often not super effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is that if you actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elearn the principles of how it works\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s actually pretty straightforward and easy.\u00A0 I don\u0027t at all mean to downplay the frustration you\u0027re experiencing-- obviously this is very painful for you.\u00A0 However, there\u0027s a pretty good chance that it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Esomething very simple that you\u0027re doing wrong (and not realizing it) \u003C/strong\u003Ethat\u0027s getting in the way.\u00A0 Or, more likely, a combination of a few different \u0022wrong\u0022 things, which is what makes trial-and-error so painful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, if what you\u0027re trying to accomplish is to have a fun experience while playing KSP, then your forum post should be focused on trying to figure out what are those simple things that you\u0027re doing wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote
