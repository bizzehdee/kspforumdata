If I \u0022aim\u0022 the stage at the surface of the planet and separate it with the use of sepratrons to push it towards the atmosphere, will it inevitably de-orbit? Or will it simply carry on at a distorted orbit. Let\u0027s say for this example my initial orbit from which I\u0027m launching the now useless stage is 80km or so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts are that since there is no resistance in space and the piece is now moving away from a stable orbit station, the debris should continue traveling downwards in an ever lower orbit that will eventually cause it to hit atmosphere and reentry. Is this also possible even with very minor \u0022pushes\u0022 as there is no resistance? Will parts eventually move closer and closer and finally de orbit inevitably?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.

You are essentially falling in towards what you are orbiting. If you reduce your velocity you will fall further towards the orbited object; reducing orbital velocity is a retrograde maneuver. If you increase orbital velocity you reduce the effect gravity has on you and \u0022fall less\u0022; increasing orbital velocity is a prograde maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning towards a planet isn\u0027t exactly a retrograde maneuver, it actually just alters your orbit\u0027s shape. To deorbit, reduce orbital velocity by burning retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life many things will interact with the craft to reduce its velocity and alter its vector. Eventually it will encounter a greater force (atmospheric drag, gravity, solar winds, micrometeoroids) that will degrade its orbit. KSP has a simplified system so orbits will not automatically degrade (at this time).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T03:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIT works exactly the same as with your craft. If you aim to the planet and thrust forward for a few seconds, are you gonna re-enter the atmosphere? Probably not, but you will get an eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf You just burn downwards, yes you will start going down, but you\u0027re not actually lowering your speed, as you are burning 90 degrees from your movement vector. So you will go down, pcik up speed from gravitational acceleration, and start going up and even higher again from that speed you picked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo deorbit something, you have to lower it\u0027s orbit until it enters the atmosphere. And how do you lower an orbit? The exact opposite way as how you raise or put yourself into orbit, by thrusting retrograde. See it like this: shooting prograde makes you go faster --\u0026gt; makes you go higher. Shooting retrograde makes you go slower --\u0026gt; makes you go lower. An orbit is just about speed. To orbit, you go faster, to deorbit you go slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the best way to deorbit this spent stage is to have it thrust retrograde. So if it\u0027s at the back for your rocket, just point the nose forward and when you stage, the spent booster will go retrograde. Although I must say, it\u0027S very very unlikely it will re-enter the atmosphere. The best way to do it, is to put a probe core hidden in your booster. You stage it with separatrons to lower it\u0027s orbit, and then you finish it by controlling the booster, and using what\u0027s left of the fuel to burn retrograde and reenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I could help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T03:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that reaching orbit required accelerating your ship to around 2000m/s.

After they will enter atmosphere - they\u0027re already finished. So all that\u0027s needed is to add enough sepratrons for a small retrograde burn.

This is mainly due to the energy required to raise/lower your apsis in that it takes less energy to raise/lower an apsis at the opposite apsis (i.e Raise periapsis by thrusting prograde at apoapsis) than it does to try and to the same thing by the same amount anywhere else in your orbit. (If you don\u0027t believe me plop a maneuver node at apoapsis and raise your periapsis to a set altitude and make a note of the dV required, then plop another one down elsewhere and repeat.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
