Most of your orbit time is spent far from the sun, so as long as your periapsis is pretty low, making it lower will have only a small effect on the time taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe length of time for an elliptical (or circular) orbit is proportional to (R\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Epe\u003C/span\u003E \u002B R\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eap\u003C/span\u003E)^1.5. Kerbin\u0027s orbital period is 426 days. So, let\u0027s figure out \u0022what\u0027s the fastest Hohmann transfer down to the sun\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Apoapsis is at Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Periapsis is the lowest possible, for a fast orbit-- let\u0027s say zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means that your average orbital radius for that highly-eccentric elliptical path will be 1/2 that of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Therefore, its orbital period will be 0.353 of Kerbin\u0027s. You only want half of that (i.e. you\u0027re interested in \u0022how long to get to the sun\u0022, not \u0022how long for a round trip\u0022), so that makes 0.17677 of a Kerbin year. Kerbin takes 426 Kerbin days to orbit the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the time taken to reach the sun in this best-case scenario will be \u003Cstrong\u003E75 Kerbin days\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, you will get there faster if you lower your periapsis, but not by much-- the absolute best you can hope to do will be to reduce the time from 90 to 75 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if someone did it in 19 days, then that means something else is going on. I haven\u0027t watched the video you mention, but I can think of two possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If he did it in \u002219 days\u0022, was that Kerbin or Earth days? (A Kerbin day is only 6 hours.) The above \u002275 Kerbin days\u0022 best case scenario works out to about 19 earth days, so maybe that\u0027s it. In other words, not a lot faster than what you\u0027re doing now-- your current 90-Kerbin-day path is only 22.5 Earth days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
