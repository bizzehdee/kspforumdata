This way, you could search for a craft file by its name or by a tag you gave it. Another thing that could be done, is implementing a folder system, so you can categorize your crafts that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me give an example. Let\u0027s say that I built a rover, and I wanted to save a stable version, an experimental version, and updated,\u00A0separate versions too. If you were to save like this, you would quickly fill up on crafts, as every build would have many versions to look through. With the search feature, you could use the differently named versions of the rover, to find it easily, or look for a tag you put in, such as \u0022unfinished\u0022 or \u0022experimental\u0022. With the folder system, you could also be able to put every single version of that rover, inside of a single rover file, for easy access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading my massive collection of ,commas, .Unfinished senten-. and just horribl inglish.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T11:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a request on the tracker when 1.1 was still in prerelease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope it was noted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8578\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8578\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
