(Think its Class E.)\n\nI am quite \u0022sure\u0022 it happen/came in after updating some mods in CKAN. (Ship Manifest, Heat Management,\n\n Contract Configurator, Modular Fuel Tanks and some more.)\n\nI arm the Grapplings but it moves through the surface of the Ast. (PVU-261).\n\nTried it with targeting the Asteroid in Kerbal Engineer, with manually selecting\n\nand with \u0022Select Center of Mass\u0022.\n\nMaybe he is too small (?), maybe i do some other unknown mistake.. ?\n\nMaybe my mod installations gone broken?\n\nAny Ideas, practices or hints about that?\n\nRed Greetings from Duna,\n\nJansky"}]}
