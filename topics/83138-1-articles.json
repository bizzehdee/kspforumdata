At the moment, the only control inputs you have apart from engine gimballing are all going through the canard winglets. However, adding wing control surfaces will shift your CoL backwards; you\u0027ll want to shift the canards forwards a bit to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re getting into planes, I highly recommend that you give FAR/NEAR a try if you haven\u0027t already.
