There are just too many names to transcribe by hand.\n\n3. Log;\n\n4. Couldn\u0027t find cache in Gamedata.\n\n5. Kopernicus logs;\n\n7.

But thing is, I\u0027m running like 70 of them, and my game loads for 15 minutes each time (slow laptop). Testing which, if any of the mods cause the problem, would take forever. I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s some interaction thing, but narrowing it down without any clue what to look for... \n\nIs this a known bug?\n\nAlso, since i\u0027m running Kerbalism, I often get message \u0022crossing radiation belt, exposed to extreme radiation\u0022 even when the vessel is sitting on the runway.

Looks like a really thick atmosphere as there is land mass at sea level. Really only an issue when in orbit or looking at map view. Im guessing its an issue with eve..sve...or scatterer. Troubleshoot halp??\n\nI also had a question if its possible to disable certain star systems within GN. I have about 3 PPs installed and they all revolve around their respective star. But the star systems without planets id like to remove(at least a couple) like the triple star binary. I dont think ill be visiting that system. On that note...how possible would it be to be able to assign PPs to a specific star?? Im asuming that idea would require the planetpack mod devs to make a custom cfg for the particular star/binary system they want to revolve?

As of now there isnt much point to head to those systems minus parking a probe for a \u0022i did it and its lookin cool.\u0022 If something like that were to happen I imagine it would be a build specifically made for GN.
