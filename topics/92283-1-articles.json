I mean, it takes a long time to get there, but if you do the transfer at the right time (and there are tools for that), the whole transfer thingy is something like 2-2.5km/s to get there, into orbit without aerobraking, and back again to a kerbin intercept. You don\u0027t need nukes for that! For those kinds of delta-v, a chemical transfer stage with about the same weight as the payload is enough. Extra efficiency if it just refuels the upper stage of the lander so that gets back by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the lander, it needs about 500m/ \u002B chutes to land, and about 1.5-2km/s to get back to orbit. With ample reserves, call that 2.5km/s and you probably don\u0027t even need the chutes to land (only a bit of help from the atmosphere). But getting something like 3.5km/s is not that difficult (even with crappy 320s isp, you only need about 2/3rds of you ship\u0027s weight to be fuel to get that delta-v), and then you could probably get back to kerbin directly in that stage... that way you can make do with a much smaller, ~1.5km/s Kebin departure stage, and you don\u0027t have to do any dockings to get the mission done. Hell, the whole thing can be done single stage form kerbin\u0027s orbit if you use nukes, and if you are a good engineer and pilot, even without them. Though I warn you, it is always good to put emergency docking ports and probes in everything just in case you need to get emergency supplies to fix something you did... the almost-empty transfer stage is a good way to keep emergency fuel sitting in Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more delta-v maps, which are really the thing to use to plan your missions, check \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, and for a handy delta-v calculator, I recommend the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
