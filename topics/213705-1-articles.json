Starting with a rougly circular, equatorial prograde orbit if I use the standard escape of ~190 m/s with the burn in the middle of the kerbin facing side of minmus I should end up with a kerbin orbit with a low PE. However the orbit line was rendered showin an orbit that escaped Kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying around with the manuevre node I found the one shown below which claimed a PE at Kerbin of ~80km. Orbital mechanics tells me this is incorrect.
