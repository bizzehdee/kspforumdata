Although larger than the average scout or interceptor, it is smaller than the other cruisers here and uses the denser rocket fuel in places in order to avoid increasing the plane\\\u0027s size for, say, railgun targeting. However, it is heavy enough that it does not handle cargo well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Atroxolith is a six-engined low-altitude cargo plane. A ring of fuel tanks surround a central hollow space which can be filled with any 1m parts, the effective cargo. It carries a grand total of 31 fuel tanks and can henceforth fly for relatively long distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gamasco is a four-engined cargo plane with a more open structure than the Atroxolith. A radial decoupler is provided for attaching cargo to the roof, and a large under-wing space is also suitable for another role - holding missiles or bombs. When full of cargo the plane is quite heavy and so a booster rocket is provided in order to reach takeoff velocity by the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kavassara is another 6-engined plane, using tricouplers to get the most from 2 long stacks of fuel tanks. Only 22 tanks mean that this plane has a shorter range than the Atroxolith, but this plane\\\u0027s advantage is a massive wing area which is simply perfect for bombs and missiles. Fitting the front swept wings with 3 missiles each, for instance, arms the plane with a salvo of 12 missiles total, suitable for wrecking any plane on the recieving end of the assault.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Osmura is simply massive. It has a lot more engines and wings than it needs, and so can survive an impact or a less-than-perfect takeoff. Again it has a lot of wing area, but the placement makes railguns a more suitable weapon than missiles on this ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that all of these ships cut it quite close with takeoff and landing - make sure to pitch up well, and if the ship has RCS turn it on! With the Osmura be careful not to pitch up too sharply as you leave the ground, however, as that\\\u0027s how you lose an engine or a wing or two. And be careful whilst rolling as well - it does not always go quite as planned in crafts with such wide wingspans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to comment, improve, and generally mess about with these crafts!

Although larger than the average scout or interceptor, it is smaller than the other cruisers here and uses the denser rocket fuel in places in order to avoid increasing the plane\\\u0027s size for, say, railgun targeting. However, it is heavy enough that it does not handle cargo well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Atroxolith is a six-engined low-altitude cargo plane. A ring of fuel tanks surround a central hollow space which can be filled with any 1m parts, the effective cargo. It carries a grand total of 31 fuel tanks and can henceforth fly for relatively long distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gamasco is a four-engined cargo plane with a more open structure than the Atroxolith. A radial decoupler is provided for attaching cargo to the roof, and a large under-wing space is also suitable for another role - holding missiles or bombs. When full of cargo the plane is quite heavy and so a booster rocket is provided in order to reach takeoff velocity by the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kavassara is another 6-engined plane, using tricouplers to get the most from 2 long stacks of fuel tanks. Only 22 tanks mean that this plane has a shorter range than the Atroxolith, but this plane\\\u0027s advantage is a massive wing area which is simply perfect for bombs and missiles. Fitting the front swept wings with 3 missiles each, for instance, arms the plane with a salvo of 12 missiles total, suitable for wrecking any plane on the recieving end of the assault.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Osmura is simply massive. It has a lot more engines and wings than it needs, and so can survive an impact or a less-than-perfect takeoff. Again it has a lot of wing area, but the placement makes railguns a more suitable weapon than missiles on this ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that all of these ships cut it quite close with takeoff and landing - make sure to pitch up well, and if the ship has RCS turn it on! With the Osmura be careful not to pitch up too sharply as you leave the ground, however, as that\\\u0027s how you lose an engine or a wing or two. And be careful whilst rolling as well - it does not always go quite as planned in crafts with such wide wingspans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to comment, improve, and generally mess about with these crafts! For one thing I find it can help to mess around with changing which type of engine is used for better flying, for instance. Gameassassin, you may also note that the Gamasco fulfils your request!
