Besides the obvious command pod bug \u0022really\u0022? Their seem to be a few graphics issues under linux . I am getting this menu overlap in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E .It cuts off the top half of the parts list icons and drops the bottom icons over the funds and symmetry toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Sorry was going to post a pic but my dropbox \u00A0 appears to be not working . I can only run the game in my monitors native resolution . If I try to lower the resolution the game will lock or go black under full screen and gets offset and has ghosted overlays of itself running windowed. I have seen this happen during updates before. Someone needs to test their Unity compile for linux better. I thought maybe Steam\u00A0 needed to install Something to make it run right? So I gave running direct from Steam library a go and its still the same .\u00A0 My copy of 1.3.1 runs fine . I went through the screwed up menus thing worse than this with 1.3.0 and it did not get fixed until 1.3.1 was released. If they sell this game as multi platform it should work for Linux and Mac users as well. I was looking forward to the DLC but I wont be buying until they can at least make this patch run right.
