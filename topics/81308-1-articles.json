Is the part a parachute? Again, attach it to a decoupler, stage the chute then decouple it. It\u0027s possible in stock too, but a bit more CoM/CoL balancing would be needed.

If you\u0027re smart about them, funds are not a problem. If you\u0027re not smart about them, funds will run out fairly quickly. That\u0027s a pretty reasonable balance for now. Since there\u0027s undoubtably going to be more types of contract before the game exits alpha, and changes to the range of parts and what they cost, it\u0027s relatively pointless trying to achieve a perfect balance right now (just as long as it\u0027s not badly broken, and it isn\u0027t).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that playing without \u0022revert to VAB/Launchpad\u0022 and the autosave function makes the game a lot more financially demanding.

It still doesn\u0027t provide a huge challenge, if you know what you\u0027re doing, but this could be easily overcome, by making contracts more difficult e.g. being given fewer attempts/less time to complete them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T04:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must have a serious budgeting issue if you can\u0027t manage a surplus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple tricks: Place a space station in orbit of every planetoid or moon you have \u0022explored\u0022 in order to retrieve science on demand.

The public really eats those up (pardon the pun.)
