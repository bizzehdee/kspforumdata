This topic might be in the wrong section, but I have a question about the way the nav-ball is oriented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think your alignment point is always on the part of the ball relative to the angle the face of your selected command pod it\u0027s facing, and the orange portion of the ball always rests closest to the pull of gravity; but why does north on the nav-ball appear to be facing south, while east is to the right like normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only conclusion I can come up with is that it\u0027s not North, east, south, and west oriented. It\u0027s more like an X, Y graph representation or something, since the longitudinal rotation never changes, your ship\u0027s orientation rotates around it instead...

However, the navball shows you the direction you\u0027re pointing in, which is slightly different, and so East and West are swapped.
