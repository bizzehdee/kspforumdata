And the points should be awarded just once for each accomplishment. Maybe some extra points to earn aside from the main tasks in case the player isn\u0027t able to fulfill a task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in total there should be 150% of points needed for the tech tree available through missions/tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe starting equipment is too hard for beginners.

It makes it a little more realistic for the new players. You have to make a few sub orbit missions before you go to the mun. Just wait till you have to be strapped to a budget. (If Squad does it right.) You won\u0027t make it to the mun before you get a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I play the science mode I play it like a new player would. I didn\u0027t start out with 5 pods, and a huge ship that blows itself apart to get into orbit. I built a small rocket that i thought a new player would make to test the game. At the moment for more expereanced players yes it is easy. For new players on the other hand... It takes them a little more time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally to solve the science issue you should only get to use the science modules 1 time. Once they are used they are done. The science you send back to kerbin gets sent back and the science you didn\u0027t get to send back stays with the ship until you recover it back on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take a goo reading. I then send 40% back to Kerbin via transmission. The 60% I could not send stays on the ship to be recovered later once i return to Kerbin. If you trash the report the science not used returns to the pool, but you have to send another ship up because the goo pod can not be reset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T06:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lexar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kruleworld","CreatedById":69697,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T07:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lexar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lexar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt makes it a little more realistic for the new players. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espeaking of realistic, i\u0022d like to see Kerbals follow a similar mission flow to that of NASA, ie start out with reaching space height, then a full orbit, etc. But as it is now, you have to send up a MANNED mission first, because you don\u0027t get any remote guidance devices at the first tier. you know, to test your rockets are safe enough for a Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, we get a transmitter, but no power modules (solar or nuclear). therefore i\u0027ve never had enough power to transmit the data back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roderik","CreatedById":85776,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T08:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust ask for missions to be implemented.
