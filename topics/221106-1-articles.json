It was several years ago. I was going out to get food or run some trivial errand in the evening. It was 30-45 minutes before sunset. I saw what can be described as a UFO. It (to me at the angle i had on it) was low to the horizon to my 10 oclock maybe 1/2 mile away and shaped like a jack-in-the-box head (the fast food jack head that is). I was looking at it as i passed some trees that obscured it from my line of sight for 5-10 seconds. By time i had a clear view it was gone. Was it alien tech? I doubt it. Was ATC aware of it? Probably if it was a vehicle. It truly to me was an UNIDENTIFIED Flying Object. Id wager dollars to donuts it was manmade, of this world and whomever was in control of it knew what it was. To this day I wonder what I saw. Its a mystery. One I am happy to have. Why? It lends a sense of wonder in a world where fantastic things can happen that we cant explain. I will never know what I saw, and I like that. I know for sure it was not aliens and very likely mundane but hey a mystery is more memorable!

Some or all of this could be total bogus but the mass murder-suicide theory doesn\u0027t seem to be something the pilot would do. He had a wife and family and apparently loved his job, while not everyone has an outward reason for ending their own lives it just doesn\u0027t make sense why he would choose to take so many with him. Regardless of motive its clear the plane was manually steered to the most remote area possible to avoid it ever being found. The little wreckage found indicates that it nosedived into the ocean and probably totally disintegrated, weather this was intentional or not I cannot speculate on but it makes detecting the wreck even harder on the bottom.
