Probes I see as unmanned craft you send to other planets/places for the purpose of exploration. Satellites are placed into an orbit to accomplish tasks such as scanning/communications. It would be nice if it had its own craft type.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T20:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs someone who launches a lot of unmanned craft, I second this. Sifting through a bunch of communication and navigation satellites in the tracking station to find your probes can be annoying.

Because as of right now there is no functional reason in the vanilla game to differentiate between satellites and probes. You could set them as landers or rovers if that helps. Once resources are brought into the game and once there\u0027s a use for the communotrons I could see the need for more craft types. Perhaps you could post this in the addon requests and get the modders to add craft types relevant to the parts in their mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T02:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, a few new craft types wouldn\u0027t hurt.
