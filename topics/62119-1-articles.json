So far i\u0027ve fallen in love, but omg im lost. I downloaded KSP Intersteller (gotta get the update as well) and im rather lost as to what I can and should do. I\u0027ve tried building things to help me mine, but it all just seems to be crap. Im terrible at this. My biggest problem is, while playing this game, im actually lost as to what im going to need. I seem to overpack my ships with a lot of junk of which im not even sure what they do. Like the mining station hub thing, no idea how to use it, how I am supposed to build it into a structure, and what it would need to function properly. Im looking for KSP ship and station builds, and also pointers on how to make my ugly mess of ships and crappy stations more efficient and some major help with the parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good skype session I feel is needed, because this game is complex. I\u0027m asking for help here folks, I work full time and on my off time i tend to lose a day or two to this game, but it always turns out to be a day of playing and failing. Most of the time I get frustrated because I can\u0027t build anything functional and just restart fresh. Im also at a loss as to how to get science in the career mode without taking months of real time. Oh, and im totally looking for star trek ships. Just for phone tho, i\u0027d like to build things inside these great ships and wonder the solar system lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T12:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should start out with simple designs as you build up your experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample first couple of missions in Career;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E In Career Mode, your objective is to build rockets with the limited resources you have available and conduct missions to earn Science Points. With those Science Points, you can then spend them to unlock better parts which will allow you to build better rockets for earning more Science Points. Those Science Points are used to unlock your Tech Tree which will allow you some flexibility of where to spend your Science Points to further your space program.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Tier Zero starts you out with some very basic parts.

For example: when I first landed on the Mun, my lander often jumped from the surface and landed on its side. Or the main throttle got damaged, or I either got too much thrust or too little etc. .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started creating a lander for Kerbin: just lift from the launch pad a few metres, and try to land again.

Also, it helped me to understand how much lift I need (if it suffices on Kerbin, it will suffice on any moon), how important symmetry is, and that some thrusters are better for gimballing than others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are satisfied with your design, try to rebuild it so it works as modular assembly.
