The docking ports deactivate after undocking so that the two vessels don\u0027t immediately bounce back together. To reactivate them you have to reload the vessels into physics. The easiest way to do that is to switch to the Space Center, then switch back to the vessels via the Tracking Station. If you want to move away and come back, you have to get out of physics range, 2.2 km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klajan","CreatedById":64866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T13:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENO. The dockingports are deaktivated after undocking, but will reaktivate if you back up a couple of meters (100m is more then enough there). You don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t have to get out of physics range to get the dockingports to work aggain, unless exactly this happens.

Just make sure you retarget the station\u0027s docking port.
