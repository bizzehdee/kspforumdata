I had placed two of the animated components under the 3rd animated component in the heirachy, I just had to create an empty game object and then have it be the parent for all 3 objects and then it exported no problem, have yet to see if it actually works in game though but at least it exported.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for your reply though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: well I guess it technically works... but I\u0027m getting spam errors causing it to lag while animating:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActor::updateMassFromShapes: Compute mesh inertia tensor failed for one of the actor\u0027s mesh shapes!
