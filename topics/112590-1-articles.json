I have been told it\u0027s fine to do in the past but have never actually attempted it myself, and this error is a bit upsetting, any clues?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T10:11:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:30:35Z","Content":"What\u0027s the hierarchy of the part in Unity?\n\nWhere did you put your Animation component(s)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:34:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s the hierarchy of the part in Unity?\n\u003E Where did you put your Animation component(s)?\n\nYeah I was just about to post an update saying I solved it, this was exactly the problem! I had placed two of the animated components under the 3rd animated component in the heirachy, I just had to create an empty game object and then have it be the parent for all 3 objects and then it exported no problem, have yet to see if it actually works in game though but at least it exported.\n\nthanks for your reply though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: well I guess it technically works... but I\u0027m getting spam errors causing it to lag while animating:\n\nActor::updateMassFromShapes: Compute mesh inertia tensor failed for one of the actor\u0027s mesh shapes! Please change mesh geometry or supply a tensor manually!\n\n(Filename: ..\\..\\Physics\\src\\NpActor.cpp Line: 134)\n\nok this is very weird, it causes incredible amounts of lag and the attach nodes don\u0027t seem to work properly, things just became detached from it at random but still counted as being part of the same ship...\n\nOk I fixed it, this was caused by mesh colliders on objects that were too small, seems it causes an error in unity\u0027s physics engine, simply replaced them with box colliders and it no longer gives errors.\n\nnow the only problem is finding out why Dmagic animate modules won\u0027t work if there\u0027s also a stock animate generic....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T22:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"}]}
