For nearly a week, I had to deal with random on-and-off storms coming from the south, being pulled up by the jet stream. This setup began to slightly change over the next few days. Mercifully, this resulted in some decent days where I could finally get outside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the last week or so, the dramatic jet stream dip has lessened a bit, so now storms are coming at us in a more typical SW to NE or W to E direction. They\u2019ve become more predictable and less frequent, leading to a few nice sunny days. It was especially nice in Plymouth when I visited there\u00A0Friday and Saturday. However, one major problem remained: the humidity. Temperatures have already been in the mid to high 80\u2019s for days now, and constant 60-80% humidity does not help. Heat index values have been maxing out in the mid to high 90\u2019s since late last week. This can sometimes make even a few minutes outside almost unbearable.

Being such a small storm, with a tight ring of convection and a wind field less than 100 miles across, it\u2019s been more unpredictable than the other powerful East Pacific storms so far this year. Its small size is likely why it\u2019s gone through two periods of rapid intensification. Hector is currently a high-end Category 3 but will likely become this season\u2019s third Category 4 by later tonight or early tomorrow. I believe it may intensify even further, based on its impressive convective structure and how more models are showing it tracking south of Hawaii into warmer, more favorable waters. Some models are suggesting that Hector may survive its journey through the Central Pacific basin and enter the West Pacific, similar to Hurricane/Typhoon Genevieve in 2014. With Hector still going strong, TD 11-E poised to strengthen, and another tropical system likely to develop, this is quite the time to be watching the East Pacific.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the days of rain are finally over where I live.

In fact, it may be a Category 5 already. The latest low-level recon flight (it\u2019s close enough to Hawaii from Hurricane Hunters craft to get into it) found winds of up to 170 mph on one side of Hector\u2019s eyewall. Based on how well organized the system is, with a very tight ring of powerful thunderstorms, I find it likely that Hector will become a Category 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are now two tropical storms off the coast of Mexico, Ileana and John. Both are set to become hurricanes by later today or early tomorrow, and they\u2019re dangerously close together. John is likely going to absorb or destroy Ileana before rapidly intensifying. Some models suggest it could become another Category 4/5.

The eye had collapsed pretty early during this phase, and as I mentioned before, it looked like there may have been another eyewall forming last night, potentially signalling the start of another eyewall replacement cycle (EWRC). The latest satellite imagery of Lane makes me fear that this could be the case. Over the last few hours, Lane\u0027s core has become more symmetrical again, and now you can visibly see the eye again. Most of the system\u0027s convection is becoming more organized around the core while some of the convection ripped off by wind shear continues to drop heavy rainfall over Hawaii. If Lane was not finishing\u00A0an EWRC, this should not be happening; the storm should continue to lose its organization and, most importantly, weaken to Category 3 status. It has now maintained low Category 4 winds for longer than forecast for today. This maintaining of intensity and its organizational improvement as seen in visible satellite imagery leads me to believe that Lane has finished or is finishing yet another EWRC, which will help the storm remain strong as it gets closer to Hawaii, which is not good news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Uc5IytJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Uc5IytJ.png\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother concern is Lane\u0027s intensity not including the potential EWRC. The latest intensity guidance models predict that Lane will remain as a Major Hurricane (\u0026gt;111 mph winds) for at least 12 hours, likely closer to 18-24 hours. This, along with the possible EWRC, indicate that Lane will still be a powerful storm even when it reaches Hawaii. To make matters worse, some parts of the island chain can get over a FOOT of rain, on top of the foot some areas have already gotten today. Some places may even exceed 24-30 inches of rain total. If that wasn\u0027t bad enough, most models (as seen on Tropical Tidbits) are predicting a very close pass (\u0026lt;50 miles) or even a direct landfall before Lane is steered out to the west. All I can hope is that this storm somehow doesn\u0027t get even worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-24T22:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5957178523\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/RyanMaue/status/1033123058016509953\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing to see here, let\u0027s move along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-25T03:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGone and gone...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022enXPfvc.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/enXPfvc.gif\u0022 width=\u0022720\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersisting rainfall\u00A0is still a major threat, but as a tropical cyclone, Lane has practically gone poof under the 35-40 knot wind shear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-29T01:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome updates on the latest tropical systems:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe once formidable\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EHurricane Lane\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0has, after almost two weeks, finally met its end.

The GFS model says it\u2019ll become a Category 5 Super Typhoon...but seriously, when has any GFS model accurately predicted the formation of a Cat 5 typhoon? It says that for nearly every new soon-to-be-strong West Pacific storm, and 95% of them end up being Category 2\u2019s, 3\u2019s, and 4\u2019s. However, this time may be different, like with Typhoon Maria, because like the latter, Jebi is going to be traveling a pretty long path over very favorable conditions. Maybe it\u2019ll prove the GFS model right, maybe it won\u2019t, but either way it\u2019s going to be a very interesting storm to track.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I get to talk about the Atlantic for the first time since Beryl reformed back in mid-July. The NHC and other meteorologists have noted that tropical activity could return to the Atlantic basin for the peak of the hurricane season this September, and it looks like the next named system may be upon us. A tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the coast of Africa south of the Cape Verde islands late Thursday/early Friday, and just about every model on Tropical Tidbits suggests the wave will develop pretty quickly. These predictions could easily change, but because of the short time frame they\u2019re covering (no more than four days), I\u2019d say they\u2019re rather reliable. The same cannot be said about their predictions for a system developing near Florida by early-mid next week, or the possibility of another tropical wave behind the first one developing next week. For right now, the first tropical wave has the highest forecast confidence to be considered worthy for observation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-29T13:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153551-protojeb21/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022153551\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153551-protojeb21/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ProtoJeb21\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Tropical Storm Miriam is gradually strengthening again, so it has some chance of becoming a Hurricane.

The GFS model has it becoming a Category 3 hurricane by early next week, which I\u2019m a bit skeptical about, mainly due to a patch of below-normal SSTs just north of the MDR. Future Florence is likely to pass through this patch, but how much of it the storm goes through depends on its exact track. For now, it looks to be one of those typical long-lasting open-ocean major Cape Verde hurricanes like 2011\u2019s Katia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u2019re right, the other area of interest is going to move into the Gulf of Mexico. However, even though that would be concerning for Texas as it\u2019ll be heading into very warm (29-31 C) waters, I don\u2019t anticipate anything major. It\u2019ll likely stay too close to land to become anything more than a tropical storm...I hope.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
