R-7, when it refers to a single rocket, refers only to an obsolete Soviet ICBM that was never really any good in that role.

Russian rockets tend to get named after a payload they fly a lot of (e.g. Proton is so named because it flew the Proton series of scientific missions, Vostok is the family of rockets derived from and related to the LV for Vostok missions, etc.); Soyuz LVs are \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E referred to as R-7s, because the more descriptive name for the rocket family is the Soyuz family (R-7 is uselessly generic).

The Energia itself was also a master piece, able to lift 100 tons to LEO, and would have given humanity the opportunity to launch huge things into space since the Saturn V, but even THAT was also canceled.

The engines from the N1 worked very well after being in storage for about 40 years, and while that project was cancelled, they had worked out and fixed the design flaws. The engines from the N1 - NK-33 - were taken out of storage and were exported to the USA, where they now power the Antares rocket, which launches the Cygnus spacecraft. For reference the NK-33 engines have performance close to that of the Mainsail in KSP, from 0.17 to 0.23.5 (except the NK-33 produced more thrust in vacuum, and has 1/5th the mass of the Mainsail).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also this news: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://rt.com/news/russia-booster-rocket-energia-817/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://rt.com/news/russia-booster-rocket-energia-817/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T04:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the trend with space craft is affordability and reusability.
