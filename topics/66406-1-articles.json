That\u0027s because you have to \u0022cure cancer\u0022 in order to make it work, and also be able to modify what\u0027s known as \u0022programmed cell death\u0022. That could even mean reversing the aging process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe researchers had reservations against what \u0022youth\u0022 meant-- we are talking something quite different from physical age. All your cells replace on a regular basis, so the difference lies in how many times the cells have divided. This has profound genetic meaning, but the arm won\u0027t grow out a baby arm and then mature; it would be (mostly) as it was. The clock no longer matches the physical age. The stem cells are responding to the cells in the stump, and then in a chain reaction as it grows (I have had this explained to me, so I\u0027m a bit fuzzy on that one). In programming terms, they where instanced with the same parameters as the stump-cell, but there\u0027s a null-pointer in it\u0027s internal time variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, here is where the \u0022end of the species\u0022 part comes in. Feed forward in genetic systems can be beneficial on a small scale but over many generations it usually leads to stagnation (there are technical reasons; the noise-to-signal ratio of useful genes increases. Plants are a notable exception, they can have truly enormous DNA). Sterility is common in biological systems, and so-called \u0022over-fitting\u0022 in artificial evolution; they have lost the ability to evolve further, \u0022stuck in their local minima\u0022. Sterility is a shot to the temple in evolutionary terms. That\u0027s it. Done. So unless those who wanted to live forever willingly sterilized themselves, there would be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I take a different stand point; mostly from a spiritual point of view. I think our DNA has protected itself from that kind of mutation early on in evolution. During the fractal phase of life, that evolutionary path should have been tested. It didn\u0027t work, or life in general would not die of age. While regenerative medicine will change surgery and internal medicine as we know it, I believe we will find any attempt to change the fundamentals of our evolution to fail-- it\u0027s not a compatible modification. We have to die, or we can\u0027t live to begin with-- not as human beings at least. Maybe as some kind of sapient crystalline sponge \u0026lt;/nerdy reference drop\u0026gt;?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for \u0022conspiracies\u0022; where\u0027s the conspiracy? There are some pretty obvious conspiracies out there, so I\u0027m rather disconcerted at how many people waste time on aliens. I mean, when individuals in governments make backroom deals with banks to rip off the people, that\u0027s pretty much the definition of conspiracy. There\u0027s been an awful lot of that the last hundred years. Yet. Aliens. Lizards. Orbital Mind Control Rays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.
