Same goes for the TMI stage (mass also dependent on payload); more payload, more pain. For your launch vehicle to be in a single stack, you should use an efficient fuel-motor pair, such as LH2 and INSERT ENGINE NAME HERE. Also make sure you have several vertical stages. The Saturn V has 3 massive stages burnt out by the time it was in a Lunar Transfer Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven then, a single stack may be out of your reach depending on the engines you have (I use the stock engines with the RF configs) There are only two things you can do: Decrease your payload mass or increase the ISP of your rocket motors. Since you can only really decrease payload mass, you\u0027d better get working on designing a striped-down lander. If you\u0027ve read \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E, you will know you need to get rid of anything unnecessary. But probably not as drastically as in \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E. You may want to try some variation of the Apollo style for your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your lander and TMI stage, you will have to pick the fuels that will give you the best bang for you buck (mass). LH2 is not very dense and also has a much higher ISP thank RP-1 or Aerozine 50. You will just need to throw in more tankage if you choose to use it because LH2 is less dense. Keeping with comparisons to the Saturn V, make note that the S-IC (First stage) was fueled by Kerosene and the upper stages LH2. The CSM used MMH because cryogenic fuels would have boiled off, as you probably know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, use the lightest motor you can get away with in your upper stages as this will save on payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T22:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your reply !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about all the Isp stuff and have seriously considered using essentially hydrolox, but it is not dense enough so I would have to basically double the tanks size or number (second stage boosters still use hydrolox) and boiloff is a serious issue for a trip to the Moon. For the bottom stage and the core second stage, I use kerolox as it is the densest and I don\u0027t care that much about mass. For the third stage, command module and lander (lunar insertion and orbit) I use hypergolics (Aerozine50) as they are not cryogenic, so no boiloff issue and I can wait as long as I want for a transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V is not an issue with this design (I have 1500 m/s spare dV on lunar orbit stage, and over 500 m/s extra on both lander and ascent module) so I do not need to worry that much about Isp and which engines to choose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, my main issue with this design is the part count (\u0026gt;170) that makes it basically a slideshow at launch (add that it is a little wobbly) for my current laptop. Using LH2 would give me better Isp and a less massive rocket, but I would have to use bigger/more tanks, which would either increase the part count or make the rocket taller, so more wobbly (I can use struts, but then again, more parts). So, even if I change this design, I think I will keep using Kerolox and Aerozine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T23:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have extra Delta V you should ditch the extra fuel and tanks. Because of the logarithmic nature of the rocket equation, you may be able to shrink the launch vehicle a decent amount. You have to try to squeeze as much DV from your upper stages if you want to get a single stack. You kinda have to deal with the fact that you need a taller rocket so that is why I don\u0027t usually use a LH2 first stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know exacly how you get into a parking orbit, but I don\u0027t stick around for more than 1 orbit so my TLI stage is usually LH2 like the Saturn V\u0027s. Boil-of isn\u0027t significant but the mass savings are. Also, what is the mass of your payload you are delivering to the Moon?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T23:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I could wait a few days in LEO for a transfer window because I did not bother matching the inclination ^^ But anyway, in my current design, the stage that gets me from parking orbit to lunar insertion is also used to circularise the Moon orbit.
