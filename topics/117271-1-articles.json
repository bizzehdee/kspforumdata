THE RULES TEND TO DIFFER TOURNEY TO TOURNEY, SO YOUR BEST BET IS TO ASK IN THIS THREAD. ALSO, PM ME IF ANY CHANGES TO THE OP NEED TO BE MADE. THANK YOU.**\n\n![o37n8ol.png](http://i.imgur.com/o37n8ol.png)\n\nWelcome to Top Gun AI, in which you will pit your best fighter designs against another, in a single elimination style tournament. May the best engineer win. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Top Gun AI, and haven\u0027t seen the other thread yet, the premise is simple; you will build a plane, within a certain point limit, and then the tournament host will draw random seeds, and the designs will fight. Usually, each match is a best of 5.\n\n**All tournaments will be recorded and posted on YouTube, with #TopGunAI in the title.**\n\n**Rules (ALL RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON THE TOURNAMENT**\n\n**-No mods. (Except for BDarmory)**\n\n**-Fights are 2v2**\n\n**-Fights are best of 5**\n\n**-The last** **flying** **aircraft wins. If both are destroyed in the sky, the round is considered a draw.**\n\n**-There is no part hard cap, however try to keep it low, for the sake of our PC\u0027s**\n\n**-ALL DESIGNS MUST HAVE A COCKPIT, PROBES ARE NOT ALLOWED.**\n\n**-REACTION WHEELS ARE ALSO NOT ALLOWED. They are stupidly OP.**\n\n**-All designs must be withing the point limit, which is stated below.**\n\n**-All turrets MUST be fixed forward**\n\n**-One entry per tournament, unless stated otherwise.**\n\n**-No clipping fuel tanks or engines. They can be slightly clipped for looks, but not completely inside each other. Structural parts and ammo, guns, gear, etc. Is ok. Wings are OK as long as you\u0027re not putting all your wings inside the plane.**\n\n**Point System**\n\n**60 point limit**\n\n**-AIM-120 - 4**\n\n**-AIM-9 - 6**\n\n**-All other missiles - 4**\n\n**-Flares - 3**\n\n**Chaff - 2**\n\n**Hammers - 20**\n\n**-Ammo Can - 4 points (all types)**\n\n**-.50 cal turret - 4 points**\n\n**-GAU 8 30mm - 14 points**\n\n**-M230 - 6 points**\n\n**-Vulcan Hidden - 7 points**\n\n**-Vulcan Turret - 7 points**\n\n**-Goalkeeper - Banned**\n\n**-Abrams Cannon - Banned**\n\n**-M102 - Banned**\n\n**-Millennium Cannon - Banned**\n\n**ABL Laser - Banned**\n\n**The points are also subject to change based on tournament rules, and if we notice trends in designs. (Countermeasure spam, etc.)**\n\n**Setting up matches**\n\n**If you are not already aware, BDarmory has an AI system, that is able to fly and fight planes. (As well as ground vehicles, but that is not our concern)**\n\n**To set up the match, all planes will be Hyperedited into position, and then the host will quicksave, and start the match.**\n\n**Star position will differ depending on who is hosting the tournament, but will usually be one of these.**\n\n![y2BEVXm.png](http://i.imgur.com/y2BEVXm.png)\n\n**I should note, I will not be hosting the tournaments, I do not possess a powerful enough PC. t3hJimmer is the one to run the tournaments usually, but anyone can as long as they know how**\n\n***PLEASE KEEP ALL NON- TOURNAMENT RELATED DISCUSSION ON THE DISCUSSION THREAD.
