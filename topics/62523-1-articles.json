If so, you might want to break those pieces off with a different material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs dispatcher stated, normals might be tweaked on the mesh, so make sure they are averaged out. Texture padding between UV islands is definitely important as well. Depending on the size of the texture, you may need quite a bit (roughly 3px for a 512x512, 12px for 1024x1024 and 24px for 2048x2048). Also, your spec/gloss settings might be a bit high? Looks like you\u0027re just getting halo fresnel from the shader. Might want to tone those values down and see if it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
