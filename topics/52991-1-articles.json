Although I have seen larger lifters, 400 tonnes for example is one I have seen before, however this lifter is so smooth and easy to launch that you\u0027ll forget that your CPU is about to explode and the 32-bit thread shouting at you for using too much RAM and going on strike (/crashing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have used KWRocketry mainly, as they have nice 3m parts and powerful enough engines to go with them. I have used asparagus staging, which basically makes this feasible (without it, it only get\u0027s something like 3900m/s of delta-V).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may notice I have Mechjeb autopilot on, and before you click on reply and do a anger-crazed message about how it is game-breaking, I only use it when I am doing a screenshot launch, as I cannot do all the lifting and manoeuvring while moving the camera angle constantly at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most of the payload\u0027s mass, I have just used 2 big orange 3m tanks and 1 little one from KWRocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s some pic\u0027s for you to enjoy and maybe get some design ideas from:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vSDqu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I know that you can use a little less delta-v, I have done some research into that, and basically on a good launch you can get into 100km orbit with 4450m/s with 10km and 40%, and you can get it down to 4420m/s with a shallower ascent profile. However, that comes at a disadvantage, you are in the atmosphere for \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E longer, and so creates greater uncertainty/variation in the amount of time taken to launch. I have a space station that I always send stuff to, and the quicker you get out of the atmosphere, the more closer after orbital insertion you will rendezvous with another craft in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, shallower ascent = small saving on delta-v, but greater uncertainty with rendezvous. I choose to spend the extra 20 to 50m/s of delta-v to get a \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E more constant time-taken to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps with your orbital rendezvous/construction antics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and I am already working on an even heavier launch vehicle, with another asparagus layer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Is just the beginning... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESam\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T15:37:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by samhuk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T16:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SamboUK96\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SamboUK96\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis...\u003Cp\u003E...Is just the beginning... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother Whackjob in the making?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samhuk","CreatedById":221604,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T16:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehaha \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am almost ready to post the even heavier version of this Super-Ultra heavy lifter, the Super-Ultra-Mega Heavy Lifter, and a little peek at payload...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E650 Tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, 6...50...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is about 80% complete.
