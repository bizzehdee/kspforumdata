Using several \u0027roots,\u0027 shown in green, going into the main hull of a long plane makes it very strong and requires less eyesore struts; most of the time 3 or less on each branch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice plane, I hoped this helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-27T07:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI decided not to use branches, to keep the weight further back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-27T14:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided not to use branches, to keep the weight further back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\\\u0027t make them too much heavier; only adding the weight from the radial stack decoupler.
