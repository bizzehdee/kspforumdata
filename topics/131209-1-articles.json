vehicle themselves, without undertaking a massive effort.\u00A0 Imagery requests from other agencies were not considered useful, as previous missions had shown that imagery attempts were not adequate to show any damage, and NASA personnel did not have security clearances to be aware of the current state of the technology.\u00A0 Further, the simulations run on the ground showed that even if the large piece of foam had struck the TPS, it would not have sufficient force to cause significant damage.\u00A0 This relieved a lot of the pressure to continue concern over the issue.\u00A0 (Of course, these simulations were later shown to be incorrect.)\u00A0 STS-27 did suffer extensive damage to the TPS, after all, and made it through fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the damage had been known or suspected, there\u0027s not a lot the crew could do with what they had.\u00A0 They would have to improvise a fix for the damage, then improvise a way to get someone to the damage location, improvise tools and process, and they would have to get it right the first time, because they were not prepared for EVA, much less multiple attempts.\u00A0 Without detailed information about what the damage was, and what was needed to fix it, any action they took could have simply made the issue worse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA rescue mission would have been extremely risky, as well.\u00A0 Foam shedding from the ET was a known issue that had been previously determined as not being a flight risk.\u00A0 STS-107 demonstrated that the rationale they had developed was incorrect.\u00A0 The problem was that no one knew \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E the foam was shed.\u00A0 It might have been a property of the foam itself, meaning that any ET used for a rescue flight would have a high possibility of losing foam, which was obviously (at this point) an underestimated risk.\u00A0 The shedding could have something to do with the manufacturing process that applied the foam, meaning any ET available for flight would have been equally suspect.\u00A0 In addition, any attempt at a rescue would have meant rushing the entire stack through preflight.\u00A0 That would have introduced an entirely new set of risks that could not be foreseen, such as skipping checks or overlooking issues that would normally have prevented a launch.\u00A0 The crew would also have been rushed through training that normally takes a very long time.\u00A0 As mentioned above, there was no way to dock the shuttles, so transferring the crew would have been quite a feat.\u00A0 Again, OV-102 was not prepared for EVA.\u00A0 The rescue mission would have to plan for quite a bit of unconventional operations.\u00A0 And all of this would have to be done quickly.\u00A0 Any rescue plan I\u0027ve seen has been something that was drafted up in weeks or months.\u00A0 NASA would have had to come up with a plan and make it happen in

A very interesting \u0022What if?\u0022 proposal. I do not believe it would have been possible, but the whole proposal is pretty amazing. Were they to make a Hollywood movie about it, I fear people would get the wrong idea that it was actually possible, and begin to wonder why NASA didn\u0027t try it. (Assuming they don\u0027t know that NASA had already made a larger mistake in not addressing the foam strike in the first place)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, I would watch that movie many, many times. I watch Apollo 13, Space Cowboys, Astronaut Farmer,\u00A0and Race to Space as much as I can stand, and will continue to do that with Gravity and Interstellar, regardless of their inaccuracies. Space is what I plan to live my life for, and any movie having to do with space exploration in the feasible, similar,\u00A0or realistic sense (With the exception of Interstellar, that\u0027s just a great movie with some space things in it.

I would watch any movie about the NASA program, in any aspect of it, or other space programs as well.
