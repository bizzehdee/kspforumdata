But keep in mind I find it harder to keep a plane stable the more I angle pitch of wings so it\u0027s a trade off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found I have to build the wings flat first because stuff doesn\u0027t attach right after you do the pitch adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond in addition to what they said above about wheel angles is true and also you can move your rear wheels forward more, so that the aircraft tilts back easier but obviously not so much you hit the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I sometimes for a quicker fix, I toss canard type wings on the nose to see if it does the trick. It\u0027s wierd, I have a plane that happens to fly best when it has front canards pitched up one increment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso make sure your control surfaces aren\u0027t fighting each other ie going up and down on the same wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, any plane that literally rolls out of control while still on the runway is almost always because the wheels are not straight. Go back and make new wheels or double check that your old ones are actually parallel and not crooked. I always put my wheels straight up and down as even angled slightly they don\u0027t work for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimo, a good design is one that lifts off with a very slight nudge and then flies in a straight line and does not drift up or down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T06:37:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neodyme","CreatedById":57481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T17:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, mine drifts down initially when its picking up speed/altitude (till about 2km-3km) then it decides to go up.

As the fuel is consumed from the front first it might be the cause of your flip higher up. You could try pumping fuel forward to increase the fronts weight, or grab the TAC fuel balancer mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T21:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, I finally made a plane that can take off (almost no stock parts:P).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
