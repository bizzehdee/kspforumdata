Some of them are made to increase the realism, some are, on the contrary, making life easier, but I haven\u0027t found yet a mod, that could represent some specific space program, national or multinational (ESA).\n\nThat\u0027s why I decided to start working on the mod called **\u0022Road to Kosmos\u0022**. \n\nThe mod consists of two parts: **Core** (tech tree, parts) and **Contract Pack** (contracts only).\n\nIt is done for several reasons, first of which is the fact that 1.0 will overhaul the tech-tree system, which may require separate update just to account for those changes.\n\nATM, the mod is in it\u0027s early steps, so I\u0027d like to account it and post all the critics here. That way you can help the development and improve the quality of gameplay. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe CKAN support is WIP, as I\u0027m trying to set it up manually and may not work always well.\n\n[DOWNLOAD CORE@KERBALSTUFF](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/698)\n\nContract Pack: WIP\n\n**Overall requirements:**\n\nModuleManager - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)\n\nTech Manager - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98293](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98293)\n\nDMagic - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972)\n\nFuels Tank Plus - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108238](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108238)\n\nProcFairings - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512)\n\n***Not yet needed, but totally required in future (actually so I don\u0027t lose the link*** ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)***):***\n\nContract Configurator [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604)\n\n**Kerbiet Union Reqs:**\n\nTantares/TantaresLV - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81537](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81537)\n\nAB Launchers - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106687](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106687)\n\n**Kerbal States Reqs:**\n\nOMSK - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112419](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112419)\n\nSXT - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542)\n\nSpaceY - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408)\n\nSDHI - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362)\n\n*What will it do?* - It will represent different space programs in their efforts to reach space with their specialities. Ones, for instance, will be less \u0022human rated\u0022 than the others. Some programs will have different approach to reach the same goal.\n\n*What programs will be represented?* - Currently, I think, I will focus on two main players of the former space race: USSR and USA. After that, I will add some support for Europe and private companies. Possibly last touch will be \n\n*How will the programs be organized?* - Well, let me think for a minute...\n\nThis is a really hard question. The first idea that comes to my mind is: every tier of tech tree represents an era of space exploration.\n\n- Tier 0 \u0022Start\u0022, 1945\u002B: Postwar sounding rockets. Basically, it\u0027s a A-4, the rocket, from which many space programs have begun its way. Assemble, stick an experiment and let it fly for peace!\n- Tier 1 \u0022Splitting up\u0022 1950\u002B: First national rockets. Early attempts at reaching space: Redstone and R-5 will be the main players, without capability to reach orbit, but able to reach further and touch the edge of space.  \nAt that point, several branches form itself: USSR (which will split into three others later) and US (thanks to centralisation, it will be more \u0022stable\u0022).\n- Tier 2 \u0022First satellite\u0022 1956\u002B: You may have guessed, it\u0027s R-7, and solid booster stages for your Redstone.\n- Tier 3 \u0022Man in space\u0022 1960\u002B: Vostok and Mercury hardware, including launchers and their alternatives.\n- Tier 4 \u0022Back in numbers\u0022 1965\u002B: Gemini and early Soyuz hardware.\n- Tier 5 \u0022Mun or bust\u0022 1967\u002B: Saturn and N-1. \u0027Nuff said, those monsters are well-known to anyone\n- Tier 6 \u0022New frontiers\u0022 1970\u002B: Space stations and alternative programs: fly me to the Duna or build mine ice on Minmus!\n- Tier 7 \u0022Reusable Space Program\u0022 1980\u002B: Space shuttles, basically, and Energia launcher.\n- Tier 8 \u0022Reach for the planets\u0022 1990\u002B: Angara, PPTS, Orion... So many opportunities!\n- Tier 9 \u0022Joining efforts\u0022 2000\u002B: Technologies, that enable cross-docking capabilities, and allow to make Kerbalkind united.\n- Tier 10 \u0022United we stand\u0022 2015\u002B: Finally merging branches and advancing into space as one: large orbital constructions, resource collection etc...
