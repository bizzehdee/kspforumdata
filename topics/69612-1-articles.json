This results in hours of vigorous exercise daily for astronauts, as well as hauling heavy and expensive exercise equipment to space. What if we used the simulated gravity from centripetal force in order to provide 1g of force. It would have to look like the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey. It might also be problematic to reach the centre of the ship, due to the force. But the ship itself would function as one giant treadmill for exercise.

It might be beneficial or its side-effects might be detrimental. The induced Coriolis effect might cause nausea, dizziness, blood-circulation problems or internal-ear issues.

The only other difficulties would be in keeping the spin stable and reliable as any slight shift in weight would effect the centre of mass and impart a wobble to the rotation effecting the amount of artificial gravity felt by the crew, perhaps a bundle of ballast tanks in both modules could pump RCS fuel or waste water around to maintain the spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T08:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust accelerate at 1G.
