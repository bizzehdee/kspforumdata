Is this literally what the name implies, and what gives Jebediah his \u0027whatever situation we might be in i will always find something to smile at and to find awesome\u0027? What determines wether Kerbals get this trait or not? I\u0027ve had very courageous, smart Kerbals, very courageous, dumb Kerbals, even tried dumb non-courageous Kerbals, and still most of them will show frowny/scared/aaaargh we\u0027re gonna dieeee faces at launch, rather than wheee/yaaay/ohmygodthisissocoool faces.
