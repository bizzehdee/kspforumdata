For Kraken reasons (Ship ripped itself apart upon exiting timewarp) I reloaded the quicksave. Upon reloading the quicksave, as soon as the physics kicked in my whole ship appeared to experience some sort of physical jolt and then all of a sudden the 4 OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels on\u00A0 the probe seemed to reset their rotations to 0 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as I don\u0027t have much time to play KSP lately I didn\u0027t want to have to re-do the mission, so I put a new probe on the launch pad and made a named quicksave, went into the SFS file and copied the position of the solar panels, and then inserted that into the regular quicksave and reloaded. Upon initially seeing the probe the solar panels are in the correct location, however once again it appears the moment physics load the same jolt happens and the panels are in the wrong rotation again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone ever experienced this before? If so is there some known thing that\u0027s causing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ESo apparently all of my problems, ships ripping themselves apart upon exiting timewarp, as well as part resetting their direction and such ... Was all resolved by simply making sure that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was off when I quicksave and timewarp.. I\u0027m imagining this is a bug spawned by one of my 131 mods. Which one I\u0027ll probably never know as long as I have this\u00A0workaround.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Come to think of it I just recently installed the S.A.V.E mod for backing up my game and had never had this issue prior to installation of that mod.. Going to try removing it and see if the issue happens again. Will report back results after adequate test play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-11T05:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2019 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
