You lose a lot of energy to air resistance. Every part on your rocket causes drag regardless of its shape or whether it is shielded (by fairings for example). This means that putting a nosecone on or something like that actually hurts your rocket performance in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR actually models the aerodynamics much more accurately, so an aerodynamic rocket will experience much less resistance and thus lose much less energy to air resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Morhem","CreatedById":120948,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T16:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get that, but it just seem overpowered, that I can go to orbit instantly, on something resembling a firecracker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T17:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Morhem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Morhem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI get that, but it just seem overpowered, that I can go to orbit instantly, on something resembling a firecracker.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause KSP rockets are overpowered, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T17:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is what happens when you apply realism to only one aspect of an unrealistic game.
