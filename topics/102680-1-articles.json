I kinda wanted to explain how close the ISS was in comparison to the size of the Earth so I could show how close space really is, and how much atmosphere you\u0027d have to go through to get there going sideways. Now, that wasn\u0027t really a dumb question at all, but I just wondered what you guys have seen people ask, or say, because I know there\u0027s a lot of people that don\u0027t know much about space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slab\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jman508","CreatedById":122550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022what if other planets don\u0027t actually don\u0027t exist i mean they\u0027re so far off its hard to believe they\u0027re real\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei can\u0027t remember the rest of the conversation. it was in-between some girls in my class.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T16:25:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jman508\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eto edit or not to edit\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They did it in the studio\u0022 - about Moon landings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I see some comments on space related videos on youtube about all space programs around the world are fake, \u0022ISS is just an empty shell\u0022 etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy friends care so little about space they don\u0027t even dwell on it long enough to say stupid things about it. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember trying to explain Newtonian motion in space to someone many years ago, and they stuck rigidly to \u0022but in Star Trek, when they turn the engines off, the ship stops moving, so...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt temporarily turned me into a raving lunatic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Second star to the right and straight on until morning\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Everyone knows that\u0027s wrong; you won\u0027t get there until at least lunchtime!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone once told me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022We don\u0027t need to go to space because God loves us.
