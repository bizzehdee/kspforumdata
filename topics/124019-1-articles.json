Plenty of data to be had there. Kimdie Kerman (Scientist level 1) is busy aboard the lab, while her colleague, Agagie Kerman (Pilot, level 1) does all the running around collecting results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Bob Kerman reports back from his excursion into Kerbol orbit, I guess he\u0027ll have reached level 2, so I\u0027ll probably be sending him off to Minmus Base to help. The question is, what happens to the research rate/efficiency? Does having two scientists (of differing levels) have any effect on the science generated?
