Both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and mechjeb\u0027s Smart ASS have wild oscillations around the roll axis of the docking port, like its overshooting its attempt to stop rotation. This happens with both an inline docking port part like the shielded clamp-o-tron or with a normal docking port attached radially. I might try testing this in an unmodded install, but was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I have several mods installed but the only one I can think that would effect \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s ability to hold steady is mechjeb.
