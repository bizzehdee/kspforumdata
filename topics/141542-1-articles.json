If a neutron star were to hypothetically fragment off, then what the fragments will be depends on their bulk mass. Or so I guess, it could also instantly explodes off. It really depends on what happens in the meantime - these stars, while gravitationally and degenerately \u0022stable\u0022, required a lot of energy to compress (hence why there\u0027s still the supernova, the remnant star (neutron star or black hole) are only from the core).

Classically (ie. only taking into account bolometric EM radiation and using the standard between 100 - (-15) deg C for life), yes. But not realistically. Bigger stars tends to emit more particle radiation, or emits very high-energy photons. \u0022Bigger\u0022 is actually a bit confusing - do you mean more mass (like, class O/B/A/F main sequence star) or radius (which will include things like Red Giant Sun) ? The former makes a lot of UV radiation, the latter makes a lot of particle radiation - not good in any way. Not to mention they die out fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Classically, yes.
