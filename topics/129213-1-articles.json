Ahh, and there\u0027s an inline docking port - same stuff. I\u0027d either ditch those, or decide to refuel.

I\u0027d remove 80% of those wings, 70% of the control surfaces (eg.: 4 tailfins look cool, but you only need one), 50% of the airbrakes and 70-100% of the RCS stuff. (but really: at first it\u0027s better to arrive with a \u0027useless\u0027 plane than failing to orbit a useful one.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAscent profile: I feel your initial ascent is too steep: I\u0027d aim for like 30\u00B0 AoA below 10k, thus you arrive there on like 300 m/s instead of 100. Provided if you don\u0027t burn up. If you do, I\u0027d slowly raise the angle (35\u00B0, 40\u00B0) until I manage to reach 10k meters with like 300-350 m/s. After that you can pitch down to like 10\u00B0, so you gain more speed while still on jet engines. If you reach like 1200 m/s before the air gets thin and you stop accelerating on jet trust, your ascent profile is geting close to be perfect. Once you reach your top jet speed, you can switch the rocket engine on, pitch up to \u003Cs\u003Elike 40\u00B0 or so, and take it to orbit like you did with every rocket before.\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0 Ahh, 40\u00B0 is too steep for a Nerve, maybe 10-15 would be good.. To be frank, I never tried a spaceplane with a nuke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T14:00:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T14:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222348035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129213\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451915487\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145424\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Evanitis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n30 minutes ago, Evanitis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesign: Too much stuff = too much weight and drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed, as others have said: Build something simple that can get to orbit, then figure out how much extra junk it can afford to carry.
