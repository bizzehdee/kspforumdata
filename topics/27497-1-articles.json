While it\u0027s a cheat in that you can fly for hours without running out of fuel you get to learn a lot about flying them that a 30 second descent and landing just doesn\u0027t teach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspired by that I set out to see what I could come up with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first effort was this. It\u0027s based on the Munox pod and I edited the config to add fuel to it. I\u0027m using the HOME radial engine and I\u0027ve edited the config to make the isp 10X normal. Not realistic I know, but a 20 minute flight is a lot more fun than a 2 minute flight. It also slows down the weight shift you get as fuel burns. To use as a lander rather than a transport you could probably manage with the standard settings, but it would be more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img854/892/screenshot76e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot76e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img20/892/screenshot75l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot75l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img194/3821/screenshot90c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot90c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses 6 engines for lift. The front and rear lift engines are mounted high on the hull to keep the center of gravity below the center of lift. This makes it more stable. The center engines are mounted on Damned Robotics rotatrons that allow them to tilt forward or back to control your forward speed without having to pitch the nose up or down. These rotation servos are pretty cool in that they have a centering mode that can be toggled. When it\u0027s off you rotate your thrust nozzles and they stay, when it\u0027s on they return to center as soon as you let go of the rotation button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing handles good and can carry 18 passengers, but it looks like a flying beer can and that landing gear really looks pretty bad when it\u0027s down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went with a bigger version and while the landing gear looks better, I had to move the engines from the hull to the landing pods. This puts the center of lift below the center of gravity and makes it a bit more tippy, but it\u0027s still not bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img194/6042/screenshot94mu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot94mu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img62/5348/screenshot98d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot98d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one uses the new passenger compartment from the latest Munox release and I\u0027ve edited the config of that to hold fuel as well. It also uses the landing pods from the Wayland Eagle and I\u0027ve edited the config to remove the monopropellant from them. None of these ships have any RCS on them yet.The biggest problem of this design is that the front fuel tank has more engines feeding from it than the rear tank and eventually it gets tail heavy as the front tank drains faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easy fix would be to put another pair of vectored engines to feed from the rear tank, but I\u0027d have to rebalance the craft to get them closer to the joint between the front and rear. Just adding another pair to the rear hull would place the center of lift too far back. A slightly more complex fix would be to mount 2 of the rear lift engines on servos so I could rotate them outwards and cut their lift effectivness as the center of gravity changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA proper fix would be a plugin that would scale down the output of certain engines to compensate for changes to balance. This is one of the addon requests I\u0027ll be posting soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I decided to try a completly balanced craft with the center of gravity at the center of the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img837/4927/screenshot128jw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot128jw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img5/5738/screenshot121g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot121g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img705/8383/screenshot119ei.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot119ei.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pod is the Bac9 overview pod with the unmanned version on the back as a counterweight. It uses the HOME 3m horizontal landing legs that I\u0027ve resized to fit, but they make it sit a bit close to the ground and sometimes when you land they move between the segments on either side. Not sure if the spotty connect nodes are a result of rescaling it or if they were always like that. There\u0027s also a pair of large SAS modules. The theory is that they help MechJeb\u0027s KillRot hold things still even if engine thust isn\u0027t perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use Mechjeb 2 to fly using the KillRot in the SmartASS module and the Keep Vert function to hover or climb/descend. I didn\u0027t realize till I started playing with that function that you could set a descent rate and execute it, then enter a new value and change focus from the window. This lets you drop a 1 rate, (say -50 for example) and enter a new rate while you descend. (-2 for instance) You can fly the ship, put down the gear, turn on the lights, and whatever else and when you get close to the ground all you need to do is click the execute button and your descent slows to the new rate without having to stop and type anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re on the ground and stop descending Mechjeb automaticly shuts down your engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion this works way better than the landing autopilot since it won\u0027t flip you over by going full throttle at the last instant if your lander is a bit off balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that you need to be off the ground for keep vert to work. If you try to use it off the runway it seems to go full throttle and flip you over before it figures out throttle control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else I noticed is that if you angle your lift nozzles outward you lose some lift effectivness but gain stability. Imagine each nozzle is angled out 30 degrees. If the craft tilts over 30 degrees the nozzle on the low side is pointed straight down and gets maximum lift while the nozzle on the high side is pointed 60 degrees to the ground and is generating mostly sideways movement. (which is much easier to fix than being inverted) Placing your thrust nozzles above your center of gravity means that you\u0027re hanging from your lift rather than trying to balance on top of it and you get more stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone else is working with VTOL\u0027s and have any tips for me I\u0027d love to hear them. I\u0027d like to try and find landing gear that looks and works better and maybe some engine nozzles that fit the rotatron better. If you know of plugins that can balance fuel burn or scale engine output would also be appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T04:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice crafts.

Are you flying with a joystick or controller, cause you\u0027re pretty smooth on the controls for KB. Mine can take off and fly around if you\u0027re careful but they all handle like bricks with rocket engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the craft files Scotius you\u0027d still have to edit the part configs in specific ways to get them to fly. I wouldn\u0027t really want to be distributing modified versions of other peoples parts so it\u0027s probably easier for you to just copy the basic design. For the crew transport I\u0027ve edited the munox to add fuel and oxy at 720 and 880. The batteries and SAS are just ballast to move the COG back near the center of the passenger pod. You place the front and rear sets on engines so the center of thrust is as close as possible to the center of mass then fine tune it to the exact center when you place the swivel engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a couple of newer ones that don\u0027t need any config editing except the engines. As stated previously these are the HOME radial engines with their isp edited up to 3000 and 3300 to extend runtime. These are copies with new names and titles so I can still use the stock ones in the game. I\u0027ve also made a larger version to cover the Rotatron better. For that I added the line \u0027Rescalefactor = 1.28\u0027 to the congfig. Once again it was another copy in it\u0027s own directory with a new name and title given in the config so I can use both versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one looks pretty neat and I didn\u0027t need to use the rescaled legs, but the vectored engines are mounted too high and if they swivel too far back the nose pitches down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img16/1743/screenshot129k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot129k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img15/4821/screenshot136o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot136o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo construct it\u0027s Pod, B9 adaptor, Home 3M legs, HOME SAS, HOME 3M fuel, then SAS, Legs, adaptor, and pod. Total symmetry. Put the Mechjeb anywhere and you\u0027re all set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I tried a stretched version of the same thing. This one is Pod, 2.5m SAS, B9 adaptor, Bp HL fuel tank, adaptor, SAS, and pod. Once again total symmetry. The wings are mostly cosmetic but their lift is centered on the cog. I also went with dual rotating nozzles on each side. In a later revision of this I lowered the front swivel engines, and raised the rear ones for more clearance when tilted all the way to the rear for rocket flight. The Front and rear lift engines were also put on action groups to allow the use of just the vectored engines when you\u0027re trying to shed velocity and altitude fast. I haven\u0027t touched the lift engines on either cockpit since I built the first VTOL with them. I just retune the balance with the center engines. Your thrust vector in the spaceplane hanger should always go through your COG and point straight down for stability. (unless you can fly like Fleb in which case stability is more of a bonus than a requirement. LOL.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img62/2731/screenshot183r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot183r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img547/2518/screenshot196.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot196.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot all the way to the Mun and back only to run out of fuel 30m above the spaceport.

I replaced that with the empty cylinder part, and used two shrunken jet fuel tanks (TV Aerospace 1.3.4) ON cg on the wing struts.
