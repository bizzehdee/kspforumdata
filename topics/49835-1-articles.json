I\u0027ve got a little caf\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 set up that kerbals sit around in near the launchpad, so if they\u0027re needed they\u0027re already close by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus they make very nice pastries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T12:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way I\u0027ve found to get around this problem is to put a small probe core on rovers. They can make nice decorative parts and allow the rover to be driven without Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch the rover on the launchpad and another craft on the runway (with Kerbals in it), drive the rover over and unload. After testing spaceplanes and practicing landing them I\u0027ve got plenty of spare Kerbals all over KSC \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you could just use the same system but drive the rover off the pad, launch another craft on the pad and then drive the rover back. I just like having to load the rover using another functional vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, make sure the probe body is facing in the right direction, otherwise it messes up the controls. I\u0027m not sure how that works with 0.22\u0027s rover detection SAS thing though, because I\u0027ve yet to drive a rover in 0.22.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T13:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a rover question.

I\u0027ve not done a Mun-landing in career more yet, so I don\u0027t know how the biomes work there, but if the bottom of a crater counts as a different biome I guess you could use the rover to investigate nearby craters, that shouldn\u0027t be too far. I\u0027m hoping that in the future the terrain scatter objects, like trees, moon rocks, etc, can be inspected individually, that\u0027d give us a reason to drive around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, on that note, do you get anything, science-wise, from anomalies, does anyone know?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T19:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw someone asked that a few days ago about the anomalies.
