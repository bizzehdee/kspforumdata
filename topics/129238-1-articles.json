It\u0027s an exotic location, it isn\u0027t too difficult to land there, and the spaceplane that fails to orbit in Kerbin can usually take off there easily.

Starting with electric generation and full steel structurals and wheels and mining capabilities, but no fuel.. so the objectives are switched around... the first thing to do is, Get fuel!. Im also using Extra planetary launchpads, INfernal robotics, KSP foundry, and KAS KIS.\u00A0 I first moved to a location and plopped down a launchpad near a good fuel source. This took a while.. I built paddle boats to transport everything, and some large land rovers to haul my stuff to the new location. Since Im no longer using the default space center, (other than to design my rockets for EPL) I have to mine for everything.. Also my new base is on top of a mountain in the western desert 4000 meters above sea level, (saves some fuel when launching) . This was a REAL job getting everything up there, (I built a spider that grapples the terrain to climb the mountain).. This enhanced my gameplay INCREDIBLY.\u00A0 I\u0027ve just wiped my save, and am starting over in a new location for a different experience. Just thought I\u0027d throw this up here for an IDea for people who may be getting bored with the same ol same ol. Take care!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
