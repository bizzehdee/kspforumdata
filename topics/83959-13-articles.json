Firstly, most players have discovered that for getting between biomes, they\u0027re really, \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E slow, and it\u0027s easier to hop around with a lander, and so this has probably skewed what the modders think to work on. And secondly, making wheels (or any kind of animated landing gear) is a serious pain. It took me weeks to get the legs working right for SpaceY (and the set I moved here to MRS). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, rovers can be fun too. I could see working on some parts for it at some point. Depending on what\u0027s useful, I could add some parts here, or fork off a separate mod just for rovers.

I couldn\u0027t think of any last-minute things to look at, so I\u0027m pushing out the current changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer-- KSP 1.0 changed quite a lot of things. I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if we find some things that still need fixing. But I combed through all my part configs and remapped tech tree locations, adjusted engine specs (thrust, ISP, mass, cost, etc) based on the changes to the stock engines, altered heat parameters to mostly match what 1.0. I also had to flip all of the bottom attachment nodes since 1.0 did that too. Plus the parts needed to be added to the cross-section profiles so that those filters work correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI retired the \u0022radial booster tank\u0022 since it was stupidly limited in uses, and was one of the first parts I made, so I was never completely satisfied with it. I also retired the fuel cells, since stock has them now. I can think about re-adding the inline one (re-balanced), if there\u0027s enough interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cargo bays will be back, but I need to rework them in the 3D modeler a little bit, to make sure the colliders fully enclose the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fully expect to need to do a 1.6.1 release before long.
