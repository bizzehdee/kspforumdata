He looked through the window and contemplated for one second what Ereus Technologies was today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Rocket R\u0026amp;D. Hum.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He started remembering the company in the ol\\\u0027 times. Back then, Ereus was an appliance company, specialized in Clocks and watches. They were the best clock company in the state, selling more than 1000 units in a month. It seemed clock making was the future of E-TECH, but one day, it all changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * *\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Frederick entered in the room, and exited, he sad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Gabriel, have you seen it?

After reading about it, he had been thinking about a great project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Hey, Frederick, you think those bins full o\\\u0027 boom have clocks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Both stared each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * *\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Two months after the beginning of the research, Ereus was going to present their last product to the leaders of the engineers teams from the world\\\u0027s biggest space programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Gentleman- sad Gabriel \u0027I present you Ereus Technologies most recent creation:\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The cloth covering the device was removed, revealing a rectangular box, with a white outer shell and a black display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Behold the Space Clock MK 1, a watch specially created to work at the harshness from space, and capable of the precision necessary to conduct your space missions.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The engineers began to murmur to one another, speaking about possible applications to it. One engineer raised his hand, to make a question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027I\\\u0027m seeing that your clock doesn\\\u0027t have any kind of pointer, so how you can see what time is?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Good question, sir. To answer it, let me turn on the clock.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gabriel pushed a switch on the device and the dark black display showed red numbers, stating it was 3:15 PM. The engineers were now exited about the device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027It uses something we call Vacuum Fluorescent Display. It consist of a hot cathode, anodes and grids encased in glass under a high vacuum condition. This means that A: as it is not a mechanical device, the chances of time display error are practically 0. B: as it is in a high vacuum, even when outside the spacecraft, it will not blow up because of diference in pressure.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The engineers were impressed. Apparently, the clock was a success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * *\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After making the commercial hit \u0027Space Clock MK1\u0027, Ereus Technologies started to go deeper and deeper into the rocketry world. Their next product was the Gyroscopic Stabilization And Safety device. The next one, the E-100 SRB. And so on. 15 Years later, or as we like to call it: Today, Ereus Technologies is still making clocks and watches. But now it\\\u0027s main focus was another. It was to help to take the Kerbalnity were it never went before. It was to help exploring the universe, and to understand how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gabriel now focused in the beautiful rocket standing 1 kilometer away on the launchpad. The Kerbal Orbiter MK 1 was going for the first time take E-TECH\\\u0027s astronauts to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As the rocket turn on it\\\u0027s engines, Gabriel thought that even with the changes on E-TECH, one thing was still the same. \u0027We design, we innovate, we make.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket took off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -First Flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Here\\\u0027s Burfel, we\\\u0027re ready to takeoff\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Understood Burfel, you have permission to take off.
