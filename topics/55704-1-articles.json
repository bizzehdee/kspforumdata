I don\u0027t see it as being a high priority feature, personally; but I also don\u0027t see a negative side to it, if it can be added without too much effort. You might want to suggest it in the MechJeb thread, as it\u0027s more likely to get added via a mod in the short term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Krist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne idea I currently have is to put six satellites on a single craft in a five hour orbit with apoapsis at exactly the right height for a KSO.

One thing to remember is that a true KSO without any drift is only possible by editing the save. If you ever make them active (i.e. switch to them from the tracking, or get within 2.5km with another active ship), their orbit will cease to be perfect again. In the real world, sync orbits do require occasional corrections if the sync is to be maintained, so you might be happy to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascension Islander","CreatedById":92338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T19:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Krist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...One idea I currently have is to put six satellites on a single craft in a five hour orbit with apoapsis at exactly the right height for a KSO.

It\u0027s actually very easy, assuming you have mechjeb or KER:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Launch craft into the orbit as described\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) At the apoapsis (which should equal KSO altitude), burn prograde until your orbital period equals a time divisible into six hours. In your six satellite network, you could set your orbital period to five hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At each subsequent apoapsis, release a satellite, switch to it, and circularize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Every apoapsis will land you one hour behind the previous, so by the time you drop your sixth, one more go-around will rendezvous you with the first one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Deorbit your mothership\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
