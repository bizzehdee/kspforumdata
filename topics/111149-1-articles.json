Obviously I am trying to get home and have no fuel left but thankfully air will bring me home, but I noticed that when I leave the physical warp on longer than I have to (e.g. 70k\u002Bm), then my apoapsis starts increasing for a good while and my periapsis decreases although again: I am at 70k\u002Bm and either both should decrease or nothing should happen, but certainly not pe decreasing and ap increasing.\n\nIt also only happens if I leave the physical warp on, if I go to transwarp or however that less-calculated warp is called it doesn\u0027t happen."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappus","CreatedById":100574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:24:59Z","Content":"I managed to increase the bug a notch and increase my actual altitude while aerobraking and I don\u0027t have any wings or anything.

No physics is calculated with rails warp, and it is possible to completely miss the atmosphere with a high enough warp rate. Is it happening at 1x warp? If so, I would say this is not a bug, unless you\u0027re actually gaining both velocity and altitude. If it doesn\u0027t happen at 1x warp, it is probably because Physics warp, by definition, is less precise than 1x warp.\n\nEDIT: Or do you mean the Apoapsis is increasing while you\u0027re in space? That would be a bug.\n\nOr I may have completely misunderstood you...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T20:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover**"}]}
