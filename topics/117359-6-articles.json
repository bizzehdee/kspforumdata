While mutations are the only source of new genetic information, their short-to-medium term effects are mostly harmful and rarely beneficial. Cells have a plenty of mechanisms for preventing mutations, and for repairing the damage if a mutation happens. There is also a lot of redundancy in the genome, which helps to minimize the effects of mutations.\u003Cp\u003EIn a large population, which can afford to lose a plenty of individuals, a low mutation rate can help to increase the genetic variation in the population, increasing its fitness in the long term (after hundreds or thousands of generations). In short-to-medium term, the primary adaptation mechanism is recombining the genetic variation that already exists in the population. Recombination is much less likely to have adverse effects than mutation, because individuals have already lived with all of the genes involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplication is not as simple as copying a piece of data. It involves adapting the resource extraction and production activities of the probe to the conditions in the new environment. Many of these activities may involve location-specific risks that are not always apparent in advance. If the probe can\u0027t afford to take risks, it may not have access to all the resources it needs, or it may not be able to process them in the forms they occur in in the current environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer science is the science of systems, processes, mechanisms, complexity, information, and similar things. It\u0027s a methodological science with a similar role in the 21st century science as statistics had in the 20th century science. Its English name is kind of unfortunate, because computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. In many other languages, people use more appropriate names, which translate as e.g. computing, informatics, datalogy, information processing science, and science of computation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer science is simply the most relevant field of study to this discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, as a VNP probe will be likely to operate alone any mutation is likely to be negative, also it will have far more single source of fail that an living being. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast the obvious beneficial mutation for the probe would be remove the cap on replication.
