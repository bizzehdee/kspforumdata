No building upgrades in between (since RealChutes uses action groups and those depend on building upgrades, except when you also have Custom Barn Kit \u002B SETI rebalance installed (though that functionality of SETIrebalance might need adjustment for the new CustomBarnKit...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to KSP instability at the moment, I can not test for extended periods of time and I do not experience this issue when I install SETIrebalance \u002B RealChute myself. I d need at least a clear culprit by process of elimination (eg if you can confirm that it is indeed SETIrebalance while the only other installed mod is RealChutes and module manager of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that you mention it, it may be building upgrades. I\u0027ll start up a KSP career and edit my starting money so I can upgrade the VAB and I\u0027ll test the parachutes before and after upgrading. I had this issue before but I am not completely sure it exists anymore. Since breaking after a certain amount of time rather than breaking immediately as it would be the case if mod files were broken it might be a random bug, and maybe the issue is with RealChutes, although I don\u0027t have this issue without SETI. I\u0027ll check building upgrades and see if they cause the problem. Btw I forgot to mention SETI Contracts when I listed which SETI mods I use but it\u0027s unlikely they did anything about it since it\u0027s only changing contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Yes, it\u0027s the building upgrades.

I was thinking of KAL9000 to be integrated in every probe core, but not before it is unlocked (mid to late part of game). Pretty much tech node tree like it already is. So, instead of having additional part, it will be integraded in probe core. Part mass is already low, so it will have no impact in game in terms of gameplay balance, so there is no need to change probe core mass due to this. In similar way as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E or TCA is integrated in probe cores.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince, by time when you unlock those tech tree nodes, you have already steped in in interplanetary travels. By then you already learned how to overcome different kind of obstacles and puting just one more part to craft is rather more tedious than interesting thing to do. At that time of playtrough you already got plenty of stuff on disposal and some new parts to try out, so integrating it in probe core will bring player focus to new stuff to discover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for gathering too much science early in game, there is not much what you can do or even need to do. For noobs with game, starting is already difficult enough until they figure out how to collect science. For experienced player, you can\u0027t do much, they already know how game mechanics work and they were able to unlock early tech tree realy quickly, just with few flights in Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that there is need to change that, experienced player probably already want to solve early obstacle as soon as possible, go to Mun/Minimus quickly and focus effort to send probes on distant celestial bodies. So, collecting enough science is not much of problem, you can unlock tech tree nodes for first level of Resarch building quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, if you do that too fast, you will get another obstacle, you have plenty of science points, but not enogh money for all building upgrades, because, you didn\u0027t finish enough contracts. With strategia and different kind of contract packs everyone can adjust his own gameplay experience as it suits him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that you are on right track, to adjust science parts in different nodes and maybe adjust tech tree node science cost you can slow down that too quick early game progress. Better that than adjusting rewards, that is way too much work to balance properly and someone can easy break that effort by installing not covered mod that gives more sci parts. Again, nothing you can do about it for experienced players, they will found other way around to quickly progress trough early game. And also, it is good to be that way, experienced players can focus then on other stuff in game without too much grinding and avoiding to game become booring to them if they need to restart career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T22:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127158-kcs123/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022127158\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/127158-kcs123/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@kcs123\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with unlocking already integrated modules by tech (like the 3km omni of RT and the mech jeb functions) is, that I currently do not know a way to do this with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches alone (ie without including a dll).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I meant that instead of unlocking the late game module, I would integrate a kOS module into the stock probe cores, with the capability roughly based on the position of the probe core in the tech tree.

With termometer, barometer and crew reports jsut around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and old runway I unlocked enough parts to be able to establish first orbital flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as I was able to put craft in orbit, due to RT usage, I have put one small comm probe around equator. That was enough to have full control of second probe with ALT SCANsat from DMagic, orbital telescope and additional RT anthena for future Mun connections. That probe, due to multiple sci usage, Local science program with strategia mod and different biomes around polar orbit bringed decent number science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that I did some other small contracts, I have put additional comm probe in polar orbit, much higher altitude, more antenas, without other sci parts and in 90 degree inclination, compared to the first polar probe, to cover Mun if first one is in shadow behind Kerbin. Somehow i felt that another comm probe in nearly stationary Kerbin orbit will be good idea too, for extra connection stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom strategia mod, I have also choose Mun unmaned program and send first probe at Mun as soon as possible to build rocket that is capable of more than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. For traveling outside of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, upgrade of comm center and tracking station was pretty much necessary, as it also unlock precise node mod. First Mun probe included SCANsat too and orbital telescope. Unfortunately, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E was barely enough to establish equatorial orbit around Mun and I didn\u0027t know that you also need dish antena on craft to be able to send sci data back on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, second, more expencive Mun probe with dish antena was needed for polar orbit. That probe is also used to fullfill contract from strategia, to put in desired orbit and also do 50% of altimetry scan. Multiple things done with single probe. When it was in place, it also allowed stored data from first Mun probe to be send back on Kerbin. While out of fuel, it still have purpose as local comm relay, that was proven useful later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid some other maned orbital flight too, as soon as I tested out that i was able to do that with unlocked parts. I was nearly broke at that moment due to all building upgrades, alsmost all except research building upgraded to level 2. Fortunately, that second Mun probe bringed some money, also I was lucky with 2 Tourist orbital and suborbital contracts. Barely design proper rocket before \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/Launchpad upgrade that is capable to bring up and down two Mk1 capsule, but it was enough to get paid for tourist travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I was able to build first Mun lander (with kOS KR-2042B). That include 3 comm dishes, 4 rotational solar panels and 4 small solar panels as well as 1000 EC battery. Home made power landing script for kOS worked just fine to land this thing near Mun north pole. Two more lander probe are on it\u0027s way to land on Mun at different biomes to fullfill strategia program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, I got 700 000 kebobucks to spend. I still didn\u0027t upgraded research building as it will eat a lot of money and I might not have enough to build crafts for other contracts.Also similar sum is needed for administration building level 3 that will allow to chose some more program/strategia that I aim for, before sending probes on Minimus and start with maned space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, that provided some context for progression discussion. Goo and material bay with few orbital flights along with other rockets to satisfy contracts were come too early and allowed me to unlock bunch of things before reaching Mun (probes were still on travel to Mun). With those in higher tech tree node it will be much more difficult, but still not impossible. As you said, I might send some cheap probe outside of Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, with just termometer and antena instead to establish Mun orbit. That would allow to unlock same tree nodes with different method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis bring another conclusion, DMagic reusable sci parts are far more powerful in terms of sci points grinding. Almost all should be in nodes that require research building level 2. SCANsat altidude scaners are OK as it is, as those require some time and effort to put in proper orbit until you get reward from it. Telescope is also OK to be in early tech tree, I\u0027m divided in opinion if it should pe pushed higher in tech tree or not. It have limitecd usage, as it can be used only in orbit, despite ability of different biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot few more ideas about game progression, but I just figured out that I created wall of text that might be boring to read if I continue. I will put some more info later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-23T20:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127158-kcs123/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022127158\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/127158-kcs123/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@kcs123\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm, I just checked again and even the KR-2042 does not fit nicely into 0.625m diameter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo from my perspective, that would be a major advantage of giving all probes kOS capability. Eg every probe core gets 5000 disk space so people can use the code that would normally fit on a KR-2042. Saves a part in the early game, fits into the probe core diameter and later parts are still superior in terms of disk/mass. Kind of like the integrated 160km omni antenna for remote tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm, maybe command parts cost increase by factor 20 and crew without command by factor of 10. While the parts can be recovered, doing so far away from ksp would at least cost something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the idea of material bay and goo at a 90\u002B node. That would tremendously increase predictability of early career science returns and slow down initial science generation a lot without taking away from the mid game. Maybe material bay to miniaturization at 90 science and mystery goo to composites at 300 science. That would also make those nodes more \u0022viable\u0022. Magnetometer and accelerometer can then imho stay where they are for the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose changes would be especially beneficial in conjunction with the new CustomBarnKit functionality which allows modders to change the number of building upgrade levels. Perhaps R\u0026amp;D cutoffs at 30, 80, 150, 280, 500, 900 science. That would contain some of the beelining to eg particular science parts. Though I m not sure whether that should be part of UbM or SETIrebalance, as the latter might be used in conjunction with other tech trees and thus different cut-off values may be better for those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how many/what levels would be good for the launch pad/runway (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E should imho influence dimension restrictions instead of arbitrary part counts, so I m reluctant to change those until that is fixed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
