This craft was tested at an altitude of 290 meters.\n\nThe Speed Demon II\n\nThe cruising speed at 125 meters altitude with a 1 m/s altitude gain is 86m/s. Range is potentially 250 kilometers based on a rough extrapolation of a 50km flight. \n\nYou may think this is not impressive and is in fact a downgrade from the Speed Demon I. Well, you\\\u0027d be wrong! Our new \\\u0027boost\\\u0027 feature increases the speed by an astonishing 57%. Simply toggle the auxiliary thrusters and engage!\n\n![8cpO5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8cpO5.jpg)\n\nHandling can be a tad tricky for both craft; the attached ASAS ring is extremely helpful.\n\nParts: C7 everything, Damned Aerospace for the rotor, and Down Under for the ASAS ring.\n\nSpeed Demon I is Proto-1; Speed Demon II is Proto-2."},{"CreatedByName":"zombiphylax","CreatedById":5471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T16:43:58Z","Content":"That looks very cool.
