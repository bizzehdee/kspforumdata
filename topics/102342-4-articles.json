And you think their response is to turn the official forums into Reddit and Twitter?\n\nLets see, doing the math, why yes 1 hour short of it being April the 2nd. This means that for anybody east of Western Europe (The ENTIRETY of Asia, several BILLION people) this date they scheduled the update is April 2nd.

The assistant will for example see that you\u0027re writing a new post, and inform if it can assist you, or if you want to continue writing the post without its help.\n\nFormer admin Walter has been demoted to the role of KSP Clippy. Excellent.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We\u0027re integrating Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, pInterest, Spotify, Vine and dozens of other websites right into the forum.\n\nnoplz\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A side effect of the integration with Twitter is that all posts will be limited to 140 characters. We\u0027ve heavily debated and tested the pros and cons of this, and we\u0027ve found that ultimately the short posts improve communication efficiency drastically.\n\nHow on Earth did you guys come to this conclusion? Forum \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2  Twitter\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We will tag your age, gender and location onto your posts, and introduce a feature to match you with other KSP players in your region to make it easier to get into contact with other fans in real life!\n\nWhat?

Ten bucks to use similes and signatures!?

And the search engine restriction is ridiculous, BTW. Here comes Google Site Search.\n\nAnd the last one. My god, the last one.
