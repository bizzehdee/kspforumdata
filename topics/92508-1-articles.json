When you start a new game drag that science slider way down. 10% is pretty durn low but I\u0027ve found 30% doable and challenging/rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T04:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr just plain limit yourself to a \u0022max tech level\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T05:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, though its not that the tree is too \u0022easy,\u0022 but the real issue is that so much science can be obtained from the Kerbin system that there is little to no reason to ever make the next step and go to other planets. But I think the difficulty settings help this a ton.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T05:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, i also think it goes too fast in general. I think it should be one mission or more per science node, rather than being able to unlock multiple nodes with one mission. As far as im concerned, i \u0022beat\u0022 the game once i unlocked all the techs, even if i havent purchased the parts...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T12:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022godless216\u0022 data-cite=\u0022godless216\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIts way to easy to get full tech tree now in kerbal, i seriously just got 1 science lab around the mun and one around kerbal and did contracts over and over.

The lower game settings are not designed to make the game hard. Anyone who knows what their doing shouldn\u0027t have that difficult of a time. Now there custom settings AND much harder difficulty levels to play on if you find the game is to easy than your liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the \u0022legit\u0022 setting isn\u0027t normal or medium or whatever, its max difficulty. As in a real space program there are now reverts, test flights cost money, and people die for good. So yes Iron Man mode is what the game is all about, but since its more tough than fun (like a real space program) its advised you play a less intense setting ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
