It\u0027s made up of (from top to bottom) a Cuppola module with 4 high gain antennae,\u00A0 a hitchhiker with 4 docking ports mounted around it, a service bay holding batteries,\u00A0a\u00A0RSC fuel tank,\u00A0a Liquid-Oxidizer fuel tank with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controllers and 8 OX-4L around it and a poodle engine at the end. I had no problem getting it into space and achieving a stable orbit\u00A0have since had it docked with with a laboratory, lander I needed to refuel before sending to Mun, and another fuel tanker I sent up to refuel the station. I\u0027m planning on moving the think to a Munar orbit so dedocked the lab and started my burn only to find that after 3 - 5 seconds it started pitching and will spin uncontrollably if I don\u0027t turn the engine off. From what I can tell there\u0027s nothing that should be unbalancing it. I also tried filling the tank to full thinking maybe it\u0027s top heavy (it was at half tank), but that didn\u0027t do anything either. Is there something I\u0027m missing? The only thing I can think is that it\u0027s unbalanced, but for the life of me I don\u0027t know how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-07T14:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027d need a pic prolly to do any real troubleshooting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027ve moved off balance stuff before by reducing throttle and making sure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is at full strength.
