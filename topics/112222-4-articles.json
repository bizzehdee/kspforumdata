The big advantage of this type of telescope is that you can have a large aperture, which means larger light gathering capability which in turn means you can see fainter objects, with a lower cost in comparison with a refractor telescope of the same aperture, also setting it up and dismantling it takes less than 5 minutes. A small disadvantage of the newton telescope is that from time to time you need to check the collimation of the optics (ie the alignment) so you can have clear sharp images but once you learn the process it becomes a routine check. As for the blind spot it only removes a small portion of the total surface of the main mirror and it does not affect the observation at all, also the spider vanes (the spokes you mentioned) of the secondary mirror don\u0027t affect the observation and the only thing that affect the image is the addition of spikes at the stars due the refraction of the light at the spider vanes which can help you in focusing the image. As for what telescope to choose i recommend from 6 inches in diameter and above with the 8 inch being the most popular, i have a skywatcher 8\u0027\u0027 dobson for 8 years and it never failed me whether i used it for observing or imaging the planets. If money is the issue i recommend to save some more money and get a good scope or buy a used one from an astronomy forum (cloudy nights is the US forum)"},{"CreatedByName":"nesixakin","CreatedById":175641,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T10:21:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/7/2015 at 0:27 PM, jmiki8 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Those pictures are pretty cool!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I take a different approach, as I don\u0027t have a telescope.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried to take photos of star fields with a camera.

You don\u0027t realize that visually as you watch only on the optical axis, but a large camera chip would show it as it has a larger area than the pupil.\n\nThe difference is that the \u0022EdgeHD\u0022 thingies have a corrector for the comatic aberration built in (aka coma-corrector), the right image shows only little coma. The advertising is bit misleading, you don\u0027t need a new scope. You can have the same effect with a separate (but much cheaper) coma corrector, one that fits your scope/focuser/camera. You don\u0027t need one for visual.\n\nAs to what is \u0022better\u0022, a mirror or a lens ... if it is only the image quality then nothing tops an apochromatic refractor, but a well made mirror can come close. \u0022Real\u0022 apos larger than 120mm aperture are expensive, though there are so-called ED (referring to the glass designation of 1 or more elements of the objective) or half-apos (german: halb apo). That are three element objectives with an apochromatic correction that go for about half of a real- or super-apo to serve a wider market. Much cheaper are the entry level 2-element achromatic objectives, but then you\u0027re probably better off with a mirror. As said, you get a large aperture for comparably little money.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-09T14:31:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2017 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Green Baron**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoadRunnerAerospace","CreatedById":177973,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-01T22:35:22Z","Content":"MUST\n\nKEEP  \n\nTHREAD  \n\nALIVE\n\nI saw the iss fly over....
