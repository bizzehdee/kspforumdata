I have constructed a launch vehicle tuned for low orbit insertions with a central core of two stages and four side liquid fueled boosters. Its centre of lift point is normally quite far behind its centre of mass during the whole flight and its centre of thrust is aligned and all of its potentially wobbly booster joints are fixed firmly in place with triangle strut constructions. The problem is that in flight under mechjeb control at some point in flight it is becoming progressively wobbly as the control inputs are becoming so aggressive that no obvious deviation exists at all but the controls are just jumping left and right as crazy in a minute the whole rocket is constantly jumping left and right as crazy. What can the reason for this be?\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas perusing for information on Hotrockets, ran across your post.

You\u0027re correct that it\u0027s something related to the control law, but perhaps not what you\u0027d expect. If it\u0027s what I\u0027ve experienced on a few of my launchers, it\u0027s due to the root part wobbling significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, the payload is semi-poorly attached, which causes it to wobble one way. This causes the controller to try to correct for the wobble, which flings it across, and wobbles too far the other direction, causing the controller to try to correct even more. Etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s two solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrut the crap out of your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-or-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate a \u0027control pod\u0027 and place it somewhere on a stable part of the rocket, just on the side, and use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43208-0-24-Jul18-SelectRoot-Set-a-new-root-part-Still-works-in-0-25\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESelectRoot\u003C/a\u003E to rebuild the craft around that nice stable control pod (I\u0027ve always used a probe core, not sure if it\u0027d work otherwise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sufficiently dampens the oscillation as measured by the controller, and controls to a part of the rocket that\u0027s not oscillating wildly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Briefmoment","CreatedById":48182,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T10:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey RedAV8R and other Realism Overhaul peeps!
