Personally I\u0027ve never used Kax, but B9 it\u0027a an absolute \u0022must have\u0022 for me.\n\nIf the RPM part of it wasn\u0027t so memory intensive, I would always use it. I have never really found RPM to be useful, only nifty and cool; ALCOR uses it best imo. If I have B9, the game can\u0027t handle having both Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp (which is \u0022an absolute \u0027must have\u0027 for me.\u0022) and B9 installed at once. CSS (Component Space Shuttle) is one of my favorite mods of all time (I\u0027m talking of any game ever), mainly due to my love for the real Space Shuttle. Having that absolutely beautiful spacecraft in a game where I can do whatever I want is just plain awesome! It has also increased my appreciation of it and my mourning for its cancellation/retirement (no tears shed though). I can give the cancelled missions another chance, push it\u0027s limits, and use it to its full potential which was sadly never truly realized (I mean the entire Space Transportation System, which included the Space Shuttle, a Space Tug, and a Nuclear Shuttle Vehicle. The Space Shuttle was the only built component, although the Space Tug was planned to be \u0022half-donkey\u0027d\u0022 [sorry for the avoided profanity, but I couldn\u0027t think of any other way to express it. Blame the English language! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)] as the Centaur-G; but was sadly stopped by the Challenger Disaster).\n\nOk, back to the main topic: I think that KAX\u0027s propeller engines should be earlier on than jets, It seems *very* wrong to have both at the same time."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T21:41:34Z","Content":"**[MOD - Moved to General Add-on Affairs, since this is more of a \u0022What is your favourite aircraft parts pack?\u0022 poll rather than an actual development thread]**"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T21:46:30Z","Content":"Favorite spaceplane mods were SP\u002B and Nertea\u0027s Mk4.
