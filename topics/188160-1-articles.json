Buuut there\u0027s some stuff like inertial angles being flipped, the help screen not showing all the available screens, etc. Small stuff. Plus a few things I would like to add as well. I was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction of how to fix this? Seems like tunefix, the original creator, hasn\u0027t had any activity for the past year. There\u0027s the whole thing on github here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Tunefix/KSP_MOCR/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Tunefix/KSP_MOCR/releases\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and I found which files contain what needs to be fixed but they\u0027re all .cs or something? The standalone download, not the master, seems like it was compiled with Python which I\u0027m pretty familiar with. I could honestly fix what I want in the master files but have no idea how to compile it or work with those files. Also not sure what the pyssmq server is or what it\u0027s used for. Google returns nothing on pyssmq. Telemachus with the Houston UI looks ok but not great and it\u0027s incredibly laggy for me. But KSP MOCR runs very smoothly and I absolutely love the retro look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I also want to be able to select targets and view relative velocity, inclination, etc\u00A0which is not currently an option. That\u0027s the one thing I really want to add to the mission controller side of things since the pilot will be locked into IVA mode only (without the fancy custom IVA screens as that renders a mission control redundant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-11T15:02:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2019 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by LockManipulator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
