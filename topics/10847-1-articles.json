What exactly is efficiency measuring? At lower efficiency do engines use fuel faster?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the same design at the same alt (around 400 meters) and got around the same distance with both before running out of fuel. The test designs were 1) 3 Basic Jet Engines, 2) 3 TurboJet Engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance to anyone who can provide information or guidance!

While yes, a turbofan will operate better at higher altitudes, you can still easily get off the ground with them.

I cannot seem to pull more than a 1.5-2G turn, not only because the game doesn\\\u0027t really let me, but these engines aren\\\u0027t producing a whole lot of thrust, contrary to what you might think... they\\\u0027re actually just piling speed on gradually. If you make a sharp turn, not only will the aircraft fall out of the sky and completely lose control, but assuming that doesn\\\u0027t happen, you have to sit there and slowly wait for the velocity vector to catch up - because the engines, even dual turbofans on a very lightweight design - just aren\\\u0027t making a whole lot of Delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf turbofan operated as poorly as you all seem to want, you\\\u0027d see aircraft with multiple styles of jet engines on them in real life, which just doesn\\\u0027t happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m experimenting with small fighter aircraft designs and while they *work*, they don\\\u0027t work very well, and if we make it so that I now have to tack on 4 different kinds of engines just to get high-altitude flight, well, that\\\u0027s just getting kind of silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: My wing loading is utterly massive and yet it takes the whole runway to get in the air - that should tell you how these engines aren\\\u0027t really that great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s not just the engines though, the wings don\\\u0027t simulate lift properly and they actually resist your attempts to turn, the engines themselves are ok I think but the new fueltank isn\\\u0027t very balanced, and the new RCS thruster is massively overpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe really need a way to see where the center of gravity and thrust is in the SPH, as it\\\u0027s too easy to make a plane with all the weight and lift at the back, and it\\\u0027ll then struggle to get airborne without bags of trim.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECenter of gravity would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I want engines and control surfaces that let me pull 7-9G turns and still maintain control and a modicum of speed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\\\u0027m making two little addons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Turn the Small Hardpoint into a second version with decoupler functionality so I can use it to drop tanks - the current decoupler is just way too big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Add internal fuel to wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried the aerospike? its got an output of 225 and is the most powerful stock engine, it\\\u0027s not vectoring though, I haven\\\u0027t used it yet so don\\\u0027t know if it\\\u0027s what you\\\u0027re after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd extra control surfaces for more manoeuvrability \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.... can\\\u0027t seem to make wings carry fuel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have fuel in them and they appear to still generate lift, but the fuel won\\\u0027t transfer out, even with piping (which shouldn\\\u0027t even be required).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
