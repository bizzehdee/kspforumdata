To settle the debate even further, give players the option to adjust their hairstyle. Most players will likely automatically ascribe genders to each hairstyle, based on their own personal views--but when they realize that X Kerbal can also be given hair that matches other genders (in their mind), perhaps they will begin to realize that the Kerbals really don\u0027t have a gender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frozen_Heart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frozen_Heart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDevs have stated that they are added a model for female kerbals.
