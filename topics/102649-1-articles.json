It will have skids instead of wheels. Now, the wonderful thing about friction is that it exerts force, proportional to the friction coefficient and the relative velocity at which the two objects are moving. In most normal circumstances, a plane will either be unable to take off from level ground, or able to take off from anywhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut take a plane with skids and a powerful enough engine that it can barely gain enough speed to take off from level ground and, \u003Cstrong\u003Eif you put it on a conveyor belt that doubles its effective velocity relative to the ground, it will fail to reach enough speed to take off\u003C/strong\u003E, due to increased friction, as well as friction not being reduced by the lift it would have gotten from actually moving forward against level ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntertaining enough? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.

The winch is located off the end of the people mover which is moving \u0027backwards\u0027 at 5kts. You hold onto the rope, and your wheels spin beneath you - but you don\u0027t move backwards. The speedometer on the wheels indicate 5kts. Then the winch begins to turn, and you are pulled along the people mover. The winch pulls you at the exact same RPM as before, and so you are now moving forward at 5kts, the speedometer on the wheels would indicate 10kts, and if you had an airspeed indicator it would indicate 5kts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine is the same as the winch/rope; completely independent of what is going on with the free turning wheels and so just as you move forward, the plane moves forward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this is assuming the bearings in all the wheels have 0 friction.

People make all kinds of fundamentally faulty assumptions. Wheels do not count, as they are not powered. The propeller or the jet engine provides the forward motion so that the wings can provide enough lift to fly. Wheels have nothing to do with that. If you want to nitpick you could say the wheels reduce friction, and are therefore relevant, but they do not provide any of the speed that gets an aircraft into the air. Planes are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E cars. Wheels are not powered on them. Wheels are just passive things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir speed is what counts, not ground speed. This is what I mentioned earlier. Slow craft, like gliders, can actually fly backwards in relation to the ground. However, they can never do the same in relation to the air, as that would be falling, not flying. They need to maintain proper airspeed, while ground speed is totally irrelevant. That is why taking off into the wind is easier and taking off with the wind harder. You already have some of the relevant speed you need in the first case, and need extra in the second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that still is not enough for you: aircraft can fly while tethered to the ground in strong winds. It is the reason flaps and spoilers need to be set in such a way that it pushes itself to the ground. If ground speed mattered, that would be impossible, yet it is a very real concern in airfields when there are strong winds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-wjtP90d_g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T22:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
