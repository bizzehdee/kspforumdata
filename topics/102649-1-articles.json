A rotary wing aircraft generates lift by spinning it\u0027s wings through the air, even from a stationary position. A fixed wing aircraft must move forward to generate lift.

Try imagining with something more tasty. Like Jello, custard or icecream. Now make our conveyor out of Jello, or custard or icecream, and our wheels will be replaced by skids (made of ice cream cones of cause). As there is very little friction, our river of flowing dessert just does nothing to slow down our aircraft. It\u0027s like trying to take off from ice... it can be done. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo, unless the wheels melt, fuse into a solid lump, and dig into the ground, they have little effect on stopping the craft. If our aircraft on skies can take off, so can the aircraft on a treadmill. Once our skies start to dig in, is about the same point a wheel would start to slow the aircraft.\n\nSo the question is not \u0022can an aircraft take off from a treadmill\u0022 but \u0022can an aircraft take off with broken wheels\u0022. That depends on each aircraft, some produce enough thrust, most do not (see carrier launched craft as an example. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ).\n\nPS, breaks are not wheels. As much as parachutes are not the ground. Breaks work by *increasing* friction. Our treadmill does not, it can move 1mph or 1million mph, the friction stays (roughly) the same. Though I do agree at some point friction will overtake it... at which point you sheer off the wheels and get to the point of \u0022broken aircraft\u0022 trying to take off again. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:48:37Z","Content":"It comes down to friction, really. The actual answer is that there are 3 types of planes in this regard.\n\n1: Planes that **can\u0027t** take off, from the conveyor belt AND level ground. Imagine a seaplane without secondary wheels on the pontoons. The propeller\u0027s thrust might tip the plane over, but it will not be able to gain enough speed to take off, even if the ground under it were not moving.\n\n2: Planes that **can** take of, from the conveyor belt AND level ground. Any regular plane with regular wheels will be able to take off from level ground with ease, and there isn\u0027t much a conveyor can add to this.\n\nMost importantly to this discussion, 3: Planes that can take off from level ground... **but can\u0027t take off from a conveyor belt** This will heavily depend on the design and mass of the plane, but think of something like a plane intended for use in northern areas, where snow and ice are everywhere. It will have skids instead of wheels. Now, the wonderful thing about friction is that it exerts force, proportional to the friction coefficient and the relative velocity at which the two objects are moving. In most normal circumstances, a plane will either be unable to take off from level ground, or able to take off from anywhere. \n\nBut take a plane with skids and a powerful enough engine that it can barely gain enough speed to take off from level ground and, **if you put it on a conveyor belt that doubles its effective velocity relative to the ground, it will fail to reach enough speed to take off**, due to increased friction, as well as friction not being reduced by the lift it would have gotten from actually moving forward against level ground.\n\nEntertaining enough? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:52:14Z","Content":"Yep.

The engine, whether propeller driven or turbine driven makes the plane move. Whether the plane is on a conveyor belt or not is irrelevant. \n\nHere\u0027s some examples of what happens in different situations:\n\nIf the plane is on a fixed runway, and the required airspeed for flight is 60kts, the headwind/tailwind is 0kts, and you were to put a speedometer on the wheels, the speedometer would indicate 60kts, the airspeed would indicate 60kts, and the plane would lift off. \n\nIf the plane is on a conveyor belt with all of the same parameters above except the conveyor belt is moving the opposite direction of the aircraft\u0027s thrust at say 20kts, the aircraft will move forward until the airspeed is 60kts, the speedometer will read 80kts, and the plane will lift off. Same if the conveyor would moving backwards at 300kts. Airspeed would indicate 60, speedometer would indicate 360, the plane still takes off.\n\nIf the plane is on a fixed runway, and the required airspeed for flight is 60kts, the headwind 60kts, and you were put a speedometer on the wheels, the speedometer would indicate 0kts, the airspeed would indicate 60kts, and the plane would lift off.\n\nIf that\u0027s too difficult to understand, think about this:\n\nImagine you are wearing a pair of rollerblades/rollerskates, or on a skate board. You hold a rope attached to a winch, and you are on a normal floor. The winch begins to turn, and pulls you. You will be pulled across the floor - at say 5 knots. If you had a speedometer on your wheels, it would indicate 5kts. Same situation except on a airport people mover. The winch is located off the end of the people mover which is moving \u0027backwards\u0027 at 5kts. You hold onto the rope, and your wheels spin beneath you - but you don\u0027t move backwards. The speedometer on the wheels indicate 5kts. Then the winch begins to turn, and you are pulled along the people mover. The winch pulls you at the exact same RPM as before, and so you are now moving forward at 5kts, the speedometer on the wheels would indicate 10kts, and if you had an airspeed indicator it would indicate 5kts. \n\nThe engine is the same as the winch/rope; completely independent of what is going on with the free turning wheels and so just as you move forward, the plane moves forward. \n\nNow, this is assuming the bearings in all the wheels have 0 friction. In the real world there would be some friction in the bearings, and so you would need to have ever so slightly more power to attain that 60kts of airspeed.\n\nSigned,\n\nMe\n\nCertified Flight Instructor and owner of two airplanes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T14:02:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EdFred**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:01:41Z","Content":"Quick question: Is the plane a VTOL?"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:04:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Quick question: Is the plane a VTOL?\n\nIrrelevant."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:26:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Smarty-pants.

People make all kinds of fundamentally faulty assumptions. Wheels do not count, as they are not powered. The propeller or the jet engine provides the forward motion so that the wings can provide enough lift to fly. Wheels have nothing to do with that. If you want to nitpick you could say the wheels reduce friction, and are therefore relevant, but they do not provide any of the speed that gets an aircraft into the air. Planes are *not* cars. Wheels are not powered on them. Wheels are just passive things.\n\nAir speed is what counts, not ground speed. This is what I mentioned earlier. Slow craft, like gliders, can actually fly backwards in relation to the ground. However, they can never do the same in relation to the air, as that would be falling, not flying. They need to maintain proper airspeed, while ground speed is totally irrelevant. That is why taking off into the wind is easier and taking off with the wind harder. You already have some of the relevant speed you need in the first case, and need extra in the second.\n\nIf that still is not enough for you: aircraft can fly while tethered to the ground in strong winds. It is the reason flaps and spoilers need to be set in such a way that it pushes itself to the ground. If ground speed mattered, that would be impossible, yet it is a very real concern in airfields when there are strong winds.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-wjtP90d_g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T22:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"}]}
