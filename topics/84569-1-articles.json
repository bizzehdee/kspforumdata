It is called the FLOATBOAT 2000. I was building it on my DMP server while my friend messed around, and I didn\u0027t seriously expect it to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut work it did! I built a boat capable of at least 135 m/s (486 km/h), and I haven\u0027t even tested it to it\u0027s maximum speed yet. It remains controllable (but unmaneuverable) throughout this time, although it lost several intakes and a rudder while I was trying to turn at that speed. At lower speeds (around 30 m/s) it is maneuverable even without the rudder I lost and it doesn\u0027t lose any intakes while turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to the water is handled by a large set of wheels, and it took a good 20 minutes to wheel the thing to the water. This is the only disadvantage of the FLOATBOAT so far. The FLOATBOAT itself is powered by two jet engines, and is steered by two below-water rudders and four above-water fins. The rudders underwater provide an advantage, or at least have some effect, as they seem to help with stability and when I lost the right one the craft started listing to the left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nnHLSX3l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nnHLSX3l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the FLOATBOAT with wheeling gear on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JpYDtEo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JpYDtEo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfirmation of speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SNrbwJyl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SNrbwJyl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FLOATBOAT kinda digs into the water at high speed.
