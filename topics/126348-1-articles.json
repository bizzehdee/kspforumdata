There are scientific gains. There is no envisionable economic gain to build a moon base, or a Mars mission or even a Mars base, but there are scientific gains. Yes, sure, you can do most things with rovers or probes and what have you, but there is still a lot to learn from boots on the ground. We\u0026#39;re still at a time where it is commonly accepted that theory can only go so far and at some point, you need to get your hands dirty. Eventually we will have to expand beyond our planet, but there is a lot to be learned before that can be done. We still don\u0026#39;t know how people would fare with 1g, and microgravity itself has shown itself to be troublesome. We still don\u0026#39;t know a bunch of things I don\u0026#39;t even know that we didn\u0026#39;t know. I sincerely believe that we need people to go to these places and find out what it is like.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022[COLOR=#333333]Requiring humans on a mission has nothing to do with science goals.\u0022 itself is flat out wrong and I think it\u0026#39;s time that you start clarifying your point and making your case.
