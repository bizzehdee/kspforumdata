This tutorial works for versions 1.0 to 1.3.\n\nMore than giving a script or set of instructions, my goal with this tutorial is for you to gain an understanding of the factors that affect your rocket\u0027s behavior during launch, so that you can apply it to any rocket you fly. For that, you\u0027ll need to go through the entire post, but I\u0027m also including a TLDR as a \u0022cheat sheet\u0022:\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETL;DR (courtesy of \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102132-kbob/\u0026do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022102132\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102132-kbob/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@kBob\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E)\u003C/u\u003E\n\n1. Turn ON \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and set throttle to give \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~1.5.\n\n2. Launch!\n\n3. When your speed reaches 50 m/s, perform a pitch over maneuver (tip towards the East until pointing between 5\u00B0 to 10\u00B0).\n\n4. When \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E stabilizes (i.e. the control input arrows on the bottom left are all centered), turn it OFF. Avoid control inputs and use only throttle to control your gravity turn (throttle up to turn slower, throttle down to turn faster).\n\n5. When your altitude reaches ~40 km, turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E ON. Start pitching down manually towards the horizon and adjust throttle to keep your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E around 45 seconds in front of you.\n\n6. When your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E reaches the desired altitude, cut your engines, coast to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and circularize.\n\n==========================================================================================\n\n**General Notes on Gravity Turn**\n\nYou all probably know by this point that to get into orbit you need to go up, above the atmosphere, but you also need to go sideways (i.e. horizontally) very fast. To do this, we could launch straight up until we\u0027re out of the atmosphere, then point sideways and accelerate to orbital speed. But that would be very inefficient. We want to launch in a way that we gradually turn sideways while we ascend. This is called a gravity turn. \u003Cu\u003ET\u003C/u\u003Ehe best way is to do [a real gravity turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn); that is, a turn ***caused by gravity and aerodynamic forces***, rather than one achieved by actively turning the rocket. It is important to keep this in mind.\n\n**Design Items**\n\nBefore even launching, you need to take these design items into consideration when building your rocket:\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/u\u003E: Your thrust-to-weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E) at launch should be relatively low, around 1.5. A higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at the beginning of the launch makes it harder for your rocket to turn naturally, as gravity will have less influence on its trajectory, making it fly straight and screwing up your gravity turn. Keep in mind that drag losses are almost negligible in the new aero, unless your rocket is shaped like a brick or you are going extremely fast in the lower atmosphere. Thus, a *slightly* higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of around ~2.0 *in theory* is more efficient, but only if the launch profile is flown correctly. The drawback is it makes your rocket less forgiving in terms of control during ascent, and it shortnes your widnow to make a pitch-over maneuver. What usually ends up happening is that you have to force the gravity turn manually, which does generate significant drag (because you expose the sides of your rocket to the airstream anytime you deviate from your prograde vector), and causes steering losses (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E wasted on changing direction rather than gaining velocity). This reduces overall efficiency and defeats the purpose of having a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to begin with. A higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E also causes increased stress to the craft, inducing wobble and risking a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E, especially when trying to maneuver. You may experience heating issues too. For these reasons, in my experience, \u003Cu\u003Ea \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~1.5 is a good sweet spot between efficiency and controllability of the rocket\u003C/u\u003E. Smaller and lighter rockets handle higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s better than big and heavy ones and each craft will have its own sweet spot; you are encouraged to experiment. If you find your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at launch is too high, either use a smaller engine or just throttle down, and vice versa. As a final note, all rockets will have their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E go up as the launch progresses due to shedding weight by burning fuel. This is normal and you should manage by reducing throttle throughout the ascent as needed (more on this below). You can check your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E with the Kerbal Engineering Redux mod (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E) or with MechJeb, or if you\u0027re running a stock game, the G Force meter roughly doubles as a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E meter (if the G Force meter is pointing at 1 your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is roughly 1, and so on).\n\n\u003Cu\u003EAerodynamic Stability\u003C/u\u003E: You want your rocket to be aerodynamically stable. That means that it will have a natural tendency to fly straight, instead of, say, sideways. Any object that flies through the atmosphere will naturally orient itself with its center of mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E) facing forwards relative to its trajectory and its center of drag (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E) facing backwards. You can see this in darts, arrows, badminton cocks, etc. Similarly, you will want to have your rocket\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E in front of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E. To ensure this, add 3 or 4 winglets or wing surfaces with radial symmetry at the base of the rocket\u003Cu\u003E, and if possible cover your payload in a fairing to make it more streamlined\u003C/u\u003E. If your rocket insists on flipping, you need to add more/larger wings at the bottom. If that still doesn\u0027t fix it, it means your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is shifting back too much as fuel is burnt. The heaviest part of a rocket in KSP is usually the main ascent engine(s), so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E will tend to move back as fuel is spent. The easiest way to fix this is to add a small fuel tank at the top of the stage that\u0027s experiencing the problem and lock the tank in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (right click on the tank and select the green arrows for both fuel and oxidizer). This fuel tank will act as ballast keeping your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward. You can unlock it manually in flight when the rest of the stage\u0027s fuel is gone so as to not waste it, and then stage as normal.\n\n**Ascent Profile**\n\nOnce you\u0027ve implemented the above design items, follow these steps for your ascent:\n\n1. Turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and set your throttle to whatever will give you a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~1.5.\n\n2. Launch!\n\n2. As soon as your speed hits 50 m/s, perform a [pitch-over maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn#Vertical_climb) to begin your gravity turn. To do this, tip your rocket towards the East *slightly*, until it is pointing between 5\u00B0 to 10\u00B0. Don\u0027t start pitching over before your speed is ~50 m/s, otherwise you will likely find yourself horizontal within a few seconds, as your winglets won\u0027t be biting into the air hard enough to provide stability. The higher your thrust, the more you need to pitch over initially, because higher thrust makes the rocket want to go straight. If you\u0027re using a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E higher than 1.5, your pitch-over should be to at least 10\u00B0.\n\n3. As soon as your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E stabilizes (i.e. the control input arrows on the bottom left are all centered) turn off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Watch closely for this moment, as you will have only a small window of a few seconds at most before the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E starts trying to resist the gravity turn. Turning \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off while it\u0027s trying to steer will cause your rocket to become unstable and lose its heading or possibly break up. You should be done with your pitch-over maneuver and have your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned off by the time your velocity is around 100m/s. If you take too long and your rocket is going too fast by the time you\u0027re done, it won\u0027t want to continue turning (fast rockets like to go straight, remember?) and you\u0027ll have to force the turn manually, which is inefficient and causes stress on your craft. As mentioned above, a gravity turn should happen on its own and not as a result of control input. For particularly unwieldy rockets, you can lock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde instead of turning it off during this phase. However, stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is far from perfect and it\u0027s best to let gravity and aerodynamic forces do the steering for you. If you do use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, be sure to disable it before you hit 35 km to avoid you craft from jolting down suddenly when the navball automatically switches to orbit mode, which happens at around 35 km.\n\n4. Enjoy the view while your prograde marker gradually sinks towards the horizon; your rocket will follow on its own thanks to gravity and aerodynamic forces. Try to avoid control inputs during this phase (i.e. no AWSD), just let it fly. \u003Cu\u003EIf you need to make adjustments, use throttle. Remember, lower thrust means the rocket turns more, higher thrust makes it want to go straight\u003C/u\u003E. At about 10 km altitude, you should be pointing roughly to 45\u00B0 and your speed should be around 500 m/s. If at 10 km altitude you\u0027re still pointing above 45\u00B0, your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was too high and you went too fast and/or your pitch-over maneuver was too gentle. Next time throttle down more or make a more aggressive pitch-over maneuver. On the other hand, if you\u0027re pointing below 45\u00B0 at 10 km, you went too slow and/or your pitch-over maneuver was too aggressive. Next time use higher thrust or do a gentler pitch-over maneuver. If your rocket flips on its end at any point, it\u0027s not aerodynamically stable enough. See above under \u0022\u003Cu\u003EAerodynamic Stability\u003C/u\u003E\u0022 for possible solutions.\n\n5. \u003Cu\u003EAt around 40 km altitude, turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E back on and start steering manually; use pitch and throttle to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ekeep your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E around 45 seconds in front of you\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. Any time you\u0027re burning above the horizon, you\u0027re wasting part of your thrust to gravity instead of gaining horizontal speed; this is called gravity losses or gravity drag. In the initial stages of the launch, you can\u0027t help incurring gravity loses because you need to gain vertical speed to get out of the atmosphere. The atmosphere also means you can\u0027t steer away from the prograde vector without inducing aerodynamic drag, steering losses and/or destabilizing your rocket. However, by the time you get to ~ 40 km, you\u0027ll have enough vertical speed and the atmosphere will become negligible. Thus, at this point you want to begin gradually pitching down towards the horizon. During this phase, you will also start adjusting your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u0027s most efficient to perform your orbital insertion burn right at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, so you want to keep it \u0022hovering\u0022 only a few seconds in front of you. Of course, you don\u0027t want to it to get too close either, otherwise you risk passing it and falling back down into the atmosphere. A time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~45 seconds is a good rule of thumb to balance safety and efficiency. To control your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003Etime to Ap\u003C/abbr\u003E, use pitch and throttle. If your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is more than 45 sec, throttle down a bit and point more horizontal, and vice versa. Avoid pitching below the horizon. Continue adjusting pitch and throttle until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E reaches your desired altitude, at which point you can cut your engines, coast to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and circularize. Note that as you approach orbital speed, there will be a point when your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E will begin shooting away even if pointing straight at the horizon and no matter how much you throttle down (unless you cut the engines of course). If you reach this point, just let it go until engine cutoff; any efficiency gains from keeping your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E near you will be negligible by then.\n\n**Advanced Mode**\n\nTry doing the ascent and orbital insertion in a continuous burn. This is the most efficient profile (citation needed) and it\u0027s *extremely* satisfying. Easier said than done, though. To pull it off, you need to allow your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to creep closer and closer during steps 4 and 5, while not allowing it to get higher than your intended orbital altitude. You do this by reducing throttle and lowering your pitch in a more aggressive manner. The closer you are to orbital velocity, the closer you can allow yourself to get to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. You want to hit orbital velocity exactly at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. There will be much trial and error and the exact procedure will vary from rocket to rocket, but give it a try!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-10T20:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2017 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by A\\_name**"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T17:56:35Z","Content":"Updated for 1.0.5."},{"CreatedByName":"rodentgun","CreatedById":156120,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T18:30:17Z","Content":"Oh goodness.

Specifically, the points about SAS seem to be worth serious consideration.\n\nOne thing I have been a bit baffled about is the shift of prograde when changing from surface velocity to orbital velocity. I suppose at this time the craft should be sufficiently far from atmosphere for attitude to matter much less. Then again I have a lot of experiments with spaceplanes which have good thrust in atmosphere, low thrust in vacuum and generally pretty bad drag characteristics so my thinking is probably skewed some, because I have had to consider whether to burn with the jets in vertical to get rid of drag, or horizontal to actually attain orbital speed, all the while micromanaging the shifting engine efficiency due to speed and altitude.\n\nThose experiences aren\u0027t based on gravity turns but consider the same relationship between aero forces versus thrust amount\u0026direction and gravity.

Is there a particular size range where one is more practical, or am I mistaken?\n\u003E \n\nThe point of 10 degrees at 50 m/s is to get the gravity turn started.  You want to be beyond 45 degrees at 20 to 30km, so you have to start early.  The new aero model with 1.0.x isn\u0027t kind to the old \u0022suddenly jerk your rocket over\u0022 of the earlier releases.  That said, the aero model also allows greater efficiency through reduced gravity losses by having trust-to-weight ratios higher than 1.5 (although much less than 2.0) but you will have to manually turn the rocket (and get steering losses, but they will be offset by your lower gravity losses).  As mentioned in the original post, fast rockets don\u0027t like to be steered.\n\nThe problem with going straight up (assuming a 1.5 TWR) is that you are spending three times the thurst for every bit of acceleration you get.  You want to get sideways as soon as possible so that you get as much acceleration from that thrust as you can.  Obviously, you can\u0027t just go sideways from the launch pad (unless you are on a airless moon), but 45 degrees at 15km works much better than 0 degrees at 15 km.  You could presumably try a late gravity turn with a TWR of 2.0 (or more, but I think kicker SRBs explode from overheating if you are over 2.1), but I don\u0027t know how you will find the means of turning at the speeds you will have (and you pretty much wasted all the speed you generated going up in the wrong direction).\n\nThe first thing you need to learn about orbital mechanics is that velocity is everything.  Height is only a side effect from getting your speed sufficiently high, and only needs to eventually hit 70\u002Bkm (note that real rockets barely need any circularization burn.  They have achieved nearly all the needed velocity on the way up)."},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T06:52:42Z","Content":"wrong thread, no forum option to delete posts\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-15T06:53:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2016 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa**"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T17:37:22Z","Content":"Most of my rockets are about 3/4 as tall as the VAB.
