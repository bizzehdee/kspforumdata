To do this, we could launch straight up until we\u0027re out of the atmosphere, then point sideways and accelerate to orbital speed. But that would be very inefficient. We want to launch in a way that we gradually turn sideways while we ascend. This is called a gravity turn. \u003Cu\u003ET\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehe best way is to do \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ea real gravity turn\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E; that is, a turn \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecaused by gravity and aerodynamic forces\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, rather than one achieved by actively turning the rocket\u003C/span\u003E. It is important to keep this in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign Items\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore even launching, you need to take these design items into consideration when building your rocket:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/u\u003E: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EYour thrust-to-weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E) at launch should be relatively low, around 1.5\u003C/span\u003E. A higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at the beginning of the launch makes it harder for your rocket to turn naturally, as gravity will have less influence on its trajectory, making it fly straight and screwing up your gravity turn. Keep in mind that drag losses are almost negligible in the new aero, unless your rocket is shaped like a brick or you are going extremely fast in the lower atmosphere. Thus, a \u003Cem\u003Eslightly \u003C/em\u003Ehigher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of around ~2.0 \u003Cem\u003Ein theory \u003C/em\u003Eis more efficient, but only if the launch profile is flown correctly. The drawback is it makes your rocket less forgiving in terms of control during ascent, and it shortnes your widnow to make a pitch-over maneuver. What usually ends up happening is that you have to force the gravity turn manually, which does generate significant drag (because you expose the sides of your rocket to the airstream anytime you deviate from your prograde vector), and causes steering losses (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E wasted on changing direction rather than gaining velocity). This reduces overall efficiency and defeats the purpose of having a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to begin with. A higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E also causes increased stress to the craft, inducing wobble and risking a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E, especially when trying to maneuver. You may experience heating issues too. For these reasons, in my experience, \u003Cu\u003Ea \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~1.5 is a good sweet spot between efficiency and controllability of the rocket\u003C/u\u003E. Smaller and lighter rockets handle higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s better than big and heavy ones and each craft will have its own sweet spot; you are encouraged to experiment. If you find your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at launch is too high, either use a smaller engine or just throttle down, and vice versa. As a final note, all rockets will have their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E go up as the launch progresses due to shedding weight by burning fuel. This is normal and you should manage by reducing throttle throughout the ascent as needed (more on this below). You can check your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E with the Kerbal Engineering Redux mod (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E) or with MechJeb, or if you\u0027re running a stock game, the G Force meter roughly doubles as a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E meter (if the G Force meter is pointing at 1 your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is roughly 1, and so on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAerodynamic Stability\u003C/u\u003E: You want your rocket to be aerodynamically stable. That means that it will have a natural tendency to fly straight, instead of, say, sideways. Any object that flies through the atmosphere will naturally orient itself with its center of mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E) facing forwards relative to its trajectory and its center of drag (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E) facing backwards. You can see this in darts, arrows, badminton cocks, etc. Similarly, you will want to have your rocket\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E in front of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E. To ensure this, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eadd 3 or 4 winglets or wing surfaces with radial symmetry at the base of the rocket\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E, and if possible cover your payload in a fairing to make it more streamlined\u003C/u\u003E. If your rocket insists on flipping, you need to add more/larger wings at the bottom. If that still doesn\u0027t fix it, it means your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is shifting back too much as fuel is burnt. The heaviest part of a rocket in KSP is usually the main ascent engine(s), so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E will tend to move back as fuel is spent. The easiest way to fix this is to add a small fuel tank at the top of the stage that\u0027s experiencing the problem and lock the tank in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (right click on the tank and select the green arrows for both fuel and oxidizer). This fuel tank will act as ballast keeping your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward. You can unlock it manually in flight when the rest of the stage\u0027s fuel is gone so as to not waste it, and then stage as normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAscent Profile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve implemented the above design items, follow these steps for your ascent:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETurn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and set your throttle to whatever will give you a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~1.5\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELaunch\u003C/span\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

To do this, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Etip your rocket towards the East \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eslightly\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E, until it is pointing between 5\u00B0 to 10\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E. Don\u0027t start pitching over before your speed is ~50 m/s, otherwise you will likely find yourself horizontal within a few seconds, as your winglets won\u0027t be biting into the air hard enough to provide stability. The higher your thrust, the more you need to pitch over initially, because higher thrust makes the rocket want to go straight. If you\u0027re using a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E higher than 1.5, your pitch-over should be to at least 10\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAs soon as your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E stabilizes (i.e. the control input arrows on the bottom left are all centered) turn off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. Watch closely for this moment, as you will have only a small window of a few seconds at most before the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E starts trying to resist the gravity turn. Turning \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off while it\u0027s trying to steer will cause your rocket to become unstable and lose its heading or possibly break up. You should be done with your pitch-over maneuver and have your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned off by the time your velocity is around 100m/s. If you take too long and your rocket is going too fast by the time you\u0027re done, it won\u0027t want to continue turning (fast rockets like to go straight, remember?) and you\u0027ll have to force the turn manually, which is inefficient and causes stress on your craft. As mentioned above, a gravity turn should happen on its own and not as a result of control input. For particularly unwieldy rockets, you can lock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde instead of turning it off during this phase. However, stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is far from perfect and it\u0027s best to let gravity and aerodynamic forces do the steering for you. If you do use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, be sure to disable it before you hit 35 km to avoid you craft from jolting down suddenly when the navball automatically switches to orbit mode, which happens at around 35 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Enjoy the view while your prograde marker gradually sinks towards the horizon; your rocket will follow on its own thanks to gravity and aerodynamic forces. Try to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eavoid control inputs\u003C/span\u003E during this phase (i.e. no AWSD), just let it fly. \u003Cu\u003EIf you need to make adjustments, use throttle. Remember, lower thrust means the rocket turns more, higher thrust makes it want to go straight\u003C/u\u003E. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAt about 10 km altitude, you should be pointing roughly to 45\u00B0 and your speed should be around 500 m/s\u003C/span\u003E. If at 10 km altitude you\u0027re still pointing above 45\u00B0, your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was too high and you went too fast and/or your pitch-over maneuver was too gentle. Next time throttle down more or make a more aggressive pitch-over maneuver. On the other hand, if you\u0027re pointing below 45\u00B0 at 10 km, you went too slow and/or your pitch-over maneuver was too aggressive. Next time use higher thrust or do a gentler pitch-over maneuver. If your rocket flips on its end at any point, it\u0027s not aerodynamically stable enough. See above under \u0022\u003Cu\u003EAerodynamic Stability\u003C/u\u003E\u0022 for possible solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u003Cu\u003EAt around 40 km altitude, turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E back on and start steering manually; use pitch and throttle to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ekeep your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E around 45 seconds in front of you\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. Any time you\u0027re burning above the horizon, you\u0027re wasting part of your thrust to gravity instead of gaining horizontal speed; this is called gravity losses or gravity drag. In the initial stages of the launch, you can\u0027t help incurring gravity loses because you need to gain vertical speed to get out of the atmosphere. The atmosphere also means you can\u0027t steer away from the prograde vector without inducing aerodynamic drag, steering losses and/or destabilizing your rocket. However, by the time you get to ~ 40 km, you\u0027ll have enough vertical speed and the atmosphere will become negligible. Thus, at this point you want to begin gradually pitching down towards the horizon. During this phase, you will also start adjusting your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u0027s most efficient to perform your orbital insertion burn right at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, so you want to keep it \u0022hovering\u0022 only a few seconds in front of you. Of course, you don\u0027t want to it to get too close either, otherwise you risk passing it and falling back down into the atmosphere. A time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~45 seconds is a good rule of thumb to balance safety and efficiency. To control your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003Etime to Ap\u003C/abbr\u003E, use pitch and throttle. If your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is more than 45 sec, throttle down a bit and point more horizontal, and vice versa. Avoid pitching below the horizon. Continue adjusting pitch and throttle until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E reaches your desired altitude, at which point you can cut your engines, coast to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and circularize. Note that as you approach orbital speed, there will be a point when your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E will begin shooting away even if pointing straight at the horizon and no matter how much you throttle down (unless you cut the engines of course). If you reach this point, just let it go until engine cutoff; any efficiency gains from keeping your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E near you will be negligible by then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Mode\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry doing the ascent and orbital insertion in a continuous burn. This is the most efficient profile (citation needed) and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eextremely \u003C/em\u003Esatisfying. Easier said than done, though. To pull it off, you need to allow your time to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to creep closer and closer during steps 4 and 5, while not allowing it to get higher than your intended orbital altitude. You do this by reducing throttle and lowering your pitch in a more aggressive manner.
