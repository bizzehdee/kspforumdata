An add-on (Kerbcomp?) module that can be installed in the command module (or upgraded command modules, e.g MK2, MK3 etc) can synchronise and automatically execute the maneuver on time, provided SAS/RCS is active and it has time to align to the maneuver prograde target. I\u0027d suggest it uses electrical charge to perform synchronisation (and requires a comms device) and to store it\u0027s target requires a trickle of electricity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not played with any mods yet - having played the demo for a few days and then splurging on the full game, my gameplay path went: Demo-\u0026gt;Tutorials, Demo-\u0026gt;Sandbox, Full Game-\u0026gt;Career mode, so I may have missed some learning aspects, otherwise, I\u0027m loving this game - always enjoyed a bit of rocketry!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
