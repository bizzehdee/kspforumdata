I have the science module you get after the goo container. I went up past the atmosphere and \u0027observed\u0027 the experiment. Then a box opens up saying that I will get 22 science for recovering the data, or 7 for transmitting the data. I save it to my clipboard, land, and recover the ship with module intact. I see no points awarded for the flight, and no point gain on my \u0027scoreboard\u0027. What am I doing wrong? I\u0027m using a pilot, does that matter? Hopefully someone can explain why it tells me I will get 22 points and then not receive them. \n\n-thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T11:00:50Z","Content":"Do you use any mods that deal with science or strategies?\n\nDid you only recover the pilot and not the ship maybe?\n\nDid part of the ship fall off upon landing?"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T11:23:52Z","Content":"Are you sure you didn\u0027t reset the experiment by mistake ? If you clicked on the \u0022recycle\u0022 button it erases itself. You MUST always click on \u0022Keep data\u0022 button (or send).\n\nRetry on the launchpad"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T13:25:06Z","Content":"Also, when you recovered the ship, what did the science report say? Did it not even *mention* the materials bay (that\u0027s the name of the experiment)? Or did it show that you recovered it, but it awarded zero points?\n\nIf the science report doesn\u0027t even mention the materials bay, then it\u0027s likely one of the reasons that the previous responses indicated. If it\u0027s mentioned but says zero points, that would be an indication that you already have points for that instrument in that situation and you can\u0027t get any more."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:11:38Z","Content":"Copy to clipboard? How do you mean?\n\nAs someone else mentioned already, what you need to do to actually get the science points once you\u0027ve \u0022observed\u0022, is to press either the green \u0022keep data\u0022 button, or the blue \u0022transmit data\u0022 button."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:15:14Z","Content":"Also did you have multiple material bays on board? My first time I tried launching 5 mat bays but the diminishing returns happens on each bay even though it say you will get full science."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:57:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did you only recover the pilot and not the ship maybe?\n\nThis is honestly my bet. You can maximize your science income by getting out of the capsule after landing and doing EVA stuff, so just about every new player tutorial recommends it.\n\nBut if you don\u0027t climb back inside the ship before recovering, you recover *only* the Kerbal. The empty craft is still out there, and can be recovered via the tracking station."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:46:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Copy to clipboard?\n\nI think by \u0022clipboard\u0022 he means the UI that pops up to show you your science results. The green \u0022keep results\u0022 does have kind of a clipboardy icon on it, I think that\u0027s what he means by \u0022save to clipboard.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Browncoat","CreatedById":146380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T19:00:41Z","Content":"What Snark said. My Kerbal is inside the craft when I click \u0027recover craft\u0027. It could be that I hit reset experiment by mistake while right clicking on the module. I\u0027ll play around with it some and see what happens. Thanks everyone."}]}
