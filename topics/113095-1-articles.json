I have the science module you get after the goo container. I went up past the atmosphere and \u0027observed\u0027 the experiment. Then a box opens up saying that I will get 22 science for recovering the data, or 7 for transmitting the data. I save it to my clipboard, land, and recover the ship with module intact. I see no points awarded for the flight, and no point gain on my \u0027scoreboard\u0027. What am I doing wrong? I\u0027m using a pilot, does that matter? Hopefully someone can explain why it tells me I will get 22 points and then not receive them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T11:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you use any mods that deal with science or strategies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you only recover the pilot and not the ship maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid part of the ship fall off upon landing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T11:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure you didn\u0027t reset the experiment by mistake ?
