I am using the largest helicopter blades and the R7000 turboshaft engine. The vehicle lifts off fine, albeit with some help from vernor engines, but the second I enter it into \u0022plane\u0022 mode the engines are massively too weak to propel it, capping at about 35m/s. The vehicle weighs 66,5 tonnes. Is there any way of improving the thrust/weight ratio without adding more rotor/jet engines? Why is it that they have enough power to lift the whole thing off the ground, but not to propel it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I\u0027m new here and couldn\u0027t figure out how to insert images into my post, here\u0027s an imgur link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/msRQ73z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/msRQ73z\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T07:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, if it can lift, then it has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E greater than 1 when standing still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut once you start moving the angle of attack on the blades changes and they produce less thrust if the blade pitch is not adjusted.

What you do set is the pitch of the blade.) I believe you set the pitch of the blades by setting them to deflect and then adjusting the \u0022authority limit\u0022 in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E, correct? You can bind this authority limit to one of the axis groups in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and use that to adjust it during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you describe is exactly the effect I\u0027m talking about. If you increase the pitch of the blades above the value for optimum thrust at standstill, then it will give less thrust at low airspeeds (your plane lifts slower) but will give better thrust at high airspeeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBut:\u003C/strong\u003E I made a test, switching the 2m prop blades with the 2m helicopter blades on one of my planes. And got essentially the same result you got: good acceleration at low airspeeds, but lousy maximum airspeed (for me it was ca. 40 m/s instead of 120 m/s with the prop blades). So I guess that this is the fundamental difference between these two types of blades: the helicopter blades give higher thrust in general but max out at low speed, and the prop blades have less thrust at low airspeeds but can keep their thrust up to higher speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try prop blades instead of the helicopter blades, or adding prop blades to the same engines that you have the helicopter blades on (i.e. have two sets of blades on the same engine). But my guess is that both won\u0027t work too well. (Prop only will probably have too low static thrust to lift the plane, and with both on the same axis the helicopter blades probably generate lots of drag at high airspeeds.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T14:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForward velocity requires some pretty steep pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this reason I place my helo blades, deploy them to -150 in the editor, then rotate them so that they are flat/parallel with the ground (when the nacelles point up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I have from -150 to \u002B150 to adjust the pitch, to give a much higher top speed.
