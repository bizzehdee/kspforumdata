The model rework mod shows it in an easy way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small arrows show where the base of that part is. If you dock two crafts the root part of the vessel can change. If you got into a situation like I built in this screenshot one of the joints will be oriented the wrong way and thus not work correctly anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure you could \u0027simply\u0027 rotate the joint in the right orientation and reattach it to the vessel in the plugin.

The fundamental problem is that when you dock two craft together the tree structure of the craft causes some parts to be reversed (that we knew), but it causes the created joint to behave strangely almost as if there\u0027s two fighting each other, and if you force this then the craft is liable to be krackened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you save and load the craft again the joint will be fine but the part would just be visually reversed. Also any rotation you applied before the save will be treated as zero when you reload, potentially causing the part to move more or less than you intended. This seems to be true for translational parts too, but the position of the part gets changes. Basically, because IR does not know if this part switch-around has occurred, there\u0027s no way for the plugin to even begin to flip the models or whatever to overcome this issue. If you\u0027re willing to spend the time, you may find situations which will work, but ultimately the original disclaimer still applies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuel","CreatedById":118530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ziw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ziw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases/tag/v0.21.3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/MagicSmokeIndustries/InfernalRobotics/releases/tag/v0.21.3\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can wait for KS and Curse release, but sirkut is a bit busy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot mate, for the link although I don\u0027t seem to be able to test it do to a glitch in the 1.0.4.861 build, building upgrades do not take effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks a lot mate, for the link although I don\u0027t seem to be able to test it do to a glitch in the 1.0.4.861 build, building upgrades do not take effect.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;Slow clap\u0026gt; Well done Squad \u0026lt;/Slow Clap\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuel","CreatedById":118530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiusInfuser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiusInfuser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026lt;Slow clap\u0026gt; Well done Squad \u0026lt;/Slow Clap\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was solved, it turned out that the problem was with 0.0.9 kopernicus it was added to the updated vs of Kerbol Plus and I did not noticed, so updating it with 0.1 solved the issue, anyhow I am not very happy with the 1.0.4 update as it interferes with quite some mods generating severe issues, for such a small update I don\u0027t think squad did a proper testing before it\u0027s release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrafZahl","CreatedById":147027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T12:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks @Aqua and @ZodiusInfuser for explaining this.

The mass of the ring is far greater than the mass of the command pod (root part) at the rings hub. Now the mass needs to be considerably different as leverage is also at play here. In the VAB the ring rotates because of which side of the docking washer it is on. In space you aren\u0027t connected to anything. When the Canadarm 2 moves an item around on the ISS. The station is moving in the opposite direction as the payload on the arm. Push the item away you push the entire station away in the opposite direction. But the mass of the station as well as the cushioning of the canadarm\u0027s joints slowly changing speeds is such, it moves very slow / not at all, with a light payload at the end of the Canadarm 2. So in short make the hub / station heavier, the ring lighter. Adjust the acceleration curve of the docking washer, as well as add SAS to the stationary bits. No SAS on the ring and it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T21:38:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
