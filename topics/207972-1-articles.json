Loading large complex crafts can fail. (See some of ShadowZone videos.) Bases loading in the ground and either exploding or jumping in off the surface.

For myself, the pros ultimately triumph over any cons or the pros cancel out cons. It may be different for others-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPros:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. New parts. There will probably be more available for pure Kerbolar system exploration too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. All KSP1 parts will be in KSP2, but will undergo changes. For example, the NERVA will be 2.5 meters in diameter in KSP2. Thus \u0022rebuilding\u0022 craft (even if just to the greatest extent feasible) will be more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Support. I did not think about it, but if I am not going to be able to play KSP1 eventually anyways, I might as well move over to the modern successor now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The Kerbolar system is being left as similar to KSP1 as possible. New technology and features but the basic environment is virtually identical. Ironically, specifically because I have so much left to do in KSP1, I don\u0027t mind going back and doing what \u0022little\u0022 I have done in KSP1 over again in KSP2- in fact, it would be great fun (I enjoy flying missions over again) and would have a tinge of newness to it thanks to new features and the visual enhancements. So, I am not really leaving KSP1 behind at all- it is all there in the new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4a. Because KSP2 is a new game, instead of just \u0022doing what I did over again\u0022 it may as well be doing it for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Bug fixes/bugs-problems not existing in the new game. Assuming the rover bug mentioned above is fixed, among other surface related challenges, missions that were previously a little unworkable (like standalone rover probes) will be more feasible. I found it rather unfortunate that my Lunokhod 1 replica exploded just a short while after the mission concluded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. New technology. I like to build replicas, but there are a lot of replicas that I can\u0027t build because the parts aren\u0027t there in KSP1 (I play the game stock). Especially the addition of more electric engines will be nice. Also, finally having nuclear reactors as power options will be great too. Paint schemes will be nice, as I will be able to make a green Soyuz and an orange External Tank, the latter without having to use colored flags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Performance? The discussion on this seems a little all over the place to me. On the one hand, resource use (or whatever it is called) is going to be improved, but on the other hand, I recall a thread discussing the ideal computer for KSP2 claiming the specs have been raised? I don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECons:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. It is indeed going to suck that 2 years of building in KSP1 is going to go away. On the other hand, when I was in the process of considering buying KSP two years ago, I knew full well that KSP2 was on the way. Although I bought KSP1 instead of waiting on the grounds that I didn\u0027t really care about interstellar travel and thus wouldn\u0027t need KSP2, I eventually became interested in such concepts and continued playing KSP1 while fully being hyped and excited for KSP2- recognizing that I would \u0022lose\u0022 my work. So I don\u0027t have too much of an issue with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. I thought I had more last night, but I either I can\u0027t remember them or I didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Performance? As above, I don\u0027t understand the situation on that. Perhaps I won\u0027t be able to even play KSP2, in which case I don\u0027t have too much of a problem with sticking with KSP1 and might examine using parts mods. Although I would still get it in the future, I probably won\u0027t get a new computer just for KSP2 (yes, get, I am not technologically fluent enough to build a PC, and in any case, I hear it is expensive at the moment anyways).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be really cool if we had a memorial to KSP1 in KSP2. I would like to build a space resort around it, and put old KSP1 parts on display in a museum next to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb24","CreatedById":214340,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-29T23:41:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan on buying KSP 2 as soon as possible, but I will finish KSP 1 before playing KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-30T00:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224124503\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221651275696\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022214340\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerb24\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, Kerb24 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan on buying KSP 2 as soon as possible, but I will finish KSP 1 before playing KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious what you define as \u0022finish\u0022.

So instead of getting perturbed in any way about things that I could not do, I focused on the prospects of a fresh start, taking lessons I had learned in previous versions and applying them to the current version in hopes of having a better game experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, over the course of building several gigantic automated farms over several versions of Minecraft, I found that I became limited by my supply of iron of all things.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI needed that iron for hoppers (and they take a whopping 5 ingots each!), but I kept using hoes so much that they would either just break, or need repair at an anvil. And the iron to make those anvils and repair those hoes (and make new ones) was a significant drain on my resources so my hopper production was not keeping up with what I needed for how big of a farm I wanted to build. Here\u0027s what I learned: I know the \u0022don\u0027t waste diamonds on a hoe\u0022 meme quite well, and usually it makes a lot of sense. However, in my situation a diamond hoe with at least Unbreaking III on it seemed to be what I needed. Even then, I went thru 2-3 of them. Now consider this: Where previously I might have needed enough iron to make 50 iron hoes, I could replace that with diamonds enough to make at most 3 hoes. Sounds like a good deal to me, since I\u0027m already boring down to the level of lava and then just mining 1000 blocks from the origin in \u002B- X and Z coordinates (turning the lava to obsidian but not mining it unless it\u0027s higher than the average lava level). Diamond supply was NOT an issue. Iron supply was an issue, before I switched to diamond hoes (and all other tools as well, with them usually having Unbreaking III and Mending on them, along with one Silk Touch pickaxe).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd as for why I wanted such a large farm in the first place? First off, why not! IMO farms in Minecraft are far too small to sustain a person, let alone many. Secondly, I ended up selling most of the crops to Villagers in exchange for things I actually needed, without having to \u0022torture\u0022 the villagers (let them get turned into a zombie at night in a boat, and then cure them, and it gets you more favorable exchange rates, but I didn\u0027t feel like that was the intended gameplay mechanic so I avoided it).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, what I learned from that is \u0022Test or at least analyze the common knowledge to see if it applies to your situation like you think it does, sometimes your specific situation is an exception to where the common knowledge applies\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, the whole point I\u0027m trying to make is that maybe you shouldn\u0027t get so hung up on \u0022not finishing the old thing before you move on to the new\u0022. Especially since you have no idea how the new game plays. It\u0027s way more than just a graphics upgrade (but that is part of it). And if you do like the older looks of some parts, I\u0027m sure a mod will come around that maybe lets you load the old KSP part assets into KSP 2 (using some form of asset referencing to avoid infringing copyright or modifying core game files, kinda like how ModuleManager works when applying changes to Squad files (it doesn\u0027t change the file on your hard drive, just how the game interprets it) but across 2 games that share a game engine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-30T22:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224124383\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221651257589\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/29/2022 at 7:39 PM, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224124378\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221651257494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miklkit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/29/2022 at 7:38 PM, miklkit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a good game with some very frustrating bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nName them please (for latest version).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Welcome._New_here%3F.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Welcome._New_here%3F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-30T22:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I can do better than NAMING the bugs.
