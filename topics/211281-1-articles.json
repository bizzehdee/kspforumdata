I\u0027ll add some tips for landing gear placement since that tends to be the next big hurdle to players after they figure out basic airplane design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nuse angle snap to make sure all your wheels are perpendicular to the ground and perfectly straight. I know it feels like it should be fine to angle the wheels in certain directions, but because of how KSP\u0027s wheel colliders and springs work it\u0027s with rare exceptions best to have them pointed straight and upright.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nattach them as close to the fuselage as you reasonably can. I mean close in terms of number of connections, but also to a lesser degree actual closeness. directly attaching your gear to the fuselage minimizes the amount of flexing and bending they can do, every additional joint between increases it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving the landing gear far from the fuselage increases the yaw moment wheel friction can apply to your aircraft, keeping a narrow footprint minimizes that. Of course you don\u0027t want to be doing a balancing act either, so just keep it in mind. I see a lot of inexperienced players attach their gear to the wingtips to avoid tipping over only to find themselves veering off the runway (and usually still tipping over after).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSimilarly to the above point, keeping the majority of your wheels rearward will help you stay pointed true while rolling. In the same way that in flight you want your center of mass ahead of your center of drag for stability, on the ground you want your center of mass ahead of your center of friction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep all that in mind and your aircraft should reliably at least have a chance of flying and maybe even landing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-03T10:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne big reason for oops-I-fell-off-the-runway syndrome is that your nose wheel can \u201Cdig in\u201D and produce too much friction, acting as a pivot point for the rest of the plane to rotate around and sending it veering off to the side. To fix this, enable advanced tweakables in the main menu settings then select your nose wheel(s) and override friction control, then set wheel friction to somewhere between 0.2 and 0.5- not 0 as this will make them useless for steering. The rear wheels should be fine as they are, friction at the back will help keep the plane stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should also increase the brake force at the rear and decrease it at the front to improve passive stability on landing, though the basic nose wheel has no brakes so this is more for later when you unlock retractable landing gear and also for rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvanced tweakables has a lot of useful extra features that can be very helpful, including greater controls for rover wheels, the ability to autostrut parts together to prevent wobbly rocket syndrome and assign fuel tank priorities to drain tanks in a specific order; I usually set them to drain from bottom to top in a stage as this shifts the centre of mass upwards and helps to keep the rocket passively stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Director_Valle","CreatedById":224482,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-03T16:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tutorial by Mike Aben might be useful:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/416zilwOwAQ?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Designing a First Plane - KSP Beginner\u0027s Tutorial\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for veering off the runway at take off, make sure your landing gear is straight and that your plane isn\u2019t too heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-03T16:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224215025\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672686763\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Many of my attempts to make planes veer off and crash, regardless of tech level.
