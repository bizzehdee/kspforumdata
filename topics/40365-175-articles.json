I don\u0027t have a solid suggestion on how to do this.

Nobody is ever going to refuel a fission reactor except to say they did. I\u0027m sorry, but uranium and thorium need to either go or be made super more convenient to play with - like giving the reactor a small internal storage for all the fuels and byproducts, allowing it to switch available fuels manually and automatically upon exhaustion, and having one (small) container that can hold useful amounts of all radioactive stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that\u0027s it.
