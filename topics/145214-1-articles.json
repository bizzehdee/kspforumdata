Need someone to point me in the right direction. I have a cheapo Netgear wireless router cabled to the satellite internet modem. We use a variety of laptops and a desktop all running off the wifi router. It used to work perfectly for my application, then Avast advised updating the firmware. I probably wouldn\u0027t have updated as we have no neighbors close enough to steal our signal, but the satellite had speed issues. I knew the problem was on the satellite companies end but had to try everything just in case.\u00A0Honestly these two issues are otherwise totally unrelated (I have internet speed back and did nothing but keep pestering the provider).\u00A0Anyway\u00A0followed the firmware update directions carefully. It works on everything except my XP laptop. I know it connects to the router with excellent strength. It even seems to be trying to establish a secure connection but eventually times out. I dug out another old XP machine and tried to connect with same result. All other computers, games (WII-U), and even my wife\u0027s Nook work fine. It has to be something about the firmware but I\u0027m baffled. Where do I begin to look?

I finally solved my router problem this morning. My oldest laptop running XP stopped being able to connect to webpages after a router firmware update (3 other computers on the network worked fine). I had been out shopping for a cheap replacement. Decided I wanted nothing to do with Win 10 (I\u0027ve seem the latest Bourne movie -kidding mostly). Decided to take a final look. Uninstalled Avast and it worked fine. I had previously tried disabling it and the firewall on the XP laptop just in case but it didn\u0027t help. I had to completely uninstall then reinstall. Not sure why a change to the router firmware would mess up my XP connections\u00A0- especially since the only reason I did the firmware update is because Avast told me to do it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just my little couch laptop that I surf the forum while watching TV.
