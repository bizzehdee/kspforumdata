Six minutes after launch, the Odin spacecraft had entered a 102.6 km x 99.9 km orbit around Kerbin and the crew started system checks, readying everything for the trans-munar injection. After one hour in space the crew was done with checks and fired the S-IVB stage to put them on their way to the Mun. Ten minutes after finishing the burn, it was time for the transposition and docking maneuver. The CSM seperated from the remaining craft, turned 180 degress and docked with the MEM. Command Module Pilot Bill Kerman performed the maneuver. He then used the RCS to pull the two docked spacecraft away from the spent S-IVB stage. Now everything was set up for their coast to the Mun - time for a nap and some snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the usual one day trip to the Mun the SPS fired over the it\u0027s fars side, slowing down the spacecraft in order to enter a munar orbit. After a few hours around the Mun Valentina and Bob enter the MEM and ready it up for its trip. They soon undock and lower their orbit. After 26 minutes they start the main breaking maneuver and slowly decended into the giant midland crater. Because of a new decend profile fuel started to become crital soon. However Valentina expertly steered the MEM to a precission landing with the last drops of fuel. The engine ceased working just one meter over the munar surface and the MEM set down safely although a bit rougher than usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter completing their landing checklist Valentina an Bob donned their space suits. It was time to once again step one the Mun. Right after egress Valentina planted the obligatory flag and went on a small mun stroll while Bob set up the two OMSEP stations. On his way back to the MEM Bob collected a few samples and the first EVA had to be concluded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a little nap and some snack in the MEM, the two kerbonauts where ready for their second EVA. They once again exited the MEM and went on a walk to the nearby crater where they examined it\u0027s rim. It was decided to name the crater \u0022Jebediah\u0022 in honour of the famous pilot who lost his life in the Odin I accident. Valentina climbed down into the crater to collect more samples while Bob stayed behind on the rim, watching her. After returning to Bob they examined several more rocks and finally returned to the MEM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce inside they took another nap, sorted and bagged their samples and prepared for liftoff. After spending a whole day on the munar surface, Val fired the ascend engine to return to the CSM. After about one hour the two spacecraft docked in munar orbit. Bob and Val transfered back to the CSM with their collected samples and. The ascend stage was jettisoned and left to crash onto the Mun while the now reunited crew fired up the SPS to return them back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trip home was uneventfull, only disturbed by a small midcourse correction. 126 km above Kerbin the Service Module was jettisoned, the crew was commited for reentry. Protected by the heat shield they hurtled through the atmosphere before splashing down safely, four days, three hours and three minutes after launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/grKV8/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:08:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T20:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow!

Even with the naked eye you could see that something was different. The shoud of the mighty Sleipnir V had to be altered to accomodate the Munar Rover, the most exiting technical innovation on this mission. But the booster had no problem with the increased weight. When the countdown reached zero, the cluster of Mainsail engines fired, creating a fiery inferno beneath the rocket that slowly started to move upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the acceleration was small in the beginning, the rocket soon reached high speeds. Two minutes after liftoff, when the first stage separates, the rocket is moving at over three times the speed of sound. The sky turns black and the curvature of Kerbin becomes visible when looking out the window. Five minutes into the flight, after a short cruise phase, the S-II stage reignites to circularize the orbit. Once the burn is completed, the spent stage is separed and the shroud is ejected. But this time there was a small problem: Some of the charges to blow the shroud did not fire. So while the shroud was fractured it did not fly off as intended. However the spacecraft was able to \u0022break free of it\u0027s cocoon\u0022 using a bit of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a one hour period of system checks in orbit it was time to go to the Mun. The S-IVB stage fired and put the crew on its course to our distant companion. Ten minutes after the burn was concluded it was time for the docking and transposition maneuver. The CSM separated and turned around. Bill Kerman, the command module pilot, docked the two crafts and pulled them away from the spent S-IVB stage. With this last hurdle gone, the crew relaxed, ate some snacks and took a nap while they cruised toward the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout one day later the crew fired up the SPS while passing behind the backside of the Mun to decelerated the spacecraft and enter a munar orbit. Bob and Val, giddy to test out their new equipment, soon board the MEM and undock. Leaving Bill behind in the CSM while they descent down to the Plait Plateau. Because of the increased weight, Val has to set down the lander softly. A rough landing like on Odin XIV could tip the lander an potentially strand both of them on the Mun. But the seasoned pilot she is, Val gently sets down the MEM on the ground, right in the target zone and with four seconds of fuel to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking out the window, they can both see the munar arch aswell as mons matterhorn.

Once both were awake, they ate some snacks and then donned their space suits. After egress one of the big innovations on this mission was deployed: the munar rover. During the flight it was attached to the side of the MEM and was now separated and paced in a upright position next to the lander. Val checked out the fuel tank, the batteries and the fuel cell before both kerbonauts got onto the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe commander took the helm and the two kerbonauts headed to the Riley rille, about two kilometers to the north.

With a few breakes to collect samples and to recharge the batteries they arrived at the Riley rille and stopped at it\u0027s edge. Val and Bob exited the rover and collected a few samples of the sorrounding area before getting back on the rover to head straight into the rille. They followed the rille eastwards, stopping now and then for more samples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the sides of the rille got more even they exited the rille, back to the plateau. Having spent so much time collecting samples Val puts the pedal to the metal to get back to the Lander, since they still had to set up the OMSEPs during their first EVA. Val accelerated to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=41.4\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkm%2Fh\u002Band\u002B41.4\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph\u0026amp;dataset=\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E41.4 m/s\u003C/a\u003E while Bob started to quiver. The flight surgeon in ground control suspected Bob of having a heart attack when the two Kerbonauts hit a small bump and lifted off the munar surface for a few meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce back at the lander Bob seperated the OMSEPs while Val took care of the rover, making sure nothing hat broken. They then deployed the OMSEPs together, carrying them to their location about a hunded meters of the MEM. At this point it was time for another Nap, as physical activities in spacesuits are quite taxing. So they headed back into the MEM, munched a few snacks and hung out for a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell rested, they donned their spacesuits a second time and, after some persuasion on Vals part, they both got on the munar rover and headed for the \u0022von\u0022 and \u0022Kerman\u0022 twin craters. They are obviously named for Wernher von Kerman (whose ego is so inflated he needed two craters named for him). Up to now, they were on schedule but the way to the ridge of \u0022von\u0022 was steeper that it appeared from a distance, so the two kerbonauts lost some time while crawling up the slope at a snail\u0027s pace. Bob was happy. Once on the ridge Val stopped for a few quick samples before heading straight into the crater and up it\u0027s westward flank. While geologically interesting this side also provided a nice downward slope to accelerate toward the bridge between the two craters. Bob did not know that Val had bet fifty funds that she could jump from one crater to the other without touching the ground between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly Val lost her bet as they set down rather hard on the munar surface between the craters. Since the remaining flat surface was to short to break, Val instead accelerated and they hurtled on straight into the Kerman crater. When hitting the ground inside the crater one of the rovers tires blew. So Val brought the rover to a halt near a nice rock and, while Bob calmed his nerves collecting samples, Val replaced the tire. Once again late on ther schedule, they headed back to the MEM as soon as the rover was fixed. A small stop at Kermans ridge to collect a few samples and straight then straight to the lander. During the trip to the lander Val checked the new tire and the rovers reaction wheel by driving on only two wheels.

Once ontop Val collected several more samples and made pictures of the sorrounding terrain and the arch itself. They should keep the scientists at Kerbin busy for some time. Even though Val wanted to spent more time ontop of the arch, it was time to move on. After her descent Valentina got back on the rover and buckled up.

On impact the munar rover converted into a munar sled, meaning all tires blow and leaving Val without any way to steer. Hoping they stop before the drop into the Leto crater, Bob and Val slid through Atreides. Thankfully they stop within time. While Val was still high on adrenaline Bob started to replace the tires. It was time to collect a few samples from the Atreides crater before heading back. They headed up the western flank of the crater and then get the rover up to speed, crossing the crater and jumping of the north-east ridge off it into the fringe of the Riley rille.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Riley rille was their way back. They head up the rille, onto to the Plait plateau. Once again the steep terrain pushed the rover to it\u0027s limits. Val and Bob had to stop several times to recharge the batteries, as the fuell cell did not supply enough energy to keep them charged while driving. After almost 40 minutes the Kerbonauts were back on the Plait plateau and approached the MEM. Once back, Bob and Val got all their samples into the lander and took another quick nap before it was time to liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun was almost setting when the two Kerbonauts fired the ascend engine and left the Mun behind. A few orbital maneuvers later and the Crew was finally reunited. Just one more thing to do before leaving the Mun: Deploying the subsatellite. Happy to have something to do, Bill happily went to work. He opened the CSM equipment bay and activated the subsatellite engine. With just a little nudge it slowly drifted out of the CSM and into it\u0027s own munar orbit. The crew stayed just long enough to make sure the satellite was successfully deployed before preparing the trans-kerbin injection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trip home was uneventfull. The crew ejected the service module, as usual, when they approached the atmosphere of Kerbin. But due to their long stay on the Mun they had to reenter over Kerbins night side. They safely splashed down in the middle of the night, five days after their launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Vxznd/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SqQwgIz.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SqQwgIz.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:13:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T00:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving recently watched the Apollo 15 mission on DVD (I\u0027m a bit of an Apollo geek at heart) I must congratulate you on finding such a suitable spot on the Mun to recreate the mission.

Commander John W. Kerman, Command Module Pilot Thomas K. Kerman II and Munar Excursion Module Pilot Charles M. Kerman Jr. had been training for a long time for this mission to our distant companion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sleipnir V rocket worked flawlessly during the ascend. Once the first stage was burnt out and jettisoned, the S-II stage carried the spacecraft all the way to orbit. After \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Z0xKA7y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe problems during Odin XV\u003C/a\u003E the new shroud design had been reworked and now separated as intended, together with the S-II stage. The crew spent one and a half orbits, just over an hour, in orbit around Kerbin to check all systems before firing up the S-IVB stage for their trans-munar injection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe S-IVB stage worked as intended and put the crew on their desired path. With the burn completed the crew prepared for the last crucial maneuver before their cruise to the mun. Ten minutes after TMI burn was completed the CSM seperated from the remaining craft and turned around to dock with the MEM. Command Module Pilot Thomas K. Kerman performed the maneuver flawlessly, just like the endless times he had practiced in the simulator. In the mean time the Commander had prepared some snacks and the crew could slack while they were cruising towards the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in munar orbit, the crew started obeservations of the munar surface and prepared for the decent to the surface. About one hour after MOI John and Charles undocked and headed for the Hilbert Highlands. With the heavier J-mission MEM they have to take a very direct approach. Therefore just nine minutes after undocking the Gauss Crater and the Highlands came in to view. John initiated the main breaking maneuver and just five minutes later the MEM touched the munar surface, right in the target zone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter taking a quick nap inside the MEM John and Charles donned their spacesuits for their first EVA. John was the third kerbonaut to step onto the munar surface, followed by Charles a few minutes later. Their first task was to deploy the Munar Roving Vehicle and the two OMSEPs. After checking out the MRV, Charles and John each carry one of the OMSEPs to their deployment areas, about fifty meters away from the MEM. Once back at their lander they strap intro the MRV and take it for it\u0027s first ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir first target was the Newton crater. It actually consists of two craters, so the kerbonauts stopped at both centers to collect some samples before heading north-east, out of the crater. Next they drove along the ridge of Caushy, stopping periodically to collect samples and make pictures. The third station was the northern cluster, an indentation in the munar surface of unclear origin. John and Charles collected several samples and pictures of the sorroundings, hoping to shed some light on it\u0027s origins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis marked their furthest distance from the MEM on EVA1, at about eight kilometers. The kerbonauts then crossed the Hilbert highlands to get to Legendre, a crater on the southern edge of the highlands. Here they also collected several samples from the center of the crater before driving along it\u0027s ridge to the southern cluster, where Charles got off the MRV to collet several samples. Just like it\u0027s cousin on northern side of the highlands, the southern cluster is a series of indentations of unknown origin. Having secured these samples aswell, John and Charled headed back to the MEM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey transfered today samples into the ascend-module and called it a day.
