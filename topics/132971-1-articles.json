Note: I don\u0027t mean I don\u0027t use it, I just mean I set 25% rep to science and hardly ever touch it again. While it\u0027s good that is a fairly hands-off piece of the KSC, I\u0027d wager it\u0027s a little too hands off. Therefore, I recommend the addition of: Investors!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInvestors would be found also in the admin building as a separate tab from the strategies. Each investor would be acquired (bought, purchased?) using the reputation resource. Now, I know that some people may be thinking that \u0027we already have contracts, that\u0027s essentially investors\u0027 and I\u0027d say that\u0027s partially true. However, contracts are representative of the wants and needs of a specific agency (FLOOYD Dynamics, Probodobodyne, Symphonic Protonic Electronics, etc.) while investors would be singular individuals willing to throw their money at you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInvestors themselves are designed to reduce overhead of doing various launches without having to do eighteen contracts to get your one \u0027just for me\u0027 launch. Based on their happiness (covered later), they will provide a certain amount of funds per launch to your program. These funds are not affected by strategies. Gaining an investor is much like recruiting an astronaut, where there\u0027s a set of values for each investor: science, exploration, stability, progression, technology, and charitably. Each of these values but one denotes an expectation of your program, while charitably denotes how often they\u0027ll randomly and without condition give you a small (or large) stipend.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EIf an investor becomes too unhappy with your program, they may back out, no longer investing in your program and dealing a moderate reputation penalty.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter an investor comes on board, they\u0027ll have a relative happiness statistic. Each launch, crash, failed contract, or cancelled conrtact will drop happiness. However, based on their statistics, various actions can increase their happiness. For science, every repeated experiment done has diminishing returns for their happiness, while an experiment in a new biome or a new experiment in an old biome generates more. Exploration interests can be sated by new celestial body discovery/interaction, as well as flights brought back from father and bringing back data. Stability can best be described as \u0027days workout an accident\u0027, readily met with reverting, but less so without. Gauged by how many parts of a non-separated active stage (non-debris craft) are destroyed; major penalties for loss of life. Progression focuses can be appeased by new exploration, unlocking science nodes, and upgrading buildings, and technology interested investors tend to be happier when launches user higher tech-level parts (diminishing returns).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
