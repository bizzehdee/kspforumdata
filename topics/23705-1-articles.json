Assuming a prograde equatorial orbit, start a burn in the prograde direction (90) some time between late afternoon and midnight. Your \u0022escape trajectory\u0022 from Kerbin should be prograde and outward. On the map, zoom way out until you can see the orbit of your target, and watch until the orbits intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetrograde - same procedure, but start the burn in the prograde-to-Kerbin direction (90) some time between pre-dawn and noon, so that your ejection is retrograde and inward. Similarly, zoom way out until you can see your orbits intersecting, then cut the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got crossing orbits, you need a second burn at the ascending or descending node to match the orbital plane of your target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you reach the orbital intersection, check out your position and orbital resonance with your target .. you can usually make a single burn that will set you up for a rendezvous \u0022next lap\u0022, but sometimes patience and letting several laps pass will serve you better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a middle ground, you can use Kerbal Engineer Redux, which will calculate the correct ejection angle for you -- rather than just burning \u0022sometime between dusk and midnight\u0022, you\u0027ll get a \u0022start your burn at 119.823487 degrees from prograde\u0022 .. and a marker telling you your current angle to prograde. Easy enough -- this should help with #3, as your orbital intercept distance will be fairly small. If your burn was perfect, you\u0027ll actually intercept, but generally, I find that I can make a slight adjustment at the ascending-node/descending-node burn to achieve an SOI intercept by either adjusting radial-in/radial-out or adjusting my prograde/retrograde node in addition to the normal-plus or normal-minus adjustment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, ORDA or MechJeb can just about handle it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d rather get super into the planning and firing off the mission, then I suggest \u003Cstrong\u003Eolex\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027s website, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E, a.k.a. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInteractive Illustrated Interplanetary Guide and Calculator for KSP\u003C/a\u003E.

You can see that it takes about 1100m/s to get to duna. I want to have at least 2000m/s so i don\u0027t need to worry if something goes wrong and i have to make major changes wich may require some Delta-v. Since duna has an atmosphere we can use parachutes to land our equipment at Duna, so we only need a little bit of fuel to slow us down the last few km\u0027s if we are to fast so we dont smash into the surface. There is no real number on how much Delta-V you will need to land since it is mostly based on your skill, so the best thing is to test it on kerbin or use Hyperedit to make some tests on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, our fully equiped transporter needs at least 1100m/s to get to duna.

This is the point where you can save the most delta-v if you do everything the right way. There are different ways to approach this step, you can use spreadsheets and try to read the angle from the mapview or you use differnt mods to help you out. If you want to know more about phase-angles and how to visit other plantes you should check the forum or youtube, there are a lot of people out there who will teach you anything about KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing you should know is that going into a stable orbit around sun and after that waiting for a burn to intercept Duna is not an option because you will waste a lot of fuel this way. We will let Kerbin do the solar orbit for us und just do the intercepting burn when the \u0022window\u0022 has opened. The easiest way to set this up is to use the Kerbal Alarm Clock and set the timer for it as shown in the picture below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zU52aD4h.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zU52aD4h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zU52aD4h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I set up an Alarm to 10 minutes before the so called window arrives and we will start our burn towards duna. However, because we need to dock everything together and refuel it we need to stop a few days earlier so everything is ready to go when the time comes. At the moment, i have about 188 days left before the window arrives. Since I dont want my kerbals to stay that long in space we are going to warp to about 30 days before the window for now. this should give us enough time to do the rest of the work and give our kerbals some rest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YXcRehlh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YXcRehlh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YXcRehlh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we know the Delta V we need and we have our timers set up.

The plan is to dock them both together after they undocked with the Carrier and deorbit them together. At an altitude of about 11km i will decouple them and while mechjeb/ASAS will hold one of them steady I will use RCS the keep the other one close while they both decent next to eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI RECOMMENT that you use Hyperedit to test your lander and see if it works the way you want. I don\u0027t like cheating, but there is no other way at the moment and there is nothing more frustrating to find out that your craft is useless after you managed to get to another planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ewU5dych.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ewU5dych.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ewU5dych.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocked together, they got about 79m/s Delta-v and a lot of RCS wich is enough to get the orbit down into the atmosphere and land them. I tested them before and practiced to Land 2 crafts simultaniously and it worked, so they are ready for the mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext thing is the Rover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

As you can see it has enough Delta V and a high enough TWR to land at Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter we build our final stages we have to design the carrier:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

Why you ask? well because they simulate the mass of the Rover and the two Landers. Of course we dont leave them on there we just need to simulate the mass in orbit so we know the Delta-V we\u0027ve got with full payload. As you can see we got about 5000m/s of Delta-V wich is pretty much overkill for this mission, but since i like the simple design and i want to use this craft for further missions we will stick with it. If you wanted to return the carrier to Kerbin you would have enough fuel left to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur preperation is pretty much done to this point. The only thing we can do now is to look at our Script and Crafts again and search for mistakes we might have done or improve and expand the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest from here on is to launch and fly your crafts and finish the mission you set yourself.
