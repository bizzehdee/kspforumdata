The shuttle boosters were 4 segment. No amount of scaling is going to fix it because making the booster shorter disproportionally will not just shorten the \u0022tube\u0022 section it will smush the nozzle and bezel also and will look like crap. Do not shrink it, see if the guy who made it has the shuttle booster also or use the original boosters from the old version of the mod, they looked much better than the \u0022new\u0022 ones."},{"CreatedByName":"cheech420now","CreatedById":32124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:49:01Z","Content":"Well i have FSTextureSwitch2 working but im working out an issue with it not working till i reload the database"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:55:49Z","Content":"Ok so here are the options.

At this point I trust you, and I think you will make the right decision. Honestly if you have to maintain three rhree different boosters and cfg for aerodynamics you\u0027re gonna get burnt out.

Also i figured out what part of tweakable everything was messing it up. It was the tweakable staging dll. I removed it and its all working great now. Here is my CSS folder for you to look at.
