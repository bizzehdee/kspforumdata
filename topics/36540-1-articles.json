Direct observation is such a measurement that requires no models beyond well-established. Understanding of electrodynamics and statistics are required for you to believe that an image you receive from Hubble telescope is an actual image of a distant galaxy. Fortunately, our understanding of General Relativity is at least as precise. So observing motion of distant stars is no different than making measurements on currents in a detector of a modern telescope and analyzing them. In contrast, an indirect measurement relies on a model that is itself questionable. In which case the observation is conditioned on reliability of the model. For example, observation of an exoplanet based on luminosity changes requires a model to describe star\u0027s own luminosity cycles.

If I can infer the existence of an object by bouncing photons off or detecting radiation from something else and the behaviour of that object is consistent with another object that I cannot directly observe, I very definitely have made an indirect observation. The instrumentation that I\u0027m using to make that measurement doesn\u0027t really have any bearing on the directness of the observation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the terminology may be pretty rubbish but that\u0027s often what you get when you combine physics with common parlance but hopefully we know this already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, whether I have direct or indirect evidence of something is of little bearing on its validity. I could have an enormous number of high quality pieces of indirect evidence supporting the existence of one thing or a tiny number of hazy direct observations supporting the existence of another. Often it\u0027s easier to derive convincing evidence for the existence of something with direct evidence but there is no requirement for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T08:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot even close.

It\u0027s still being debated by some people whether or not they really exist. We have never directly observed one. Yes, we have observed the effects it has on it\u0027s surroundings, but we have yet to \u003Cstrong\u003Edirectly\u003C/strong\u003E observe one. Our best chance we will get in the near future to look at one will be with the James Webb Spatial telescope. With it\u0027s infrared vision it should be able to see rather clearly through the gas and dust clouds around the galactic core and directly capt radiation emitted by the black hole when it consumes matter. But for now, those are indirect observations. We have been proven to be wrong quite often in the past, and although it\u0027s highly unlikely that we are wrong about black holes, we could be, and it could be, just like black matter, another phenomena we don\u0027t quite understand. So \u003Cstrong\u003Eno\u003C/strong\u003E, we have not yet observed a black hole or even fully proven their existence. We have strong evidence, but they have yet to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to answer OP, before this thread goes more off rail than it already has, assuming that the materials from which we are made from created a black hole is taking a rather wild guess. Yes, all the matter we see around us heavier than iron was created in a supernova, but only a small percent of those end up in the formation of a black hole according to the current models. And this could have taken place million of years before the creation of the solar system, there\u0027s really no way to know. If it did create one, it\u0027s very unlikely that it\u0027s still hanging around. It could be thousands of light years away, there\u0027s really no way to know. Trying to observe it\u0027s presence, as stated above, would be extremely hard, and identifying it as \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E black hole that was generated from the supernova that created the matter we are made from would be absolutely impossible. Really, there\u0027s just no way of knowing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously I\u0027ve read more about black holes than any other stellar object, I\u0027m even seriously considering focusing my research on them once I get my Doctorate in Astronomy.
