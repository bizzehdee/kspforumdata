I am sure this has been suggested already but i couldnt find it ( i read the \u0022already suggested\u0022 thread and i tried to search the forums)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion might not be really important but in some situations i could have used timer trigger system. What is that? Its a countdown timer that executes a predesigned action after it hits zero. Example: 2 stage lander is entering the atmosphere of a planet. One stage is a jet plane and another is a small base that needs to land using parachute. When the stages are decoupled you have 2 options. 1. switch around between the jet and the base and do what you need to do (deploy chute and manually land ur jet) or 2. when decoupling occurs parachute is deployed as well and u keep flying ur jet. First one is complicated if the altitude is low, and 2nd one can sometimes make a disaster (base could hit ur jet cus parachute could create some rotation of the parts etc.; depending on ur orientation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Timer Trigger System could be assigned to start the countdown timer when you decouple your stages. And, in the provided example, it could deploy parachute after maybe 2s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could also make it a bit easier to plan your burns. Lets say you need to burn for 10s to reach your desired speed/orbit/whatever. Set the timer to cut the engine after that time has passed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETimers could trigger times as well, so you could make some cool shows in the sky for your own fun or for others to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts/critiques?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
