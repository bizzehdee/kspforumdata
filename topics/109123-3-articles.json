At the time, the challenge seemed impossible. Now, the powerful Sarnus V rocket has proven to be a reliable launch system. Orbital docking, landing on alien worlds, and living for months in space have all been proven possible. As the Kerbal aerospace-industrial complex churns out more Sarnus boosters, the boys at KSC need a mission that can expand on these technologies and accomplish something amazing. After all, if they slow down now, funding may disappear. And if one thing horrifies our Kerbals, it\u0027s the thought of being sentenced to LKO resupply missions. Those are just boring. Fortunately, an clever engineer came up with a plan to perform a flyby of Duna - and land at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i3iyZdIl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i3iyZdIl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe Plan\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kw1TXiul.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kw1TXiul.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You can read more about the Flyby-Landing Excursion Mode proposal at the excellent \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wired.com/2014/01/to-mars-by-flyby-landing-excursion-mode-flem-1966/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBeyond Apollo blog\u003C/a\u003E by David Portree, over at Wired.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA traditional stop-over at another planet costs a lot of Delta-V. You have to boost yourself out there, slow down a lot once you get there, and then boost yourself all the way back again. And you may end up having to wait for months or years in orbit of your destination waiting for a transfer window back home. As was demonstrated with the Ascension E-1 mission to Eve, you can nearly halve your Delta-V requirements by waiting for a flyby window - they\u0027re usually not the most efficient way to get to the other planet, but the gravity assist you get when you swing around the planet allows you to return home essentially free. The problem is that you only have a few hours in the planet\u0027s SOI as you zip by. Certainly not enough time to get surface samples!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Flyby-Landing Excursion Mode proposal gives the best of both worlds. The vast majority of your ship\u0027s weight performs a simple, cheap flyby. However, several days out from the encounter, a small lander separates and puts itself on a course to enter the planet\u0027s atmosphere. After a brief landing and excursion, the crew takes off and accelerates toward the main ship to catch a ride home. And that\u0027s exactly what the boys at Kerbal Space Center decided to do. They\u0027ll need to get a lander, a deep-space habitat, and a CSM to Duna. That\u0027s a lot of mass, but we\u0027ve found a way to do it using conventional propellants and minimum modification of the Ascension Program hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Mission\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhase A: Assembly\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/WtqlB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The first three launches lifted modified Sarnus V third stages into LKO. These modified third stages include solar panels, RCS, and docking adapters, but otherwise use the same design as a normal third stage. Once in LKO, the three boosters were docked remotely from Kerbal Space Center. The mated boosters will make up the main propulsion system for the Ascension D-1 spacecraft, performing the Trans-Duna Injection burn.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ENext, the \u0022assembly crew\u0022, consisting of Bob, Eliedith, and Kirgel Kerman, rode a Sarnus V into orbit.

Unlike the Eve flyby, there will be no wet workshop for this mission, so the ESM has been expanded for the lengthy trip to and from Duna. As the mission crew arrived, the assembly crew undocked their CSM and returned to Kerbin, where they will no doubt watch the entire mission from the comfort of their home theater systems. The mission crew docked their transposed CSM and ESM to the DEM and Propulsion Modules, and the Ascension D-1 spacecraft was complete.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EPhase B: Duna Flyby \u0026amp; Landing\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/7XEl3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

As the ship swung back around to periapsis, the three boosters fired again to send the crew all the way to their rendezvous with Duna. Partway through the burn, the two external boosters were depleted, and they were discarded. Finally, with the burn complete and the craft moving away from Kerbin at escape velocity, the last booster was discarded, destined to become a derelict object in solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 60 days until their Duna encounter, the crew was occupied with regular science experiments, maintenance checklists, and Phildred nagging everyone to play chess with him. Nobody liked to play chess with Phildred, because they always won. But they were bored enough that they did it anyway, which may have lead to Phildred developing a rather large head by the time the encounter with Duna was near. Ten days out, Phildred and Marene climbed into the cramped Duna Excursion Module, where they would live for the next 20 days. With Milus waving through the window, they used a few short bursts of RCS to place themselves on a trajectory to enter Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 days later, the Red Planet loomed large in the viewport window. For centuries, Kerbals had been fascinated by the red point of light in the night sky. Up close, with its canyons and polar caps visible in exquisite detail, Merene and Phildred were in awe of the planet\u0027s menacing beauty. They did not have long to gawk, however. As the aerodynamic shell of the DEM hit the anemic atmosphere at over 3,000 m/s, they were engulfed in a ball of plasma. When the fireworks were over, the shell and heatshield were dropped, and the drogue chutes were deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarene: We\u0027re at 5,000 meters and dropping fast, Phildred.

All systems nominal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhildred: Looks like we\u0027re over a pretty significant slope, Marene. I\u0027m worried the lander could tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarene: No help from KSC, it\u0027ll take 20 minutes before they can even here us from out here. I\u0027m taking manual control of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhildred: Maybe I should, I mean ... I am an expert pilot. And a master of strategy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarene: To hell with your ego, Phildred. I\u0027m landing this thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith precise bursts of the four Terrier engines, Marene deftly brought the DEM to a gentle halt on the side of the mountain. The lander tipped almost imperceptibly ... and stayed upright!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarene: The surface is about a half-meter hop from the end of the ladder. I\u0027m dropping...there! First Kerbal on Duna! Take that, Phildred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhildred: Hey, hopping on Duna is easy! I\u0027m still the second Kerbal on Duna, and the best chess player in space. I\u0027d say I\u0027m still coming out ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerene: Forget it, Phildred. Let\u0027s get these samples, we don\u0027t have a lot of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith their brief, two-hour EVA complete, the duo reentered the DEM and ignited the engines, emerging from the cloud of red dust and ascending into orbit. From their, they accelerated the craft to escape velocity, placing themselves on a course that would allow them to rendezvous with Milus and the main craft in 10 day\u0027s time. At the point of closest approach, the engine was fired one last time to match orbits with the main craft. Donning their spacesuits, the kerbanauts spacewalked (with the Duna samples in tow) to the ESM airlock and a warm welcome from a very lonely Milus Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E70 days later (10 of which Phildred spent locked in the CSM until he promised never to mention chess again), the crew caught their first glimpse of the Kerbin system through the window. They busily prepared for reentry, collecting all of the Duna samples and moving into the Command Module. The ESM and Service module were jettisoned, and the crew reentered at a blistering 4,800 m/s, with the beefed-up command pod heatshield protecting them from the reentry plasma. They descended under parachutes to splashdown and a hero\u0027s welcome - the first Kerbals to land on an alien planet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe eggheads back at the Kerbal Space Center are thrilled to have samples of Duna rocks, and will analyze them for signs of life in the months to come. Besides the scientific benefits, Ascension D-1 has proved the viability of in-orbit assembly of large ships with multiple propulsion modules. Wernher von Kerman believes that this could lead to a re-usable space program. He has talked of plans for a \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Transportation_System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Transportation System\u003C/a\u003E\u0022, using spaceplanes to deliver nuclear propulsion modules and space tugs to LKO.
