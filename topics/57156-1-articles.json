For me it was very much a trial and error process; building something, flying it, and correcting deficiencies. One of the things I learned to do was to try to keep the thrust level of my rocket engines similar to my jets, otherwise if the jets are overpowered you\u0027ll actually lose speed at first when switching to rockets.
