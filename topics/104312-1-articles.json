Plenty of crew space allows you to do crew transfers on the same flight you bring stuff up, and a spacious payload bay, specifically sized for low density payloads (sample payload is half full so it is around 20mT). It was designed actually to supplant the Dao because I was always running out of room before I run out of weight. Plus, it has somewhat of a margin in there, and it handles sweetly. And best of all, it does all things, plus the good looking part, in a modest 170 parts. It is not up to my usual ridiculous standards, I know (I have shuttles that use less parts), but all the intakes to feed those turboRAPIERs take their toll, and if you want to go big, you have to provide enough oommph. This one turned out more awesome than usual. Enjoy the flights! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA look at some statistics and stuff, so you know what you are getting into:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L3HdXuE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L3HdXuE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now the flight manual! My usual building tricks are used, and I took the time to write up the action groups in the file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight profile is, again, standard SSTO with the turboRAPIER twist. You know... \u0022as fast as possible to 20kms, keep vertical speed under 100m/ds until 25kms, level there for a speed run, when you go over ~1,500m/s start building vertical speed for the rocket takeover\u0022. The twist being you will have \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo\u003C/strong\u003E flameouts, first when the RAPIERs switch modes, and then a second one when one of the turbojets actually goes. Or not, because the last time I did it I got a 80 km apoapsis without turning off the jets... the air is routed so the spool down without asymmetric flameouts, so you can milk every last air atom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking about routing, I also did some magic and managed put both tanks so they drain evenly, so keep that in mind when refuelling, put the same amount in both tanks and that way the CoM won\u0027t move at all. The CoM, of course, being smack in the middle of the payload bay. Ditto for filling it up for maximum rocket delta-v, or to put only liquid fuel for atmospheric flights, just fill both tanks to the same level and the ship will be balanced. Simple, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: Update of the update! After a few not-really-prods form people using FAR, and realizing I had more potential wing area, I switched the wing to a more legit single-layer one, which might even give this some hope of surviving the aerodynamic revamp coming next week with some further modifications. The imgur album is a mix of two, I think you can differentiate them by wing (the old one joins the rear body in a different spot) and because I have put the shots of the new one right after the pic showing the (considerable) difference in wing area while retaining the shape. I\u0027ll probably do a new thread if I come up with a 1.0 compatible version, but for a week, I think that\u0027ll work. As such, I offer both versions now. In the nice news category, the resulting version, \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDaring\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E, is even more economical in parts, clocking in at an even 150. As not-so-good-news, wing loading is substantially higher, so takeoff speed is about 90m/s and lading on full tanks is a certainly not for the faint of heart.

Removed upper wing and lowered the hull abit for stability. With wings at half strength and even less \u0022cargo\u0022 the craft is at 73t and barely takes off at the end of the runway. Then it cant hold its nose up at 5km up anymore, followed by unplanned disassembly as level speed reaches 400ms at 5km.\u003Cp\u003ECuriously all stability indicators were green when I started modifications.
