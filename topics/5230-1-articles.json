Now, my housemates cook all kinds of things that smell funny to me, so i never pay it much mind. I\\\u0027m halfway back to kerbin when I smell burning paper. At that moment FRAPs crapped out on me and i decided to take a look out in the living room/ kitchen to see what was going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was greeted by grey smoke thicker then a rocket ploom. I rushed over to the stove and discovered that no fire had yet broken out. A pot had boiled off and it\\\u0027s contents started burning on the bottom of the pot and smoking. There were red hot embers when I arrived. Grabbed another pot, took the overheated pot outside, and put it somewhere safe to cool. Then i went around opening windows and turning on fans and vents. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo much for sleep tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-07T10:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that doesn\\\u0027t happen to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-07T21:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo where were your housemates through all this?

I yelled \u0027Mom?\u0027, and she ran out her room, looked at the smoke, and cursed. She was melting sugar to make some nectar for hummingbirds, but had burned it.
