I didnt pay much attention to the updating of this mod since it worked fine for me as it was, but as you also might know, in recent versions of KER, they removed the part needed to display the data, and now all my crafts that was made with this part is unavailable to load in. Are there any way for me to remove the part so that the rest of the craft might work? I have some pretty sweet spaceplanes and rockets that i would hate to lose since I have spent many hours designing and perfecting each of them.\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
