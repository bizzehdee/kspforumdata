And as of yet I still dont understand the inclination / Node /Argument descriptions of the satelite contracts.\n\nAnyways I just sound I had to get out of Kerbals SoI and raise my Apoapsis and Periapsis to the rigth numbers and would be done for since there wasnt any visible orbit on the map for it (while not being focused on the sun sigh... ) \n\nAfter I escape with my little satelite out of Kerbins SoI and was in an orbit of the Sun I suddently got the \u0022todo\u0022 orbit visible the first time and was completly shocked that it was clockwise ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nNow I have honestly not the slightest Idea how the hell should I be able to make a clockwise orbit around the sun.\n\nContract Specifics:\n\nApoapsis 66.9 Mil. Km\n\nOeriapsis: 4.9 Mil. Km \n\nInclination 170.8 Degrees (is this the thing that should have warned me thats clockwise instead of counterclockwise?)\n\nLongitute of Ascending: 3.8 Degrees\n\nArgument of Periapsis 217.7 degrees (or is it this... honestly no idea what this even means right now)\n\nContract Deadlne: 14y 200 days.\n\nCurrent Date of my KSP Program: Year 1 Day 32\n\nI am not even shure if this contract is worth it. It gave an advance of 70k Credits and will give a completion reward of 417k credits together with 180 science and 270 reputation.\n\nI am thinking about abandoning the contract atm but I cant afford the 82k Credit penalty (my space program is short on funds) and the 126 Rep Penalty and well... admiting defeat sucks...\n\nSo any Help would be great.\n\n(Oh and if it is any important I only use Alarm Clock and K.E.R. as mods)\n\nMy normal Satelites so far have a DeltaV of 6-7k after being in Kerbal Orbits. I sticked a Satelite Monster together atm but I cant even afford to launch it with has 25k DeltaV and a TWR of 0.15 (27 large Xenon Tanks and 3 Xenon Engines).

I personally haven\u0027t played career in ages, however with a small probe core and some static panels you should be able to lift it and even put it in the required orbit with minimal costs. An SSTO should cut it with a small satellite on top. just get into LKO by going retrograde and you are mostly there.\n\nMaybe lift the satellite with the long black and white tank with an lv909 engine on bottom and some reaction wheels and ou should be able to get a Kerbin escape trajectory with delta V to spare to fine tune the orbit for the contract. When im at home tonight i will see if i can throw something low tech together to achieve what you need (at work right now).\n\nTweety"},{"CreatedByName":"Doodle","CreatedById":139448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T13:13:30Z","Content":"I am fairly done with the Tech tree.

Manoeuvres are always cheaper the further away you get from a body, so the best way you can probably do this is to kick your apoapsis out somewhere beyond Eeloo, then flip it over. The 170 degree inclination, is brutal, and will cost upwards of 6k delta-v in itself, if performed at Kerbin\u0027s orbit. If you can get your solar AP in alignment so that you can do the plane change out there, that\u0027s again your cheapest option. It\u0027ll take years of time in-game though, and I\u0027m not sure you\u0027ll get there before the deadline is up.\n\nFrankly, my advice would be cancel the contract. They\u0027ll take back the money they paid you up-front, and you make take a small hit in reputation, but unless you\u0027re in a high difficulty mode, that\u0027s all that\u0027ll happen.\n\nAlso, with every satellite contract, just *ignore* the numbers for longitudes and arguments - just look in the map view and match it visually. There\u0027s nothing in the game that lets you put those numbers in, so they\u0027re massive red herrings ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Inclination is relevant, since it has a big impact on the delta-v requirements; the nearer zero it is, the easier a job you\u0027re going to have.

The deadline is well over 14 years - you can easily max the tech tree in just a weeks of in-game time and the travel time shouldn\u0027t be more than 2 years. The target orbit is also very eccentric, so you can send your probe to target Ap, reverse the orbit and from there it\u0027s just a few m/s of deltaV to complete the contract.\n\nGood luck! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:18:59Z","Content":"The real problem is that you can only have a limited number of contracts open.
