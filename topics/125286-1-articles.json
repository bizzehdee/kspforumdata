However, I\u0027ve gotten a little ways into a new 1.0.5 career (just unlocked the first science facility upgrade, am snarfing down science from Mun/Minmus), and I find that in practice it\u0027s not as big a deal as I thought it would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is that there are a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E of World First achievements. Basically, there\u0027s one for just about nearly every new thing you can do as your capabilities progress in a career. And the achievements are not some special missions to \u0022shoot for\u0022, but rather they\u0027re the things I would be doing naturally anyway in the course of a career. For example, one of them is \u0022fly by the Mun\u0022. Well, that\u0027s not something for me to \u0022shoot for\u0022, it\u0027s something I would be doing anyway. The only difference is that I get cash for it when it happens. And if I skip it, for example if I decide to focus on Minmus instead, then there\u0027s a different set of rewards waiting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it boils down to is that you don\u0027t need to worry about it. Just do your career and go where you want to go, and trust that the game will reward you for your ambition whenever you push the envelope. And if you\u0027re more of a self-directed player who prefers to just go out and explore new places as you see fit rather than following contracts, then the admin facility has a new strategy available in 1.0.5 that will reward you for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this new dynamic. It makes the game less grindy and gives me more freedom to play my career the way I want to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEven before the milestone revamp in 1.0.5, KSP has always thrown huge amounts of cash at you during the first couple missions.

I seem to recall that the first hurdle \u0022grind\u0022 that I had to get past, pre-1.0.5, was the first upgrade to VAB and science facility. The initial financial \u0022surge\u0022 at the start of a new career would suffice for a launchpad and mission control upgrade, maybe tracking station too, but then I would have to spam a bunch of grindy contracts to scrape together the cash to upgrade the VAB and R\u0026amp;D. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in 1.0.5, however, it seems a lot smoother. I\u0027ve upgraded to level 1 of basically every building except the three I never ever use (admin, SPH, runway), and I\u0027ve done only a small handful of contracts. Most of what I have done is just the usual do-new-thing-to-get-new-science-opportunity stuff, like getting to Kerbin orbit, landing on the Mun, etc. Gotta say I\u0027m really loving the rebalancing so far. Career just got a lot more fun and less grindy.
