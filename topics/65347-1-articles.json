If part of the ship breaks off, you can unbolt the other half to balance it for flight reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd from a realism standpoint, if kerbals can repair parts, they can probably unbolt/unweld them. (I\u0027m imagining a kerbal has to be next to the part, and you click on it to bring up a dialogue box that asks you are you sure you want to do this?, after which the part falls off, or explodes, or whatever) Also, the devs don\u0027t want to add a delta-V calculator (I know about kerbal engineer) for the reason that it removes from the experience of just playing the game to get a feel for it. I understand that, but I think this would be a nice complement to that choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T05:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnbolt?
