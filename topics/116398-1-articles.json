First of all, there is no point in space from which light has not reached us, because while it\u0027s true that some parts of the universe are more than 14bly away from us, it\u0027s only due to expansion of the universe being faster than light.

But if the stars were uniformly distributed at the same density they are found in Milky Way galaxy, it wouldn\u0027t have made a difference. There would be enough stars in our immediate neighborhood, to close to us for red shift to make an impact, to make the entire sky glow as a star\u0027s surface.\n\nI\u0027m glad the video did not bring up another common misconception that interstellar dust is the cause of it. While it\u0027s true that we\u0027d see a lot more light if there was no dust, if universe was, indeed, filled with stars uniformly, the interstelar dust would heat up due to starlight to the point where it itself glows same as the stars around it.
