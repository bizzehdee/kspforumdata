A single extra pilot does not make a backup team, you need a scientist and engineer as well.

When either one of them get back from a success, I picture them strutting by the \u0027other team\u0027 in the break room with a large grin and taunting each other amicably, and the \u0027losers\u0027 have to buy the snacks or drinks that day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never seem to give it importance after filling out the second team - any further teams just get filled with whatever the rescue contracts or roster offer.

So here goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would define equality as not letting a person\u0027s gender, orientation, colour, religious beliefs etc. affect the respect they\u0027re\u00A0given, the dignity they\u0027re afforded or the opportunities made available to them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t necessarily mean treating everybody exactly the same. To use a slightly contrived example, if I\u0027m advertising a job and one of the absolute \u0027can\u0027t-do-the-job-without-this\u0027 requirements is that the successful candidate must be able to benchpress 300lbs, then that\u0027s probably going to rule out most women from applying for the job - certainly more women than men.\u00A0What equality\u00A0means in this context\u00A0does mean is that if I do get a female interviewee (or a candidate identifying in any other way for that matter) that \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E benchpress those 300lbs, then the fact that she\u0027s also female is irrelevant. Likewise,\u00A0equality is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E adding a bogus \u0027must be able to benchpress 300lb\u0027 requirement to my job advert, purely to discourage women from applying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use a different example, if I feel that somebody is being an idiot, then I\u0027m not \u003Cem\u003Eobliged\u003C/em\u003E to give them any respect - but whether they\u0027re a male idiot or a female idiot shouldn\u0027t affect\u00A0how little respect I give them. Likewise, I shouldn\u0027t be giving the female idiot any more respect \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E because she\u0027s female.

As I see it, there all sorts of ways\u00A0in which people are not treated with equality according to that definition. There are the overt \u0027isms\u0027 - racism, sexism\u00A0\u00A0and the like. Then there are the, much more insidious, social narratives. Those are a real problem - \u00A0you can be the most genuinely equal-opportunities employer ever but\u00A0if the prevailing social narrative is that \u0022girls don\u0027t do those jobs\u0022 then you\u0027re probably\u00A0not going to see a whole of lot of women replying to your job advert. Even worse, it simply may not occur to women that applying for those jobs is even an \u003Cem\u003Eoption\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s a real thing by the way - go look up the \u0022Draw a Scientist\u0022 test if you want an example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings us back to this thread and back to my earlier point. KSP matters when it comes to equality because to some extent\u00A0KSP \u003Cem\u003Ewill \u003C/em\u003Ebe shaping that social narrative. KSP is also all about science, technology,\u00A0engineering and maths (STEM), which are all fields where women tend to be poorly represented. Which, at face value, is strange because there\u0027s no good physical or mental reason why that should be the case. Doing maths doesn\u0027t require a mathematician to benchpress 300lb. Therefore the reasons for that poor representation are largely due to social narrative. Therefore shaping the narrative around STEM is especially important. Therefore KSP is more important to that\u00A0than you\u0027d perhaps give it credit for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd actually, to be fair, KSP isn\u2019t all bad at equality. It does have male and female astronauts, it does pay tribute to notable real-life female astronauts. But most of the females are faceless white suits and the tribute names are buried in amongst a heap of procedurally generated ones. The \u003Cem\u003Enotable\u003C/em\u003E characters - the orange suits, the guys in the strategy building, Gene, Wernher - are, apart from Val, all male. At which point, Val does start to\u00A0look just a little bit like the token female.
