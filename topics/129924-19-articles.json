Frankly i\u0027d like just something simple that emulates the real solar system with a few cool changes. So here\u0027s my proposal for GP2, GP3 and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas Planet 2 (Saulper (saw this name on another post and thought it was good)): Orbits at roughly twice the distance of Jool (~120 billion m.) with no orbital eccentricity. Would be as defined by Nova and look like in the wiki. Would also have three main sets of rings (With lots of little one in between), as compared to Saturn\u0027s two and have 6 moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoons: From innermost to outermost\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaphne: Like Nova proposed, but with a small spelling change and orbiting inside the gap between the outer two main rings. Extremely difficult to reach due to the orbital dance you would have to do to reach it and avoid the rings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo: Like Nova Proposed, but it now orbis just below a wispy outer ring fed by Eeloo\u0027s geysers \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotatus: Like Nova proposed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFonso: Like Nova Proposed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAeon: Minuscule (11 km.) fun retrograde orbiting asteroid that is otherwise not very special besides being a god of Eternity in Kerb Mythology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKalbur: Mimas equivalent. dark gray medium sized moon that is just large enough to be spherical, with classic single huge impact crater\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJapetus: Equivalent to Iapetus, slight eccentricity to the ecliptic, also a reference to a great book. Known for it\u0027s large inclined mountain range that encircles the Ike sized body. A tiny captured asteroid named Clarke goes around Japetus along the same plane as the mountains in a tight orbit, some scientists think the mountains keep it stable. Some Kerbals psychics have also claimed to have visions of a multi-km. high monolith on Japetus\u0027s surface, but they have been dismissed as crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas Planet 3 (Varune(named inspired by Varuna, Hindu God of the Celestial Ocean)): Dark teal blue gas planet roughly 2000 km. in radius. Orbits at roughly twice the distance of Saulpur (~250 billion m.) Known for its brilliant shiny ring arcs that orbit at various heights, great dark spot in the northern hemisphere and it\u0027s network of four moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoons from innermost to outermost:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarbos: Bumpy coal black moon that orbits in a tight circular orbit around, only about 100 km. above the highest ring arc. Slightly smaller than Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERhodes: Tan sandstone colored moon with a rotational direction almost perpendicular to its orbital direction. Small and irregular. but it\u0027s fast rotational speed would still make for crazy landings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThans: A small lumpy collection of partially fused asteroids that create a quilted looking moon made of various metals and stones a little smaller than Bop (65 km.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECelia: Triton equivalent, and only a bit smaller than Duna it\u0027s the only circular moon in the system. Orbits in a huge elliptical retrograde orbit compared to the other moons. Known for its slightly dark purple hue and thin dark highly inclined (about 55 degrees above the ecliptic) ring system that starts just above the wispy atmosphere (thinnest in the Kerbol system). Using the tradition of naming outer moons after female Kerbspeare characters caused Celia to be named what it was. Perhaps a tiny globe theater sand castle is on the surface somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKuerbier Belt Object 1a \u0026amp; b (Pluto/Charon Equivalents): An almost perfect binary system of two rocky worlds orbiting Kerbol in a similar resonance to Pluto and Neptune, only with Varune and the Binary Pair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStyx: Larger of the pair of KBO worlds (70 km.). Slightly orange hued world with deep Europa style cracks in the surface. However there are also many large impacts craters suggesting any internal activity has halted long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELethe: Smaller of the two objects by 30 km. Known for several long, flat, east to west, icy, shiny, silver stripes across it\u0027s surface. Other wise a dirty snowball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like my ideas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Halflife\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OgreMagi","CreatedById":103767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T08:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see more planets from science fiction, Larry Niven of the ringworld series, one of my favorite authors, wrote about human expansion into the near by stars in his books of known space and describes several interesting worlds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlateau A planet with earth normal gravity with no moon and a single very high mountain, about the size of new zeland, the rest covered with a very dense atmosphere. the livable areas are on plateaus on the mountain roughly 20,000meters above sea level . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJynx heavy gravity planet, roughly twice the earths gravity, egg shaped with a high rotation rate, the Poles are in vacuum with the equatorial areas venus like with a narrow band that support earth like atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewonderland system, primary world is 60% earth gravity good atmosphere but a lot of asteroids rivaling small moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECanyon, a mars like world that has a deep crater, over 5 Km deep, that holds a near earth like atmosphere, roughly the size of California Baha peninsula \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust to think of a few...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T02:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGas Planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKima\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA dwarf gas planet with a brownish tint, probably in the 1500km radius range.

Deredict is the size of Kerbin, but has higher gravity. It is Tidally Locked to Kima and as you can see, the side facing away from Kima is heavily cratered while the side facing Kima is flat. It would be nice if the craters were made a separate biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I hear a lot of players requesting Vulcanism to make some bodies more dangerous. This is where that would most likely happen. Due to the tidal forces of its parent planet, Deredict would be dangerous to land on. Volcanoes would be more present on the side facing Kima. This makes choosing a landing site difficult. Either difficult slopes and deep craters or risk a volcano blasting your ship to smithereens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, I never did mention that Deredict actually has HIGHER gravity than Kerbin.

It is smaller, and has a thin icy atmosphere that I could liken to Duna\u0027s. (It is also similar in size and gravity to Duna) But more importantly it has an equatorial ocean with large icy poles The area around this ocean is extremely jagged with multiple-kilometer-high cliffs.

Orgin is essentially a combination of the challenge of Eve and the fun of Laythe. Rough approximations of its statistics would be about 1.3G and 1.6Atm, O2 Present. But Orgin has to have some new, unique challenge. I though it might have very deep canyons in the landmasses that players could get stuck in, hindering exploration by ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also trying to think of a legitimate explanation of how Orgin might have oxygen in it\u0027s atmosphere, from a scientific standpoint.

No, with stock parts it\u0027s going to be impossible to land on and return from a body like that. But, if we were to put something in a Retrograde orbit around a gas planet, it is very much reach-able. Nobal is a captured asteroid, perhaps bop/pol like.

Don\u0027t turn Stock into another typical Sci-Fi-Game. Stock needs more varieaty as i said in various threads, but realistic nature still offers thousands of diverse possibilities that aren\u0027t implemented, before there is any need to go unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENO criticism of your ideas, i think it could be a good mod, and also the X-Rings would offer a great view and the sun-planet an awesome challenge but it would definetly push the stock game totally in Sci-Fiction territority and destroying the FEELING I ( and probably others) like particulary about KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As for really far objects, when i\u0027ll make the planet pack i\u0027m planning on implementing a Pluto-Charon object really far out.
