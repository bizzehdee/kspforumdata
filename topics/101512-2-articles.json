Sure, deforestation is big, and it would be good to stop it. But then you get into a heap of economic and political difficulties. Oceanic pollution (like the huge volume of plastic waste floating around the Pacific) also warrants addressing. This is bad, but it is a huge thing to try to repair. Cars use some oil, and they contribute to CO2 pollution, but a bigger problem is the factories and power plants that use coal, and spew more pollution into the air. Of course, many of those have a good deal of wealth and consequently political power, which makes their dismantling difficult, especially in regions where really, it would be difficult to get support for a new, clean power plant. Meanwhile, farms in \u0027\u0027developed\u0027 states often use destructive monoculture and pesticide, which is hardly good for many things down the road (or river, as the case may be). At the same time, people can blame the Chinese, or the Indians, or throw their hands in the air and say its all pointless anyway, and there is nothing we can do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is difficult to rally behind some strategy, as a consequence. You cannot really hit all of these targets (and there are more than have I listed), in any practical way, all at once while making an impact of note. The interconnectedness of some issues are interesting. electric cars sound great, and they really could be if everyone who used a car now switched to one. But if your electric car is powered by a coal power plant, we have a problem. Other efforts at geoengineering may sound promising, and may be promising, but most practical proposals that I have seen do not really demonstrate feasibility of doing it at the required scale, and do not adequately demonstrate that they will not cause other problems; if you give me a pistol, I can cure anybody\u0027s cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn defense of the idea of battling climate change, I think we can well realize that some of the changes that we are forecasting are not that great for humanity. Climate changes all the time, sure. Why can we not take the reins, just because it can run by itself? The problem is the dire forecasts (many of which are justified) which cause huge confusion and convince people that nothing can be done. In a lot of places, that is the case. We probably need to be patient, the changes we are causing are fast, but are not like Venus smashing into the Earth from a retrograde orbit (in two weeks). We need to accept that things are going to happen, and then try to prevent them from getting worse, maybe even make them a bit better.
