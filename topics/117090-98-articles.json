Their solution literally is \u0027just slap a generic heat shield on it\u0027... which to me has never made much sense (it is just extra part count with no function at that point; might as well just add the mass and turn heating off).\n\nIt is precisely that which I\u0027m trying to avoid.

Getting a few things to a good state though, so some areas should start settling down soon\n\nCraft files -- likely not until after 1.1. is release and the mod fully updated; still far too much stuff in flux and changing / not finished / not finalized.  And of course, little/nothing has had balancing done yet, which will be needed before any craft files can be made or released.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, ComatoseJedi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I -think- I\u0027m looking at a bug with the Shuttle\u0027s IVA placement where it places the cockpit in the rear of the cargo bay -again-. While it starts out normally in place, when you start switching views from IVA to the outside and back, it resets the placement. Now, before I go any further with this and fully test this out, I am using the ASET MK3 cockpit in place of the shuttle IVA that comes with the mod. Reason being, I am testing out the Canadarm mod VIA RPM computer screen cameras. The ASET MK3 IVA has large screens to facilitate full use of the camera\u0027s view and only accommodates 6 kerbals. I\u0027m not sure if the number of occupants and/or IVA selection has anything to do with this, but this is what I use when I use so an STS.  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure if this has a lot to do with it, but in my \\*flawed\\* logic, it shouldn\u0027t matter what you put in that slot for the IVA, the model node is there to accept the IVA coding that points it to the interior space designated in the config files.

If you are just patching the main model in the SC-E-IVA to use a different model, you will also need to patch it to update its position.\n\nIn short - the method I used to \u0027fix\u0027 the stock IVA is not very well supported, and is going to require custom hand-work in order to get other IVAs setup for it.  Your assumption is incorrect -- the positions of the parts within the IVA are defined **in the iva config** and -not- in the part config (and it is the positions in the iva config I had to patch).  So, if you put a different IVA in place for the part.cfg, you will -also- need to update the positions of the models (and props) -in- that IVA .cfg file.\n\nGot the modular heat-shield part mostly working yesterday.  At least it functions the same for a given type of shield regardless of the size.  So a \u0027light\u0027 1.25m performs the same as a \u0027light\u0027 10m -- they will experience the same heat load, same external heat, same relative flux input/output, and burn through their ablator at the same (relative) rate (both will run out simultaneously).  \n\nCurrently have defined the following types (each with their own mass, resource amount, and heat-peak curves):\n\n**Light** - intended for LKO (~350km) re-entries.  Not needed for many parts/craft, and mostly only necessary for protecting sensitive bits (science stuff).\n\n**Medium** - intended for Mum/Minmus/Duna return.  Should be capable of direct-to-ground capture when returning from any of those bodies.\n\n**Heavy** - intended for return from further origins, or aerobraking through Jool.  Tested for a 10.75km/s pass through Jool @ 170km periapsis, resulting in capture (highly eliptical) with ~50% ablator remaining, plenty for a second/third less-energetic pass.\n\n**Extra-Heavy** - same heat-load capability as Heavy, but double the amount of ablator; should be used for multiple passes through Jool/Laythe, or when a single heat shield needs to perform both Jool capture and Kerbin return aerobraking passes.\n\nHave not yet tested any of them at Eve, but I would expect the Heavy/Extra-Heavy varieties to be needed. \n\nI lowered the max-part temp on them, and cut the heat-curve down to maintain them at a lower temp.  This results in much more logical setup for the part... where they -will- explode if they run out of ablator.\n\nAlso have them set up in a very easily scalable manner -- simply patch two values in the part config to rescale them all for a different heat load (solar system rescales or stock-heating increase).  Still unsure what scale values would be needed as I don\u0027t use system-rescale mods... but the code-side support is there for it.\n\nDuring all of that investigation (staring at re-entries for the past two days...), I also ran across the reasoning for the pod-integrated heat shields\u0027 odd performance, and have a few ideas on how to clean those up as well (higher area and skin thermal mass than they should have).\n\nStill needs at least a few more days worth of testing and balance; though I\u0027ll consider packing them up tonight and letting some of you guys do that testing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T18:04:16Z","Content":"Cool!!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T18:17:53Z","Content":"Laid-out and unwrapped the H-1 this morning (and AO bake):\n\nEdit: Updated image with first-pass texturing (diff/norm/spec; no noise, and barely any detail work so far)\n\n![kWCBSKE.png](http://i.imgur.com/kWCBSKE.png)\n\nReference for coloring:\n\n![H-1_engine_on_display.JPG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/H-1_engine_on_display.JPG)\n\nWith luck I\u0027ll get it about half-textured today, and get a preliminary export of it tonight with the basic texturing.\n\nEdit:  Probably won\u0027t get too much more done on the texture today, but at least it will have a basic tex for exporting the model / setting it all up in KSP.

This will not really matter for a simple stock\u002BSSTU install (as stock doesn\u0027t have any production chains aside from Ore-\u003EISRU-\u003EStock Fuels), however it will be quite important for interaction with MKS / Life-Support / EPL.  This will also determine what resource-switch options are present for the default setups for the various (not-yet-available) shipping-container styled MFTs (and the lander-core cargo containers).  Yes, the reason they only hold Ore right now is because that is the only stock non-fuel resource.  No other resources = no other resource switch options.\n\nBeen quite awhile since I\u0027ve played around with any of them, but last I did, there was pretty much two very different setups as far as resources were concerned -- the EPL production chain, and the MKS production chain.  Apparently there is now a third option...some warehouse/workshop mod? (OKE or something?.... yah, I\u0027m a bit out of touch with the current state of affairs for much of this stuff)\n\nI\u0027m personally leaning towards the MKS resource chain, as that opens up easy integration with the MKS/OKS habitation and life-support system (at least on a plugin/module basis, even if I may design custom parts for many uses); while still maintaining a working interface with EPL (as MKS changes around the recipes/etc).\n\nI don\u0027t want to turn this into a discussion on which is better/more realistic/easier/harder/whatever -- merely inquiring about preferences?\n\nWhichever direction I take won\u0027t be the end-of the road -- as usual my plugins and parts should be easily patchable/adaptable to whichever system the end-user wants to use (though may require some ***effort*** on their end to accomplish)."}]}
