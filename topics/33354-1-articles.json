I was wondering if I could get some advice on the kind of telescope I should get. What I do know is that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I need the telescope to be able to track different celestial bodies (needed for the photography)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Can adapt an SLR camera to the eye-piece (I believe it\u0027s called a T-Adapter) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. On board computer or the ability to connect to an external computer (PC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. These features come with or can be added to the telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally what I want is something relatively inexpensive and easily upgradeable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if someone could explain T-adapters and T-rings, that would be great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-16T23:25:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2013 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Extemma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T23:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor this sort of thing, definitely look for a reflector (Newtonian).

For a telescope, being inexpensive is somewhat mutualy excluding. But, you don\u0027t need tracking hardware to take pretty pictures of celestial objects. Get yourself a used DSLR and any mounts needed to hook it up, and there\u0027s software to combine pictures. So you can take lots of pictures of your intended target, then combine them to compensate for the exposure time needed. This is surprisingly simple in reality. The software is free or not expensive to get. You can even use photo editing software to do it if you must.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with this, I\u0027d say get yourself a newtonian refletor with an equatorial mount, and get a motorized zoom motor as the first motorization. You can move the telescope by hand to aim at your targets, take series of pictures, and combine them afterwards. Such is the benefit of digital photography today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Latcarf","CreatedById":59786,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T13:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found this site including a series of video explanation/tutorials on telescopes.
