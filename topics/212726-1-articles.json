My PC can just handle it (1070 ti, watercooled I5 and 16 gb ram). with big crafts FPS was lower, but still playable. If my rocked crashed it lagged a lot. But it is playable and just good enough to not ask for a refund.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBugs I had:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-engine snaps weird while assembeling vehicle, sometimes by moving vehicle the engine is 45\u00B0 turned (bit still snapped)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- while pressing launch my computer kept showing tje assemby building from insight.

Reaction wheels are not working as good as in ksp1 (fine with that), but I am a bit impatient.
