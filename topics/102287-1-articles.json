After some Wikipedia learning and, more extensively, Blender/Unity learning, I began building this ISRU. Currently it is useable on Kerbin, Laythe, and Duna. **I am looking for feedback!**\n\n**Concept of Operations**\n\nUsing the Sabatier Process, this ISRU uses electricity and a catalyst to convert CO2 into CH4, which for the purposes of KSP, is Liquid Fuel.\n\n4H2 \u002B CO2 =\u003E CH4 \u002B 2H2O\n\nThe module also offers the capability to convert the H2O back into molecular Hydrogen and Oxygen via electrolysis. For the purposes of KSP, the Oxygen is Oxidizer and the Hydrogen may be re-used in the Sabatier Process. The core part is a 2.5m device (TweakScale compatable) and is internally capable of refilling the 1/4 size 2.5m Rockomax tanks. **You need a fuel pipe going from the ISRU to the tank!**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also a big thanks to RoverDude for the development and maintenance of Regolith and the CommunityResourcePack, without which, this part pack would not be possible.\n\n**Link**\n\n[https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/652/Jasper%20Aerospace%20Technologies](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/652/Jasper%20Aerospace%20Technologies)\n\n**License**\n\nJasper Aerospace Technologies is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T02:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kalloran**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T00:36:21Z","Content":"Looks promising but I\u0027m getting a \n\n\u0022Unauthorized\n\nThe server could not verify that you are authorized to access the URL requested.

We\u0027d love to have your help over there, actually! I\u0027ve got a long list of ISRU reactions to add to KSP-I, but don\u0027t personally have the coding expertise to add them (as it involved modifying the KSP-I .DLL file instead of just configs) and FreeThinker, the other modder/developer who does, seems more interested in crossing other things off his to-do list first...\n\nTake a look at [THIS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159-WIP-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-Extended-0-8-16?p=1790377\u0026viewfull=1#post1790377) list, and maybe it\u0027ll whet your interest a little to help out...\n\nItems 2-8 on that list still haven\u0027t yet been implemented in KSP-Interstellar Extended.
