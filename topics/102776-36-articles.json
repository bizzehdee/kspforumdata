I have been playing New Horizons for a few months and have had a ship glitch out and explode on the launch pad 1 time prior to my most recent session. I was testing a rocket by adding all the mass and some of KWs separators to the top of the rocket and when I initially loaded this at the launch pad I ended up with a scene that has been posted here earlier where the terrain is all giant planes slicing through Kerbin at extreme angles. The rocket was placed high above the launch pad, reloaded to the same location and then fell and exploded. Reverting to launch or going back to the VAB and launching again gave me just the launch pad (I only had the terrain glitch the 1 time) but the rocket would still explode 100% of the time.

I don\u0027t mind difficulty curves, but as a Science Mode player, the experience feels a little discontinuous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not looked at the details, but considering you have Mun, Aptur, and Serran with biomes plus Sonnah without I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s that much of a science shortage. I\u0027m playing with the stock tech tree, 60% science gains, but DMagic Orbital Science parts present. Once I had jets and wheels I did do a bit of science grinding around the KSC and I have needed to choose my tech nodes well, but so far progression was fine, and that\u0027s with being cautious with Kerbals because I\u0027m playing without reverts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus I\u0027d say none of what you list is needed for a Kerballed landing. Provided you have stack and radial decouplers, struts, and ideally decent-sized fuel tanks you should be good to go. Remember the advantage of science mode is no worries about mass or part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you do want more science points then to me the obvious thing is to chuck probes at the other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
