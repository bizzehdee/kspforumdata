I have been playing New Horizons for a few months and have had a ship glitch out and explode on the launch pad 1 time prior to my most recent session. I was testing a rocket by adding all the mass and some of KWs separators to the top of the rocket and when I initially loaded this at the launch pad I ended up with a scene that has been posted here earlier where the terrain is all giant planes slicing through Kerbin at extreme angles. The rocket was placed high above the launch pad, reloaded to the same location and then fell and exploded. Reverting to launch or going back to the VAB and launching again gave me just the launch pad (I only had the terrain glitch the 1 time) but the rocket would still explode 100% of the time. I was just testing dV variances based on weight for different situations and when I removed the test stage I had placed on top of my rocket everything fixed itself.\n\nThe only thing that I can think of is that the bulk of my craft and mass was placed above the root part of my rocket, which is the opposite of how I build my actual ships. The separator was not placed upside-down so the bottom part of the rocket I wanted to keep would be considered the throwaway component, but I was just using it to divide a stage for dV purposes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T12:42:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tynrael**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T12:53:34Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen the same issue occur myself. And I believe it\u0027s the root cause of the explosions on launch some people have suffered - that the rocket gets put in the wrong position vertically on the launchpad.

I was originally blaming an interaction twixt NH and Kerbal Construction Time, but I still (more rarely) have it happen without KCT too. My suspicion comes back to Kopernicus, rather than NH specifically - unless it\u0027s a stock thing - but it\u0027s definitely quite rare and a revert to VAB/SPH usually clears it.\n\nRockets/planes being above/below the pad/runway *is* something I\u0027ve had in stock and it\u0027s darned annoying :/ Oddly, a game restart seems to get rid of the problem when it happens though."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T14:42:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen terrain glitching occur in stock if you fly a ship very far from the Sun then go back to the Space Centre.

Not a single person replied to it, except Nori in a PM saying that he could reproduce it as well. E: Now also reported on the [Kopernicus Github page](https://github.com/BryceSchroeder/Kopernicus/issues/75). Shoulda done that earlier ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\nIt seems only to happen if Kerbin is reparented (it happens in New Horizons and Alternis Kerbol, but not with just Kopernicus or KScale2). If you timewarp enough in the Space Center scene and then launch a vessel without a scene change, your terrain will get totally messed up and it will 9 times out of 10 destroy your vessel (either by putting it underground or way in the air). There might be other ways to make it happen, but that\u0027s the way that KCT exasperates, since you often have to timewarp in the space center scene.\n\nWith KCT, I advise everyone to timewarp only in the tracking station and then switch back to the Space Center to launch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T15:09:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magico13**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:02:13Z","Content":"Useful to know, thanks Magico ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ll put KCT back into my game and have a go with tracking station only for warps.

Very nice, especially with the custom GFX addons. I was hooked when I first saw Sonnah over the horizon from low Kerbin orbit. Also, good call on having Kerbin as a moon - it certainly adds a new layer of challenge and planning to interplanetary trips.\n\nOnly issue I\u0027ve had is that as a Science Mode \u002B CTT player, my career is pretty much stalled in the Sonnah system. I don\u0027t know if this mod is meant to be played in Stock full career, but there don\u0027t seem to be enough available science points around the local bodies to progress to technologies required for manned landings (i.e. 2.5m rocketry, landing legs, crewed landing modules) or to even advance to the intermediate level of science instruments. I might either add some initial science points, or make a MM config for players who can\u0027t or won\u0027t play with contracts, in order to counteract the science-poor early game. I don\u0027t mind difficulty curves, but as a Science Mode player, the experience feels a little discontinuous."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:56:59Z","Content":"I\u0027ve not looked at the details, but considering you have Mun, Aptur, and Serran with biomes plus Sonnah without I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s that much of a science shortage. I\u0027m playing with the stock tech tree, 60% science gains, but DMagic Orbital Science parts present. Once I had jets and wheels I did do a bit of science grinding around the KSC and I have needed to choose my tech nodes well, but so far progression was fine, and that\u0027s with being cautious with Kerbals because I\u0027m playing without reverts.\n\nPlus I\u0027d say none of what you list is needed for a Kerballed landing. Provided you have stack and radial decouplers, struts, and ideally decent-sized fuel tanks you should be good to go. Remember the advantage of science mode is no worries about mass or part count.\n\nBut if you do want more science points then to me the obvious thing is to chuck probes at the other planets."}]}
