(Why they have rockets and haven\u0027t invented the wheel yet is a mystery to me, but that\u0027s a whole different thread.) I\u0027ve made a couple of basic, simple rovers using both the M-1 and whatever they call those little probe wheels. In either case the brakes don\u0027t work! I know how to adjust the torque and all that but can\u0027t get them to work. The landing gears for planes perform great but the rover wheels,,, no, uh uh. Neither the \u0022B\u0022 key or clicking on the parking brake have any affect. Is this a bug? or something I\u0027m doing wrong? No mods, totally vanilla Appreciate any help or suggestions.

Once you right click, then save that .craft or the game save, the wheel in question will forever be broken. The only stock fix after that is to remove the wheel and replace it with a new one.
