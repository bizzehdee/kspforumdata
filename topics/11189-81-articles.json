So did you run the mission specifically to work in harmony with the K-Prize rules? Looks complete for a Utilitarial Commendation plus Advanced Pilot Precision Award, assuming there was no fuel usage from the payload during the lift to orbit, which I was unable to verify, can you confirm that? Your word is good enough, just to be sure I am not assuming anything.\n\nNo fuel was used from the payload, and I actually had 15 tons of extra fuel left in the spaceplane itself (althought I did use some of that when i had to do a go around to land on the runway ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\nIt can haul a 100 ton payload to LKO, using only its own fuel and without detaching anything but the payload.

With lighter payloads, angles up to 45 degrees are possible for rapid ascent.\n\n2) Wait until the jet engines shut off due to lack of air, then start the KR-2L\u002B\n\n3) Complete Orbit\n\n4) Hit action key 0 to extend the solar panels\n\n**Descent:**\n\n1) Transfer all fuel from all tanks to the rocket fuel tanks in front of and behind the cargo bay\n\n2) Equalize the fuel between the two rocket tanks for COG. Then transfer 500 units of fuel and/or oxidizer to the large rocket tank in the front for re-entry. This helps stabilize the craft and prevent spins.\n\n3) Hit action key 8 to disable the majority of the jets (helps lag)\n\n4) Retrograde burn, then face prograde\n\n5) Hit action key 0 to retract the solar panels\n\n6) Re-enter at a 20-35 degree pitch up attitude. While the craft can handle pretty serious re-entries pitch up, having a 0 degree or pitch down attitude may destroy the wings.\n\n**Landing:**\n\n1) Come in low and level with the runway. I do my final approach at around 300 meters altitude when the grass color changes from dark green to light green, near KSC.\n\n2) Maintain approximately 110 m/s speed when landing. A 25-35% throttle will maintain velocity when flying straight and level. The stall speed is roughly 60-80 m/s when empty. DO NOT fall below this speed during landing or you will encounter RUD.\n\n3) Watch the Vertical Speed Indicator indicator closely. Try to keep the sink rate \u003C 5 m/s. \u003E10 m/s may result in RUD when hitting the runway.\n\n4) Once over the runway, gradually pull throttle and flare to land. I typically land at 70-90 m/s.\n\nAs long as you keep the sink rate low, and keep your speed up during landing, it lands very easily. \n\n**Craft Files: (Right click and \u0022Save Link As\u0022)**\n\n[Galaxy VII with Refuel Pod](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/Loth%20-%20Galaxy%20VII%20-%20Refuel.craft)\n\n[Galaxy VII Heavy](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/Loth%20-%20Galaxy%20VII%20Heavy.craft)\n\n![2015-10-24_00017.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00017.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-24_00019.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00019.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-24_00025.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00025.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-24_00026.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00026.jpg)\n\nCargo Weight: ![2015-10-24_00028.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00028.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-24_00033.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00033.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-24_00037.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00037.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-24_00039.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-24_00039.jpg)\n\n![2015-10-25_00005.jpg](http://lothsahn.com:3172/kerbal/KPrize/2015-10-25_00005.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T06:40:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 06:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lothsahn**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kokanee","CreatedById":93886,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T17:30:35Z","Content":"Second entry, the \u0022Twinplex\u0022 sporter SSTO.
