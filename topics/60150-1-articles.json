Like how when we\u0027re young we\u0027re told electrons orbit an atom. The analogy completely breaks down. The two sensor readings on your ship are acceleration and distance, they combine to give you mass. The only use for such a system is identifying an unknown object, be it ship, asteroid, etc. in which case your ship will be crewed. Could make a good plot point in a sci fi, having them all have to stay completely still and silent while they were scanning, kind of like on a submarine (albeit reversed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T17:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand suddenly le wild sci fi movie/game that uses this idea appears.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
