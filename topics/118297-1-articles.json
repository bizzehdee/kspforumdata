This means that the earth is passing through a dust cloud and leads to a lot of dust particles burning up in the atmosphere, meaning lots of shooting stars.\n\nTonight from midnight to 04:00 (GMT\u002B1) will be the peak with up to 70 shooting stars per hour, though you\u0027ll see an increased amount of shooting stars throughout the entire night. Some tips to get the best view:\n\n- try to be somewhere away from light pollution. That basically means away from cities.\n\n- look northward\n\n- get a comfy chair, let your eyes adjust to the darkness and look at the sky for at least 15 minutes\n\nand finally: wish away ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\\*note: neither the universe, the atomizing dust particle nor any other person, entity or event, cosmological or otherwise, can give guarantee of wish fulfillment.

Northeast U.S. Went out at about 1:30AM. No clouds, perfectly clear, comfortable temperature. Saw more meteors in a half hour than I have in all the other events I\u0027ve watched combined. Definitely close to the 100 per hour that was predicted. Saw residual streaks for the first time ever. And... I guess I shouldn\u0027t be surprised, but having seen so few before, I never knew they came in \u0027different colors.\u0027 A purple meteor! Whoa.\n\nAnd one weird thing happened; I can\u0027t be sure of what I was seeing. Best guess is that it was a huge cluster of very small fragments all burning up at one time. It looked like a faint cloud, roughly the size of my fist if I held it away from me at arms length. Same speed as a meteor, and vanishing in under a second.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T07:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T07:34:37Z","Content":"blah, I only caught a couple in one and a half hours staring at the sky.
