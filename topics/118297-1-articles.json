This means that the earth is passing through a dust cloud and leads to a lot of dust particles burning up in the atmosphere, meaning lots of shooting stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight from midnight to 04:00 (GMT\u002B1) will be the peak with up to 70 shooting stars per hour, though you\u0027ll see an increased amount of shooting stars throughout the entire night. Some tips to get the best view:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- try to be somewhere away from light pollution.

Definitely close to the 100 per hour that was predicted. Saw residual streaks for the first time ever. And...
