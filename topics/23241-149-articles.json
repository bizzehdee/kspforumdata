I think it\u0027s the first one I ever DL\u0027d from Spaceport last year when I started playing (last June, I think. Right when v0.20 was released, shortly after what everyone\u0027s calling \u0027The Great Forum Derp\u0027 of April 2013, lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use all the parts, I don\u0027t see how anyone could, there are so many! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But it\u0027s easy enough to delete the folders and/or configs of the parts I don\u0027t want, so no worries. I also have adjusted configs of other parts to suit my play style, for instance, the M27 cockpit: I stretched it lengthwise (the \u0027Y\u0027 axis in the config, I believe) by 1.5x, this makes it look a bit sleeker and less blunt and stubby. Here\u0027s the point, btw, lol: After stretching the part, I got to really looking at it close up, and saw that underneath the \u0027hatch doors\u0027 (which are, unfortunately, completely cosmetic, the EVA point is on the top of the pod for some reason) there are graphics which indicate the presence of a BUILT IN ladder on each side! That would be so cool if they really worked! Of course, I realize that Bac9 never intended for there to actually be a ladder animation there, my understanding is that this wasn\u0027t even possible in Unity when he made the part, to have more than one animation per part I mean. And for the M27, that \u0027animation\u0027 is the cockpit windows lighting up, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my request to Mr. Bac9 would be this: Now that it IS possible to have more than one animation per part, would you consider putting a real built in ladder on the side, where the door is now? And, also, moving the EVA point to one of the doors on the side as well? I know there can still be only one EVA point per part, and that it has to be within one meter of the part\u0027s origin, or CoM, or something like that, but that shouldn\u0027t be a problem for this cockpit, I wouldn\u0027t think. Point is, it wouldn\u0027t matter to me which side it was on, left or right, if I could get the functional ladder built in. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of my favorite B9 parts, that\u0027s all, and I figure it can\u0027t hurt to ask. Oh, while I\u0027m asking, how about making it just a tiny eensy weensy bit more \u0027streamlined\u0027, by leaning the front glass back to maybe a 60 degree angle? From horizontal, I mean. 30 degrees from vertical. Or, heck, you could even lean it FORWARD 30 degrees, and it would still look great, lol. That would make it even more of an \u0027Overview Cockpit\u0027, is how I believe the title reads. Anyway, it would still be mostly upright, but it would just look like it could handle supersonic/hypersonic pressures a bit better during launch or re-entry. And I think it would look a lot cooler than it already looks, lol. IMHO. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Finally, I also think it would be visually pleasing (and look a bit more \u0027realistic\u0027, dimension-wise) if the actual cockpit portion of the part, the greenhouse area and structure behind it such as the \u0027doors\u0027, etc. were just a bit wider, perhaps?
