I have a test install of KSP that I can use for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your mission summaries (these would be both the report after you recover a vessel, and the contract completion report that you access from the toolbar)\u00A0does it show a number in parentheses next to the science total?\u00A0 That would document the effect of your strategy.\u00A0 I ask because it may be that the devs decided to leave actual experiments available as a source of science points if you needed them (this would be from before they made the changes to the mobile lab, mind), though it boggles the mind that they would not have been thinking of these experiments as field work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll look at the cfg files as well when I run the test rig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are couple of other possibilities to consider, as well.\u00A0 How high is your reputation?\u00A0 One important difference between science and rep is that science is a running total that cannot go below zero, whereas reputation asymptotically approaches the endpoints on its -1000 to 1000 scale.\u00A0 If your reputation is sufficiently high, then you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0gain more.\u00A0 (The same is true in the other direction:\u00A0 the general public becomes inured to your indiscriminate and reckless disregard for property and the lives of your Kerbals, and your reputation cannot go below -1000, either.)\u00A0 In other words, the more reputation you have, the harder it is to get even more.\u00A0 I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that the game would take the many disparate sources of science, add them up, and only then convert the total into reputation points, but if it does each conversion individually, you might be gaining thousandths of a point and thus seeing no practical change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means for your strategy is that if you already have a high reputation, converting science points into more rep may just be a way to get rid of excess science points. and nothing else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother alternative is to ask whether you committed 100% to the strategy?\u00A0 You mentioned unlocking the entire tech tree, so I assumed that you also had a level 3 Administration Building, which you need for 100% commitment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll have an answer within twelve hours, I hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 Did it in eight!\u00A0 Anyway, the strategy configuration file is very clear:\u00A0 \u0027field work\u0027 consists of ScienceTransmission, VesselRecovery, and Progression.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EScienceTransmission\u003C/em\u003E is straightforward.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EVesselRecovery\u003C/em\u003E covers, I think, both experiments recovered with the vessel and the vessel itself (for those times that you bring back the first vessel to fly by, orbit, or land on a body).\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EProgression\u003C/em\u003E is the internal name for World\u0027s Firsts rewards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also ran a short career save with the strategy turned up to 100% and with a number of experiments in different situations.\u00A0 The vessel recovery window showed the science\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Evalue\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of each experiment, but the bottom of the window showed zero science\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egain\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The notification window (the one with the green checkmarks for completed contracts and blue globes for World\u0027s Firsts--it\u0027s the first button on the toolbar) showed the correct subtractions of science and additions of reputation as I expected, and my actual science total did not change after the mission.\u00A0 Perhaps that was the problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-02T23:25:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2022 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlchemistZ7","CreatedById":219711,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-13T17:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used the same strategy to increase my reputation. The field work science has definitely yielded rep points for me. Two things to note:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) it seems to take exponentially more rep points to raise actual reputation score the higher you go, similar to xp requirements for leveling up in other games.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Rep yield is rounded down. Say you have the commitment set to 50%. You go do some field science worth 100 science points.
