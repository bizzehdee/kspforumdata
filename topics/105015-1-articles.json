It was \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E low-performance, low-tech SRB. It had terrible stats as it was meant to be the most basic rocket motor. The problem with this is that it will probably only be used once, as the engines in the next tech node would be superior in every to it, kind of like wooden tools in Minecraft. I think this would be a terrible waste, especially with all the effort in creating the part. \u003Cp\u003EI see the FT-5 as an \u0022orbital kick motor\u0022, like the Payload Assist Module, due to its low profile and nozzle size. As such, the stats of the engine should be changed to that of a vacuum solid rocket motor and should be moved to the node the LV-909 is (and the LV-909 to different node). The stats of the RT-5 should be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 2.0t (full), 0.25t (dry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax thrust: 100kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific Impluse: 150s (sea-level) - 300s (vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make it a low-cost alternative to the LV-909.

Even then, it would be \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E more useful than it is currently. I envision players using it as a cheap, compact and simple second stage for small probe missions where the RT-5 would send the probe and a liquid-fueled upper stage to fine tune the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with the RT-5 moved to a higher tech node, what would replace it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 0.625m SRB, of course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reasoning behind this is that it would be and extremely versatile part that would also make sense in the starter tech node.

It would also be easily spammable, allowing players to complete the first few contracts by adding moar boosters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe proposed stats for the 0.625m booster would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.9t (full), 0.1t (dry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax thrust: 75kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific impulse: 150s (sea-level) - 200s (vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be stack and radially attachable.

It was \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E low-performance, low-tech SRB. It had terrible stats as it was meant to be the most basic rocket motor. The problem with this is that it will probably only be used once, as the engines in the next tech node would be superior in every to it, kind of like wooden tools in Minecraft. I think this would be a terrible waste, especially with all the effort in creating the part. \u003Cp\u003EI see the FT-5 as an \u0022orbital kick motor\u0022, like the Payload Assist Module, due to its low profile and nozzle size. As such, the stats of the engine should be changed to that of a vacuum solid rocket motor and should be moved to the node the LV-909 is (and the LV-909 to different node). The stats of the RT-5 should be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 2.0t (full), 0.25t (dry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax thrust: 100kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific Impluse: 150s (sea-level) - 300s (vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make it a low-cost alternative to the LV-909. It would cheaper and more powerful than the LV-909, but the inability to change the throttle and relative inefficiency would make it less attractive in some missions. Even then, it would be \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E more useful than it is currently. I envision players using it as a cheap, compact and simple second stage for small probe missions where the RT-5 would send the probe and a liquid-fueled upper stage to fine tune the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with the RT-5 moved to a higher tech node, what would replace it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 0.625m SRB, of course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reasoning behind this is that it would be and extremely versatile part that would also make sense in the starter tech node. It would have lower performance than the RT-10 due to its size, but unlike the current RT-5, its size would allow it to used later in the game, such as a super-sized Sepratron for huge rockets or as tiny boosters for small rockets. It would also be easily spammable, allowing players to complete the first few contracts by adding moar boosters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe proposed stats for the 0.625m booster would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.9t (full), 0.1t (dry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax thrust: 75kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific impulse: 150s (sea-level) - 180s (vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be stack and radially attachable.
