So tonight I decided to download this free movie through FrostWire called \u0027The Cosmonaut\u0027.

You sure the file extension isn\u0027t .iso or something? If so, it\u0027s a disk image and I doubt any media player will play it straight away. You\u0027d need to burn a file like that to disk, or use a program like MagicISO to make your computer think it\u0027s a disk drive. If it IS a disk image of a DVD, then once MagicISO mounts it, VLC (or Media Player) should be able to play it as if you\u0027re playing a DVD inserted into the fake drive that MagicISO sets up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if it\u0027s just a honking great movie file, then VLC should cope with it as-is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T07:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 07:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M83","CreatedById":68926,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T07:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an .mp4 file, which I learned has some spotty support with Media Player.
