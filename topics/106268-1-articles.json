What we have atm doesn\u0027t seem to work.\n\nI didn\u0027t realise they had changed heat that much before things like batteries started exploding. I\u0027ve got a ship dedicated to moving an asteroid, equipped with miner and refinery, that is stuck at 290 temperature. It doesn\u0027t reduce, even after months at max-speed, even though the ship still has large solar panels that \u0022supposedly\u0022 help to radiate the heat. Seems It\u0027s going to orbit Kerbin at that temperate for the rest of time. They should get some scientists up there to harvest the infinite source of energy. \n\nI\u0027ve constructed new ships with masses of wing-parts that again I\u0027ve read \u0022supposedly\u0022 help act as heat sinks, but they don\u0027t seem to make much of a difference either. Most of my launches now consist of me watching my ship slowly turn a deeper shade of red, from which it will never return. Most of everything stops working. I\u0027ve never even had a chance to switch on this ISRU converter, it\u0027s at 100% overheat long before it gets anywhere near any ore. Lets not even mention the games lack of proper temperature displays. Again, i had to trawl the internet to even learn about the ability to display temp as a colour from the debug menu. Honestly, it feels like they\u0027ve added temperature without bothering to consider how we\u0027re supposed to be aware, or even deal with it. \n\nI was honestly really excited about 1.0, but now I\u0027m like what\u0027s the point? I\u0027ve trawled the internet for hours now, looking for a fix, without success. Am I just being a complete idiot here, is there a solution I\u0027m overlooking??"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T12:02:56Z","Content":"Temperature calculation does not work if your ship is packed.
