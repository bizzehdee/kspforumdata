I\u0027ve got a ship dedicated to moving an asteroid, equipped with miner and refinery, that is stuck at 290 temperature.

Most of my launches now consist of me watching my ship slowly turn a deeper shade of red, from which it will never return. Most of everything stops working. I\u0027ve never even had a chance to switch on this ISRU converter, it\u0027s at 100% overheat long before it gets anywhere near any ore. Lets not even mention the games lack of proper temperature displays. Again, i had to trawl the internet to even learn about the ability to display temp as a colour from the debug menu. Honestly, it feels like they\u0027ve added temperature without bothering to consider how we\u0027re supposed to be aware, or even deal with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was honestly really excited about 1.0, but now I\u0027m like what\u0027s the point? I\u0027ve trawled the internet for hours now, looking for a fix, without success.
