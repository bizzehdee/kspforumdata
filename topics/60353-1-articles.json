But, I haven\u0027t introduced myself so here I am. Basically a casual gamer .. sorta .. as in I don\u0027t take any game too seriously. I have played a ton of them but i just can\u0027t get worked up about a game. Until this one.

I mean I love shootin stuff in planetside 2 (wurd to my outfit Black Widow Company) and I\u0027m not about to quit that game because i really do enjoy the fellowship of the game as much as the combat.
