(i used LV-N, but those dont have enough thrust and rapiers use a lot of Lf/O). Can you give me your ascend profile and some fueldata?\n\nI\u0027m flying with FAR, so there will be some differences if you\u0027re in stock. You can see the profile and fuel remaining in the album above, but in general:\n\n1) Climb to above 10,000m at a sufficiently steep pitch that you remain subsonic until you\u0027re out of the thickest bits of the atmosphere.\n\n2) Level off to about a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch so as to crank up the speed to at least Mach 3 (and preferably 4\u002B) by the time you hit 20,000m.\n\n3) Keep it mostly level as you approach the jet ceiling (between 20 and 30km, depending on ship and piloting) in order to maximise your jet speed.\n\n4) Light the rockets and gently lift the nose as soon as you maximise your jet speed.\n\nIn all of this, keep an eye on temperatures. If you start to cook, climb more steeply. *Kerbal Flight Data* is very useful for this (and for other stuff, too; highly recommended for all spaceplaners).\n\nThe profile will vary a bit based on the design. If you\u0027re well within your temperature limits, a shallower climb is usually worthwhile; if you hit the jet ceiling before you get up to speed, a Silbervogel style \u0022climb and bounce\u0022 ascent (as shown above) can be helpful.\n\nThat trick works better in FAR than stock, though; stock tends to apply excessive deceleration as you lift the nose during the \u0022bounce\u0022. The stock ascent profile is fairly similar to FAR these days, but with a slightly lower jet ceiling and a greatly reduced ability to maintain speed while manoeuvring. Design-wise, FAR allows you to get away with a bit less in the way of engines, but tends to require a bit nore in the way of wings and tailfins.\n\nIf you\u0027re just trying to get a heavy load to LKO, stick to jets and high TWR oxidising rockets (e.g. RAPIERs, or a Turbojet/Skipper combo etc). Nukes are best kept for interplanetary."},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T17:01:29Z","Content":"Every time I haul up cargo I leave left over fuel up at the assembly station or in the cargo.

But the ascent path is not a straight line.\n\nClimb above the thick/hot/draggy lower atmosphere, level off and/or go into a shallow dive while you crank up the speed, then climb. Jet thrust increases with speed (up to a point) but decreases with altitude; you need to balance the two against each other.

Let them sputter out, then do nothing until you reach 50km. Only then power up your rockets. They work at maximum efficiency now.

I\u0027d climb to some 6-8km until their thrust totally dies, then dive at a sharp angle downwards.

That or stash it in the cargo bay of a spaceplane, to be dropped en-route to somewhere else. The only flight cost apart from the payload is the tiny amount of fuel consumed; one FL-T800 for LFO, plus a sniff of LF for the airbreathing portion of the flight.\n\nThe craft file is at [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bki39ohbj7vr40i/Kerbodyne%20Jetlift.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bki39ohbj7vr40i/Kerbodyne%20Jetlift.craft?dl=0)\n\nIt would probably improve the design to ditch the intercooler and put the engines and fins straight onto the LFO tank. It has more than enough LF and intake, engine heating isn\u0027t a problem, and the weight reduction would give a bit more margin in oxidising thrust. At the moment, it has just barely enough O to deorbit after reaching LKO."}]}
