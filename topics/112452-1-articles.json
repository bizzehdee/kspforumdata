You can see the profile and fuel remaining in the album above, but in general:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Climb to above 10,000m at a sufficiently steep pitch that you remain subsonic until you\u0027re out of the thickest bits of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Level off to about a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch so as to crank up the speed to at least Mach 3 (and preferably 4\u002B) by the time you hit 20,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Keep it mostly level as you approach the jet ceiling (between 20 and 30km, depending on ship and piloting) in order to maximise your jet speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Light the rockets and gently lift the nose as soon as you maximise your jet speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all of this, keep an eye on temperatures. If you start to cook, climb more steeply. \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Flight Data\u003C/em\u003E is very useful for this (and for other stuff, too; highly recommended for all spaceplaners).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe profile will vary a bit based on the design. If you\u0027re well within your temperature limits, a shallower climb is usually worthwhile; if you hit the jet ceiling before you get up to speed, a Silbervogel style \u0022climb and bounce\u0022 ascent (as shown above) can be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat trick works better in FAR than stock, though; stock tends to apply excessive deceleration as you lift the nose during the \u0022bounce\u0022. The stock ascent profile is fairly similar to FAR these days, but with a slightly lower jet ceiling and a greatly reduced ability to maintain speed while manoeuvring. Design-wise, FAR allows you to get away with a bit less in the way of engines, but tends to require a bit nore in the way of wings and tailfins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re just trying to get a heavy load to LKO, stick to jets and high TWR oxidising rockets (e.g. RAPIERs, or a Turbojet/Skipper combo etc).
