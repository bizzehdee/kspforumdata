Unfortunately I noticed that the hinges when in place (locked) keep draining the batteries dry. If I disengage the hinges the rover automatically deploys in space. Is there anyway to stop the batteries from draining from the G-00 hinges? Is there any mechanical lock that doesn\u0027t require electrical charge?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-07T08:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure that you actually locked the hinges (enabled the servo lock), and that the lock was actually set?

I understand that perhaps there are some forces pushing the parts away from each other. I tried to reduce the torque percentage and it decreased the overall power consumption, but it\u0027s still there a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-08T14:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223668873\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188038\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567951848\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269609\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022goncaloeaguiar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, goncaloeaguiar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that perhaps there are some forces pushing the parts away from each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, apparently there is. Otherwise the hinges wouldn\u0027t consume power trying to get to their target position.
