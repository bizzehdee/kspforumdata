I had to confirm RT2 still works the way it did when I used it seriously in 23.5. I also typically use the AIES antennas with RT2 and then further hand edit everything so that the antenna selection is diverse and useful.

Our existing dish is 0.625m in diameter and is the biggest size we feel comfortable fitting on our 0.625m frame. That dish will comfortably range out to Duna in all conditions. It\u0027s slightly less powerful than the KR-14 (2.5m diameter) provided with RemoteTech. For BoxSat this will probably be our largest antenna. I am planning on increasing the performance of the tape antennas to be more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said I do want to better understand what gaps people are trying to fill in their antenna line-up so that I can plan ahead for future projects. RemoteTech includes 1.25m, 2.5m and ~3m fixed dish antennas. The stock Communotron 88-88 provides a folding 2.5m dish.

Pull the wrong bit out and everything may detach. Instant Kessler cloud. I\u0027m trying to find a way to neatly incorporate our existing BoxSat modules into a 1.25m frame in order to support large satellites. Keeping the mass reasonably balanced with multiple module bays is difficult.

The basic probe core gets an upgrade in RT2 when you unlock Unmanned Tech. It adds a 3km omni-directional antenna to the probe core.

Yup, there it is in the ModuleSPU code. Six is the hardcoded requirement. Now, if it were changeable, I still probably wouldn\u0027t change it. Six Kerbals in a station is not difficult even with a life support mod. I suppose putting that station in orbit around another planet with a life support mod would be a bit harder but still very doable. However, the difficulty is the point of this game mechanic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou did cause me to think of a radially mounted command station part which I\u0027ve noted down should we ever make some station parts.
