I did think they were entirely too optimistic about how much of the team and project they are salvaging when Private Division took development away from Star Theory and gave it to Intercept. Whether or not it was the right decision at the time, it is guaranteed to be extremely disruptive, and given that they were still looking for graphics and physics engineers well into when game was supposed to be approaching later stages of production on the original schedule... Pragmatic thing would have been for Intercept to treat the game as if in pre-production for the first time.

You can\u0027t just take a bunch of people who are good at making this kind of content and code together into a team and say, \u0022Ok, make a game.\u0022 You need all of the pieces to fit together, and that means team structure. For every 3-5 developers you need a lead or sub-lead. For every 3-5 leads you need a director. And then you need a production team to keep it all on track. If you wanted to add 10 developers to your team and you managed to hire just 20 people to achieve it, you\u0027re being rather efficient. And then all of these people need to be ramped up on tools, best practices, various details of the project... So for the first few months, these new people are mostly just learning what\u0027s there already. And this is assuming they all have some prior experience working with teams, because otherwise, there is no guarantee they\u0027ll be ramping up fast enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we get into costs. The studio is in US, so even with everyone working remotely, Intercept would have to hire people who can legally work in United States. Game development in US is rather competitive. Yeah, you can take a chance on a budding developer who\u0027s making mods, but if you don\u0027t offer them a competitive salary, six months down the line, just as they\u0027re starting to contribute, they\u0027re likely to ditch you for another job. In Bay Area, an entry level games engineer costs company about $100k/year. It\u0027s a bit cheaper in Washington, but still, high 5 digits. More senior individuals cost more, and as we\u0027ve discussed, you\u0027ll need management and production. So very conservatively, the addition of the above 20 people to increase your dev team by 10 developers is costing you something like $2 million per year. And as we\u0027ve discussed, first 6 months are basically ramping up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrivate Division tried to have their cake and eat it. They were unhappy with Star Theory, whether because of scheduling or some other conflict, doesn\u0027t matter. Private Division decided that if they torpedo Star Theory, they can staff Intercept with existing developers, patch some losses, and get everything on track. That very clearly didn\u0027t work. Maybe they lost more core people than they thought they would, or maybe the project outgrew the existing team. I think it was actually both. Regardless, they ended up short, and are now trying to recover. The dilemma for Private and Intercept is whether they pull everyone back, re-scope the game, and start production with a new scope; or they hire and train up new people to meet the scope they inherited from Star Theory. Either way, this results in delays and additional costs. Hiring new people costs a lot more, however, as it increases the burn rate while still having the same delivery date. And looking at current openings for Intercept, it looks like Private Division decided that this would cost too much. So if I was betting, my money would be that they are re-scoping, narrowing down some ambition, while merely restructuring some of the rest to fit the team and the budget they get to work with. And that means they will be making somewhat different game than they were trying to make this spring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if the game doesn\u0027t end up quite as big in some aspects, that might be a good thing. Because the modders will still be around, and so long as Intercept delivers a solid foundation, there will be ways to expand on it. They just have to make sure the core game is worth playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grimmas","CreatedById":207818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-06T12:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo long as it gets released before Star Citizen, I\u0027m fine with this.

So unless Intercept already had a decent amount of API code written, or the individuals were already familiar with using C#/C\u002B\u002B then it\u0027s really not something you couldn\u0027t find somewhere else. Modeling? DX11 changes what texture layers are required, and their individual complexity in some places.

Potentially it might actually cost more to train someone who\u0027s had the bulk of their experience modding KSP1 than just a normal Software Developer straight out of College, due to KSP1 modder hires potentially having to unlearn so much while also dealing with significant gaps in their own understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can think of a few people here, who might be exceptional enough to meet that bar and not require more training (Myself not included in that set, I\u0027d fall flat on my A$$ day 1. The set would include GamesLinx for instance though). But anyone like this probably had already gotten offers and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E had prohibited them from talking, or they already have a job in the field or similar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of exceptionally talented people here in general, but talent in one area rarely translates to very broad areas (Like ya know, building an entire game from the ground up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPs.
