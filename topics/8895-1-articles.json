I don\\\u0027t know anything beyond basic orbital mechanics, But I want to know if you can establish an orbit that goes from LKO or close to it, then goes to the Mun, \u0027Slingshots\u0027 a bit to correct the course to return to LKO and do it all again. In my head I think it could work, but like I said, I don\\\u0027t know enough to try it in a scientific manner. Theoretically, it would be very hard to do but could work. A use for that path would be a space station orbiting the two as a go between from the Mun to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-30T16:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you done orbital rendezvous yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-30T22:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting back is half the fun and more than half the satisfaction IMHO.

If they did say so, ask for their PhD in Physics. To see the fun of trial and error, Youtube has a lot of the best examples. In KSP, failure is an option, a hilarious one at that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I love about KSP is it challenges you to train yourself. Even with the community here sharing what they have learned, you still need to get out and do it yourself. And when you figure that out, and accomplish it, nothing ever beats that feeling. There is barely any other games out there that can offer you that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you were open about using mods, I am going to throw a guess that you used them to get to the Mun.
