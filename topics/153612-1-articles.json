We\u0027re talking about exploration part of the game. And career is meant to have that element. The problem is it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m not talking about going interplanetary the first day of the career mode, because that\u0027s simply impossible. The game should allow for going interplanetary whenever there\u0027s a window for it. The problem is you can easily unlock the whole tech tree way before that happens. And that has a major influence on the exploration part of the game. Since you have all the tech by visiting the Mun and Minmus then there\u0027s no reason to explore, because the only motivation for exploring are science points, thus tech.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would argue that any persistant KSP game is supposed to have exploration at its core - places are there to go to, so you go.

After you\u0027ve been a few places, you realise that no matter how monumental your achievements, you\u0027re performing to an empty theatre.
