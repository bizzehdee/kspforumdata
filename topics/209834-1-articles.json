However, the Kerbal Space Center is confident that their KLS Megarocket will eventually be functional, and they\u0027re looking for commercial solutions to get crew and cargo down to the Munar surface from the Munar Gateway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this project, the powers that be at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E are looking for two things: reusability and flexibility. They want the same autonomous vehicle to be able to deliver crew on one trip and cargo on the next trip, or vice versa. For cargo deliveries, like rovers or surface stations, the vehicle should drop the payload off on the surface of the Mun and return back to a space station; for crew deliveries, the vehicle needs to bring the crew back. You can do drop tanks or refilling, but obviously the lower mass required from Kerbin to the space station, the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShow me what you\u0027ve got!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
