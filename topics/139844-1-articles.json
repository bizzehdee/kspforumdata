Here are some images of what I am talking about. \u00A0Ok this is annoying the image album isn\u0027t updating to what it shows on imgur so you\u0027ll have to view it on imgur to get the images and their titles right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell turns out my procedural fuel tanks were not calculating correctly till I left and came back to the ship. \u00A0So I would get into orbit leave the ship come back and have many many MANY more tons of fuel on board and that was messing things up. \u00A0On the bright side I was able to massively downsize the rocket and still have the performance that I wanted! \u00A0So be it my .625 monoprop tanks which carry 80 monoprop changed to holding 6400 monoprop! \u00A0Which is more than a little odd but dumping the excess mono prop fixed that just fine!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/O2uyM/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T04:32:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by captinjoehenry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixxed the issue.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
