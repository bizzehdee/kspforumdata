Sometimes I\u0027ll google image something like \u0022concept space craft\u0022 to inspire modeling, and often I come across images of stuff that is already in KSP and copied almost exactly down to every contour and color...they don\u0027t even add their own twist to it.....many from mods you might not even realize are replica\u0027s of designs that exist elsewhere. There\u0027s quite a few mods I\u0027ve come across that I thought were original designs, then later find out they were exact replica\u0027s of something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there\u0027s some great mods out there copy or not, and it is fine to be inspired by something and nice to have some pre-existing designs to play with, but I would take a guess that well over 90% of mods, are these copies I speak of. There\u0027s actually very little out there that hasn\u0027t been ported into KSP, and very little that is actually original in any sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I\u0027m getting at, is to remind people to not get caught up in copying stuff into KSP, but rather putting yourself into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etake my trek style nacelle mod for a loose example. simplistic, based on a pre-existing concept, but not an exact copy of anything you\u0027ll see anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img802/180/warp7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imageshack.us/a/img802/180/warp7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-19T15:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2013 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
