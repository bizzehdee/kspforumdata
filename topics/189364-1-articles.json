My tech tree is completely filled so I want to split my science into funds and reputation. I have upgraded the admin building to level 3 and I have 7,780 science points left after completing the tech tree. The first strategy, to convert science to Funds is the \u0022Research Rights sell-out\u0022 and the second is the \u0022Open-source Tech Program\u0022, to convert Science to Reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first question is, I have read here about a bug in the admin building that actually doubles the commitment amount I set (so 50% becomes 100%). Is this bug still active in 1.7.3?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may have another question but let\u0027s start with that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-28T23:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I\u0027m pretty sure that bug is still active. You can try setting the commitment percentage to something above 50% -- if the bug is still there, it should complain that you can\u0027t commit more than 100%, and reject your attempt to activate the strategy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-29T20:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure, B. I tried a 67% commitment of the Open-source Tech Program and it took it just fine, no questions asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then opened my save created before starting any strategies and then tried to do Research Rights Sell-out. That program leads to the next issue I hinted at above. No matter what commitment % I choose for the Research Rights Sell-out program, when I hit \u0022accept\u0022, it takes my Science and changes it into Funds...but this program is never listed under \u0022Active Strategies\u0022 tab?

I did not have a back-up save from before upgrading the Admin Bldg. So, I just split my 2 strategies at 50% / 50% and accepted them.

Any that had Science rewards in them showed them reduced to 0 and the Reputation for each increased. No funding increase was shown on any of the available contracts with science rewards. This leads me to believe that the Research Rights program is not truly active.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-30T08:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could now go and really verify the issue by (saving first, and then) cancelling the reputation strategy.
