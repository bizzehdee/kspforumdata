No experiments as I was at 30 parts with just enough fuel, though my design wasn\u0027t optimized and my ascent was not the best. Bringing experiments might be possible with very careful design and flying. But just orbital EVA spam on the Mun, plus one biome landed, plus crew reports and high space over Kerbin and Mun, netted enough science to fill out the rest of the tier and then some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, this was done with no ground science and no contracts other than world firsts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit, just realized you are playing science mode, so you aren\u0027t limited to 30 parts, but the above mostly still applies. If on hard you\u0027d need one extra experiment to unlock both 5 pt nodes (no WF contract), could conceivably land on then mun without the 909, but you\u0027d either need to land on the engine bell or make landing legs out of struts, as the T30/45 is too tall for the microstruts.... Conceivably you could do it with only the T30 and radial decouplers, I might try that, but I imagine it will end up mad wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T18:40:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Garius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
