Whenever we play the kerbal way, we end up wasting a lot of money incinerating nuclear rockets or smashing 5m \u00A0asparagus boosters into the ground. Yes it may be the safest and most reliable way to go about things due to the simple nature of disposable parts and no pollution (please squad, uranium and reentry do not make rainbows and unicorns).

Yes, I can do a two stage to anywhere, that\u2019s not the hard part. What\u2019s getting difficult is the expense and complexity of designing the a booster that can put a heavy final stage into orbit, and have leftover fuel to deorbit, and have the heat resistance to not burn,\u00A0and have the aerodynamics to not tumble through the atmosphere, and have the glide capability to land it into the 98%\u002B funds recovery area.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve done it.
