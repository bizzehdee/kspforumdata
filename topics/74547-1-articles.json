However, after importing the fbx into unity, the preview window shows something completely different than what is in the Scene. In the scene, it looks as it should (legs retracted and flush with the cylindrical body). but in the preview window, it shows both legs on the same side, and also have some inverted motion for one of the objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue doesnt seem to be only with the mirrored section. It seems that the lower control arm (see the first picture) has its motion reversed as well. When in KSP, the arm swings upward. But, in blender its suppose to swing downward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny clue as to either of these issues? The feet and main leg animations seem to work properly. Just that reverse swing of the lower arm, and the mirrored assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qjDEYj6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qjDEYj6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ss6Q28D.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ss6Q28D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bs7or7g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bs7or7g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T04:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing you may have duplicated then rotated/mirrored legs to create the full set and the rotation attributes are now out of whack for the one\u0027s which aren\u0027t working right in game (i.e. they now have a global transform offsets of 90-0-180 instead of 90-0-0)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T04:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyup, i duplicated and mirrored one side. can resetting the rotation and scaling of the transforms fix this, or is mirroring a bad practice to do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T06:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fine, just use local transforms so that they don\u0027t try and apply their animation against the global transform, which is now in the opposite orientation from them\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
