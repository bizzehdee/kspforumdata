Direction was correct, surprisingly no wobble (though this wobble still remains on other ships; helps to use kill rotation feature of RT2/MJ, but when I go on EVA it starts swaying again), node execution started as planned, after that flight computer closed (specifically, its window shrunk to the size of close button) and it continued burn even after node delta-v was already reached. Only thing that stopped burn was clicking green computer icon again and clicking any button there. Seems like I\u0027m forgetting that feature till better times and use MJ instead =(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Tried both with enabled and disabled signal delay - no difference.

Also, I wasn\u0027t able to queue any actions for after the node was finished (though that might be my fault since I\u0027m not quite sure I understand how to queue stuff yet). And once the burn started, I was unable to access the command queue at all - clicking the button to make it show up just caused the Flight Computer window to disappear; after it was done, the Flight Computer window stopped showing up at all. Still haven\u0027t gotten control back, since I need to wait for Mission Control to come over the horizon and I can\u0027t timewarp since the ship\u0027s still throttled up. It seems like Flight Computer just didn\u0027t turn the throttle off after it was done carrying out the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T02:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBroken compatibility is the risk we all take with all mods and even stock save games.
