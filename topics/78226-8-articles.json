There\u0027s a bug with powered recovery and scenes other than the flight scene that makes it so SR can\u0027t look at the engines and get their thrusts/ISP/etc and as a result causing a crash. I can get around the game crash, but it results in the loss of the craft. The stage must not have had enough parachutes to drop to a 100% recovery rate, so it tried to use engines, causing the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo solutions: make sure to watch controlled stages from the map mode and not the tracking station, or turn powered recovery off. I should make that fail more gracefully in the future. I just wish I could actually get access to the values I need outside of the flight scene :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe recovery window resets every time you leave the flight scene, so in this case it wouldn\u0027t have showed up unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way DREC and this work together is \u003Cem\u003Eweird\u003C/em\u003E to say the least. There\u0027s a 1% chance of a stage burning up for every 10m/s it\u0027s going faster than 2000m/s (2400m/s is therefore a 40% chance, 3000m/s is 100% chance). If you have a heatshield, the total chance gets reduced by the ratio of the remaining shielding to the total shielding (a new shield provides a -100% to the chance of burning). A full heatshield will protect you up to 3000m/s. After that there\u0027s a chance again (3500m/s: 150% chance normally, 50% with full shield, 100% with a half used shield). It isn\u0027t scientific or precise at all, but it prevents you from smashing things into the atmosphere at 5km/s and expecting them to survive, and it does pose a slight threat to stages dropped at near orbital velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supraluminal","CreatedById":1472,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T04:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick note to say I\u0027ve also been having a lot of trouble with inaccurate distances for recovered stages.

So I think it\u0027s a Stock bug with determining the location of an unloaded craft, but it apparently only sometimes happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been considering tying into the Trajectories API since I don\u0027t really like taking code from other places, but that would require Trajectories be installed as well for that enhanced functionality. Since the Trajectories license is MIT, I may borrow that implementation from them so as to not require a dependency for what should be considered normal functioning. However, since SR doesn\u0027t \u0022kick in\u0022 until vessel destruction, the trajectory would have to be computed when decoupling or first unloading rather than at destruction (since that won\u0027t happen until below 22km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I\u0027ve been considering doing is something a la TTNeverUnload and have the option for stages that would be recovered automatically (or ones you manually flag to remain loaded) continue having physics applied. That way they can actually land, and if you\u0027re like me and use kOS you can have your craft land automatically back at KSC. Also, then the percentages will be accurate and only parts which have actually been destroyed won\u0027t be counted (and deadly reentry will work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would likely be disabled by default (lots of people probably don\u0027t want to have a bunch of parts loaded at once). The only problem I\u0027m having is determining when parts are dropped. I\u0027ve found functions for determining when things get decoupled, but not how to access those \u0022new\u0022 vessels. Either that or I need to wait until they unload, then manually load them again and flag them to not unload again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yaivenov","CreatedById":81754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T03:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to be having some trouble with the mod.

The usual case that would cause that issue is a vessel being destroyed while not in the flight scene and not having a Vt value less than the low cutoff velocity. What happens is that SR says \u0022Hey, that\u0027s not going slow enough, let\u0027s try to land it with it\u0027s engines!\u0022 and starts looping through the parts to look for engines and some sort of command (aka a probe or kerballed command pod).

As you can see, that tank\u0027s empty cost is well over 4000 funds despite costing about 6500 funds full. That\u0027s because rocket fuel is actually ridiculously cheap in comparison to parts (1468.8 funds for 1440 LF \u002B 1760 Ox).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, your assumption that most of the funds for a fuel tank go toward the fuel is actually wrong, which is surprising to me as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find that your returns are higher than what you\u0027re comfortable with you have a few options. If you\u0027re playing with the Variable Rate (aka, the default mode) then you can lower either the low cutoff or the high cutoff (or both) to make the same terminal velocities pay out less. Or, by switching to the Flat Rate mode you can adjust the return percentage directly (but then recovery is all or nothing based on the singular cutoff speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set some personal rules. I personally don\u0027t try to recover things that are going to be dropped when near orbital velocity, since they\u0027d probably be very damaged or destroyed on reentry. I typically only recover things that I drop while still in the atmosphere (boosters rather than anything on the main stack).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-19T18:57:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2014 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T17:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there magico, me again buging you on yet another one of your mods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying yesterday something happened which I didn\u0027t know was possible: Stage burned in atmosphere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/ouou0jvcl/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s26.postimg.org/ouou0jvcl/screenshot17.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot17.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this normal or is because I have \u0027deadly reentry\u0027 enabled?

It will only happen if Deadly Reentry is installed and the vessel is going fast enough. Fast enough means greater than 2000 m/s (but is configurable in the settings, and I THINK setting it to 0 will disable it. I wrote that a while ago and don\u0027t remember off the top of my head.) Importantly, it\u0027s not a strict cut off of 2km/s. That\u0027s just when there starts to be a chance of the vessel burning up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a semi-quick overview of how DR support works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove the DR cutoff velocity there starts to be a chance of the stage burning up. For the default settings this is 1% per 10 m/s above 2000 m/s. When you hit 3km/s there is a 100% chance of burning up. If you have heat shields it subtracts a percentage equal to 100 * (current_shielding / max_shielding), aka 100% with full shields, which will totally negate any chance of burning up until 3km/s. After 3km/s, even with heat shields there\u0027s a chance of burning up (for instance, at 3500 m/s there is a 50% chance with full heat shields (150% - 100%). With half used shields it\u0027s back to 100%! (150% - 50%)). After 4km/s no amount of heat shields will protect your stage from destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest way to avoid this is to not drop stages at near orbital velocity (especially without heat shields). Do notice that I made no mention of the actual shielding amounts, only the ratio remaining. This can be exploited to use tiny heat shields on big stages to land successfully, but I hope that most people would feel bad about downright cheating \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E This mechanic is mostly in place to prevent people from throwing things at the atmosphere at 5km/s with Deadly Reentry installed and still have them survive, but it also makes it so you have to consider whether dropping things into the atmosphere (especially uncontrolled) with orbital speeds is a good idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ches","CreatedById":129655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T00:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey thank you for clarifying my concern about the large amount of cash from spent fuel tanks.
