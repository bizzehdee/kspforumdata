So try not to laugh at me too hard when answering this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am having a problem returning from the Mun once I make a landing. I am currently using the liquid fuel engine that has 200 thrust output and using the long, skinny fuel cans for the source. My problem is that I burn up too much fuel trying to decelerate to the surface and have none left to get back. My question is twofold. First of all, is there a landing trajectory that will decrease my speed without using as much thrust? Second, would a nuclear powered engine be a more efficient choice and still get the job done (make orbital maneuvers and decelerate enough to land safely. Also I would appreciate any plans for decelerating to the Mun (altitude-speed indicators).

I use the Poodle for my big landers with size 2 fuel tanks; for size 1 tanks I use either a pair of the white radial engines (for the heavier loads) or either a pair or a quad of the orange radial engines (for the light stuff). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t worked out how to land on the heavier worlds with atmospheres; right now I\u0027m experimenting with a big lander can with a descent stage of 4 radially-mounted aerospikes (heavy, but nice I(sp) throughout the profile) and an ascent stage of a Poodle. If I\u0027ve got it right, I can use the descent stage\u0027s remaining fuel to help boost the ascent stage through the lower atmosphere (taking advantage of the aerospikes\u0027 efficiency in atmosphere) and into the thin air where the Poodle excels; but it\u0027s only tested on Kerbin, and it can\u0027t quite make it back to orbit there with enough fuel to rendezvous with my space station at 150km.
