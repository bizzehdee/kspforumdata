Add that this result in lower trust now not just more fuel use.\n\nThink the 909 was 89 or something, vacuum ISP is probably not very affected. \n\nI guess solid fuel first stages will be common."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T11:23:09Z","Content":"at least the jet and turbojetengines weren\u0027t nerfed at all (from what I got from several preview-videos). and rockets behave quite like with NEAR/FAR, so they shouldn\u0027t be heavily altered.\n\ncan anyone confirm, that the engines now have a constant fuel consumption like real engines?
