The problem that i am experiencing now is that my engines stop functioning midburn - and by that i mean all engines, both 2nd and 3rd stage, and they wont start up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome background, i took 2 tourist missions that are exactly the same - orbit Kerbin, orbit Mun and orbit Minmus -, reason is, i had missions to fly by, orbit and collect data from both Mun and Minmus and told myself that i could take the tourists along and make more money out of the trip. So, i made improvements on a craft that previously used to orbit the Moon. First stage had 4 Skippers, 2nd stage with 3 Reliants and the 3rd stage with 1 Reliant - combined Dv is around 5k (which is actually more than enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here is where it gets weird (for me anyway), i completed the first tourist mission using the craft that i designed \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout\u003C/strong\u003E any issues, all stages worked fine and was able to land safely on Kerbin again. Saved the game and proceeded to run the second tourist mission. Everything starts as per normal, i proceeded with my usual ascent profile (which i have to improve), completed an orbit around Kerbin and created a maneuver node for a Mun transfer. As i am burning my node for the Mun transfer (40 seconds\u002B), midway my engines would stop working. It can\u0027t be a fuel issue because everything says i have fuel, i am puzzled, thinking that it might be some glitch or the game might be acting up i exited to my desktop and restarted the game. But lo and behold, same thing happens on my second and third retry. As checked what went wrong i noticed that all Electric Charges on all engines are \u003Cstrong\u003EZERO\u003C/strong\u003E, that goes for 3 Reliants on my second stage and 1 Reliant on the first stage. I tried ditching the second stage thinking it would solve it but no, same, engines wont start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs i try my fourth run on the mission, i noticed that my Electric Charge gets sapped slowly when my engines are \u003Cstrong\u003EIDLE\u003C/strong\u003E, which i find weird because the only part on the ship that requires electricity is the Communotron16 and i haven\u0027t even activated that yet. Turning OFF/ON SAS and RCS doesnt help either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure, it has never happened before and dont know why its happening now, all along i thought Reliants didn\u0027t use Electric Charge. I haven\u0027t tried again after the 4th run, maybe i should rebuild the ship? Remove the Communotron16?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas? Advise?

I can see it go down from 41... 40... 39... 38... all the way to zero. And of course, i have to power them down when i create nodes and or drift/warp along my orbit. Do take note that i am basing all of these in Kerbin time and not real world time, because in KSP warping seems to make getting from point A to point B faster but essentially the same amount of time has passed, only faster - with this in mind you spend more Kerbin time idle than burning, which, as i stated before - my EC drains when engines are idle.
