The plasma thruster enumerates all power sources that are attached to the ship and calculates its thrust such that it uses most of the power available from onboard generators, so having two plasma thrusters doesn\u0027t have any benefit over simply having one.

I wasn\u0027t able to easily reproduce the negative efficiency thing. The primary vehicle I have been making with this mod looks and functions best with three distinct engines. I ended up making 2 versions: a plasma powered and a thermal powered version when I wasn\u0027t happy with the plasma limitations. I had to compromise on the plasma version a little. I was able to have 3 functioning engines in the configuration I wanted but was unable to add the high power 135 GW \u0022warp core\u0022 without bugs. It seems to me that the \u0022imbalance\u0022 caused by adding the fourth reactor/generator combo screwed things up. The other 3 engines assemblies are identical with antimatter \u0026gt; reactor \u0026gt; generator \u0026gt; engine. This engine setup looks to be very efficient and has enough to charge the warp drive units in an ok amount of time with moderate acceleration. The thermal version weighs twice as much but it has a much more guaranteed performance with the downside of possibly falling apart from all the weight. It will be interesting to compare the two versions. They have yet to be tested in space, but I have sent off a warp probe already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found out that the warp drive\u0027s energy requirements vary with the vessel\u0027s mass and that to increase speed you add more warp drive units.

The only way to do that is to put a whole lot of satellites in Low Kerbol Orbit and power up the warp drive with a microwave transmitter. There is just no way you could power the warp drive with solar power. If you consider the slow rate that the warp drive charges at, even with the largest (un-upgraded) nuclear reactor (1.5GW) and assume an Earth like solar insolation of ~2KW/m^2 in orbit of Kerbin then you\u0027re going to need 750,000sq m of solar panels to charge at the same rate (or a solar array almost 1kmx1km) and that\u0027s assuming the solar array is 100% efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips with the microwave transmitter aboard have their solar energy curve updated from the stock values, which means *vastly* more power in Low Kerbol orbit. It\u0027s very possible to make the solar panels generate 100x their normal Kerbin output. A few of those would make charging the warp drive possible but transmission losses mean it\u0027s probably only viable out to somewhere in the region of Moho\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T00:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdated mod documentation, hopefully this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceK531","CreatedById":62535,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T05:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found this article while browsing today:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/green-energy/4243793\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/green-energy/4243793\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s basically solar technology that uses the difference between hot and cold to generate electricity at a large efficiency.

I was just thinking of working on something similar. A number of years ago I was working on a thermal rocket for orbiter space simulator but there were too many limitations in that sim engine so the best I could do was approximate the values of thermal engines using some custom models and configs and there was no mechanism by which I could actually simulate atmospheric skimming in any realistic sense, though I did skim venus, mars and jupiter a few times and \u0027pretend\u0027 lol. When I got kerbal space program getting some parts like these working was the first thing that came to mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to point out something about your propellant based thermal engines that I think could really improve this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my research I discovered that thermal engines can harness any propellant but each propellant has a different thrust and specific impulse. So you are overlooking some vast resources... On kerbin for example you have ~ 78% nitrogen, this can be used as a propellant in a thermal engine. On duna you have ~ 95% carbon dioxide, this can be used as well, eve\u0027s atmosphere is 98% carbon dioxide, and so on. Liquid hydrogen is actually one of the worst propellants to use in terms of thrust, but has the highest specific impulse. In my models I was using plain h2o which has excellent thrust and relatively high specific impulse, at least when compared with traditional chemical rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that you should include more of these resources and alter the function to support their use. So for example you can power a thermal engine using electricity \u002B h2, co2, h2o, N, o2, etc - no nuclear heat is necessary assuming you have enough power to drive the internal microwave magnetrons which act as the heating element in the supercritical compression (heating) chamber of the engine. The more energy available, the more DV you can get out of a given amount of propellant, up to the design limitations of the compression chamber of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric scoop could only be used to collect liquid fuel for standard engines from jool or other hydrogen rich atmospheres, and oxidizer from kerbin and other oxygen rich atmospheres, etc, but literally any other propellant could be collected and used in a microwave thermal engine. Ice mining or collecting liquid water from kerbin (and whatever the liquid in the oceans of eve can be assumed to be) could be an additional source of propellant in its raw form or could be further refined via electrolysis for standard rocket fuel as you have already apparently added support for in your latest mod revision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS Great work so far, I created my account on here just to say thank you and post these suggestions, this is exactly the sort of mod I have been waiting for, or at least it is headed in the right direction \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T16:51:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Conti\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceK531","CreatedById":62535,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euh oh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have competition\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T09:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd i must say zzz is winning.
