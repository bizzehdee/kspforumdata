You quickly get into diminishing returns past local TWR of around 2. And engines are heavy, so you actually start getting worse in payload fraction for higher TWR as more of your craft mass is engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gravity losses in the video are basically negligible. If your velocity vector is perpendicular to gravity (moving horizontally), gravity losses are zero. The losses in the constant-altitude landing method are in the form of steering losses, since you have to thrust higher than retrograde to maintain altitude. Still, for the same initial TWR, it is more efficient than performing a retrograde suicide burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-13T07:27:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2013 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T07:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elow-periapsis-above-landing-site method \u003Cstrong\u003E\u002B\u003C/strong\u003E the new Mun \u003Cstrong\u003E=\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022%5Bimg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/czIvV5H.png\u0022]This\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T09:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skiingrules88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skiingrules88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think the landing in that video is very efficient at all.
