Also SQUAD doesn\u0027t need to add rocket engines/variants that already exist only add brand new types of engine for example no more reliant and swivel scenarios. the reliant engine or swivel, one of the two wouldn\u0027t even need to exist if this had been implemented from the begining. Practically everything in Making History we could create on our own. Vostok could be made out of a Stayputnik probe and then ever dated to support crew We could build our own LEMs Our own Soyuz Craft the N1 Apollo Hyperaccurate Gemini External Fuel tanks etc with this, all squad would need to put about as much effort as they did 1.2 or maby Making History to implement this. If we had gotten this instead of making history Then almost all mods involving\u00A0parts would be useless. We could design what ever space stations we wanted, and we don\u0027t need to hear can you add so and so part, James Webb, Hubble, and more could all be designed. I only use fuel tanks and engines as a example because they would be the easiest. You merge a bunch of existing parts into one big part wothnits own values, the player adjust the dimensions and stats and the texture if they so choose. I would even propose that SQUAD at parts for visual appeal only like portholes and such, This would transform Kerbal space program into the traditional game we all love but also a physics and space program simulator even more so. If engines can be scaled up and down and adjusted with cooling pipes to as such improve efficiency and such sure it\u0027s complicated and I would expect it to be dumbed down like build rockets in KSP currently is. Even if we got parts for increased efficiency like cooling pipes a nuclear engines wouldn\u0027t overheat that quickly which would increase Maneuver node effectiveness which would increase Delta-V, The Player community is restricted by platform and mods (involving parts) as much as they are now. Eventually most KSP Players would use the \u0022Research Lab\u0022 st one point or another, and e fact that when making a new part in the Lab it doesn\u0027t interfere with parts in game I could have A Normal and Scaled up RS-25 Engine on the same Rocket. This Improvement would allow squad to focus on improving Physics, Asteroid Belts, meteor showers and more in LATER Updates instead of always needing to add a new stock part or improve a so called bad texture, which only half of the community will like. If a centeral\u00A0Server similarly to Simple Planes was created to share parts the people who enjoy this type of creativity could upload a part for others to download then highly \u00A0sophisticated parts would be created and people who enjoy texturing would work on it too, this could a version of multiplayer not in game but in design of the game. The players would OWN Kerbin Infrastructure. I\u0027m not suggesting multiplayer or anything that wasn\u0027t mentioned in the original post but they are POSSIBILITES/REWARDS Of a \u0022Research Lab\u0022 Although the part about all parts being editable and creative new parts which goes for telescopes and new crew modules is a EXAMPLE of what could be done. Even a way to create new parts with no template just draw and image and fill (although they will be ugly) using a form of symmetry and drawing tools maby it could be a paid DLC (only the research lab part of The Infrastructre Suggestion) and if SQUAD Wants to keep developing new parts for the game after it isn\u0027t a problem. My point is instead of us begging squad for new parts let\u0027s just make them ourselfs IN GAME with no mods...

Extra Launchpads are more for appearances but \u00A0can be used for doing a few launches in a row and being able to get a decent \u00A0Rendezvous. Runways could refuel your craft if you leave them parked for 2 real minutes. That way you can transport let\u0027s say cars and such\u00A0across Kerbin without having to build a Giant plane or one that has half of it as a ore refinery. As someone suggested investing in Seaports and Railways could reduce science and credits\u00A0needed too spend on parts and research, Repairing Baikonuber Cosomdrome (BCD) Could allow for a new space program on the same save (so you could make a craft Their and then transfer it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and vise verse so your craft logs are not overflowed as much. If you chose this your craft logs would be better organized.\u00A0Factories could also reduce cost and many give you a free part once every 15 times it\u0027s used. (So if I use 15 Thrusters I get 1 free)\u00A0Relay Stations \u003Cem\u003Econnected\u003C/em\u003E to a launch facility (excluding tracking center) could launch two\u00A0rockets at the same time and keep them in perfect sync by keep them at their designated distance until the \u0022craft lock\u0022 launch is deactivated. The second craft would be A.I. But experience your every pogo problem and Air Resistance problem, it would effectivly be a \u0022shadow craft\u0022 when it comes to control.\u00A0This way docking and \u00A0Rendezvous could be a bit better BUT no more that two craft this way the game doesn\u0027t go completely crazy and also for multi part space stations they still need to do a Rendezvous this would only make it better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-11T02:05:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2017 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cheif Operations Director\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-11T01:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223240923\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512954978\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166502\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spricigo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n34 minutes ago, Spricigo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes lots of \u0022possibilities\u0022.
