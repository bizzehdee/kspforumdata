How about some new technologies to (somewhat) solve both these problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Provide a turbocompressor bypass to your \u0022main\u0022 ram air intake, take off in \u0022turbojet\u0022 mode, and switch to \u0022ramjet\u0022 mode in-flight. The bypass will be less able to handle high airflow rates, but should still be able to go supersonic (since true turbojets can make Mach 4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Provide a variable geometry combustion chamber, so when the combustion flow goes transonic, you can switch from \u0022ramjet\u0022 mode to \u0022scramjet\u0022 mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Since we\u0027re using something similar to a valve system to switch from \u0022turbojet\u0022 to \u0022ramjet\u0022, why not close both valves and supply your own oxidizer?

Also, you can\u0027t put turbine blades in such an exhaust stream (they\u0027d melt), so you\u0027ll have to bleed off fuel and air to run a built-in generator (to run the turbocompressor for the air and the turbopumps for the fuel and oxidizer). Finally the variable geometry will interfere with the regenerative cooling system used to keep high-performance engines intact, so perhaps a combination of new materials (carbon nanotube - tungsten composite?) and a \u0022shield\u0022 of unreacted air between the exhaust gasses and the chamber walls would do.

Also, as mentioned you need to get to mach 5 just to run the scramjet. With conventional jets this means your vehicle needs to have 4 engine systems: a scramjet, a ramjet to get the vehicle up to mach 5 so the scramjet can work, a turbojet to get the vehicle up to mach 2-3 so the ramjet can work, and a rocket to get from the scramjet\u0027s top speed to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving four separate propulsion systems on an SSTO is ludicrously impractical. This is why most of the design proposals out there use some sort of advanced engine that can operate in at least two of the speed regimes. For example, Skylon\u0027s SABRE engines are supposed to combine a rocket engine with a pre-cooled turbojet (mach 0-5) and they don\u0027t bother with a scramjet. Another promising concept is the Pulse Detonation engine. The technology is in its infancy, but they\u0027re supposed to be usable from mach 0 to mach 5 as well. I\u0027m not sure how well precoolers would work with a pulsedet, but it\u0027s possible they could allow even faster atmospheric speeds at the expense of requiring a separate rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T02:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ralathon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ralathon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EToo much weight.
