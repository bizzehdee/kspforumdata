Today, I am officially closing Kerbal Stuff. I\u0027ll explain how it came to this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built Kerbal Stuff after the announcement that KSP mods were to be officially moved to Curse. At the time, and still today, I did not feel that Curse would do right by the kommunity. I stepped up to build an alternative that would be much better than the mess Curse would provide. I built Kerbal Stuff to do right by the kommunity where Squad wouldn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI opened up a beta and got some modders on board, and Kerbal Stuff was very well received. It\u0027s fair to say that Kerbal Stuff decisively won the battle over Curse, providing hosting for nearly \u003Ci\u003Edouble\u003C/i\u003E the number of mods. It boils down to Kerbal Stuff simply being better at it. Kerbal Stuff had no ads for its entire lifetime, emailed users when their mods updated, and cared more about the modders and the players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUndoubtedly Kerbal Stuff has had a direct impact on Squad\u0027s revenue - how many players must have hopped back into Kerbal Space Program after getting an email about their favorite mod receiving an update? In the past month, despite frequent downtime and slow page loads, Kerbal Stuff has served 1.2 million page views over 279 thousand sessions for over 84 thousand unique visitors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs thanks, Squad continues to endorse Curse as the official source for KSP mods. They refuse to even mention Kerbal Stuff in public. During the early days, they even tried to have the name changed to omit the word \u0022Kerbal\u0022, citing a trademark that didn\u0027t exist (they later registered the trademark).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven setting Squad aside, running Kerbal Stuff is a largely thankless job. In fact, for the most part, I just hear complaints. Most people don\u0027t actually care about the effort put into it. Whenever I\u0027ve taken the time to add features or make improvements or meet the requests of users, no one has shown any appreciation. I stopped volunteering my time and energy to extend this website, because my efforts were always met with silence or complaints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have expectations of anyone. I don\u0027t expect anyone to gush over how great any new features I implement are. I don\u0027t expect Squad to support Kerbal Stuff as the official source for mods. However, these factors have contributed to the apathy I have for the ongoing maintenance of Kerbal Stuff. I\u0027m not willing to invest more of my time and energy into making Kerbal Stuff faster or more stable. I have been well aware of the slowness and instability, but I simply have no motivation to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to thank those who have been supportive. Thanks to the volunteer admins for helping maintain the site. Thanks as well to the modders who chose to host their mods on Kerbal Stuff, and the users who chose to use it as their source for mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the mods hosted on Kerbal Stuff are available via \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/KerbalStuff.torrent\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis torrent\u003C/a\u003E.
