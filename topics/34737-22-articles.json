Now my OCD is hitting red with the New Rotatron (Ballbearing). I really like how it looks and I was hoping to make it rotate a crane or something. Unfortunately for me it seems to rotate non stop first counterclockwise then clockwise and repeats it continuously. It is possible for me to configure it somehow through the part.cfg to rotate for a couple of degrees only or to stop it\u0027s rotation when I press the buttons? I have already followed the instructions on how to configure the part.cfg to make it work, assigned 7 and 8 for its servo control for it not to conflict and my plugins folder only has infernalrobotics.dll, mechjeb2.dll and multiwheels6.dll. Any ideas, suggestions? I could always have the other components do what I want it for, but OCD is OCD you know?

If you look at the floating part closely you can see the part that rotates is still attached correctly to the arm yet the base for it is the one floating. The other bug is the rover and base modules on kerbin has docking port washers moved up for no apparent reason. Those I think might have something to do with the parts not saving correctly under load but it doesn\u0027t happen every save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, anyone that want\u0027s to preview my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24599-Post-your-Rover-MEGATHREAD?p=576765\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post576765\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emodular rover\u003C/a\u003E can do so with this save. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emods in use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIr of course\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDROMOMAN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eflight engineer redux\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-13T02:31:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2013 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ouch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SixMarbles","CreatedById":78728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T02:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cameroon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cameroon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know Damned Robotics had issues when loading ships\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowdy!

After loading the save state, the joints do not behave as expected. As Cameroon mentioned, there are several duplicate ship parts which are far off-axis yet still attached to the ship. You may need to zoom out in order to notice this. When deflecting joints now, the original direction may have been reversed, and the extraneous parts collide with terrain and objects as they move around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany spanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cameroon","CreatedById":51687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T02:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI haven\u0027t seen the isse.
