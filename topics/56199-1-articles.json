Too much acceleration, as boosters use up their fuel, will place so much stress on decouplers as to twist off from them.

In the pictures it looks like you\u0027re gravity turn is too shallow (only about 80 degrees above horizon). To avoid this destruction try starting a gravity turn at around the 10km mark keeping your heading at about 30-45 degrees above the horizon.
