One, for tonight, I am unwilling to take. I would like to state on record: I dont need a .25 copy to demonstrate proper behavior, as proper behavior can be shown by words in this case. Target any object you have in orbit. Tell MechJeb while on the launch pad awaiting launch, that you wish to go to an orbit that is ABOVE your target. Say your target is 300km circular, Polar. Tell it: 500km, then click, dealers choice: Launch To Rendezvous and engage autopilot, OR Launch into Plane of Target \u0026lt;either are acceptable launch criteria\u0026gt; and watch as the following occur: MechJeb \u0026lt;this is assuming you are say 90 degrees off plane from your target\u0026gt; engages auto-warp, bringing the KSC into a favorable position relative to your targets orbit and position with in that orbit. MechJeb keeps slowing auto warp down as the count draws to t-0. Finally at say t-10 seconds it cuts to 1x normal time scale and the clock runs to 0. MechJeb then \u0026lt;the following assumes: auto-stage has been enabled, launch to say rendezvous for this and your climbing to a 500km POLAR orbit\u0026gt; initiates launch. Reaches your gravity turn assigned altitude. MechJeb triggers your staging at the correct times and now, you are coasting to edge of atmosphere as it has finalized your AP to around 500KM give or take a bit for vehicle oddities during flight. You achieve AP and mechjeb has oriented you into the correct position for circularisation burn.

Target any object you have in orbit. Tell MechJeb while on the launch pad awaiting launch, that you wish to go to an orbit that is ABOVE your target. Say your target is 300km circular, Polar. Tell it: 500km, then click, dealers choice: Launch To Rendezvous and engage autopilot, OR Launch into Plane of Target \u0026lt;either are acceptable launch criteria\u0026gt; and watch as the following occur: MechJeb \u0026lt;this is assuming you are say 90 degrees off plane from your target\u0026gt; engages auto-warp, bringing the KSC into a favorable position relative to your targets orbit and position with in that orbit. MechJeb keeps slowing auto warp down as the count draws to t-0. Finally at say t-10 seconds it cuts to 1x normal time scale and the clock runs to 0. MechJeb then \u0026lt;the following assumes: auto-stage has been enabled, launch to say rendezvous for this and your climbing to a 500km POLAR orbit\u0026gt; initiates launch. Reaches your gravity turn assigned altitude. MechJeb triggers your staging at the correct times and now, you are coasting to edge of atmosphere as it has finalized your AP to around 500KM give or take a bit for vehicle oddities during flight. You achieve AP and mechjeb has oriented you into the correct position for circularisation burn.

This especially \u003Cstrong\u003Ehappens with the S1 SRB\u003C/strong\u003E since that one tends to just ram your ship through the atmosphere. I\u0027m just wondering when this might get fixed.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the latest dev build, B9 Aerospace, NEAR, and the hangar mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid rockets run at full thrust. They don\u0027t have a throttle, though some non-stock ones can have their burn profiles tweaked during assembly. If you put a big honking SRB on your rocket and it\u0027s not heavy enough to keep it from hitting terminal velocity on ascent, there\u0027s nothing you can do about that except add more weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb will throttle back throttleable engines (with stock aero) when SRBs ram into terminal velocity, if you have the TV limit engaged. Overpowering with SRBs is a nice way to save fuel in ascent. I\u0027ve built some rockets with so much SRB power MJ will cut throttle completely from right after liftoff until SRB burnout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Stock Drag Fix (only aero mod I\u0027ve used, it simply removes wet mass from being counted in stock drag calculation) MJ doesn\u0027t throttle back so much, often not at all, yet most of the time a lot less fuel gets used ascending from Kerbin and other places with atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
