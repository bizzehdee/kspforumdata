Before I started sending down habs and such for my base (because I\u0027m not putting that off due to the need for heavy planning. Not at all), I sent down a new rover to scout out the locations. I quickly learned, though, that while the maps are small, the distances are huge. Somehow traveling at ~15m/s makes traveling to a specific spot on the map an ordeal. Here\u0027s my maps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b296/Wraith0/KethanemapMunblownup_zpse6c6c318.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KethanemapMunblownup_zpse6c6c318.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my kethane map, blown up to 2x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b296/Wraith0/MergedMunMaps_zps0914c3a2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MergedMunMaps_zps0914c3a2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my surface map AND kethane map merged into one (again, 2x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe little circle shows roughly where I wanted to put the base. On first glance, it seems like a good spot. Right smack in between 4 large deposits. But when I tried traveling from said spot to one of the deposits, it took forever. So I\u0027m wondering where I should put the base. How close to a deposit is too close? How far is too far? It should be noted that I\u0027ve got mobile miners and refiners waiting in the wings, so I can place the base a little out of the way. But I don\u0027t think I want to spend half an hour tapping W and B over and over, so I don\u0027t want it THAT out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you folks think?
