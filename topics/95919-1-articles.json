A ton of people have used the Mk III parts for space shuttles (and I don\u0027t blame them, space shuttles look awesome), but I haven\u0027t seen many people using them for air-breathing SSTO spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I found out why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new Mk III parts are REALLY heavy when compared to the Mk II parts.

For example a 2x shock cone intake has 8 times the intake air max capacity of a 1x. But on a flight to higher altitude, when the 1x intake is down to .30 air out of .8 (37.5%), the 2x intake is down to 1.38 out of 6.40 (21.6%). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigher and faster (15 km and 351 m/s), the 1x intake is at .10 out of .8 (12.5%), and the 2x intake is at .47 out of 6.40 (7.3%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 26 km, the 1x intake is at .02 out of .8 (2.5%) while the 2x intake is at .10 out of 6.4 (1.56%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for best performance, six or more 1 meter intakes would be better than one 2x scaled up intake that is supposed to have 8x the airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, with part clipping on, the shock cone intake can be stacked onto itself multiple times, to achieve a better looking plane that doesn\u0027t have ridiculous amounts of intakes stuck everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW - BIG planes also tend to need decent landing gear.

Action groups shut down the six 1.25 meter turbojets as the thin air risks flameouts of random engines that could cause it out go out of control. So then it keeps accelerating on the single 2.5m Turbojet.
