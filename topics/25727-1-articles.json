Assuming 16% mass efficiency (13% is a nice safe value too), take off weight is 312,5t (50/0.16). To get required thrust i multiply the mass by TWR and gravity. Lliftoff TWR of around 1,8 is good value and gravity acceleration is 9,81.

Nothing I did could ever make the thing reliable, and different components were failing almost every time. No amount of adding, adjusting, or removing struts (sometimes more struts can make things worse) helped, but just replacing the 10 gray tanks with 5 orange ones worked on the first attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you always put a small gray tank below the orange ones to avoid overheating?

Especially KW Rocketry, which adds 3.75m parts; they\u0027re not more efficient or more powerful than if you\u0027d built a stock asparagus of the same weight, but the much lower part count makes a huge difference in how big you can go.

Yes, an 11% payload fraction isn\u0027t particularly impressive, but my design has two major advantages; first, it\u0027s an SSTO rocket, that can safely de-orbit itself after delivering a payload to LKO (or on a Kerbin escape trajectory, for missions to other planets), and secondly its shape lets me launch awkwardly-shaped payloads without any issues.
