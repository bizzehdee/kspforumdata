Jeb and the crew of \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird 7\u003C/em\u003E, docked to the station at the time, transferred to the Buggy for a ground science excursion and flag-planting mission.

Owing to the presence of Lagercie and Albert (a pair of tourists) aboard Minmusport in need of transport back to Kerbin, Kacella was left on the station with Diissa and Bob (who were running the science lab).

Fortunately, I had that Vulture up to resupply the station; change of mission - the Vulture was sent to re-supply \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird\u003C/em\u003E instead. The resupply went well and \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird\u003C/em\u003E finally made it back to New Horizons, transferred the crew and science to the waiting Raven, and landed successfully back at KSC.
