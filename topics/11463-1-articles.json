My main point of advice is just to make it a teensy bit more realistic. Put some shading in, make it look alive. And unless you have reason, get rid of the thick black outlines, and replace them with slightly darker( or lighter) lines that match the colour. Or, you can rid of the outlines completely. As far as I know, there are few artists/critics on the KSP forums, so I suggest doing some research and asking around in art forums. You have good potential, and with some practice, you can do pretty well. If you have the money, I recommend investing in a drawing tablet. It is much easier to use a tablet than a mouse. If you can\\\u0027t afford it, try drawing on paper, and then tracing over it on the computer. Good luck! :thumbup:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T00:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny thing that.
