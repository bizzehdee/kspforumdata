Now I\\\u0027ll counter them.\n\nThe \\\u0027lizards\\\u0027 as you call them [they are actually alien mammals, they just have green skin and snouts] are taller than Humans are, and Hannah [the Human in the picture] is short for a Human.

My main point of advice is just to make it a teensy bit more realistic. Put some shading in, make it look alive. And unless you have reason, get rid of the thick black outlines, and replace them with slightly darker( or lighter) lines that match the colour. Or, you can rid of the outlines completely. As far as I know, there are few artists/critics on the KSP forums, so I suggest doing some research and asking around in art forums. You have good potential, and with some practice, you can do pretty well. If you have the money, I recommend investing in a drawing tablet. It is much easier to use a tablet than a mouse. If you can\\\u0027t afford it, try drawing on paper, and then tracing over it on the computer. Good luck! :thumbup:"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T00:32:28Z","Content":"Funny thing that. I *do* and always did draw my webcomic sketches on paper before putting them on the computer.

So then I started using the Ink Sketch tool. I thought it was pretty good, because it took my drawing and made it black and white, so I could easily just fill the colours in.

Just noticing what makes one of my digital drawings inadequate helps me get better.\n\nI do hope to one day be able to use antialiased lines, but the closest I can get for now is shrinking the image a little before putting it back to its original size.\n\nAs for a tablet, that may be in the pipeline for some time, but right now a have only a little over \u00C2\u00A310 in my bank account, and that will be disappearing when I buy *Iron Sky* tomorrow.
