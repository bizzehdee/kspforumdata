It was a lucky day, for such an weather was rare on Kerbin these days. All that remained of its vibrant weather patterns were the annual dry and wet seasons, containing half an year of storms vomiting acrid rains from above, half an year of burning drought, and the rest gone to pollution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-to be updated later-\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-06T10:04:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2014 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DJEN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T04:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe sighed.

It was always black, with a mucky consistency that changed somewhat during the year.

Jedediah insisted on it being continued, but the republic officials deemed that it was too resource consuming and risky.

Even though connection was reestablished, the crew did not respond. After running a remote examination on the vessel, it was concluded that the life support had gone haywire after the flare due to the main system malfunctioning via exposure to solar flares. The reason why they couldn\u0027t fix it was debated by many engineers, and a conclusion was drawn by Scott Kerman, who analyzed the ship structure and revealed the problem: the life support was supposed to be fixed at the exterior of the vessel; however, it was a open structure, forbidding access from outside due to the vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The chief architect, Shelton Kerman, apologized to the public and vowed that he would analyze the ship\u0027s blueprints with a computer software to insure the lack of errors from the moment on. The public started being worried about space travel at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The second failed due to software failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The ship was snapped in half due to the extreme tension, damaging the two engines and the landers. Scott Kerman, the mission commander of several missions, used the secondary antennae to communicate with KSC, saying that they will not give up in any condition. They were seen by KSC via the Herbel Telescope using their remaining RCT fuel to push themselves to a towards-Kerbin trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Although they succeeded in doing so, they were found dead by the rescue craft even with the ability to fix life support if needed. Eventually, the software team found a error in the ship\u0027s software that made the ship deny the use of life support if the main power source was destroyed. Also, the structural failure was caused by the software\u0027s inability to apply unexpected data to the ship\u0027s manuveres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And again, the software team apologized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-to be updated someday-\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-08T01:48:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2014 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DJEN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T16:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA very unusual start - interesting to take a look behind the scenes at the other costs of the space program. 10/10 for the title too - extremely evocative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s hoping that \u0027some day\u0027 isn\u0027t too far away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T09:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third and final mission succeeded in its objective of delivering Kerbals onto the surface of Duna, but it failed due to not one, but many unexpected aspects. The First was the planet Duna itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The mission itself went out smoothly, pleasing Jebediah to his edge for he could acquire more funds for the space program. The crew had succeeded in landing the lander, and proceeded to extract core samples for the analysis of potential resources. Since all the other types of scientific activity were already done by the probes, the only thing left was to analyze Duna to evaluate its worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, even though the probes had shown data that indicated of the existence of frozen aquifers, the samples themselves have indicated that there were none. After weeks of research, the crew had discovered a new form of silicate from the core sample that was formed in the low gravity environment of Duna, which had a density similar to aquifers. The find shed light to a ignored theory regarding Duna\u0027s supposed \u0027aquifers\u0027 being mere exotic silicate structures that contained little to no water. The find removed the potential of Duna becoming a prosperous resource hub for further space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second and the least important was the lander. After the crew had finished their work, they proceeded to enter the lander and escape into orbit.
