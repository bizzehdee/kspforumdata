The vast majority of airfoil cross-sections also further complicate matters, as well as the myriads of wing geometries available.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not an aerospace engineer, but my understanding is that none of these explanations are the whole picture, because fluid dynamics is complex, and lift is itself a phenomenon which is intuitively difficult to understand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing I understood, is that airfoils exist not only to generate lift, but to maximize the Lift-to Drag ratio (L/D). Even a brick will generate lift at a high enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the resulting drag penalty makes it all but useless as an airfoil.\u00A0 So you can say that anything can make aerodynamic lift, but airfoils are much more\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eefficient\u003C/em\u003E at doing so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you have to understand that Lift is generated through entirely difficult mechanisms at different flight regimes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) At low-subsonic regimes(=\u0026lt;0.5 Mach), the airplane is moving slowly enough, that simply deflecting the air downwards wouldn\u0027t produce much lift. If you used a flat plate at slow speed flight, you could theoretically generate enough lift to fly, but you\u0027d either need huge wings, or very high angle of attack to generate any appreciable amount. So, while they would generate lift, flat-plates would also generate a lot of drag, which would require a lot of engine to compensate. Thus the \u0027air deflection model\u0027, while being reasonably accurate, isn\u0027t actually a good model while designing an aircraft for these flight regimes. The pressure differential model is much more accurate, and it dictates the airfoil cross-sections of low-speed flight, which are usually thick, strongly curved teardrops or under cambered. Incidentally, these cross-sections are also observed in hydrodynamic wings, as both water and air(at low airspeeds) are incompressible. Thus, it can be said that while a flat-plate does generate lift, it does not have\u00A0 a great L/D, and properly designed airfoils are vastly superior at low airspeeds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)At Tran-sonic regimes(0.5-1 Mach), a flat plate becomes more and more efficient at generating lift, due to the increased airspeed, it need not have a high angle of attack, and so is actually useable at transonic regimes. However, it is still not the absolute best method, as using thinner, flat-bottomed or symmetrical airfoils will still outperform it in terms of L/D. A properly designed airfoil(\u0027supercritical airfoil\u0027) will generate a lot more lift than a flat plate, as it actually keeps the airflow subsonic at these airspeeds. Thus, it can be said, that both \u0027air-deflection\u0027 and \u0027pressure differentials\u0027 contribute to generating lift at these airspeeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) At supersonic regimes, and especially at high-supersonic regimes, a flat plate(with sharp edges) becomes the best at generating lift with the highest L/D. The standard airfoil shape isn\u0027t as efficient, because at these speed, air is no longer incompressible, and is better approximated as a series of tiny balls hitting the wing(Newtonian theory). At these speeds, the air no longer wants to smoothly follow the contours of an airfoil, and it is best to disturb it as little as possible. Thus, the best way of generating lift at supersonic regimes, is in fact by deflecting air down. A pure supersonic airplane design will have very thin wings, and will fly with a slight positive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E for the absolute maximum L/D ratio.\u00A0 Case in point are most jet fighters, and the Concorde. However, in principle, even these aircraft have wing cross-sections that resemble very thin airfoils, because they are not pure supersonic aircraft(at the very least, they have to land and take-off at low subsonic speeds!)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) At very high supersonic and hypersonic regimes(\u0026gt;5 Mach), the effect of compression lift is also present. This basically works by trapping the bow-shock beneath the wing, and using it o compress the air between it and the wing. The high pressure air effectively pushes up on the aircraft, resulting in lift. This method is very efficient at high hypersonic speeds, but to date, very few aircraft have actually utilized it(The only manned one was the the XB-70 Valkyrie, and it didn\u0027t even fly fast enough for the compression lift to actually become the primary cause of total lift.). This method of lift/ flight is also called waveriding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the prime examples of different lift mechanisms at different flight regimes, is the Concorde. It used a delta-wing planform with high sweep, and had very thin wings. At subsonic speeds it L/D ratio was actually less than at Mach 2, because it needed higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E at lower speeds. I should also note, that the airfoil cross-sections are by far the best way of maximizing L/D, generally speaking. The most L/D at supersonic airplane can hope to achieve is less than 20, while a subsonic airplane can easily achieve an L/D ratio of 30 or more(i.e. Gliders, and Sailplanes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this is about complete an understanding of lift as I have, if there\u0027s anything wrong with it, or anything needed to be added, please do so. I\u0027d love to hear any differing opinions as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-04T18:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately it\u0027s about conservation of momentum whilst minimising turbulent flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen an aerofoil has a positive angle of attack, air molecules collisions with the underside are increased (as is pressure), accelerating the flow downwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the upperside the surface falls away from the air molecules, and collisions (and pressure) are reduced.

But very little try to explain why... Why an obstacle on the flow field is capable of deflecting it at subsonic speeds...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Turbulence... airfoils works in turbulent r\u00E9gime Indeed, turbulence is not the same as boundary layer detachment, which is the culprit of lift loss. Turbulence is a flow regime where inertial forces are higher than viscous ones (High Reynolds number) and hence the flow becomes unstable and create a cascade of swirls, big to small, to the smallest at molecular level where energy is dissipated (Kolmogorov scale)... This disordered regime appears almost from the leading edge (front tip) of the airfoils on normal conditions... Only at very low speed the laminar-turbulent transition can be delayed... Or even you can have a full laminar flow regime in very small flying animals or in very viscous media...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The magic is all due to the viscous boundary layer, the fundamental phenomenon ignored by most science educators. If your remove viscosity completely, lift becomes impossible, no shape would be able to create any lift at any subsonic speed... It\u0027s called potential flow, and has exact mathematical solution. When you add a little bit of viscosity, even a very small amount, viscous effets become very important very close to the walls, this viscous effects create \u0022detachments\u0022 of the flow, that means, the flow instead of following the walls of the profile and go around the edges as they would in potential flow, they detach. When the flow is below the airfoil (at the intrados) and tries to go around the trailing edge (rear tip) as it would in potential flow, it detaches, causing a depressions that guides the flow on the upper side of the airfoil to the trailing edge, causing the deflection and hence the lift... No viscosity, no lift... But it can be detrimental too, if the angle of attack is too high, the flow can detach trying to go around the leading edge, creating a big recirculation zone on the upper side (extrados), and causing the upper side of the flow to ignore the curvature of the airfoil and pass straight, destroying the deflection and hence the lift. This can also be observed on laminar regime and is called \u0022laminar recirculation Bubble\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope these explanations helps to clarify some confusions that can arise from the information found on the internet about the origin of lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS.
