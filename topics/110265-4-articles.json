The process was truly extremely difficult with all three of the finalists designing truly awesome aircraft and any one of them could fill the role and exceed their needs. But at the end of the day when the last test flight had landed and all of the pilots and engineers and maintainers sat down and discussed the jets there was one that stood out ever so slightly from the others. What follows is the announcement speech by General Kerman; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Today is a great day for the UKSAF and for the UKS as a whole because today ushers in a new are of stability and security for this great land of ours. This is the first time that we have looked to outside sources to provide us an aircraft and we are beyond pleased with the results. All three of the jets that were tested were pushed to their limits and to their breaking points. They were pushed to and beyond what their designers intended them to be. We had to truly try incredibly hard to rank these three aircraft in order to choose one but I strongly believe that we have made the correct choice. The jet we have chosen is not the cheapest one or the lightest one but it is the most versatile and will end up being the capable and cost effective option in the long run. The plane achieved and exceeded in all of its challengers and air to air simulations was only shot down a total of 2 times in all 15 scenarios that it was put into. This jet has the smallest footprint out of three of them which made it very difficult for out pilots to hit with their main guns and was incredibly fast and maneuverable which allowed it to dodge and break away from incoming missiles. After discussions with the company providing the jet we have settled on a final price of around $54,000 per unit and we plan to order 150 of the jets over the next three years. So without further waiting I would like to bring up one of best pilots, Captain Jebidiah Kerman to announce the winner, Jeb.\u0022 \u0022Thank you General. I flew all three of these planes and this one is truly remarkable. If you would all care to look up you will see the winner fly overhead in a second here.(See images for cockpit view) And the aircraft we have chosen was designed by the engineers at Ninja Aerospace and is named the F10 Lancer! Congratulations to all those that put their time and effort into this aircraft!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to actual human typing here; Seriously a huge thank you to all of you that submitted aircraft designs for this, it would not have been possible without all of you. All of you that were chosen as finalists should be extremely proud of your jest as they really were all very well designed and were very hard to seperate from each other! And an extra huge congratulations to CptNinja for his winning design!
