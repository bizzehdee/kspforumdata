The autopilot will shut off when orbit is achieved. Next, use the transfer tool (in Orbital Operations) and select the Mun. It will shut itself off when your path will intercept the Mun, but you still have to wait until periapsis and do a retro-burn until you have an actual orbit. When the orbit is achieved, use the circularize function. To return, just wait until you are on the opposite side of the Mun from Kerbin and do a pro-grade burn until your apoapsis stretches far enough to put you into a large Kerbin orbit (orange), then fast forward until you\u0027re far enough away from the Mun to avoid being recaptured by it\u0027s gravity. When your new orbit turns blue, do a retro-burn to reduce your periapsis to around 50KM (within the atmosphere) and you can ride it all the way down. I like to set the periapsis to 100KM to orbit Kerbin first, then use the landing autopilot, which has a \u0027select KSC\u0027 button that lets me land right back at the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rocketman97","CreatedById":10650,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T04:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about orbit inclination is there anything i need to do or do i just leave it alone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rocketman97","CreatedById":10650,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T04:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about incliation because i got to the right altitude then i hit circularize and the rocket went out of control\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rocketman97","CreatedById":10650,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T07:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the help you have given me i was able to get three kerbals on the mun. the kerbals in the picture are Thompfred,Neilfurt and Dilbald\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
