This result should be sufficient to provide an incentive for scientists to seek observational evidence for wormholes in the galactic halo region.\n\nand [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491614002395?np=y](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491614002395?np=y) (abstract below)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E An earlier study (Rahaman, et al., 2014 and Kuhfittig, 2014) has demonstrated the possible existence of wormholes in the outer regions of the galactic halo, based on the Navarro\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Frenk\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153White (NFW) density profile. This paper uses the Universal Rotation Curve (URC) dark matter model to obtain analogous results for the central parts of the halo. This result is an important compliment to the earlier result, thereby confirming the possible existence of wormholes in most of the spiral galaxies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T20:18:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pxi**"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:16:30Z","Content":"Interior solutions that are wormhole-like are unstable.

I am a geek, and my biggest hobby is RL astronomy/space/quantum mechanics/everything else regarding the topic, so while I hate looking like a stuck-up know-it-all (I don\u0027t know it all), I know enough about this subject only to be comfortable with looking like that. Anyway, to it then.\n\nThere\u0027s a few things to keep in mind here before we go any further. First and foremost, the concept of \u0022dark matter\u0022 is rather....obscure. As a family friend with a PHD in astrophysics put it, scientists call it \u0022dark matter\u0022 because frankly, they don\u0027t know what the hell it is, or if it even exists. All they know is, there has to be something out there holding everything together, so they call it \u0022dark matter\u0022. It\u0027s as much possible to see right now as it is to DIRECTLY observe a black hole (that\u0027s not possible). Secondly, keep in mind that wormholes are nothing more than theoretical science right now (while many scientists/mathematicians agree the math is solid, it\u0027s still theoretical). I mean, trying to understand how space-time would be falling all over itself is pretty hard to comprehend, even for the greatest scientific minds ever. What we KNOW, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is that, at the center of the Milky Way, there is a supermassive black hole. As far as we know, every galaxy in our universe has one, and millions of smaller ones. \n\nSo the theory that there could be a wormhole in the middle of our galaxy is, to me at least, a bit farfetched. If wormholes do exist, it would only stand to reason they would be unpredictable at least, and dangerous at most. It\u0027s an interesting theory, and I\u0027m willing to work with just about anything, but it\u0027s going to be near impossible to prove."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T05:28:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So the theory that there could be a wormhole in the middle of our galaxy is, to me at least, a bit farfetched.

It\u0027s an interesting theory, and I\u0027m willing to work with just about anything, but it\u0027s going to be near impossible to prove.\n\nRelax. Nobody said it\u0027s a traversable wormhole. And an untraversable one has all of the same properties as a black hole. It has an \u0022interior\u0022 region, where all sorts of crazy stuff can be happening, which is located between two exterior regions, which can be located in different places in the same universe, or different universes. For an untraversable wormhole, the transition from exterior to interior region is guarded off by an event horizon. You can enter interior region from either side, but you can\u0027t exit. You will be stuck in the middle.\n\nThe whole idea of black holes as wormholes comes from the Kerr solution to the Einstein Field Equations. It predicts that spacetime inside a rotating black hole, and any supermassive black hole is a rotating one in practice, has multiple regions, the most \u0022interior\u0022 one stretching out to infinity and working as a whole universe. In effect, it\u0027s not \u0022inside\u0022 the black hole at all, but rather on the other side of a wormhole.\n\nWhat\u0027s even more interesting, if a black hole rotates fast enough, Kerr solution predicts that event horizon vanishes, exposing a naked singularity. That also, as a byproduct, makes a traversable wormhole. Connecting our universe with the one on the other side.\n\nUnfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, Kerr solution is not stable in the interior. It is *a* solution, not *the* solution. Last time I have checked, a stable, ground state solution to the rotating black hole was still not known. Naked singularities are still just a quirk of the theory with no practical consequence, and the only known ways to stabilize a traversable wormhole is to have negative energy densities. Same requirements as a warp drive."},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager275","CreatedById":128829,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:26:14Z","Content":"There is a mathematical object that could be better.

(For a wormhole just traversing space like you\u0027re talking about. If you start talking about ones that traverse time then no energy is not conserved, however this is not a problem as conservation of energy is a result of time symmetry, which a wormhole in time would violate)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T01:12:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCosmology**"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:08:37Z","Content":"Not true at all.
