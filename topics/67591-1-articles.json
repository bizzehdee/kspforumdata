For example, it\u0027s impossible for me to get an encounter with an asteroid because the target retrograde is broken. I burn retrograde to slow down relative to the asteroid. But yet I see the asteroid zip by me and I realize I just set up a direct crash course onto Kerbin. So, is there a way to revert back to 23.0?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s literally impossible to get around this asteroid that i found zipping really close to Kerbin, only 78 km up.
