Been playing KSP since late April, spent most of my time lurking while I got the ropes of the game. On one of my first visits, there was a post for younger players being introduced to the game with kind of a \u0022what to do in KSP\u0022 list. I know that building an orbiter, space station, Mun landing, etc, are what to do, but I prefer to have a tangible list. Can anyone point me in the direction of that post, or something similar? Searches for such an animal have come up fruitless. Thank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreg\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T04:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for a bit of a more structured approach, I\u0027d advise taking a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Campaigns\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECampaigns\u003C/a\u003E segment of the wiki.
