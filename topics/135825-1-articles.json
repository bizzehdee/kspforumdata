Because after 20 ou 30 probes thinks start to get messy and you can\u0027t understand the map. So i wold be nice to have a way to put\u00A0my comsats all in the same group and hide them. If there is no mod that allow me to do that, there is anyone who can help me to build one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T23:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like something like this too but I\u0027ve seen some posts that indicated that the categories are hardcoded and can\u0027t be changed/added to (in a reasonable manner).

With the new comm-sat stuff coming after 1.1, it\u0027ll become quite useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
