It\u0027s like playing a new game, maybe it is, and maybe I need to (re)learn the game.\n\nI try almost every approach to get into orbit, simple rockets, perfect align, all of them tend to turn right. No matter what I do. Even simple parts because of their CoM turns right when are stopped.\n\nSo, what to do? I cant play like this, I am getting desperate, I really like a lot of the many changes the game got over the past year. \n\nIt\u0027s not been fun anymore, I know the trick of 10km 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA dont work, I saw many videos, tried to follow many suggestions here but I cant get it right. I am not a total noob in dealing with aerodynamic games (flight simulator anyone?), but KSP is not real. \n\nWith this in mind, I really prefer to get dumb, and play the 0.90 model of aerodynamics. I just want to get into my career build rockets and planes and fly for fun, building stuff in space, etc.\n\nIs there any way to \u0022dumb down\u0022 the aerodynamic model? I saw many options on the hacking console about the drag, heat, and so on, but those are things I do not understand.\n\nI just really wanted to have 0.90 aero in the game. I never used FAR because of that, maybe I should have, still, its not fun anymore for me, having to struggle everytime I try to lunch a kerbal into orbit.\n\nCan anyone help me?\n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:47:56Z","Content":"yeah, this realism crap is killing all the fun. \n\nI\u0027m starting to regret buying the game, even considering uninstalling.\n\nif I wanted realism, I wouldn\u0027t be playing with little green men in lego-style ships that has every non-explosive part, explode when a feather falls on it.\n\nI liked 0.90 better, when FAR/NEAR were optional mods. now you can\u0027t even opt-out as it\u0027s forced upon you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T15:55:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xyphos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:51:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yeah, this realism crap is killing all the fun. \n\u003E I\u0027m starting to regret buying the game, even considering uninstalling.\n\u003E \n\u003E if I wanted realism, I wouldn\u0027t be playing with little green men in lego-style ships that has every non-explosive part, explode when a feather falls on it.\n\nWhat *would* you be playing?

Flying feels so much smoother than what was possible in the old pudding of an atmosphere previous versions had. It\u0027s challenging for both rockets and planes, yes, and I can\u0027t get many large rockets into orbit anymore, but KSP is about challenge and overcoming these obstacles is where I find all the game\u0027s fun. Thing is, KSP is may not be primarily made to be realistic, but there should maintain high levels of realism in the most critical parts of real rocket flying. Aerodynamics is one of these aspects. However, I do think there should be a mod for the old aerodynamics.\n\nAnyways, I don\u0027t see a very good ending to this thread, seeing how the many of the other \u0022I don\u0027t like 1.x\u0022 threads got locked.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T16:01:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thomas988**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:01:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ve heard that if you change to a spherical drag model and have drag apply as acceleration it\u0027ll feel more like the old placeholder but I haven\u0027t tried because I don\u0027t like playing with placeholder systems.

If you manage to arrive at 40km with 10 degrees above level flight, then you can just rise the apoapsis and get a nice, reliable and fuel-efficient ascent. It\u0027s also important to start the gravity curve very soon. Going 85 degree at 1km and then staying inside prograde is a nice point to start."},{"CreatedByName":"Keras","CreatedById":114511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:18:17Z","Content":"Watch the new career guide from scott manley.
