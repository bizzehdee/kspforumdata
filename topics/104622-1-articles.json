It seems to be unavoidable in these situations, but experimentals is moving along at a very impressive pace, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been making some really cool final additions and tweaks to the game. The focus, at least on my end, has been mostly turned towards improving that sense of completion. It is true we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been exceedingly fortunate this far in that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had very few critical issues, considering the size of the update. That certainly did help in giving us the opportunities to add these small but really-not-so-small details that make a game feel more complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis week, along with various other tweaks and fixes, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been having a look at the Science systems, specifically the purpose of the Lab module, which so far hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been very worthwhile in terms of effort spent vs. the rewards it brings. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve completely rethought how Science Labs work now. Instead of merely boosting the xmit factor of a science experiment for a small amount (something that scientists can do now), and allowing you to restore inoperable experiments (also something scientists can do now), the Lab now works much more like a long-term research facility. Now, when you run experiments, you can transfer data to the lab just as before, but instead of a quick process for a small boost in the xmit factor, the data fed to the lab will generate a steady output of Science for a very long time, ultimately yielding far more science than transmitting or even recovering. This, of course, requires the labs to be manned by scientists, and have a steady supply of electricity. It should greatly increase the benefits of setting up orbiting science stations and surface bases, however, and also give you good reason to visit them every now and then. (The data does decay after a while, and the labs can only hold so much processed data before having to transmit, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect to be able to timewarp your way to infinite science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of work has also gone into revising the stats for every part, and making sure they go in the proper tech nodes, and have the correct costs and stats. One big change among these was that the old Avionics Nose Cone, which was being used in a kind of placeholder-y manner as an atmospheric scanner science device, has now been given a new purpose as a non-autonomous SAS device. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a probe core, but it provides SAS services to non-pilot crews. Should be useful when you really want your scientists to be able to impress their peers with their elite flying skills. As for the atmosphere scanner, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a wholly new part for that job. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of parts now, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had quite a few new ones added this week. Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRoverDude\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and PorkJet have been working like mad, turning out a huge amount of new parts. I hinted last week at two new parts from Bob. Those are Service Bays, available in 1.25m and 2.5m sizes. These hollow cylindrical bays open up letting you mount sensitive equipment that would otherwise tend to explode during reentry (yes) inside a protective compartment, which works very much like fairings do, only these can be closed back up again. Apart from these, we also have new heat shield parts (all sizes), new Mk3 wings, new landing gears, and PJ\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been hard at work overhauling many of the older spaceplane parts, which really needed to catch up, style-wise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve dedicated a couple of days here to implement a feature which I think has been missing for far too long from the game, and I really didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to leave it out of our 1.0 release. More on that one later though\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very happy I got the opportunity to implement it though. I feel it wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have been a proper release without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been following our #KerbalCountdown, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve probably realized that this is our last dev note before the release. Not that this means there won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be dev notes after the release of course, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a good opportunity to give you guys a massive THANK YOU!! To the entire KSP community, who stood by us throughout the four years we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been developing the game, who believed in our crazy notion of a build-a-rocket-and-fly-it game, and who continuously supported us through good and bad times, from the humble beginnings of our weird little project, all the way through today, as we stand on the brink of this huge moment for the game, and to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for myself, what can I say? KSP has been a life-changing project for me\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I honestly can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t imagine what my life would be today without it, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just mind-boggling to look at what next week means for it as my first real game project\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s exhilarating and frightening, stressful, relieving, satisfying and yet filled with anticipation, and so many other things at the same time\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s quite clicked yet for me\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But anyhow, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m really looking forward for what we have coming for this update and beyond. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fun times ahead, that much I can say. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany Cheers to everyone, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eh\u003C/strong\u003Eappy launchings!

We finished the re-entry occlusion system and have been pressing on with fixing things and implementing some last minute items. The atmosphere and thermal balancing continues unabated, trying to strike a good middle ground between the hardcore players and the not-so-hardcore ones is always tough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarco (Samssonart): \u003C/strong\u003EAs many of you know we have a very important date coming next Monday, so instead of boring you people with details of how experimentals are going I want to take this opportunity to thank you, you are a fantastic community, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been quite a ride, but you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always been there for us, giving us amazing feedback, kind words and a couple occasional headaches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy 1.0 and have as much fun playing it as we did developing it, cheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaniel (danRosas): \u003C/strong\u003Eworking full steam ahead! Everything is moving forward. The animation is almost done, still figuring out stuff with our sound designer, with Rogelio and myself. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re missing a couple of shots rendering, that needed some last minute corrections. If everything goes well, they should be done during the night (considering that each frame takes between 10 to 20min to render, yep it takes that long, it could be worse though considering the equipment we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re managing). I can say that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the biggest, longest, and filled with kerbal characters everywhere. Most sequences have been color corrected, lens blured and composited, except from the ones that need rendering of course. There are still some missing VFX here and there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJim (Romfarer): \u003C/strong\u003EThis week i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve mainly been working on the tech-tree icons. It was a bit of a nightmare to update the icons before since they were hardcoded into the prefab every node in the tech tree is generated from. So I replaced the whole icon structure, made the tech tree accept any icon thrown at it and updated the dev tech tree tool. With this change i was able to reassign all icons on the tech tree in less than an hour. It also paid off while making further revisions and creating the demo tech tree. As an added bonus, every modded tech tree can have custom icons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMax (Maxmaps): \u003C/strong\u003ELast notes before 1.0.

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be joining new stores as well. A whole lot more meetings to partake in this week and I probably can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really afford to rest or sleep from here til Monday, but as long as everything works out as planned I simply can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t complain. I love being part of this project and I can only hope you will love 1.0 as much as we loved making it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETed (Ted):\u003C/strong\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all happening in Experimentals.
