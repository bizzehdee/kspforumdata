While retracting the wings might decrease drag coefficient and definitely decreases area, I would seriously doubt if it changed the overall drag coefficient/drag force of the craft that significantly, since most of the drag is experienced by the fuselage, no--wings are designed to be low drag, after all. But this is beside the point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s pretend the entire craft is a wing: a sensor that retracts the wings will essentially be changing the drag force vs. velocity curve. Thus, before it retracts its wing, it has one terminal velocity; after it retracts, it has another. It does not simultaneously have two roots i.e. two terminal velocities. Retracting the wings in this manner is like attaching wings to decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better example is the wings-on-springs, since the deformation would be continuous (i assume by wings-on-springs, you mean the wings deform like a spring proportional to the drag force) and inherent to the system, rather than a sudden change. Even so, I dont think there would be two roots based on the reasoning in this example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider a craft going at terminal velocity, Vt, with drag force = weight i.e. D = W and \u0022wings on springs\u0022 (which sounds awesome by the way). If we try to push the craft negligibly faster, the drag force will increase slightly and the wings will recede slightly. If the wings receding decreases the total drag force to below the terminal velocity drag force i.e. our initial value (which is what is required for their to be two roots), the wings will bounce back to their initial condition/displacement at terminal velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point being, its not possible for the drag to decrease with increasing velocity due to the wrings receding, since if that were to occur, the wings would \u0022un-recede\u0022 since receding only occurs with increasing drag force...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf by wings on springs you just mean some arbitrary controller that recedes the wings at will, then the spacecraft will have two (or more) roots, but the control system will be basically changing the spacecraft. A command pod has two terminal velocities-- one with its parachute stowed and one with it deployed... but that clearly never was the case we were discussing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022numerobis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022numerobis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy the way, given your excitement about very-high-TWR spacecraft, you might be interested in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102768-10-minute-altitude-challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E10-minute challenge\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will check it out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
