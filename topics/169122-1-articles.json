I am using a Mk1 command pod, with an attached Mk1 crew cabin for room for the rescued Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only issue is when I am in range, I will fly the stranded kerbal from their vessel to the rescue vessel. I then switch over to the rescue vessel in the tracking station, and transfer my pilot into the Mk1 crew cabin so there is room for the new Kerbal to enter the vessel. I then switch back to the stranded kerbal and try to board the ship. The only problem is that now my ship appears to be flipping, making it ridiculously difficult to have the kerbal board the vessel. \u00A0The ship was not flipping when I transferred its pilot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I doing something wrong? Is this a bug that occurs? I just unlocked the Mk1-2 command pod. Was gonna try this morning to see if avoiding all the tracking station switches will help me with the rescue missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-01T21:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe this is because that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will not function without a pilot on board early on in the career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IWanttobeEVA","CreatedById":165473,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-01T22:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn early part of the game with only a MkI and a MK1 crew cabin the best way to recuse Kerbals is to get \u0026lt;1000m to the stranded Kerbal. EVA the standard Kerbal and spacewalk over to the rescue craft. Grab onto the Mk1 command pod. You won\u0027t be able to enter because Jeb, or some other pilot, is there, so type \u0027]\u0027 to switch to the rescue craft and let Jeb kick it in the crew cabin. Type \u0027]\u0027 again to switch back to the Kerbal who should still be holding onto the Mk1 Pod and press \u0027B\u0027 to have him board. If he or she isn\u0027t a pilot you need to shuffle them around again. With the Mk1-2 you can avoid all this shuffling around and have room for two rescues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-02T01:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn PC - and I strongly suspect on consoles too - you can hit time warp for a second and kill rotation. It\u0027s a bit cheaty but hey, so is sending your ship into a crazy spin for no reason, so in this case I\u0027d consider it cheating back at the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-02T01:09:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2018 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-02T04:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlol what the 5th horsemen said. \u00A0yse the time warp trick to stop to flipping. \u00A0i find for small things \u00A0like that its not really cheating since it should o ly start to spin if a force acts upon it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow if you have a massive rocket and you use warp to stop your \u00A0spin at a point to save monoprop or because your wheels arent stong enough..thats a bit more cheaty lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso for a bit later in your career, if you are swapping between \u00A0vessels. \u00A0it can sometimes reset the navball marker you have it set on back to stability assist. i find this happens when you return to a ship that was set to hold a marker. \u00A0but if you have only switched away from it,\u00A0it should still be on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
