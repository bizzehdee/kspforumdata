In the most recent disappearance event, I was attempting to fill two \u0027position satellite\u0027 contracts with a single launch, by loading a vehicle with two new probes, and splitting them just before Minmus SOI, with maneuvers for each to get them close to the target orbits. On entering Minmus SOI, the AN/DN markers were in the wrong place (right on the craft in the map view), and the contract target orbits were still there, but no longer had AP/Pe/AN/DN markers. When I went back to the space center, the contracts were gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : I am also interested to know if anyone does these kind of missions, two probes in one vehicle for two separate contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had disappearing contracts problems similar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust guessing, but I think it has something to do with the code that requires a \u0027new\u0027 probe to be constructed for the contract. The vehicle in this case had three probe cores, one for the main guidance and control of the delivery vehicle, and one for each of the probes that were to be deployed (kind of MIRV\u0027d) once in Minmus SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a pretty annoying bug in career mode because your entire space program is kind of structured by the contracts since thats the only way to get money. Having to start all over again with contracts is very frustrating, very much a waste in terms of the career track and getting money for more missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have seen this, please post it here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-01T12:33:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2015 12:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LTrotsky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T12:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to hear that, sounds like a really annoying bug :c If nothing comes up here I\u0027d suggest going over to stock/modded support\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LTrotsky","CreatedById":152994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T12:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually more annoying than the bugged docking ports, since Claw\u0027s workaround worked.

I design functional craft with precise loads which are heavily tested before a real flight. Things still go wrong, but when they do redundancies make recovering from the error a fun challenge. These types of things, however, I can\u0027t fix. But you are right, I really need to save frequently for these types of things. I suspect in this case if I had saved just before the error, it would be repeatable. My lesson from this is something about the new probe requirement makes probe specific orbit contract attempts highly risky if you try a twofer. The code might not recognized the split craft as a \u0027new\u0027 probe, but something about that doesn\u0027t just not get recognized, it wipes the whole slate out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T14:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had this from time to time but not in 1.04, overall I probably earned on it as you keep the up front money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes if you have build a lot of stations and launched on the way to their destination it would not be good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid not know about the MIRV probe problem.
