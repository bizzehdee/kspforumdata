(Except for Jeb, Bill and Bob which are likely hard-coded.) It would be possible to request CM to generate a particular role, and it should be able to randomly find an unused name that assumes the desired role. However, complete customization doesn\u0027t appear possible in 0.90. To wit, I haven\u0027t come up with much of a reasoning for Squad\u0027s decision to implement role assignments this way; except that it does ensure that everyone with a given Kerbal name always has the same role.
