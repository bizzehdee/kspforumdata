It\u0027s common enough to find that your projected peri/apoapsis is fluctuating by a few metres if you hover over it, and that\u0027s simply down to the scales in the game, and what I suspect is the use of single floating point rather than double.

On average, they\u0027ll be found on their assigned side of Kerbin, and that\u0027s good enough to do the job. Also this should requires less delta-v from the deploying vessel since you don\u0027t have to circularise the orbit at high altitude; just boost up the AP and let go at the top, then drop the deployer\u0027s PE into the atmosphere to go home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also remember that decouplers will eject small objects at speed!

Accuracy isn\u0027t very important, and indeed might be counter productive; having each beacon on a slightly different orbital period will avoid resonance.

Most of the time, a connection from any direction will be intercepted by one of the satellites, and relayed to ground.
