Worth checking that you don\u0027t have other unwanted tasks running in the background including updates from windows,steam etc. Close any other game platforms. Epic, Rockstar etc. Check your hard drive/ SSD isn\u0027t too full and no errors using chkdsk command.\u00A0 Run malwarbytes just in case. If all that checks out fine may be worth trying Run sfc/scannow in command prompt as administrator. If that fails use the DISM/Online/Cleanup-Image/RestoreHealth command.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-23T18:56:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2023 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 23\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Madishmike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RickJM694","CreatedById":224444,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-29T03:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ended up doing a full reinstall of windows and that worked.
