Due to the nature of the software I used to make the calculator, including inputs for argument of periapsis and longitude of ascending node was, practically speaking, impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the case of inclined orbits (on either the semi-major, or -minor axis), well, just know you\u2019ll have some buffer. The added complexity in programming Geogebra to be able to handle the rotations (consistently) wasn\u2019t worth the effort, especially with how many weird bugs in the software I encountered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last note: I haven\u2019t added moons yet, but since your spacecraft\u2019s longest transit will be through the planet\u2019s shadow as the moon orbits it, and not the moon\u2019s shadow, you can just input your apoapsis as the altitude of the moon\u2019s orbit around the planet, if that makes sense. If not, I can draw a diagram!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-02T19:54:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2017 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by blorgon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
