I am starting the third chapter. Very good your work and very didactic, I am learning a lot from their concepts of the game, mainly on the construction ds ships. Their designs are economical and efficient, simple and straightforward. I hope to get to the end of it, I can make my designs. In fact, your tutorial has been an incentive to keep playing Kerbal, by giving meaning to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear, I\u0027ve been \u0022walking\u0022 the forum, just a general look, to know its contents ... I also have seen some video on YOUTUBE, I\u0027ll see you recommended. Despite that some videos are difficult to compreeender, I do not speak English, (writing the helpful use, including this text). Still, the images always help to understand something. Therefore prefer the written tutorials as tutorial Pecan.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T16:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Community!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to PM me with any questions.
