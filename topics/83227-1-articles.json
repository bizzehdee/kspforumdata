By default, all control surfaces try to give control input to all axes, which is sort of silly and usually counterproductive. It is a major cause of unwanted roll when pitching, for example. So right-click on each control surface and disable any axes you don\u0027t want it to mess with. I usually make all my control surfaces work only in 1 axis, so have dedicated ailerons, elevators, and rudders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you can do is place your rudders on the wing trailing edges, so they\u0027re in line with the fuselage. If you do the conventional thing and put rudders on tail fins mounted above the fuselage, the force from the rudder is off-center so using the rudder will induce roll, even if the rudder is set to only work in yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
