I flew to, landed on, took off from, and returned from Eve\u0027s oceans, and left behind two full orange tanks worth of fuel in an easily accessible orbit for future missions. HOO-YA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, the extra weight of the 5760 units of fuel and the associated oxidizer were neither planned for, nor required.

I plan on taking a break in KSP until I get the new monster, then going full on in 0.90. I kept the part count reasonable. I tried again and again until I found a semi-decent design for a splash-down lander that didn\u0027t capsize the moment it came to rest. I can\u0027t believe that it took me until 0.25 (and 2000 or 3000 hrs of game play) to embrace the loveliness of the structural fuselage part. I took Laie\u0027s advice and went for a semi-powered landing using just enough \u0027chutes to keep me vertical and slowish. Splashdown was optimal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most fun came when I accidentally decoupled the pontoons before lighting the jets to leave the ocean. What with all of the explosions going on, I was sure I would have to try again, but the pontoons (plus girders) popped back out of the sea just like an inflatable toy held deep underwater in the pool, and they all missed the ship, and the ship DIDN\u0027T sink (completely). Off we went. I sincerely hope that I provided sufficient evidence of the ascent this time. Once I get the new machine, I want to try a less-vegetably designed vehicle... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, sorry that this entry is a bit on the brute force side. But, hey - we took a deep sea sample! We wanted to swim to the shore for a beach sample also, but given that land was completely hidden by the horizon, that plan got ditched promptly. On that note, I should mention that the only time I had to resort to using F9 was, of all things, when I completely MISSED THE OCEAN during my descent - by, like, 100 km. I\u0027ll say it again. MISSED THE OCEAN BY A LOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u0027ll mention ladders. I agonized over the placement of the lander can vs the rest of the vessel. There were ladders pointing up and down from the can hatch, to ensure that Rongan could get back to the hatch. And what happened? The hatch was dead nuts on sea level. He stepped out and swam. That was a LOT of work for nothing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(EDIT: 1: Oops I guess I should say what level I am competing for? I\u0027d say 3. Is there a 3.1?
