My question is what kind of life do you think could live on the planet. It is Earth sized and in the habitable zone. Also I want something unlike Earth life. Any suggestions would be welcome. Also can it be viewed by the wanderer orbiter, or only the explorer lander, or both?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T22:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes..... the planet is inhabited by farts.... they smell... but they live.... intelligent farts.... the happier they are, the more they smell....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey.... its probably never been done before.
