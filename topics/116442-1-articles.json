My question is what kind of life do you think could live on the planet. It is Earth sized and in the habitable zone. Also I want something unlike Earth life. Any suggestions would be welcome. Also can it be viewed by the wanderer orbiter, or only the explorer lander, or both?"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T22:16:58Z","Content":"Yes..... the planet is inhabited by farts.... they smell... but they live.... intelligent farts.... the happier they are, the more they smell....\n\nHey.... its probably never been done before.
