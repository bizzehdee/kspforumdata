A free return trajectory was established, meaning the mission theoretically needed no more propellant to circle the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and return to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. A target of 30-40km was selected for Kerbin periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe journey to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was largely uneventful but some useful data was collected from this hitherto unexplored part of near-Kerbin space.

No insurmountable obstacles to a landing were immediately apparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn to Kerbin was as uneventful as the outward journey, some minor course corrections were made to increase periapsis and therefore reduce atmospheric heating on re-entry. Perhaps as a result, one pass through the atmosphere, plus burning the remaining propellant retrograde at periapsis, was insufficient to avoid exiting the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the second re-entry, the capsule was separated. Immediately afterwards, it became obvious the capsule\u0027s reaction wheels were barely sufficient to overcome atmospheric buffeting and it was difficult to orient the base towards the airflow. As the crew assessed the situation, they eventually realised this problem was exacerbated by the lack of a heatshield, apparently forgotten by the Vulcan 4 design team (they claim to have been under the impression the capsule had integral shielding). In any case, the capsule survived re-entry and was successfully recovered. (A particular landing site was not targeted on this occasion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Z2iUFE.png\u0022 alt=\u00221Z2iUFE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qLfn2y6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qLfn2y6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/duXdJ0T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022duXdJ0T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JeoUNQB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JeoUNQB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T09:16:14Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by S4qFBxkFFg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"borisperrons","CreatedById":76286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T00:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI relly enjoyed reading all of this, nice writing!
