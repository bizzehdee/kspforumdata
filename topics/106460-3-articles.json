The rest might be possible through abusing the resource conversion module. If you were to turn the heat generation back on and set the module to consume and produce some resource at identical rates, it should just chug away producing heat. I\u0027m not sure how it could be regulated through, and you would still have to activate it manually.\n\nThat\u0027s probably as clear as mud and about as helpful, but there you have it. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nEdit: Actually, it seems to work pretty well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T05:16:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 05:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T07:15:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I checked the dev files on my PC and the Kerbalstuff download right after your initial post.

From what I can gather, the only portion of the line that actually \u0022exists\u0022 is the base that is created when you place the part. The rest is just a visual representation of a game mechanic. I can make the base portion soak or dump heat, but it does not carry over to the other end of the fuel line.\n\nI did try to add physics to the end-point of the model, but that was a bust as well. The compound part module is functioning on some spatial relation dynamic that I don\u0027t understand. It might be quaternion, but even aligning all the parts to match locally doesn\u0027t give the desired result. The endpoint connects, but the line and pivot models end up elsewhere.\n\nSo, for the time being at least, I can\u0027t make it work. Maybe somewhere down the road if I can figure out how the model actually works (but it seems there\u0027s a slim chance of that considering I don\u0027t know of any custom fuel-line models out there - I don\u0027t think anyone has figured it out.
