I had a video tutorial I followed slavishly (can\u0027t find it any more to link it, alas). The launch vehicle consisted of a launch stage of 9 liquid-fuel stacks hanging from 3 radially-mounted tricouplers (using SRBs for the radial mounting, since you couldn\u0027t radially mount fuel tanks for some reason - and, of course, you fired those SRBs right through the tricouplers at launch for a bit of extra power, because thrust impingement hadn\u0027t been invented yet), a single multi-tank liquid stack for TMI (point at 90 and burn at mun-rise!), insertion (thank god the master throttle cutoff worked in map view, even if the main throttle controls didn\u0027t), and early braking (deceleration burns at 30km, 8km, and 2km), and a minimal final stage - chute, capsule, decouple, tank, engine - for landing (don\u0027ttipoverdon\u0027ttipoverdon\u0027ttipover) and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... when control fins were introduced; nobody cared about their atmosphereic steering authority - they made the best landing legs \u003Cem\u003Eever!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... my first Saturn V mod.

Maybe it was version 0.19 where ships started wobbling like maniacs and bleeding RCS fuel like crazy.

I\u0027m so happy we\u0027ve come so far with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way SAS modules changed: When RCS was bleeding fuel, I added dozens of OKTO2 probe cores to my Tugs so they could change attitude without needing the RCS on... and then when we finally got proper reaction wheels, I had these leftover weird Tugs in space carrying a mess of probe cores for no reason. And then I started putting the standard SAS unit on things to provide torque (because it was less mass than the ASAS unit)...only to have all my ships suddenly show up in a new version with tiny reaction wheels on them when the Devs decided to make the old SAS part into a TINY part. And the time when all the ASAS units on most of my ships in space became useless...because all the capsules and probe cores suddenly became ASAS devices...but, later, the useless parts got to be useful again when they became reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time the decoupler bug showed up, and suddenly there was no decoupler force IF you had struts connected between the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, OF COURSE, you had struts between the parts...because you needed struts EVERYWHERE. \u0022Space Tape\u0022 had to be applied between all your tank sections and other parts to keep your ship from wiggling apart.

And if you wanted crew in a ship using Hitchhiker modules, you had to spawn crew-carrying rovers to drive them out to the ship (either from the SPH, or \u0027launch\u0027 them earlier and have them drive far enough away from the pad so their rover would not despawn when you placed the next ship on the pad).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-16T10:06:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2015 10:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roderik","CreatedById":85776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T09:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei remember ksp 0.19 and me and my friend playd and we where just ....ing around and i think the mainsail was then still OP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T11:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone remembers the cheaty insta-orbit part from before there were plugins?
