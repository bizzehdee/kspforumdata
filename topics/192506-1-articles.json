Is it normal for it to be like this, and is there a way to minimize or hopefully fix this problem?

I have the impression that when you switch immediately to a high time-warp then the way that the current motion of your ship gets converted to an orbit has at least rounding errors(*) that causes you orbit to change a little bit. And a small change in orbit while escaping Kerbin will translate to a large difference on where you\u0027ll arrive around Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do two thing to minimize this issue: one is to not jump to high time-warp when controlling a ship, i.e. not just click on \u0022jump to next maneuver\u0022 or so, but first go to 50x or so manual time-warp and then hit that button. Or to leave the vessel completely, e.g. by going back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and doing the time-warp there. The other is that whenever I come out of time-warp with an already set maneuver node I check that node by clocking on prograde/retrograde/whatever without actually dragging - and thus changing - the marker. That will apply the maneuver node to my currently actual orbit, and I can adjust it if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*) I think they are not typical rounding errors but probably errors with the getting the time-stamp right for the conversion from one reference frame to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
