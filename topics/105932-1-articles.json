Mind you, I was still low on the tech tree, and had no access to stuff like airbrakes and drogue chutes.\n\nFirst I designed the shuttle itself. The thing I used to have trouble with - making a small vessel that could glide well - turned out to be fantastically easy with the new aeridynamics. Then I designed the booster stages. Getting the balance right has always been a pain, and in fact I think the new aero helps me on this area, since the shuttle wings help keep it stable. Then I had to find out how to reenter without burning up. I got it right on my third try. Here\u0027s how I did it:\n\nFrom LKO (around 80km), I burned retrograde until I got a periapsis of about 50km. I tried to set this periapsis a little west of KSC (near those mountains). Now here\u0027s what I think it\u0027s the important bit: in the highest part of the atmosphere, where it isn\u0027t too thick, you shoul pull your nose up and offer a lot of area to cause drag. I pulled up about 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, and lost most of my orbital velocity between 50km and 30km. If you don\u0027t do that, and you reach an altitude of around 30km with too much velocity, you may burn up."}]}
