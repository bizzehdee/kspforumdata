So if you like the ships you already have, and they can\u0027t carry 11, then do two trips.

In other words, the six Kerbals from the six-Kerbal\u00A0contract don\u0027t have to go on the same ship. \u00A0You can send three on one ship and three on another, or six separate ships with one each, or whatever else. The only thing that matters is that you get each Kerbal into the situation(s) it wants on the contract (e.g. landed at the Mun) eventually. Each Kerbal pays off the listed reward when that Kerbal returns, and\u00A0once the last one returns to Kerbin, the contract completes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I second the recommendation to use whatever tools you already have, and to look for other contracts you can complete along the way. For example, if you have a good three-seat lander (based on Mk2) that needs a pilot, grab one or two easy Mun contracts (e.g., plant a flag, return science from surface), then load up a pilot and two tourists and go. It\u0027s often the case that one or two tourists is enough to pay for the whole mission cost, so any other contracts you complete are then pure profit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Of course, you shouldn\u0027t let any of the above stop you from building a new craft. Trying new things is most of the fun. So if you \u003Ci\u003Ewant\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0to build a six- or ten-Kerbal lander, just to see if you can, go for it!
