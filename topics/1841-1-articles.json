In bigger rocket builds this means the bigger lower stages are putting huge stresses on that engine. An engine shouldn\u0027t be a load bearing part like that, I would think a monocoque or other structure would be a better way to join stages. Does this exist? Like a hollow decoupler that the engine will fit INSIDE, and the decoupler itself bears the load, shared with the skin/fuel tank of the vehicle? (This is really hard to describe in words, lol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, ideally, the above build would be this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eparachute-capsule-decoupler-fuel tank-HOLLOW DECOUPLER-larger fuel tank-larger engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In this example the engine is still attached to the fuel tank, but it\u0027s inside the HOLLOW DECOUPLER and is not attached to anything BENEATH it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help, I hope this was an understandable question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdfox","CreatedById":1818,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-20T23:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot that I know of.

Most of them, they\u0027re so short that they look more like clamps than struts, which is also cool. The result was a stable and solid ship, even with seven M-50s in the first stage running at full throttle.
