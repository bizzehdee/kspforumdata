[Heres the site for anyone interested](http://projectmgame.com/en/) (ignore their most recent video, it was an april fools joke)\n\nIts pretty sweet, just download it onto a SD card, and put that in the Wii. Adds characters, maps, skins, completely changes the game and changes movesets. Its just overall awesome. My friends and I play it at least once a week.\n\nAnywho I main Peach, Mewtwo, Link, and Mario.\n\nNo one can stop me when I play the [Shadow Peach skin](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/219/a/5/project_m_wallpaper___shadow_queen_peach_by_thewolfgalaxy-d7u7bau.png)\n\nEdit: also I am not to shabby with Charzard, Project M makes Squirtle/Ivysaur/Charzard their own independent characters, with their own smashes and new moves.
