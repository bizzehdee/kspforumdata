Again sandbox so they are all grapheme radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivate the receiver and watch the waste heat build. All the radiators are fixed at 1485.1K and whatever power output is calculated at that temperature (huge-\u0026gt;440MW, regular-\u0026gt;110MW, small-\u0026gt;27.6MW). Let the waste heat build up. then, turn off the microwave receiver. The temperature will instantly jump to something else (likely determined by waste heat level). It\u0027s cute, you can blink the temperature-dependent glow on the radiators toggling the microwave receiver!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went to radiator code and saw one interesting thing: radiator temperature is limited by the coldest heat source temperature - 1% (wich is pretty logical. You can\u0027t cool smthng with smthg hotter. Well, actually you can, but you need to provide additional power (aka freezer)), wich is 1500K for reciever. This approach is correct in general, but it\u0027s error-prone in cases when you have multiple reactors on your vessel (like 25k antimatter and ....ty 1.6k fission, so you\u0027ll never get your radiators to heat up to 3200k and provide maximum irradiation). I don\u0027t see any lightweight solutions for this. To solve this, heating mechanics must be changed pretty seriously, and cooling should now be not global for the whole vessel, but managed in optimal way (distribute radiators between heat sources in optimal way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of recievers - well, I can just change their coreTemperature to smthg like 3500 K to use graphene radiators at 100% and make it an option in plugin settings config.
