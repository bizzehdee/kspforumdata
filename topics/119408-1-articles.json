All the changes they\u0027ve mentioned don\u0027t sound gamebreaking, but small bugs in KSP tend to have hugely disastrous results so I could be wrong. The reason it might be weird is because of the new antenna range additions. If you\u0027ve got vessels outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI there\u0027s a chance you won\u0027t be able to control them anymore. I have no idea if the old wheels will be compatible with the new ones, so any vessels with wheels on them might break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe unfortunately won\u0027t know until it releases.
