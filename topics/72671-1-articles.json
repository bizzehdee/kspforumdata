However, I was able to recoup 700 mb of memory without altering my game experience at all: I downloaded a folder size scanner for windows (for some strange and weird reason, you can\u0027t sort folders by size in windows!) and first checked my gamedata folder for the heaviest mods. Within those mods, I then checked for the parts that consumed the most space -- I quickly found that a lot of those parts I never even used! After purging all of my mods, my game is now 700 mb lighter!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T04:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is very, very good advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a note: remember that size on disk does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E equate to size in memory. MBMs are uncompressed on disk; a 1024x1024 texture will consume 3MB of space. Ingame it uses 512KB. A PNG version of the same texture might use only 200KB on disk (or, if it\u0027s mostly 1 color, only 50KB!); but ingame it will still use 512KB of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falken","CreatedById":17316,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T13:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do this, but one thing you can do is have Kerbal running so you can crosscheck the parts to see what you are deleting easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T22:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei do this all the time and even reuse models for other stuff like reuse some of the models for KSPI to serve for other things\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T07:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one way ...
