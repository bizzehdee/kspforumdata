While it may not be as efficient as him, this rocket is very easy to orbit, and has just enough fuel for a lunar orbit or a free return trajectory. The best part is, it\\\u0027s entirely stock. It does require version 14.4\u002B, so all you demo guys better buy the game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s a picture of it. The mission profile is very simple. It can make high orbits, but I recommend it for 100KM, because low-orbit is just so nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=11172.0;attach=18084;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=11172.0;attach=18084;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone needs a nominal flight plan to help them out, I can also drop that in as sort of a guideline on how to orbit this thing or get to the mun, but I\\\u0027m sure nobody will have any issues.
