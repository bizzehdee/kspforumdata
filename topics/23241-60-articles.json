I have been bashing my head against the wall of extreme drag caused by those variable geometry intake engine mounts for the last day and have had very limited success. I originally didn\u0027t even consider that the engine mounts/intakes might be the problem and so have been trying to make more and more sophisticated wings, never realizing that I was solving the wrong problem. Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with regards to my earlier comments, I take back everything I said. Using the FAR mod, the variable geometry engine mounts and intakes aren\u0027t overpowered, they\u0027re massively underpowered. To the extent of being completely broken. The drag on these at transonic speeds is so extreme that at high speeds they effectively prevent the craft from accelerating while climbing without greater than 20 degrees AoA, which generally causes stalls anyway, hence my recent focus on more and more complex/sophisticated wings. At this point, I\u0027ve got more design hours spent on wings than the entire aerodynamics team behind the F22 Raptor, I imagine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo elaborate, while the Taverius shock intakes intake a lot less air, cutting out at around 20k assuming 1 intake per engine, they also have less than half the drag associated with them at transonic speeds. I\u0027ve got a link to two example craft below which weighs around 40 tons and uses 4 D-30F7 turbojets. They are identical in every way but the intakes used. The craft using the Taverius shock cones has a CD of around .35 at transonic speeds, while the other craft, using the RBM engine mount, has a CD of .75 at those same speeds. The fact that the RDM\u0027s generate a lot more intake air than the shock cones doesn\u0027t matter, since the RMB craft can\u0027t accelerate beyond ~ Mach 1.1-1.2 on jets alone without stalling out and descending into denser atmosphere, thus slowing down even more. To get around this would require more engines. A lot more engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is so extreme that the shock cone spaceplane is easily able to get into orbit with delta-v to spare, while the RBM intake spaceplane can\u0027t get above 20km and mach 1.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a fix, I\u0027d suggest decreasing the air intake for the variable geometry intakes to around the levels of the shock cone, while also decreasing the drag to similar levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaverius, Bac. Please. Look at my example craft below. They have an info-drive describing my usual ascent profile. They require PWing, KWRocketry, TV Aerospace, and FAR. The drag I\u0027m seeing here, along with the intake air amounts absolutely can not be right. Something is broken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RBM engine mount is beautiful, and I\u0027d really hate for it to remain effectively unusable because of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9K8KY8RgD-qaW5aQ0tsbEp1QU0\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDrag Example Craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - It\u0027s nice.
