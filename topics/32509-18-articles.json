this is to disable SAS.\u00A0 Its not a fix all solution, but it will at the minimum make it very difficult to hit the exact same spot multiple times as the 1st shot will start the ship in a spin.\u00A0 That said, luckily there are limits to what you can do with a drilling style weapon.\u00A0 The thing HAS TO be centralized to work well, and that means you have to have either a fully exposed weapon sticking out the front (thus easy to shoot off), or build it into the hull which lowers internal space for fuel and other systems (an issue with my Sk-CRV-IVg1).\u00A0 You need to keep the missiles within a 1.25m profile, which makes ~8 shots the absolute maximum you can theoretically have (ive managed to create a SRM-8, but it was buggy and inaccurate thus defeating the purpose entirely).\u00A0\u00A0 If you have a offcenter launcher you can sortof hit the same spot event time but it requyires cockpit aim and knowing exactly where the missiles will hit relative to centerline (easier said then done).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, im starting to come to the same conclusion many othrs have come to, that armor can only go so far.\u00A0 I havent given up my dream, and probably never will give up trying to create a ultra low part count extremely resilient vessel, but i think that armor right now is less important then it was since everyone is running around with weapons that can kill anything 90% of the time, and rarely even need to use all of their ordinance on a single target.\u00A0 You need enough armor so that a single shot doesnt kill you, but trying to defend against the entire arsenal of a super heavy warship (100\u002Bt and 400\u002B parts) is just futile...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T20:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavHud significantly aids with

(a long time ago for that matter, seen it in 1.0 if not earlier).\u00A0 Well here is my review:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArmor is so-so, but comparing it to what is out there it is actually very good.\u00A0 Its pretty comparable to my SK-CRV-IVg1 armor and firepower wise except its higher on part counts (but it does get better dV thanks to ions).\u00A0 Now as for specific weapons, its decentish vs competitive torps, with my popper-H knockoff usually able to damage but not completely neuter it in 1 shot.\u00A0 There was one try where the entire thing went poof-debri-cloud, but thats it.\u00A0 As for SRM-6M, dies just like anything else, although its not a guaranteed death, and you need to manually fire every shot into the same area to guarantee a kill (turning off sas makes this feat much more difficult once it starts rotating).\u00A0 RT-5s are so-so, ive had a few trials where the entire thing was split after the 2nd shot, and ive had trials where it took 4 direct hits with only a few chunks missing (but still fully functional).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts defenetely a solid ship, especially with how miniscule it is, but it suffers from teh number one problem in this entire game, lack of part count efficiency (yes 1.1 has made high part counts workable, but myself i still try to make hulls that are under 200 parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, i dont know if its just me, but it seems that high end torpedoes like the popper-H seem to be inferior in terms of killing ability to things like ibeam stacks.\u00A0 Only with tire based impactors does this change, but even then it is literally 75% luck as to whether the thing phases in and interacts with what we want it to interact with (namely the skeleton or core or whatever you want to call it).\u00A0 There is a hull design component (ofc terribly built hulls will die way more often), but it seems that designing a hull specifically to defend against that type of weapon is a waste of time as the super powered ones rely on high mass and velocity (to the point you cant really make anything to counter a lucky shot), the tire impactor types just obliterate whatever they phase into every time, and the shrapnel ones are really the most hit and miss, sometimes with luck they will shred internals, sometimes they split a ship, sometimes they dont do jack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIbeams (specifically centrally mounted drilling models) are some of the most reliable weapons ive seen, with very few ships able to actually take more then a few hits before they get split.\u00A0 The whole trick is to use cockpit aim (sometimes using the autoaim feature also does the trick but can be countered very easily by having your so called root part be somewhere far away from teh actual ship core) to direct more then 1 shot into the exact same spot, virtually nothing aside from excessively excessive thick plating can deal with this (in which case we are looking at some 1000-2000 part monstrosity).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow RT-5s seem to be a middle ground.\u00A0 Certain ships seem to be extremely esy to kill with something as simple as a RT-5 with a decoupler atop it (not even any structural impactor).\u00A0 From my experience anything sporting a drek styled interior seems to be the worst against these things.\u00A0 By drek interior i mean a long spine of XL-3 girders off of which the fuel tanks and hull is attached to (i just call it a drek interior as the drek was teh 1st ship ive ever seen use such a core).\u00A0 RT-5s are somewhat bad against multiple layered armor that is surrounding a single root part (hence why i started working with that style now), but even then multipke direct hits will just tear the ship apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, as a few tips to anyone who is getting into combat, the single most part count efficient weapon is a stack of RT-5s separated by 1.25m decouplers (place either a decoupler on the 1st one in the stack or a nose cone if you liek appearance.\u00A0 The thing isnt even that heavy either with a single round being around 1ton, and each round is 2 parts.\u00A0 The other best general purpose weapon is a single long ibeam with 4 sepatrons pushing it.\u00A0 These are less part count efficient then the RT-5s, but they are lighter, and most of all much easier to use in large numbers because they are smaller and can have like 8 or so jammed into the same cross sectional area that a single RT-5 takes up.\u00A0 Great to carry 4-8 of them as backups (or even close range primaries), but generally you want to avoid spamming them as they make your part count go through the roof nomatter how you try to minimize that.\u00A0 Otherwise, stick to long range torps, these are fairly reliable, multipurpose, and most of all futureproof as it looks like real time MP will all but kill short range munitions on anything that isnt an interdictor or otherwise excessively mobile, or a fighter (completely different playstyle and role though there).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
