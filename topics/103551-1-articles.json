These videos will document my adventures as I seek to colonize each of the planets in the (much expanded, thanks to a number of mods) Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a sort of companion to the LP videos, which will focus on gameplay and the reasons behind the way I build and launch crafts, I will also be posting a story-based series that follows the journey of the Kerbal Space Agency as it lifts Kerbalkind out of its cradle and into space. You will soon find links to both the videos and the series here on this page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I start the playthrough, there are two things I need to do. First, I want to let you guys know what my goals and rules for the journey are. And second, I have a couple of questions I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like you guys to answer, since I want this playthrough to have community involvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first things first, my mod list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EConvenience Mods\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese mods improve gameplay without adding new parts or changing the way the game is played. Mostly information mods or mods that let me do things I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t easily do otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to let me know everything I need to know about my craft in order to fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 makes time warping much easier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrajectories \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a great mod that accounts for the effect of atmosphere and planet rotation on craft trajectory. Helps land exactly where I want and aerobrake more accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecise Node \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how I ever played without this mod, especially because I play on a laptop and so have no mouse wheel. Makes nodes a lot more useful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 every one of my ships spins when I use RCS. Every last one. With how much docking I will be doing, RCS Build Aid is a must.

There are still places I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been, but nothing excites me like landing on a planet for the first time! That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why I got these mods, to make things a little more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrans-Keptunian, Outer Planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPart Mods\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese mods are what makes this playthrough unique. Landing a base on another planet is easily in the base game; life support and base building mods make this a lot more challenging and fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 my favorite life support mod, combines simplicity with depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI FTT, MKS, and Karbonite \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Roverdude is an amazing modmaker and these three mods are what really allows this playthrough to happen. Karbonite, MKS, and FTT let me harvest resources, use them to keep my kerbals alive with TAC, and (with Extraplanetary Launchpad support) make my bases into real, productive outposts instead of dots on a map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Combined with Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads lets me build real bases that produce real, useful things.

More on the contracts it provides below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, the rules I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be playing by in this playthrough:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EGoal\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of the campaign is simple: To colonize every planet and moon in the system. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s easy to say, but what does that mean? There are 4 criteria I will require myself to fulfill before declaring a planet to be colonized:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) It houses at least 2 kerbals in a self-sustaining habitat that doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t require more than an occasional (every 10 years or more) small resupply rocket. For example, if a planet too far from the sun for solar panels has no uranium, uranium will be shipped over occasionally to ensure that the base doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t run out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) It can produce vehicles capable of reaching any other spot on the body or heading back to Kerbin with no outside input. It has sent at least one rocket full of expensive, finished goods back to Kerbin to justify the cost of setting it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) It is in some way unique. Every colony needs something to set it apart from other colonies. Maybe the Laythe colony floats on water, or maybe the Minmus colony sits on giant wheels and roves around the surface. No two colonies can be the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) It looks awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will consider the campaign complete when every moon and planet has been colonized; every gas planet has a station orbiting just above its atmosphere; and two solar stations orbit the sun, one as low as is safe and one in the asteroid belt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERules\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be playing this campaign in career mode, with no use of cheats, debug mode, or any unbalanced mods once the game begins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started the game in career mode, but edited the save file to start with enough science to unlock all nodes and begin with a fully-upgraded science center. I did not buy any items and edited funds to 1,000,000 kerbucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I will follow the following rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) No reverting once launched, except to rectify a bug (explosion on launchpad, etc.). Building a rocket, hitting launch to see, for example, how long life support will last, and reverting is acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Quicksaving is allowed, but if I crash due to pilot error or bad design the results stand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No resource gathering on Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 those resources are owned by someone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) All contracts are acceptable until the first station is built. At that point, only the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExplore [body]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 contracts, civilian contracts, and contracts having to do with bases or stations may be accepted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Probe cores cannot fly astronauts. If a craft is manned, it must be flown by a kerbal. Non-pilot kerbals may not use probes for their enhanced SAS abilities \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 probe cores must be shut off unless a pilot is on board. This makes pilots much more valuable!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) No strategies from the administrative building. Since I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need science, they would be overpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s that.
