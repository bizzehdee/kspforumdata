This would mean a Kerbal Week and a Kerbal Month must be the same unit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s refer to \u0022Weeks\u0022 as \u0022Munths\u0022 and what we think of \u0022Months\u0022 as \u0022Minmonths\u0022, because Minmus goes around Kerbin once every 50 days, a better representation of a month.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Munth as 6 days, because of rounding, and like real Months, the Moon does not revolve once every Month, so a Munth doesn\u0027t have to be perfect either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbday\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoonday\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvesday\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunesday\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoolsday\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEelsday (If we get a GP2, change this to [GP2]sday, for instance, \u0022Sentarday\u0022 or \u0022Sarnday\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 8 Munths in a Minmonth, again not perfect, but neither is the Month. Like weeks, individual Munths get no special name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8 times 6 = 48, so there are 48 days in a month. There are 8.875 Months in a Year. This means we have to change what a month is, just like we do in real life. Sometimes a month is 30 days, sometimes 31, and of course February is 28 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can get almost close enough for one month to have only 42 days and keep the other months constant at 48 days. It would also get the fortune of having the leapyear. So that\u0027s 9 Minmonths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdatuary\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-First Minmonth of the year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeburary\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Short month.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Vall\u0027s day, a holiday about relationships and celebrating them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWobble\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlay\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTune\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoho\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The hottest Minmunth of them all, based upon seasons caused by planetary perturbations, not axial tilt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRulus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOctokerb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Day of the Deceased.

Food may or may not be gravity, so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E does many launches on this day for the Delta-V boost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNovemkerb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Hypemas, a Minmonth long holiday where Kerbals get hyped about things to be less sad about the season of coldness that occurs based upon planetary perturbation, planetwide, not due to axial tilt. It culminates with Hypemas Eve and Hypemas Day, where a mysterious space elf drops presents on Kerbal houses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Nukemunth, a Munth long holiday celebrating the efficiency of the Atomic Rocket Motor, and how it, on low thrust, burned for 8 days longer than it should have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-New Year\u0027s Eve, a celebration of another year past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, no Kerbal alive remembers WHERE the holidays came from, just that they are tradition, and that tradition is awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Year Zero is disputed. Some of the Space Enthusiasts insist that Year Zero is the year the Kerbal Space Program started, others say it was nearly 1,951 years earlier with the birth of the first Kerbal (His name was Kraken) who thought that maybe shooting giant potatoes at people was not nearly as good a way of resolving differences as talking it out* is.
