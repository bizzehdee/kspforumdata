It has been going well, and I am at the point that orbital launches are routine and reliable. But, then all my upper stages stopped working. I separate from the booster, and it can go one of 2 ways:\u00A01. the decoupler goes off, but the second stage does not move. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E engines make plumes but do not make any thrust. I try to ignite the Second stage engine, and the plume starts up, but it does not make any thrust. The other thing that sometimes happens, is that the decoupler separates,\u00A0 and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters work and ullage the rocket, but when I ignite the engine, the same thing happens with a plume but no thrust. I have tried this on 2 different second stages, different engines, different boosters, and I have reinstalled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E engines, but the same thing happens. Can anyone help with this? Am I not Ullageing enough?
