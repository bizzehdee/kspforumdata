I had a very nice design (kinda) that would get me there but unfortunately I underestimated how much extra fuel I would burn fighting gravity with such a low thrust engine. So I got stranded there with 900m/s of fuel remaining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I started from scratch, re-using the concepts I developed over the last week so the build went much smoother. I made it into orbit on the first try, which is really a big deal when building light ships that have challenging missions to complete! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also switched over to a 4 wheeled rover rather than my preferred 2 wheel SegWay style. It\u0027s going to cost me a bunch of mass and lots of extra fuel, but I\u0027m hoping the useability will make up for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/hoyin1600p\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/hoyin1600p\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be updating this post as the stream comes up and goes down, and as the mission changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your eyes open for it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-11T14:55:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2013 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T02:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETylo is similar in mass, and the same size, as Kerbin, not Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think my lander was around 70 tons (once in Jool orbit), with 2 Kerbals and an unmanned rover carried on the bottom.
