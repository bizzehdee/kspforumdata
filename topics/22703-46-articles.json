And the main reason a lot of people \u003Cstrong\u003Ekeep\u003C/strong\u003E playing KSP is the mods. Mod makers should have some kind of early access/information to at least see whats going to break. I dont think the terrain changes are bad at all but the scene changes are ridiculously long. I can understand why they made the buildings so detailed though. One of the planned features is to make the facilities destructible and with the recent focus on career mode I think this feature might not be far off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T01:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jokamo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jokamo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really don\u0027t think that would be possible without making major changes to the way games are saved, as far as i know they don\u0027t have a timeline feature (or something that would be needed for this :/)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally?

Looking back now I wish I had done more research on the game before purchasing it. I don\u0027t think this is a game that should have been developed only on 32 bit. It is like Minecraft, it doesn\u0027t really work on only 3.5 gigs of memory. I really do hope they continue working on a 64 bit version. Otherwise, I don\u0027t see the game becoming what they hope it to be. It already seems to struggle if you download a couple of mods. I can only image what it will be like 6 months from now when they add more stuff to it if they don\u0027t update the game.

I had an incident where the parachute broke off due to the slowdown being too fast and the pod being too heavy (not a lot of the fuel hadd been burned off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 (alternative solution): Make the semi-deployed drag of the parachute be a lot higher, like 150 maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Make an ever so slightly downscaled version of the \u0027chute, for use with 2.5-1.25 m commandpod and the 1.25 meter lander can. It is a little too big for use with 1.25 meter sized... stuff. Also, it seems to hover above the 1 man lander can, when attached directly on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T19:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eare we suppose to be able to see the kerbals yet thru the glass. also could u have where the pod starts off glass closed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simplicity","CreatedById":57473,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T21:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Devo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Devo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, why not a release, I figure people can enjoy it at least while we get the IVA finished and other stuff.. will get you to the Mun and back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMAZING work on this, have downloaded it and will try it out as soon as I have a sleep (just got home from work) - You guys really are amazing with the things you come up with for us mod hungry people \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T22:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sidfu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sidfu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eare we suppose to be able to see the kerbals yet thru the glass. also could u have where the pod starts off glass closed\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither a mod is required to see the kerbals through the glass OR place a command seat in one of the three chairs you see inside.
