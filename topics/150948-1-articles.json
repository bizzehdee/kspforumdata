Although, both the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E have both been very laggy and jittery, and the problem seems to occur when I\u0027m at ground level. My hypothesis is that the Kerbals that wonder around are causing the problem, yet no graphical changes I make seem to solve the issue. My mac is a late 2012 model with an intel i5 and 8GB of ram, so it\u0027s not the most high tech thing out there, but it\u0027s served me very well up to this point. Any suggestions or help would be fantastic.\u00A0I love this game and have been playing it for a number of years, and I would hate something like this irritate me and stop me playing. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003ENot to worry I\u0027ve just found the \u0027Hide space centre crew\u0027 button.
