The first one was serial, with the vertical engines at the front and back. Not only did it look goofy, it spun out of control and was difficult to make hover. The offset tool has been rather helpful getting the CoT the right side of the CoM, and disabling the thrust of the rear jets while constructing allowed me to get things in line properly. A good bit of the modification was done in the VAB, once the majority of the structure was there - particularly setting up the action groups. Hopefully, the dry CoM won\u0027t be too far forward, but I haven\u0027t tested that. Clipped within are two Z-200 batteries, and an Okto in the bottom - girders gave me a good way to lower the CoM, attach torque and orient the probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/pWnfRj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pWnfRj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/h9jYKs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h9jYKs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/wufouq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wufouq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanski used the remains of the transfer stage to adjust orbits and get a couple of temperature readings for one contract, then missed the altitude window for the third of that one. I decided it would be better to move for a landing at this point, as the lander was now separated and operating under its own power, so I sent it to Zone Q303.

Jeb was, as I have said few days ago, stranded in low Kerbin orbit and was waiting for his fellow kerbonauts to develop technology to come and rescue him. While there I decided to use him to milk some EVA report science around Kerbin. So I went to the tracking station, selected his ship and went to fly. When ship loaded it was spinning rapidly and when it stopped it was on escape trajectory out of Kerbin SOI with only 2 parts on his ship (capsule and parachute). So I canceled that mission in tracking station and edited persistent file to bring Jeb back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also upgraded administration building and flew another mission to test poodle engine and get some \u0022in space near Kerbin\u0022 science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xiziz","CreatedById":128173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T22:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got an actual payload into orbit and landed safely back on the runway, those huge wings make for a easy to land aircraft. Payload was, as I soon noticed, the better part of uncontrollable. I built it all symmetrical so I could use the gimbal to control it and get it into the correct orbit. However the decoupler I had it attached with was rotated 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, causing the bulky part to stick to the sat. Will have to wait until I have SAS I think, 90 more science for a core that has it.
