If not Roentgen, a week later somebody else would do the same in his scientific lair.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst he thought that it\u0027s some (obviously poisonous, but who cares) gas, but after playing with a piece of carton, putting it between the tube and the crystal, he got ensured that it\u0027s not (poisonous) gas, it\u0027s just (poisonous) ray.\u003Cbr\u003E\nExperimenting with the X-ray (xathode-ray ?) tube, and his wife\u0027s and assistant\u0027s parts of body, Roentgen had studied the X-rays and published his results for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Henri Becquerel was playing with funny glowing fluorescent compounds, putting them under sun together with photopaper, then developing them. So, he \u0022suddenly\u0022 discovered that a uranium compound, lying on his table among other chemicals, works like the sunlight, emitting invisible rays.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe published this interesting fact, so everyone who was having a piece of uranium salt on his table, could have a fun, too.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, it again was not a miracle, but a mess on the worktable with predictable result from unpredictable person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Curies read the article, and immediately decided to experiment with.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey got the same result, and started purifying the uranium salt, realizing that it\u0027s uranium, who glows.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut keeping doing the purification to extract the emitting piece of the uranium, they realized that it\u0027s not uranium, who glows. But an admixture of radium an polonium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, they got some amount of purified radium solution, which was causing glowing much better than the original uranium salt.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd immediately published their result to show a tongue to Becquerel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecquerel read their article, and visited them. They gave him a vial with the radioactive solution, to show it to the students.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecquerel expectably put the radioactive vial in the pocket of pants, right near the family souvenirs (what can go wrong with the unknown rays from\u00A0 toxic compound?), and was walking a whole day with it, getting a burn of the vial shape.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(It is not clear, if he had shown to the students only the vial, or the burn, too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmused and happy, he came to the Curies, to show them the burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Curies joined to his joy, and Pierre Curi attached the vial to his forearm, to get much better burn than the Becquerel\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpectably, he got what he wanted, and then several months was trying to cure the burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(So, who knows, maybe that draft horse just gifted him euthanasia, before their radium plays caused something else).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat did Maria Curie do after looking at those two geniuses?\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously, she started wearing a vial of radium on her chest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting fact: none of them even had a thought to first try it on a mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the von Guericke experiments with electrization of the sulfur ball surface, and the XVIII century electric generators brought the electric telegraph, and the electric lamps.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe electric liquid was flowing along the copper wires as via pipes, and a telegraphist was opening/closing the valve with a Morse key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut by measuring the electric effects they realised, that the electric liquid consists of particles, which were called electrons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile the chemists were purifying and purifying various compounds, studying the compound proportions in chemical reactions, and came to a strange conclusion: all \u0022chemical element\u0022 masses are proportional to the hydrogen mass as integers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis made to think than the elements\u0027 atoms actually consist of hydrogen atoms packed together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the appearance/disappearance of the electric charge led to the next conclusion: the atom consists of equal amounts of heavy positive particles, \u0022protons\u0022, and equal amount of the lightweight electrons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis brought the \u0022pudding model of atom\u0022, where the protons and electrons form pieces of sticky mess (same as the physicists\u0027 mess on the table), called \u0022atoms\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the experiments of the ray scattering had shown, that some electrons are orbiting about a core, consisting of prototns and intranuclear electrons, and probably the reason of the difference is the electrons\u0027 energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, by 1910 the pudding model of atom turned into the pudding model of nucleus with orbital electrons around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the purification of the chemicals was going on, bringing more and more pure elements, and allowing to measure their atomic masses.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd this caused another confusion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe atomic masses of same elements from different places were different.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(That\u0027s because various deposits had contained different isotopes, and their decay chains had brought different amounts of isotopes of the same element).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey realised, that there are atoms of the same element, which contain different amounts of proton-electron pairs in the nucleus.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey called this isotopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the chemists were purifying the elements, and realized that the elements form a linear sequence, more or less by mass, and their chemical properties look periodic, but not that simply.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were arranging them by mass, writing in rows, columns, and squares, and finally got several variants of the periodic table, between which the Mendeleev\u0027s version appeared to be the most close to reality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough, it happened only because he had arbitrarily swapped and joined some elements, based on his great experience in chemistry, but without any idea of what is the element number Z in the table, except just an item index.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom your pov: \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (2p\u002Bn) \u002B 2e, \u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (2p\u002B2n) \u002B 2e,\u00A0 Z = number of p\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom the great nuclear physicists of the early XX pov: \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (3p\u002Be) \u002B 2e, \u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (4p\u002B2e) \u002B 2e,\u00A0 Z = number of p minus number of e in the nucleus = who knows, what\u0027s it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen in 1920s they discovered helium in the spectrum of Sun, it became clear for everyone, than the Sun is powered by the fusion of four atoms of hydrogen into one atom of helium.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4[(p)\u002Be] \u2192 (4p \u002B 2e) \u002B 2e\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only unclear thing was, how can four atoms of hydrogen collide all at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately, it gave an idea: if compress a tank of hydrogen very-very much, the temperature inside will adiabatically raise, and some hydrogen atom will quad-collide and form atoms of helium, releasing much-much energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the fundamentally improbable physics of such collisions made this frustrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the physicists were having rest by melancholically putting a radioactive source against a barrel of steam, and making photos of the traces, left by charged particles in its volume. The barrel was in electric field, making the charged particle have curved trajectories.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsually, they were using expensive radium and polonium in a lead case with a hole.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving no idea how to make this useful, they were putting sheets of various material between the hole and the steam barrel, and measuring, how thick should be the sheet to weaken the beam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Rutherford was asked, if the nuka-physics can be used as weapon, he laughed and explained, that no, it\u0027s just a toy for the scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was joyful and pretty, before they put a beryllium sheet in front of the polonium source.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe alpha particles from polonium were bombing the beryllium nuclei, and thus some straight traces appeared in the barrel, left by some beams, insensitive to the electric field.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was unexplainable, and they called it \u0022beryllium rays\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow they were also melancholically experimenting with the beryllium rays, and with same practical result.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn 1932 it got proven that the beryllium rays consist of heavy neutral particles, called \u0022neutrons\u0022, and then that the nuclei consist of protons and neutrons, so the fusion means not just merging, but also turning p and n to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, instead of (4p\u002B2e)\u002B2e the helium became (2p\u002B2n)\u002B2e.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt also explained that Z is the number of protons, constant for an element, and the isotopes have same amount of p, but different number of n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile, the chemists were keeping distilling various substances to make them pure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd finally in 1934 they found deuterium, whih was not (2p\u002Be)\u002Be, like they could think earlier, but (p\u002Bn)\u002Be, as they knew now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun and fusion bomb became absolutely clear now. Pairs of hydrogen fuse into deuterium, then pairs of deuterium fuse into helium.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBingo! No quad collisions, only pairs!\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, it was wrong, but who cares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving no idea what to do with it, they started electrolizing heavy water, and bombing heavy water with deuterium ions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they discovered traces of tritium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey spent several years and enormous amount of money to distil some tritium from water and define its concentration, but failed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause there was just 2 kg of tritium per Earth before the nuclear tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get significant amount of energy from fusion, they had to compress not a tank of hydrogen, but a tank of deuterium.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they were trying to produce small amounts of heavy water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, they began experiments with explosive implosion spheres, fruited in the lovely series of experiments, when the Germans were compressing silver balls by implosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the calculations had shown, that it\u0027s not easy to compress deuterium with chemical explosives, but at the same time D\u002BT should fuse at much lower temperature, so a D\u002BT cryotank should be compressed by the explosives, and heat up the main reservoir with liquid D by adiabatically compressing it in a tube.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the fusing D would be expanding and cooling, so they needed something to compress it back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe obvious choice was to surround it with liquid hydrogen, whose atomic mass is twice lower, so the pressure is twice higher.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter WWII it brought the presumed RDS-6t design of a 5-t-heavy pure hydrogen bomb.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(The attempt failed because the reaction was coming together with instabilities in the reacting medium.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there were unsolvable problems:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. D\u002BT is still too heatproof for the chemicals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. There is no T in nature, while there was no idea of atomic reactors, so the only way of accumulating T was particle acceleration, producing\u00A0 pathetic amounts of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Once they had collected measurable amount of tritium, they realized that it\u0027s radioactive, so they can\u0027t store it forever. Every 12 years they would be losing a half of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving no idea what to do, they were having fun by bombarding with neutrons various things.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd finally in 1938 they had bombarded uranium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs any smart street guy would first try bombarding that uranium thing which Becquerel used, just from magic thinking (it worked once, should work again), we can state the fact, that the excessive education and overcomplicated thinking have played an evil joke on the physicists, delaying the fission discovery by five-six years.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLook at the radioactivity pioneers of late XIX. They were never thinking before trying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce they had known that the uranium fisses under neutrons, and releases more neutrons that flew inside, the further progress was just a question of time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nActually, the first nukes have been tested 7 years after the fission discovery (1945-1938), or 13 year after the neutron discovery and realizing that the nuclei consist of p and n (1945-1932), or half-century after the cathode rays experiments and fluorescence study, or less than 300 years after the von Guericke\u0027s experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the von Guericke experiments actually require technologies of the early iron epoch, just were looking better in XVII scenery, we can state that any developed civilisation must make its first nukes by the end of its first millenium, so the humans have done it unforgivably slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, this means that there can be only two kind of sapient species: troglodytes and nukemasters.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe humans are in the delayed jump from to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224399819\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225177\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221718811992\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DDE\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, DDE said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a continuous development in scale from World Wars I and II with a major global slaughterhouse every 25 or so years, until, and if, demographic transition of the early XXIst century makes expending millions of lives in war prohibitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA grain of pepper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if the 25s are just accumulated as debt?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverpopulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMotto of the real science:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227d73ee0b9efa4b19f6458d8d9bbcf0f9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.85\u0022 height=\u0022465\u0022 width=\u0022717\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/7d73ee0b9efa4b19f6458d8d9bbcf0f9.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-20T03:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2024 03:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 20\u0022\u003EJune 20\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exoscientist","CreatedById":27117,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-19T17:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224399753\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225177\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221718787509\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212243\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022awsumguy76801\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, awsumguy76801 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI watched a video or something that said nukes were a \u201C23rd century technology that we accidentally discovered in the 20th.\u201D or something like that.

Anyway it was kinda forgotten for almost 2k years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s experimenting with calorimetry, measuring the amount of heat, required for heating, or releasing on cooling\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe invented various scientific instruments, attached to the wall of his home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was doing this all between the dull duties of burgomaster, manager, ambassador, and so on, and being a friend of the emperor, conquered his city.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it doesn\u0027t matter, let\u0027s think it was indeed a one real man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, von Guericke and Torricelli had began the gas physics, then Boyle (the 7th son of \u003Cs\u003Ethe 7th son\u003C/s\u003E a super-rich British lord, and the 14th his child) had ordered the vacuum pump improvement in the local workshop, and was doing the modern gas physics which we know and love, making a fun from dry language science (pumping air from glass spheres with small animals became a popular saloon fun 300\u002B years before the \u003Cem\u003EExpanse \u003C/em\u003Eseries).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time the electrostatic generator became another saloon fun. Somebody was holding the wires, another one was winding the handle, so a sparkle suddenly hit the first one, then both were laughing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe most experienced ones were getting electric arcs, hitting the counterpart through the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strong glass spheres together with vacuum pumps and electrostatic generators unexpectedly led to another kind of fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe attempts to cause as strong and long sparkle as possible made combining them, and discover the arc discharge in vacuum tubes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the joy was not full without the electric charge storage, because it was too boring to keep winding the generator handle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappily, they discovered a leyden jar.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe idea was simple like a crowbar. The electricity is invisible liquid, so let\u0027s pour it into a jar.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was a glass jar with an iron chain inside, which allowed to store much greater charge, before it hit the person who was holding the jar in hands.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater they replaced the chain with a wire and a foil, so the fun became more effective.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe most famous experiment with it was when several tens of soldiers were holding hands of two neighbours, then a big leyden jar was discharged, so the observers noticed various funny screams and poses of the (un)told volunteers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe electrostatic generator together with the vacuum tube, and a battery of leyden jars made it possible to experiment with so strong arcs in the tube, that the gas inside was glowing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time the experiments with pumps, hemispheres, gas physics, and calorimetry, and the steel revolution of XVIII gave the steam engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttaching it to the electrostatic generator was promising by orders of magnitude greater fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut a century before Otto von Guericke (whoever it was), the English Elizabeth I and James I were sometimes suffering from constipation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, their doctor, William Gilbert, was reading books, and had read that the powder from Magnesia, i.e. magnetic ore, is a good laxative.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(It indeed is. If eat a kilogram of it and retrogradely approach to an industrial magnetic crane.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe started experimenting with magnets, and became the guru of magnetism, giving to the humanity the physics of magnetism (it stays unclear, did it help against the royal constipation, but both patients had ended not\u00A0 quite well, so who knows).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appeared that it\u0027s much better to rotate a magnet with steam engine, so the electric engines and generators appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the adepts of the arc discharges in vacuum tubes became addicted more and more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey discovered that the glowing is attracted by the magnets and electric wires, so the ubergrossekolossal vacuum tubes became \u0022cathode-ray tubes\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Doesn\u0027t relate to Rey Skywalker, though who knows, the lightsabres do glow...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey discovered that some materials start glowing in presence of the \u0022cathode-ray tubes\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince early times, the alchemists were experimenting with purifying of chemicals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince Lavoisier disproved the classic four elements, and other archaic stuff, before being beheaded, and thatnks to the industrial revolution, the purification ran much faster, so the \u003Cs\u003Ealchem\u003C/s\u003Escientists got pure crystals of various chemical compounds, and discovered the fluorescence, i.e. glowing in UV (for example, under the sunlight).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs nobody knew, what are those cathodes-schmatodes, fluorescence-mluorescence, and other fancy vile things, the physicists were studying them all at once, storing a heap of junk on the same table.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks to that (and to the expensive lighting of laboratory), when Roentgen late in the evening had switched on the cathode-ray tube, the cathode rays hit the crystal of fluorescent compound laying aside and made it glow.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(And no, it\u0027s not a lucky coincidence, it\u0027s a systematic mess at the workplace, and absence of elementary tidiness. If not Roentgen, a week later somebody else would do the same in his scientific lair.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst he thought that it\u0027s some (obviously poisonous, but who cares) gas, but after playing with a piece of carton, putting it between the tube and the crystal, he got ensured that it\u0027s not (poisonous) gas, it\u0027s just (poisonous) ray.\u003Cbr\u003E\nExperimenting with the X-ray (xathode-ray ?) tube, and his wife\u0027s and assistant\u0027s parts of body, Roentgen had studied the X-rays and published his results for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Henri Becquerel was playing with funny glowing fluorescent compounds, putting them under sun together with photopaper, then developing them. So, he \u0022suddenly\u0022 discovered that a uranium compound, lying on his table among other chemicals, works like the sunlight, emitting invisible rays.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe published this interesting fact, so everyone who was having a piece of uranium salt on his table, could have a fun, too.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, it again was not a miracle, but a mess on the worktable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Curies read the article, and immediately decided to experiment with.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThy got the same result, and started purifying the uranium salt, realizing that it\u0027s uranium, who glows.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut keeping the purification to extract the emitting piece of the uranium, they realized that it\u0027s not uranium, who glows. But an admixture of radium an polonium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, they got some amount of purified radium solution, which was causing glowing much better than the original uranium salt.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd immediately published their result to show a tongue to Becquerel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecquerel read their article, and visited them. They gave him a vial with the radioactive solution, to show it to the students.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecquerel expectably put the radioactive vial in the pocket of pants, right near the family souvenirs (what can go wrong with the unknown rays from\u00A0 toxic compound?), and was walking a whole day with it, getting a burn of the vial shape.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(It is not clear, if he had shown to the students only the vial, or the burn, too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmused and happy, he came to the Curies, to show them the burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Curies joined his joy, and Pierre Curi attached the vial to his forearm, to get much better burn than the Becquerel\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpectably, he got what he wanted, and then several months was trying to cure the burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(So, who knows, maybe that draft horse just gifted him euthanasia, before their radium plays caused something else).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat did Maria Curie do after looking at those two geniuses?\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously, she started wearing a vial of radium on her chest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting fact: none of them even had a thought to first try it on a mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the von Guericke experiments with electrization of the sulfur ball surface, and the XVIII century electric generators brought the electric telegraph, and the electric lamps.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe electric liquid was flowing along the copper wires as via pipes, and a telegraphist was openin/closing the valve with a Morse key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut by measuring the electric effects they realised, that the electric liquid consists of particles, which were called electrons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile the chemists were purifying and purifying various compounds, studying the compound proportions in chemical reactions, and came to a strange conclusion: all \u0022chemical element\u0022 masses are proportional to the hydrogen mass as integers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis made to think than the element atoms actually consist of hydrogen atoms packed together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the appearance/disappearance of the electric charge led to the next conclusion: the atom consists of equal amounts of heavy positive particles, \u0022protons\u0022, and equal amount of the lightweight electrons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis brought the \u0022pudding model of atom\u0022, where the protons and electrons form pieces of sticky mess (same as the physicists\u0027 mess on the table), called \u0022atoms\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the experiments of the ray scattering had shown, that some electrons are orbiting about a core, consisting of prototns and intranuclear electrons, and probably the reason of the difference is the electrons\u0027 energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, by 1910 the pudding model of atom turned into the pudding model of nucleus with orbital electrons around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the purification of the chemicals was going on, bringing more and more pure elements, and allowing to measure their atomic masses.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this caused another confusion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe atomic masses of same elements from different places were different.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(That\u0027s because various deposits had contained different isotopes, and their decay chains had brought different amounts of isotopes of the same element).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey realised, that there are atoms of the same element, which contain different amounts of proton-electron pairs in the nucleus.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey called this isotopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the chemists were purifying the elements, and realized that the elements form a linear sequence, more or less by mass, and their chemical properties look periodic, but not that simply.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were arranging them by mass, writung in rows, columns, and squares, and finally got several variants of the periodic table, between which the Mendeleev\u0027s version appeared to be the most close to reality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough, it happened only because he had arbitrarily swapped and joined some elements, based on his great experience in chemistry, but without any idea of what is the element number Z in the table, except just an item index.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom your pov: \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (2p\u002Bn) \u002B 2e, \u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (2p\u002B2n) \u002B 2e,\u00A0 Z = number of p\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom the great nuclear physicists of the early XX pov: \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (3p\u002Be) \u002B 2e, \u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003EHe = (4p\u002B2e) \u002B 2e,\u00A0 Z = number of p minus number of e in the nucleus = who knows, what\u0027s it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen in 1920s they discovered helium in the sppectrum of Sun, it became clear for everyone, than the Sun is powered by the fusion of four atoms of hydrogen into one atom of helium.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4[(p)\u002Be] \u2192 (4p \u002B 2e) \u002B 2e\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only unclear thing was, how can four atoms of hydrogen collide all at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately, it gave an idea: if compress a tank of hydrogen very-very much, the temperature inside will adiabatically raise, and some hydrogen atom will quad-collide and form atoms of helium, releasing much-much energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the fundamentally improbable physics of such collisions made this frustrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the physicists were having rest by melancholically putting a radioactive source against a barrel of steam, and making photos of the traces, left by charged particles in its volume. The barrel was in electric field, making the charged particle have curved trajectories.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsually, they were using expensive radium and polonium in a lead case with a hole.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving no idea how to make this useful, they were putting sheets of various material between the hole and the steam barrel, and measuring, how thick should be the sheet to weaken the beam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Rutherford was asked, if the nuka-physics can be used as weapon, he laughed and explained, that no, it\u0027s just a toy for the scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was joyful and pretty, before they put a beryllium sheet in front of the polonium source.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe alpha particles from polonium were bombing the beryllium nuclei, and thus some straight traces appeared in the barrel, left by some beams, insensitive to the electric field.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was unexplainable, and they called it \u0022beryllium rays\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow they were also melancholically experimenting with the beryllium rays, and same practical result.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn 1932 it got proven that the beryllium rays consist of heavy neutral particles, called \u0022neutrons\u0022, and then that the nuclei consist of protons and neutrons, so the fusion means not just merging, but also turning p and n to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, instead of (4p\u002B2e)\u002B2e the helium became (2p\u002B2n)\u002B2e.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt also explained that Z is the number of protons, constant for an element, and the isotopes have same amount of p, but different number of n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile, the chemists were keeping distilling various substances to make them pure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd finally in 1934 they found deuterium, whih was not (2p\u002Be)\u002Be, like they could think earlier, but (p\u002Bn)\u002Be, as they knew now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun and fusion bomb became absolutely clear now. Pairs of hydrogen fuse into deuterium, then pairs of deuterium fuse into helium.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBingo! No quad collisions, only pairs!\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, it was wrong, but who cares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving no idea what to do with it, they started electrolizing heavy water, and bombing heavy water with deuterium ions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they discovered traces of tritium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey spent several years and enormous amount of money to distil some tritium from water and define its concentration, but failed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause there was just 2 kg of tritium per Earth before the nuclear tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get significant amount of energy from fusion, they had to compress not a tank of hydrogen, but a tank of deuterium.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they were trying to produce small amounts of heavy water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, they began experiments with explosive implosion spheres, fruited in the lovely series of experiments, when the Germans were compressing silver balls by implosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the calculations had shown, that it\u0027s not easy to compress deuterium with chemical explosives, but at the same time D\u002BT should fuse at much lower temperature, so a D\u002BT cryotank should be compressed by the explosives, and heat up the main reservoir with liquid D by adiabatically compressing it in a tube.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the fusing D would be expanding and cooling, so they needed something to compress it back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe obvious choice was to surround it with liquid hydrogen, whose atomic mass is twice lower, so the pressure is twice higher.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter WWII it brought the presumed RDS-6t design of a 5-t-heavy pure hydrogen bomb.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(The attempt failed because the reaction was coming together with instabilities in the reacting medium.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there were unsolvable problems:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. D\u002BT is still too heatproof for the chemicals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. There is no T in nature, while there was no idea of atomic reactors, so the only way of accumulating T was particle acceleration, producing\u00A0 pathetic amounts of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Once they had collected measurable amount of tritium, they realized that it\u0027s radioactive, so they can\u0027t store it forever.

At all. Allow me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne of the major misunderstandings that people have about nuclear fission is that they imagine that neutrons smash into the uranium atom and break it apart, like through kinetic energy or something. That\u0027s not what happens. What happens is that the isotope uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and becomes the isotope uranium-236, which then immediately decays through fission, releasing fission fragments, fast neutrons, and a whole ton of gamma rays. Which is why it is easier to sustain a fission reaction with a population of low energy (thermal) neutrons than it is to sustain it with a population of high energy (fast) neutrons. Because it is easier for uranium-235 to absorb a low energy neutron than a high energy neutron. Which is counter-intuitive to the popular image of nuclear fission.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe split atom (or fission fragments) are not what sustains the chain reaction. That\u0027s the released neutrons. Each nuclear fission reaction releases (on average) 2.85 high energy, or fast, neutrons. But, as I said above, uranium-235 doesn\u0027t like to absorb fast neutrons. It can, but the chances of the reaction happening are much smaller. You need a much higher density of uranium-235 to sustain such a reaction, which would require you to enrich your uranium to a much higher ratio of uranium-235 to uranium-238, thus weapon-grade uranium. This is the principle difference between a nuclear reactor and a nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapons create an environment in which the fissile material can maintain a chain reaction based solely on the population of fast neutrons (a condition known as \u0022prompt criticality\u0022). Nuclear reactors are specifically designed so they cannot achieve prompt criticality, they cannot sustain a chain reaction with fast neutrons. They require the neutrons to have their energy levels reduced, or \u0022thermalized\u0022 in order to produce enough fission reactions in their concentration of uranium-235 to sustain a chain reaction. Which is why reactors have moderators. In light water reactors, the moderator is water. In graphite-moderated reactors the moderator is graphite. The moderator is a substance which is introduced around the nuclear fuel which reduces the energy levels of the fast neutrons through collisions, producing a population of thermalized neutrons which then sustains the chain reaction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, the math and physics behind it isn\u0027t that complicated. I learned what I know in six months at Naval Nuclear Power School. I couldn\u0027t design a reactor, but I understand how they function, and how they malfunction. And I\u0027m not a genius. I\u0027m above average. I was tested back in grade school and my IQ was 130, which is above average, but not genius. And, trust me, a large fraction of the guys who graduated NNPS were not above average. I know, I had to train them when they got to the fleet. You don\u0027t have to be a genius to understand nuclear physics. It\u0027s not magic or super-science.
