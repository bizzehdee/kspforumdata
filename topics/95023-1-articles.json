But in order for this to work, I\u0027d think we\u0027d need to have a unique naming system. My suggestion would be that each probe core/capsule/cockpit \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Ebe assigned a unique, irrevocable, un-reassignable name. The rename option would not be available once a name has been assigned.
