You can do a couple things, but I would suggest taking out one of the inside orange tanks. if you want to make up for that lost delta v, toss in an extra non-orange tank on the first and second stages to increase that overall initial thrust duration.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ENext, you are probably turning down too suddenly. I do not know mechjeb (and I suggest playing without it. I imagine it is nice when you know all about the game and want to get lazy, but it fails to teach you how to play it better. Trial and error will help you with these analyses) but it sounds too me like you do not have enough vertical velocity OR you have too much vertical velocity and you are burning out those asparagus too early, forcing a climb at an altitude under 60k with the single, internal, 3rd stage mainsail. This is not always a problem, but when your rocket is hugely tall and your Thrust to Weight ratio is very low, it causes issues. Mainsail is buff, yes, but two orange tanks in dense atmosphere is rough, especially with a large final stage sitting atop.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAs you launch, immediately, and VERY DELICATELY, aim the rocket a degree or two East. From there on, let gravity turn you and use about half throttle. The idea behind the best, most stable climb to orbit is not speed (although you need it to qualify the climb since too slow a climb destroys any chance of horizontal acceleration a minute into your climb to orbit) but instead \u003C/span\u003Eburn time. (as for speed; what I mean is that a low speed reduces the usefulness of your overall deltav, while a high speed can do the same. If you are going fast at low altitude, even near horizontally in preparation for orbit, you lost a lot of potential delta v because you fight atmosphere. On the other hand, if you go too slow and lose your asparagus without burning any horizontal, sure you got into space, but now you have to burn 2000\u002B delta v horizontally to get an orbit in a short window with a single engine because once you are at the peak of your climb, it becomes harder and harder to stay out of the atmosphere with a low horizontal velocity). But careful; this means your gravity turn will be more aggressive. You do not necessarily need to aim into your prograde the entire time. Back off a bit and aim more vertically if it is too aggressive. 45 deg is ideal at 35-45k altitude, for example. This slow, natural turn prevents the bend you are seeing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, if you have to have a long rocket, use struts. Make the entire thing as solid as you can throughout.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry too much about having to do a few tries to get a good launch. No rocket builder get it right the first time (except for North Korea - at least they say so) use a mod like mechjeb or KER which can help you calculate twr and dv while you build your rockets. Test test test and practice practice practice to know ow what sort of values you\u0027ll need to do a nice smooth gravity turn on launch. Moderate twr, enough dv and quick but small true to the east is my recipe. Then just fly the prograde and level off at 50 60 km up, and accelerate to orbit fully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
