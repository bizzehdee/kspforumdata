They were receiving thrust measurement reactions on a scale far too quickly to achieve via thermal effects given the low power ratings of the equipment.

It is one of the noted differences between the NASA paper, the Chinese paper, and the information that Feta has put out. The NASA test was done at very lower power compared with what the others were tossing around. Of course, the lower power likely resulted from the availability of cheap equipment for what was judged to be a small scale test. The rating/calibration process for that sensor is not in any particular doubt, so they could use the same sensor but pump up the power to theoretically get a greater thrust effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T17:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENobody claimed that \u0022because we don\u0027t understand how the machine works, science is brocken\u0022.
