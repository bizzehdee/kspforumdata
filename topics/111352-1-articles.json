Not sure it it was using a plugin to make the spawn algorigthm configurable or whether that is a function of the stock game. In the case of the latter, adding some stuff to the spawn .cfg does it. In the case of the former, the plugin will need to be updated to 1.0.x and I doubt it will be as simple as a recompile.\n\nEDIT: [I found it.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76402-Plugin-WIP-0-23-5-Custom-Asteroids-0-2-1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T01:55:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That picture just made me 5000% more hyped to visit Dres ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nHype level increased to:\n\n.1 percent\n\nYeah...
