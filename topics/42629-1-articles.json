It would be nice if we could have the option to reinforce the joins between parts without adding additional parts, perhaps at the cost of mass. I envision a system whereby you simply activate some sort of connection mode and click two or more connected parts, then have a slider to reinforce the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several mods that do this. At the end of the day, the whole purpose of struts is to reinforce parts for flight. Kinda the whole point I think. There are several other threads that talk about game optimization. KSP is still in Beta and I\u0027m sure the devs will address the \u0022high part count = lagg\u0022 problem. On the other side, I think there is a challenge for whom can get the most parts into an orbit without crashing the game!

Frequently enough to shake it apart with the current physics. While it would be one thing if realistic stress testing were a part of rocket design, it isn\u0027t, at least not yet. Designs falling apart on take off is just an annoyance that you can only control for only through trail and error. There is no way to crunch the numbers or predict the phenomenon with any degree of accuracy. And so, we spam dem struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I totally agree. A mass cost is a fine idea if you feel a need to balance it, but if we\u0027re all spamming struts anyway, I don\u0027t see why we can\u0027t just make the darn things hold together better by default.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem is that the real world \u0022cost\u0022 of a strut is much less than the cost of a substantial part, but the in-game \u0022cost\u0022 is the same AT THE MOMENT in sandbox mode where dollar price is irrelevant. What do I mean? Well, at the moment the cost is purely in framereate. And if your \u0022currency\u0022 is FPS, then a strut is just as costly as an engine or a fuel tank, and that feels somehow unfair because it makes an enormous wobbly thing cheaper than a tiny stiff thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
