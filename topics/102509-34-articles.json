I did use MechJeb\u0027s rover autopilot. Most of the stuff I didn\u0027t need, but **stability control** was a godsend. It automatically synchronised the rover\u0027s orientation with the surface of Minmus, which, when combined with the huge amount of reaction torque I had, led to a much more stable driving experience. I recorded the entire thing with PersistentTrails, but there are a couple of spots where it glitched and stopped recording. The biggest one is across a small valley and is about 5 km, sorry about that.
