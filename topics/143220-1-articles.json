I presume it\u0027s technically feasible since Alternate Resource Panel does a great job of this in-flight, but I can\u0027t find any mods that offer it in the editor. Mainly I just want to be able to tell at a glance how long my fuel cells would last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anything like this exist? Is anyone working on one? Is there any technical reason why this is tricky to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAppreciate any info!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
