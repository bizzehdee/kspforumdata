Additional tanks are attached to the main tank and the wings to the side tanks. The MK1 version is very stable, can roll, loop and so on. The MK3 version explodes as soon as I pitch over 20-25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 no matter how gentle I try, SAS or no SAS, with or without payload. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rapiers are too weak in low speeds which is why I take off with the help of the rocket engines resulting in a much higher TWR at launch (1.5), that\u0026#39;s the major difference from the MK1 version. In both planes I\u0026#39;ve shifted with the offset feature the side tanks a little bit into the main tank which makes them very stable, no wobbling of any parts. I wonder though if the forces in a 200t plane are just too strong or the MK3 parts are too weak for their own weight. Or does anyone see something wrong in my design that\u0026#39;s causing it to explode?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExplodes when pitched over 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/644374753331496973/48D68FA7D4402D658817B9AF008AF73C70B41C04/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/644374753331497551/51CFF8E7F757FAE93693C55A88F3C69D2F15E137/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis one works perfectly and is very stable, build after the same principle, only smaller:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/644374753331513616/DF7DACAB5E625BB8B225034957A6874EC2658791/[/IMG]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T20:09:54Z","Content":"\nPress F3 to see the exact cause.

I had a closer look and found indeed an error, one of the side tanks wasn\u0026#39;t properly attached. I fixed that but the plane still explodes as soon as I pitch with the same F3 log.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@Venus: of course, this is the next generation self-fueling space shuttle NASA never dreamed of building :D As long as I don\u0026#39;t pitch over 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 the plane is very stable and given the rocket power (lift off V~150m/s) I should be able to pitch well over 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 soon after liftoff and climb to 10k as fast as possible, if it wouldn\u0026#39;t break apart this would be the plan anyways.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCould it be that MK3 parts are just not made to be attached to eachother sideways so to speak?\n"}]}
