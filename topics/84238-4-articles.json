Apparently there\u0027s a bug with the ailerons in the game, where they have to be inserted in unity in a weird orientation for the symmetry to work correctly. Maybe the devs are working on it, trying to fix the issue instead of just circumventing it, and what we saw was result of a work in progress.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what they are seeing is the different shaped aielerons that SP\u002B has. Unlike stock, SP\u002B has 4 airlerons that fit together to form a shape and the linked picture is using them incorrectly (which in KSP, you really can\u0027t be \u0022incorrect\u0022, but lack of a better term).
