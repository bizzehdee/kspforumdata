I believe I\u0027m comfortably capable of designing the landers for the moons, but I\u0027m not sure about the mothership, and the overall mission flight path. Several possibilities came to my mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - Park the mothership outside of Tylo orbit, and add transfer stages to the landers, which then continue to their destinations and come back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - Start with the mothership in a high orbit, visit the outer moons, then move it to low orbit and visit the inner ones (possibly inner first and then move to higher orbit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - Design the mothership so it can transfer from moon to moon and the landers go only to surface and back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - Park the mothership into an eliptical orbit with Pe around Laythe and Ap around Pol (which could be tricky because the moons could mess with my orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent plenty of satelites and even a few crewed missions to the Joolian system, but only to visit a moon or two, so I never attempted anything this large.

Then, at Pe jettison the lander and land it on Tylo. After that, fly an ascent stage to Rendezvous with the Mothership now in Jool orbit. You could also park in Orbit around Tylo, and make that your \u0022base of operations\u0022 .

I could just get i to low fly-by, detach the lander a few hours prior to the periapsis, and go ahead for landng. Then I\u0027ll do the flag-planting and science on the surface, and take off to meet the ship when it closes in.\u00A0Do you think it\u0027s a viable option, or the savings of\u00A0delta-v aren\u0027t worth the nerve-wrecking manouvers and possibility to be forever stranded far away from home?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not certain I understand your idea here. \u00A0If my interpretation is correct, then it won\u0027t work very well. \u00A0Your mothership and lander will both fall towards your target body. \u00A0Being at the same height for the entire fall, they each will gain the same amount of speed and will arrive at the same time.\u00A0 The mothership will then begin its escape; the lander\u00A0needs to slow down to approach, land, take off again, rendezvous, and match velocities with the mothership. \u00A0By this time, the mothership is gone. \u00A0If you undock a few hours out from Pe, you can gain some time by burning to increase speed, but that is countered by needing to burn again to shed that speed once you reach your target. \u00A0Total time saved will be measured in minutes, at best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, it is possible to do something like what you want. \u00A0The idea is essentially an exaggeration of orbital error: \u00A0if you launch two ships from Kerbin to Jool within five\u00A0minutes of one another, their arrival times can be days apart. \u00A0A miniscule amount of that has to do with optimising the transfer window, but the bulk of it has to do with error in the burn. \u00A0Miscalculate your direction by an arcsecond, or hit the MECO button a tenth of a second off,\u00A0and you might not even get the encounter; hence mid-course corrections on most interplanetary transfers. \u00A0It can be very sensitive; for an example, launch one ship to Jool and after the burn and\u00A0decouple something from it at near-zero force. \u00A0The .01 metres per second\u00A0of drift isn\u0027t much but it adds up to a lot of metres over the roughly twenty-five\u00A0million seconds it takes to get to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProvided you undock your lander and give it the push it needs to be sure it arrives first, you can certainly pull this off if you give yourself enough time for the error to build up. \u00A0The point of entering a moon\u0027s SoI is not enough time. \u00A0On the other hand, I\u0027m not certain whether you\u0027re doing this for the official Jool-5\u00A0challenge; if so, be sure that sending what amounts to a flotilla is not against the rules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michal.don","CreatedById":150623,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T07:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222630766\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141741\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465930104\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zhetaan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Zhetaan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0If my interpretation is correct, then it won\u0027t work very well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you got my idea.

Lander one was a spaceplane to visit Laythe. The second had two stages: Tylo descent and Tylo ascent. The ascent stage was then used to land on all the other moons. For Pol and Bop, the lander was short-fueled (Tylo ascent is about 2750m/s, Vall is about 2400m/s in total, the others you only need 600m/s each) so that the tug used less fuel moving them about.
