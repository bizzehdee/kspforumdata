In FAR the only real difference between Flaps and Spoilers is that Flaps have incremental deployment and Spoilers are all or nothing. Because KSP is a building game, it relies on you to place them correctly (flaps are on the trailing edge of the wing, spoilers should be placed forward enough to remove the part of the wing from the airflow when deployed). For airbrakes, the main thing is you want to ensure they are balanced to not create lift or stall (or create both lift and stall at the same time negating each other).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T01:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs everyone else has said before, but also...you don\u0027t actually need airbrakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowing down in FAR is not that hard; sure, you can glide halfway around the planet if you\u0027re at 20,000m, but if you drop down below 5,000m you\u0027ll start to bleed off speed quite rapidly.
