And flaps wont help you slow down, flaps just help keep the wing from stalling at a low speed. \n\nEDIT- As for your action group setting, you have to set them up to raise on one action group and to lower on another action group. They start in full deployment. \n\nWhat you need are spoilers or air brakes. \n\nIn your FAR control surface editor in the SPH choose the option for spoiler and increase the deflection angle of those spoilers to around 60-80deg, this will cause them to act as big air brakes slowing the craft down. \n\nYou can see the airbrakes in this picture here.\n\n![D80cacD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D80cacD.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T19:28:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:43:25Z","Content":"What Hodo said, except they start at HALF deployment or position 2 if you right click in flight, which is ideal for takeoff. Position 0 for level flight. Position 1 is for climb. Position 3 is for landing. They do move slowly, so it doesn\u0027t appear right away like anything is happening.\n\nFlaps will slow you a little, but not very much. Spoilers too will slow you down a little but they are really designed to dump lift. Air brakes apply resitance on equal sides of the plane, so they slow you down without altering lift. \n\nIt\u0027s hard to tell, but Hodo\u0027s picture seems to be using them as spoilers, which will dump lift. Many real-world air brakes are placed in symmetry [on the vertical stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_%28aeronautics%29#/media/File:STS-116_landing_port_behind.jpg) or [as part of the tail assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_%28aeronautics%29#/media/File:Eurowings_bae146-300_d-aewb_arp.jpg) to slow the plane without dumping lift. This includes NASA\u0027s space shuttle. You can[use them on the wings too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_%28aeronautics%29#/media/File:Airbrakes_on_Capstan.jpg), but you have to apply equal drag to top and bottom, and that gets tricky. If you apply them only to the top, as it appears in Hodo\u0027s pic (I think, hard to tell) then you will be [making a spoiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_%28aeronautics%29#/media/File:DSCF0645.JPG), not an air brake.\n\nIn FAR you can make air brakes using two spoilers placed out of symmetry and have one deflect positive with the other deflecting negative.\n\nHere you can see air brakes on the vertical stabilizer made using FAR spoilers. Keep in mind, they probably should be closer to the Center of Mass than this. Up high like that may cause them to pull the nose up (which in this case was desired).\n\n![798A747B4A348DFB9ED86575F5617D2F5D0459EB](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39738595551173810/798A747B4A348DFB9ED86575F5617D2F5D0459EB/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T21:01:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:28:38Z","Content":"Thats right they do start in position 2, it has been awhile since I bothered looking.\n\nBut air brakes can be placed on any part of the aircraft.

One key will advance between each state \u0026 one revert to a previous state, and they take time. If they\u0027re set up with 15 degrees maximum deflection you\u0027ll hardly notice them moving.\n\nFAR is nowhere near frictionless, I\u0027m not quite sure how you expect aircraft to stay in the air ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T01:14:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To get any decent retardation out of FAR surfaces you really need to stall them.

In FAR the only real difference between Flaps and Spoilers is that Flaps have incremental deployment and Spoilers are all or nothing. Because KSP is a building game, it relies on you to place them correctly (flaps are on the trailing edge of the wing, spoilers should be placed forward enough to remove the part of the wing from the airflow when deployed). For airbrakes, the main thing is you want to ensure they are balanced to not create lift or stall (or create both lift and stall at the same time negating each other)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T01:25:19Z","Content":"As everyone else has said before, but also...you don\u0027t actually need airbrakes.\n\nSlowing down in FAR is not that hard; sure, you can glide halfway around the planet if you\u0027re at 20,000m, but if you drop down below 5,000m you\u0027ll start to bleed off speed quite rapidly. Throw in a couple of S-turns and it\u0027s not at all difficult to drop from Mach 2 to landing speed just in the time it takes to reach the runway from the mountains west of KSC.\n\nIf you have a look at this vid from the 35 minute mark to the end, you\u0027ll see some slowing techniques both with and without the use of airbrakes.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5d7f3YB99TE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T01:54:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T03:51:00Z","Content":"As this is specifically about how to use a particular mod, the thread has been moved to Add-on Affairs."}]}
