That\u0027s a Nehalem based product from 2009. It\u0027s from before Intel even started using the \u0022core i\u0022 moniker for its mainstream CPUs, meaning it is a solid thirteen generations outdated at this point. You are not merely below the minimum spec with this, you are deep in \u0022I\u0027m amazed the game actually launched\u0022 territory. You\u0027re lucky the devs aren\u0027t targeting any advanced CPU instruction sets (yet). They could well do that, at some point, when they start optimizing in earnest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no CPU upgrades for that platform that are worth it anymore. Play with this system as long as you are happy with it (or at least, can bear it), and then, do a completely new build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, video card. That\u0027s the thing you can swap. The platform is going to be a bottleneck, so you don\u0027t need to buy anything fancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe important part is 8 GB VRAM. KSP wants tons of VRAM, and 8 GB is what I\u0027d call the minimum for 1080p. The Nvidia 3050 offers this, and is about twice the performance of your current card. There\u0027s also the Radeon 6600 XT or 6650 XT (depending on which happens to be cheaper at the time), which would ordinarily be my recommendation since they often cost only barely more than a 3050 yet yield 40%-50% more FPS than it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m going to tell you to not take either. Both of them have a half bandwidth PCIe interface to save costs. This isn\u0027t an issue on modern mainboards which run PCIe 4.0 or 5.0. Your mainboard, however, is running PCIe 2.0. Even at full bandwidth that\u0027ll slightly throttle data throughput to modern GPUs. Halve it, and a VRAM-loving title like KSP2 is not going to be happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, look for a used RTX 2060 Super 8GB. Make sure it\u0027s the \u0022Super\u0022 model, and not the regular 2060. That one only has 6GB, which is not enough for KSP at 1080p (trust me, I have a 6GB card, it \u003Cem\u003Edoes not\u003C/em\u003E suffice). Where I live, these cards can be found used for significantly less money than a 3050 costs new, despite being around 33% faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour system is going to be limiting this video card, preventing it from going as fast as it could... but you still won\u0027t get better price/performance out of any other 8GB card, I wager. At least if your area\u0027s used prices are anywhere near what they are over here. I could pick up a used 2060 Super for 170\u20AC from a reputable-looking private seller right now, where a brand-new 3050 starts at 270\u20AC. A steal, if you ask me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you do buy a 2060 Super, look at pictures of the card to find out if it has a single 8-pin PCIe connector. If necessary, message the seller and ask. Some third party OC models would have shipped with an 8-pin plus a 6-pin, and your PSU won\u0027t be supporting that, so you need a model with the default single connector. As it is, your PSU only comes with two 6-pin connectors, but given this is Seagate - a very good brand - I would be surprised if they didn\u0027t include a 2x 6-pin to 1x 8-pin adapter in the box. I hope you still have that box lying around after nearly fourteen years... you\u0027ll need it.

not the game actual. id be somewhat interested in seeing if i could make it crash in game, but since i currently have no budget for a replacement, i dont think id be doing that. i think the psu is working as intended, opting to shut down rather than to destroy itself is good design. some games have had problems with their ui overloading the renderer, i think starcraft 2 had this problem where the ui would render a lot faster than needed for a ui and could result in cooking your hardware. perhaps ksp2 is the new crysis. that game has melted more psus than any
