To expand upon this idea, it would be comparatively simple to rig up a small mod that adds a \u0022carbon nanotubing\u0022 or \u0022cable\u0022 resource that is expensive and requires some absolutely ridiculous amount of science to unlock in the first place, and then to get unlimited rocketparts you would put up a station in the correct orbit, possibly requiring a captured asteroid as a counterweight, upon which you could refill your rocketparts and build/launch whatever ship you please. Although I\u0027m not quite sure how to script this as I\u0027ve never made a serious plugin for KSP, I\u0027m certain I could do everything except the final piece of scripting for bringing rocketparts into orbit through your \u0022elevator.\u0022 Although I\u0027m currently rather busy with college applications, I will definitely start work on this after my apps are due (Nov 1st) if there is any interest in this sort of mod at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAnswerIsIsaacNewton","CreatedById":147772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T18:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the easiest way to implement this would be make the part (probably three actually, small/med/large) simply generate the resource over time, at no cost (or maybe ElectricCharge based on size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part would require the following conditions to activate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAttached to space station with mass of X (varies depending on size of part...large might require a small asteroid to make up sufficient mass) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKeostationary orbit over KSC (check for planet/altitude/lat/long).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPossibly some sort of unsafe/risky/safe display depending on how close to requirements \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPart takes X days to become fully active once activated \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce fully active, part constantly generates whatever resources at rate dependent on size. \u003Cbr\u003EWhen vessel is selected and/or physics is activated, part will check for activation conditions...if part is active and conditions are not met (station has been moved, etc), part explodes.\u003Cbr\u003EWould be nice to have some way to access Astronaut Complex for med/large version, and simple transfer of Kerbals form ground to station.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T19:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess it won\u0027t be very difficult to procedurally spawn a few kilometers of elevator in a needed place when the vessel is close to it.

I could very well see something similar being possible with a \u0022CarbonNano-Tube\u0022 resource (clearly stored in big drums for simplicity). Adding another resource stored in the same big drums for simplicity\u0027s sake called \u0022GroundPower\u0022 for running things like Freight Elevators for receiving and selling resources, and Personnel Elevators for summoning kerbals from the Astronaut Complex. Having an Elevator Control Center could function for both \u0022launching\u0022 the cable, as well as locking the station in perfect k-stat if its within acceptable parameters (similar parameters to what would be acceptable for a contract). This way part-wise the mod would be lightweight, only needing 7 parts (Elevator Control Center, Freight and Personnel Elevator Docks, 2 2.5m CarbonNano-Tube drums, and 2 3.75m CarbonNano-tube drums).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T17:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always figured with a combination of KerbinSide, some custom coding, and the merger of an autopilot and a physics-less craft-mover, one could definitely make something like this possible. One wouldn\u0027t necessarily have to put the launchpad at the end of the elevator, however. The launchpad would actually be on the planet surface at the bottom of the elevator. Upon launching to that pad, however, you would not get the normal initialization into physics because, and this is where the plugin would have to come in, the craft would be \u0022attached\u0022 to the elevator and then, using a slow acceleration/deceleration method, be \u0022moved\u0022 outside of the normal physics system (aka, in a similar manner as BahamutoD has done in his vessel mover mod) vertically along the path of the cable, which itself can be made up of a series of cable sections placed separately using Kerbal Konstructs so that visibility range can be maintained (assuming that range is based on 3D proximity, and not a 2D horizontal proximity in relation to the planetary surface, which I\u0027m unsure of at this moment). Upon reaching the end of the cable, and thus the station at the end, a space for the craft to settle into would need to be available, upon which the craft would sit, in a similar way as EPL vessels are attached when they are finished being built, awaiting launch. The vessel would then be brought into the physics simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow for the elevator to have a cable, of a sort, which could be collided with (a real danger in space elevators) and the craft would have to move, in real time, up the cable. No messing around with instantly moving the entire craft to the launch transform of the pad at such a great height, and no need to mess around with procedural generation of cable lengths that follow the vessel or anything like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative idea to the launch-to-elevator would be for there to be a dedicated craft with a large docking port/grabber, or perhaps an animated static structure with movable colliders, that a craft could be \u0022attached\u0022 to which would then \u0022tow\u0022 the craft up to the top. This would also make it easy to create a return-trip from the top of the elevator to the surface, and make it more visually appealing considering you could make the elevator actually look like it\u0027s attached to the cable in some fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, this would take some time, and a fair bit of coding and combining code snippets from multiple separate mods, to get to the point where a proof of concept could be generated. I don\u0027t see this as impossible though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see the look on someone\u0027s face after launching their rocket in the standard way, only to miscalculate the position of the cable and slice their shiny new rocket in half.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
