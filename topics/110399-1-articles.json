But mission requirements can fix several of these to reduce the dimensionality of the solution space to something more useful.\n\n(A) The first to be fixed is likely the atmospheric density which is characteristic of the landing environment. The density is strictly a function of altitude per body. Every atmosphere of every body is simply density in character there exists an altitude on every body that is representative of an altitude on Kerbin. Provided that altitude is accessible (greater than 0m) one could happily test parachutes for a Duna surface mission on Kerbin at some appropriate altitude. More atmosphere means a slower craft in a linear way I believe with stock.\n\n(G) The second to be fixed again by environment is local gravity to which surface gravity is often a perfectly adequate. Gravity strength is multiplicative with vessel mass to determine weight. More weight means a faster craft, again linear.\n\n(S) The vessel by construction will have some maximum impact speed to safely land. To be the best of my knowledge this is the impact strength of the part which comes into contact with the surface or the strength of the joints which hold together the parts. Landing legs which survive 100 m/s impact are of little use if the forces rip apart the craft. Stronger craft require less parachutes which can save weight but often that robustness is heavy in its own right.\n\n(M) Vessel mass is again due to design. The more massive the craft the faster it will fall.\n\n(P) Drag from parachutes counteracts the falling speed. Each parachute will provide drag proportional to the speed.\n\n-----\n\nAssuming the landing happens at terminal velocity, the relationship is very straightforward. Downward force and upward force are equal. Downward force is mass (M) and gravity (G) and upward force is the atmosphere density (A) times the parachute factor (P) times speed (S)\\*. \\*squared.\n\nM x G = P x S^2 x A\n\nGiven M, G, S, and A are known, P is determined:\n\nP = M x G / S^2 x A\n\nAll it would take is to look up what \u0022P\u0022 values various parachutes are, plugging in some numbers and rounding up as a safety factor. The first step is to calibrate this equation to some meaningful values for known parachute parts and units of M G S and A. Without regard for the pleasantness of the number we might define 1 \u0022P\u0022 parachute factor to maintain a 1 ton mass inside 1 m/s^2 of gravitational acceleration to a terminal velocity of 1 m/s in 1 MT/m^2 of density. I\u0027ve tried to use the most KSP-native units here. I could just as easily defined a 1kg mass under Kerbin\u0027s surface gravity to a terminal velocity of 6m/s at Kerbin\u0027s surface at Kerbin\u0027s surface density. The former is more elegant and general while the latter might be most useful in common cases. Both tables of \u0022P\u0022 values for various parachutes would be the same except for a multiplication constant.\n\n-----\n\nAssuming that pressure is indicative of density (large changes of temperature and molecular composition invalidate this).\n\nSo a 920 kg craft:\n\n under 9.70m/s^2 gravity is going 6.09m/s in an atmosphere of 58.75. (4.1) \n\n under 9.75m/s^2 gravity is going 5.84m/s in an atmosphere of 76.45. (3.44) \n\n under 9.78m/s^2 gravity is going 5.50m/s in an atmosphere of 86.74. (3.43) \n\n under 9.81m/s^2 gravity is going 5.10m/s in an atmosphere of 99.66. (3.48) \n\nThrowing out the first one and averaging the rest I get a \u0022P\u0022 factor for a Mk16 parachute of 3.61. If it pleases you you can multiply this number by 1000 and input the craft mass in kg instead of metric tons and it is equivalent. Alternatively one could express this in atmospheres which would have an effect of moving the decimal nearly 2 places to the right. Doing both moves the decimal 5 places.\n\n-----\n\nA fine theory but does it stand up to experiment? To Duna! Our familiar 920kg craft just as before reentering. What will our speed be? It should be the square root of MG/PA.\n\nM 920 kg\n\nG 2.86 m/s^2\n\nP 3.61\n\nA 11.97 kPa\n\n7.8 m/s! Turns out it was closer to 10.8. Seemed pretty reliable on Kerbin but under reported on Duna. Was my math bad? Certainly possible. It\u0027s also possible the pressure is not a good indicator of density when switching from Kerbin to Duna. As far as I know Duna should be both colder and of a denser molecule compared to Kerbin which should improve parachute performance."},{"CreatedByName":"archnem","CreatedById":135259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:20:38Z","Content":"My rules of thumb for parachutes:\n\nMk1s are good for a ton each.\n\nRadials and drogues are good for 1.5t each.\n\nMk2s are good for 2t each."},{"CreatedByName":"42_aerobrake_passes","CreatedById":114147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:25:27Z","Content":"When using a reentry vehicle that\u0027s dissimilar to what I\u0027ve done before, I usually take just that part of it and put it on top of a SRB that\u0027s been tweaked to have just 2-3 seconds worth of fuel at a high TWR.
