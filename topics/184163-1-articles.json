I re installed ksp and the thing was still there, so I start to mess with the ksp settings, enabled vsync, disabled it, reduced fps limit, increased it, set the ksp to fullscreen and windowed screen, Updated my card drives, restarted the computer, search youtube and internet for an answer, and I decided that after 2 hours trying to fix this, I would just change back to my intel crappy video card, And guess what, the screen tearing dissapeared, So now i have to select 1: Unplayable modded and annoying stock ksp thanks to screen tearing or 2: Unplayable modded ksp thanks to lag, but without the screen tearing, after 1 more hour of messing around, I decided I would make a forum post to see if anyone could help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres what I mean with \u0022some sort of rolling shutter effect on screen\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how it looks with stock, Its not unplayable, but noticeable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7WeXRR58hw?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how it looks with mods, Its unplayable, and impossible to make a film with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3ERG07EiJ0?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-01T18:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you updated your drivers did you select a clean install?Just in case you changed a setting in nvidia panel that might cause this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to unistall the drivers and then download/install the new ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure you select the correct drivers or just use Geforce Experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks like you have the wrong drivers, a weird vsync problem or even a problem with your graphic card(not connected the right way etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe someone else can help more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sol469","CreatedById":195085,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-01T20:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeForce experience doesnt detect my ksp, is that normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso my nvidia control panel says the current drivers are not supported by the app\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-01T21:24:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2019 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Sol469\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-02T02:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout knowing much about your rig, here are a couple things to try (sounds like\u00A0you are on windows):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Go to the .exe or your shortcut and right-click-\u0026gt;Properties.

In that case, some people have found success by rolling back to a previous version. Often people can get away without the newest graphics card driver version if they\u00A0aren\u0027t on the cutting edge of the newest video game releases. (Often video card updates come out to support the release of a brand new video game, and new bugs are introduced for other games.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-02T02:11:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2019 02:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-02T11:01:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing, maybe the HDMI cable needs replacing...uhh probably not but you never know, there are some cases that switching the HDMI cable fixes things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sol469","CreatedById":195085,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-02T22:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoyster, I literally just fixed it by changing the hdmi cable, and now, 3 minutes after I did, I read your reply, So thank you! anyways...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
