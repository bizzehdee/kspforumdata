Here\u0027s what I do. First make your space craft and put an RCS tank on it. Then put 4 symmetrical RCS thrusters over the center of mass of the part of the ship that will be docking. Then launch to an orbit 25 km higher than the target. Make sure that your orbits Apoapsis and Periapsis are close to the same value on both spacecraft. Time accelerate until the spacecraft on the inner orbit is about 1\u0022 behind on the orbit map. Target the target ship. Then create a maneuver node somewhere ahead of your current position and pull the retrograde marker until the periapsis of your orbit crosses the target orbit. Click and hold on the big center circle of the maneuver node to move it around until the closest approach arrows line up at less than 10km( you may need to time accel a bit more to get it to line up. Then when the time comes do your burn and wait till your are at the point of closest approach. Then make sure \u0022target\u0022 is dispaled in the velocity box and burn retrograde or prograde until it reads 0. Next burn towards the target \u0022pink circle with dot\u0022 only going \u0026lt;20ms. Wait till the distance number starts to increase again and burn prograde or retrograde to reduce your relative velocity to 0. Rinse and repeat burning toward the target until you get within 200m, then right click all your engines and deactivate them. Congratulations, you have completed rendezvous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAim your ship in such a way that its orientation lines up with the target docking port. Activate docking mode (it may be helpful to reassign the keys here I use WSAD for sideways and shift/ctrl for prograde/retrograde. Note that it helps to be in chase view too) Use your rcs trhusters to line up closely with the target and approach very slowly (like .01 m/s) Try to get the target marker, the prograde marker, and the aim marker to line up with each other. You may need to momentarily switch back to staging mode to fine tune your alignment. It takes some practice and \u0022for me\u0022 it is a very slow process, but it usually works (unless I forget to turn of the main engines and switch back to staging mode, which can be disastrous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will likely find refinements to improve upon this description as you learn as I probably missed a few things and my numbers may not be optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-15T22:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2013 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by wolfedg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Titler","CreatedById":59827,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T01:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not read the entire thread, so apologies if this has been mentioned, but one thing that may make you \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E you\u0027re bad at docking, but is in fact a flaw with the game as it currently is, is that you can place a docking port and it not actually be valid. When you arrive to dock, if you find that you approach at a slow speed, but the arrival bounces back and needs RCS to keep shoving it back, or it swings off target after contact more than the length of the docking port as a very rough guide, the port isn\u0027t valid. What should happen is that the magnets engage and hold you in place whilst it lines up, and then grabs it\u0027s target... if you\u0027re not being held, drifting wildly off target or backwards... it\u0027s broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to ensure you\u0027ve fitted it correctly is, when building your ship, keep mousing gently over the target spot.

You will have \u0022pulling-your-hair-out\u0022 sessions if you are attempting to dock with a structure thats rotating about a certain axis (or three axes is a nightmare). So it\u0027s important that before you dock, make sure both structures are absolutely killrotted. Then it\u0027s mostly translational controls after that. Another thing where MechJeb comes useful is...if you will initially undock from a stack, then turn around and dock again (a la, LEM docking and extraction maneuver), having to lock or killrot the entire stack first, before undocking/decoupling is a must...so that when you are sepped, all you need to do is press the retrograde button, and voila, your craft will now point to the opposite end, and all you need to do are very small and delicate/precise translational movements--rotational movements should be a non-issue by that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RODION\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerfherde","CreatedById":63692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T18:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI hope it\u0027s by mistake, MJ don\u0027t send me to Eve each time I tell it to dock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongrats anyway...
