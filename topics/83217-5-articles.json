It is sensitive to which side of the no button mouse you click on. Works well but can be a pain when you click near the middle and it decides you clicked right when you want left and vice versa ! The older non-wireless mice may not support this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I posted earlier about 10.10.2 being more stable, which was a bit premature. However I have found that a Google app, Soundflower, the audio component of a screen capture app was very likely a proble. By removing that app and its associated .kext file I haven\u0027t had any kernel panics or crashes for over a week. So if you have that Google app you may want to try removing it if you are having stability issues. YMMV of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsenal19","CreatedById":142381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve a bug since 1.0.
