Make a backup of your current .sfs file. Load the game and queue the commands, let the game run and the maneuver perform. Then, exit to the space center and watch the clock tick over to something like 09:45:00 Day 143 (for example) and hit Esc. Save your game under a new filename. Now bring up the Esc menu again and reload your original game from the backup. Do what you need to do with other missions until you reach 09:45:00 Day 143 and exit to the main menu. Now just copy over the VESSEL structure from the custom save into your normal save. I \u0022time hop\u0022 like this often.
