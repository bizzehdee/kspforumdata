The root part lies in part A. The active control part (\u0027control from here\u0027) is in part B. Now I set up a manouver node and decouple. As expected I stay in control of vessel B, but the manouver node is gone. When I switch to vessel A, the node reappears, so I suppose it sticks to the root part of the starting vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be better to stick the node to the active control part. This seems more logical to me, but more important it also gives the player control over where it ends up (in flight the root part is both unknown and cannot be changed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
