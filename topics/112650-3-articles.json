For example, you could have kerbin, mun, duna, ike, and eve as the smaller kerbol system. Enough for players with career to unlock high tech propulsion for what ever mods to move on, but also keeping the stock system small so we can distribute the remaining planets. Not only will this cut down on the amount of new planets to add (Wich will still be a main focus) and balance the kerbol system to match others (in the number of planets). This could also be done with compatible mods. Ex: If opm was compatible (Im not sure) The gas giants could be distributed around different systems, and its bigger moons acting as dwarf planets.
