The delta-v to the other stars is really high, but still doable. The same with the flight time.\n\nThe navball is spinning strange in interstellar orbit, but I guess this is because of precision problems of KSP itself.\n\nIn a galaxy the stars are on a bit more chaotic trajectories and not so well ordered as in this mod. Perhaps it would be nice if some of the stars would have at least more elliptical orbits. But one should keep the delta-v in mind there.\n\nNice work, fair comprimise of sizes as far as I have seen. I have not reached another system yet (1h on highest time warp left)."},{"CreatedByName":"Artyomka15","CreatedById":130209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:42:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here is a idea, Since the relative velocities between nearby stars are so low IRL meaning you can just aim at the star and burn, to emulate that in ksp you should reduce the black holes gravity to a very small fraction.\n\nIf I reduce black hole\u0027s gravity, black hole will be not realistic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T18:28:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Artyomka15**"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T20:54:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I reduce black hole\u0027s gravity, black hole will be not realistic.\n\nIn intergalactic space as long as the mass is higher than the orbiting stars you can have it lower too.

For example, you could have kerbin, mun, duna, ike, and eve as the smaller kerbol system. Enough for players with career to unlock high tech propulsion for what ever mods to move on, but also keeping the stock system small so we can distribute the remaining planets. Not only will this cut down on the amount of new planets to add (Wich will still be a main focus) and balance the kerbol system to match others (in the number of planets). This could also be done with compatible mods. Ex: If opm was compatible (Im not sure) The gas giants could be distributed around different systems, and its bigger moons acting as dwarf planets. That\u0027s my 2 cents, and this mod is looking great! Good luck on development!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister_GinGin","CreatedById":146677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T11:55:12Z","Content":"Works with patch 1.0.4???"},{"CreatedByName":"Artyomka15","CreatedById":130209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T13:26:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Works with patch 1.0.4???\n\nYes.
