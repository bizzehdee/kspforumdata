About 2 weeks or so. I played it and nothing was wrong. Today when I tried to play it it launched and took me to the main menu just fine. It then told me that my save file was locked when I tried to start a new sandbox game. I tried to close it and reload the game but then it gave me an error that I do not even have permission to launch the game. So I then uninstalled the game and launched steam as administrator just in case. I then reinstalled the game and I still have the problem. I uninstalled the local content through steam but the files are still in my directory and I can not even open then without it telling me that access is denied and can only be accessed by an administrator. I am the only person who uses this computer and I am the administrator, and it even specifies me. Hell, I just got this laptop for Christmas so i am not sure why I would be having an problem like this. Hell ive never had a problem where I could not get in and root out files of an unwanted program. If someone could help me figure out what to do here that would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"glibbo","CreatedById":73642,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T12:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, I have limited experience with this but, have you tried to see or change permissions in the properties / security tab? if you don\u0027t get any joy there, there is a registry hack you can download and run, it places a take ownership item in your context menu (right click), which then gives you full permissions, maybe worth a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLINK\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndownload is at bottom of page, hope it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jammer-TD","CreatedById":173970,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T17:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might not suggest a hack without knowing the OS involved(obviously administrator=windows) in most cases \u0022takeown\u0022 is a comandline/powershell or a right click in the advanced explorer area for change owner of the root most folder involded()uninherit obects as well. again pending the OS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalternately you can change the location and map it thru steam for a new library\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJammer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T18:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222921069\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154971\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484377590\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022173738\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Denzophage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E1\u200E/\u200E14\u200E/\u200E2017 at 1:06 AM, Denzophage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI uninstalled the local content through steam but the files are still in my directory and I can not even open then without it telling me that access is denied and can only be accessed by an administrator\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a Steam user too.
