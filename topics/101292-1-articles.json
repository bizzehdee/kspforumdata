And it gave me only release threads of mods... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I\u0027d like to ask a serious question as I stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking in 3ds Max. I created a solarsail and I like to use 2 material on one model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsualy I go with multi-subobject material after unwrapping it correctly the renders working out to be nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAS soon as I load it into unity the materialID 2 seems to lost it\u0027s UVW maps. (which maps were correctly setup in max)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat should I do? separate one model into pieces? and use that way two simple material? Or other workarounds?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the answer is the first one do I have to cap each the models? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis model is basicly an (open) umrella shaped 2m long 1m with base and a 26m wide solarpanel around it\u0027s base\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to make a inline useable solarsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ematid 1 is currently the wide part and it is mapped planar and scaled 4 times up to a full 1024x1024 picture of a solarpanel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ematid 2 is the base part and reusing my old packed style texture (basicly that is just a cylinder with 24 sides and endcaps). so there is no way I can combine these two textures in it\u0027s current form because of the tileablility of the solarpanel\u0027s texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny IDEA how this should be done right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t using animations yet. Just a static mesh with a collider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.
