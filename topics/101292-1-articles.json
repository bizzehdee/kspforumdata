And it gave me only release threads of mods... \n\nAnyway I\u0027d like to ask a serious question as I stuck.\n\nWorking in 3ds Max. I created a solarsail and I like to use 2 material on one model.\n\nUsualy I go with multi-subobject material after unwrapping it correctly the renders working out to be nice. \n\nAS soon as I load it into unity the materialID 2 seems to lost it\u0027s UVW maps. (which maps were correctly setup in max)\n\nWhat should I do? separate one model into pieces? and use that way two simple material? Or other workarounds?\n\nIf the answer is the first one do I have to cap each the models? \n\nThis model is basicly an (open) umrella shaped 2m long 1m with base and a 26m wide solarpanel around it\u0027s base\n\nI try to make a inline useable solarsail.\n\nmatid 1 is currently the wide part and it is mapped planar and scaled 4 times up to a full 1024x1024 picture of a solarpanel. \n\nmatid 2 is the base part and reusing my old packed style texture (basicly that is just a cylinder with 24 sides and endcaps). so there is no way I can combine these two textures in it\u0027s current form because of the tileablility of the solarpanel\u0027s texture.\n\nAny IDEA how this should be done right? \n\nThis doesn\u0027t using animations yet. Just a static mesh with a collider.\n\nThank you in advance. Any kind of help appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T15:37:04Z","Content":"Your only option there is to split it into separate meshes, I\u0027m afraid.
