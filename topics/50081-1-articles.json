I wanted to build my first small rocked to get some science data. But I got no automated probe and I got no decoupler. So the only thing I can build right now are kamikaze rockets? I need to put a kerbal in it, but I cant decouple the parts, so the rocket is always going to explode when it ties to land. Did I just missed something, or is this a bug? Or do I really need to kill some kerbals to get the needed tech to build decouplers for my pods to land secure again? Somehow I just dont like to kill my kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut somehow I just think I\u0027m missing something. decouplers really should be a first technology, or at last automated probes before you send people out with a rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T19:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice: Start small.

Even without probes and decouplers, it\u0027s perfectly possible to build a rocket that\u0027s safe to use. Take crew and EVA reports close to the peak of your trajectory, then another EVA report and a surface sample after you land to get yourself a nice bit of science right at the start.
