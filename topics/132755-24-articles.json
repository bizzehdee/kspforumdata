Hunt\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Yeah I noticed that there were a lot of bugs in 1.2. I don\u0027t know what they\u0027ve done, but I thought they just added communications. Apparently they did something to the physics. I remember the Super25 being extremely unstable, wobbling all over the place. I had to cheat it into orbit, and it was still buggy there. I\u0027m staying in 1.1.3 until there can be an update. Besides, if I want a communications system I can just use remote tech for the time being. I would like for there to be a patch released. I get that the new EX is going to take a while, but a physics \u002B comms patch shouldn\u0027t be\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Etoo\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again I only have an elementary understanding of modding.

It\u0027s a great mod. The fact that it creates space shuttles with a lot of interesting and very nice looking components is beautiful. It\u0027s just that it doesn\u0027t have the same feel as it did back in the old days. Since the shuttle is still built for the old atmosphere of 0.90 and previous versions, the engines and SRBs are overpowered in the non-soupy atmosphere of today. What was capable of 120km orbits at the absolute limit back then (without extensions or refueling, such as the auxiliary fuel supply in the mod) today is capable of maybe 300km or even more. (IDK for sure, I haven\u0027t tested it myself)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s still an excellent addition to the game, overpowered boosters or not.
