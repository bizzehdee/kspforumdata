He was the first of us to reach the moon (and some tries later to land successfully and relaunch from there), i was the first to have a station in kerbal orbit (with kerbals onboard and the ability to refuel). Until now i successfully reached duna with a manned mission, and a second to pick up the astronaut from the first landing (since his rocket got damaged \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). I have a litte refuling station around the moon, and i got science probes to eve and laythe with science modules and relay satellites in orbit. I think we achieved quite something, but there are of course still plans for more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe were both playing without mods for long, but now we are sometimes using novapunch, mechjeb and KAS. All of the things mentioned above were reached without mods, i wont use mechjeb for a task i haven\u0027t done manually before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture plans are a second refuel base around kerbin (with more fuel than for 2 orange XL tanks) in a higher orbit, and manned bases on several planets and moons. Of course we are also looking forward to career and multiplayer - if it will ever come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far for now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarkus\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T21:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love to have someone to compete in KSP from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T23:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
