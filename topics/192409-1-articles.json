Especially the terrain on Kerbin was so awful thaat I just instantly quit. Some of them looked worse than the Vanilla game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve installed all of them via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, trying out their different configurations on different versions of KSP, but there\u0027s just not been a single mod that really convinced me. I\u0027m currently on KSP 1.9.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I doing something wrong? Are there any better mods that I don\u0027t know of? Do I need special configurations for those mods to work properly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really hope somebody can help me with this, I\u0027ve seen KSP look better in some YouTube videos and just can\u0027t achieve that level of visual realism it seems \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-14T21:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost if not all of the ones you\u2019ve listed are not yet compatible with 1.9.
