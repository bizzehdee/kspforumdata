But then in addition you also doubled the mass of the tanks (which you have to do to hold the fuel) and engines (which you didn\u0027t have to do). Plus throw in the random equipment to connect them together/ etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You haven\u0027t improved your mass ratio at all. In fact, you made it worse, so DV goes down. Your acceleration did improve, but that\u0027s not what you were after. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you were to try it again with just an additional fuel tank, you would see an improvement in DV. Not a doubling, but an improvement. If you were to fire the attached rocket by itself and then discard it when empty, you would also see an improvement. Again, not a doubling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And no, not a dumb question. You have to ask questions like this to get a handle on how the rocket equation works.

If I weld a second truck with an identical load and fuel to its side, it\u0027s not going to be able to go 400 miles. Instead it will move 200 miles with twice as much load as the original.
