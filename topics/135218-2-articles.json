But they\u0027re still there. \u00A0Contracts at this stage and beyond give me ideas for the order I do things in. \u00A0And sometimes mission plans I enjoy are derrived from combinations of contracts... maybe not in the way they were intended. \u00A0I.e. a rocket that fulfills contracts for both a space station orbiting Minmus, then another orbiting the Mun, carrying\u00A0tourists who wanted to visit both. \u00A0After I\u0027ve developed a rocket and an orbital vehicle that can do this, I start using that craft for other things too. \u00A0Oh look, an explore Ike contract! \u00A0I know where my first interplanetary mission will be going now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLategame: After nukes, science labs, rover wheels, and high thrust engines, ISRU, and gigantors\u00A0are unlocked, the possibilites are so wide open that most of my interplanetary mission concepts come from contracts.\u00A0 The rest is mopping up the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEndgame: Tech tree finished. \u00A0Otherwise, same as above. \u00A0It\u0027s a sandbox with contracts for mission ideas, and also I have science archives to show me places I\u0027ve never been before. \u00A0\u00A0I feel a certain acomplishment having worked my way to the top. \u00A0Maybe that feeling of accomplishment will go away someday, because I\u0027m still a relatively newer player. \u00A0Or maybe it won\u0027t. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s just how I play. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T21:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222479671\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459285374\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022136468\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randazzo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, Randazzo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic difference in my perception is that Career mode feels like better tools are being earned, versus Sandbox where everything is just handed to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see no difference, really, since skill and satisfaction is the real payout to me. \u00A0For instance, if someone makes an early Delta \u0022replica\u0022 and uses it to put\u00A0a satellite into polar orbit from Vandenberg, I\u0027d be just as impressed with it being done in Sandbox vs. Career; there is literally no difference in the hardware if you\u0027re talking \u0022replicas\u0022. \u00A0Same goes with a Saturn V landing to the Moon. \u00A0The only difference might be the amount of work that went into getting to the point of doing those things in the individual save game\u00A0but then, each task requires the same skills of the players\u00A0so I can assume that the players have \u0022put in their time\u0022 anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I just don\u0027t care about save game length? \u00A0I\u0027ve spun up and thrown away so many over the years...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, Randazzo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s some psychological stuff there, I\u0027m sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost definitely. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like having the game impose limitations, because the one thing that I find the most fun and rewarding of all is to figure out clever/exploitive ways to get around the limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing I like about contracts is having all those marooned kerbals and parts appear in wacky orbits that I have to go dock with.
