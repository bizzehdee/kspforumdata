Take Ubisoft\u0027s Assassins Creed series for example, as soon as multiplayer got added, started to get attention, started to get better and more entertaining, single player suffered and got worse reviews then the previous single player title. Then it went the other way, the new Black Flag game has got some awesome reviews for its single player aspects but the multiplayer only got some relatively minor editions and bug fixes from the previous title. If a game company were to keep the staff they have working on SP and add \u003Cem\u003Enew \u003C/em\u003Estaff to work on MP then this problem could probably be averted, but possibly too expensive, hence the reason it\u0027s not been done.

Here are my thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the fears of the archetypal griefing 12 year old are grossly overstated. With a game like KSP, it\u0027s very likely that multi-player will involve a small number of people playing together. Think old-school LAN gaming. I seriously doubt that we\u0027re going to see 100, 200, 500 player servers. Maybe if we all had quantum computers and ran on 512-bit hardware, lol. So then, what is more likely is small groups of people, something like 5-10, playing together on privately run servers. I very much doubt that Squad is going to roll out with a bunch of public servers. The infrastructure to manage that is way beyond their scope. That also rules out the MMO fears. Also brings me to multi-player does not mean MMO by any stretch of the imagination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally feel that Squad should continue to develop stuff to do in single-player first. Give people stuff to do other than exploring and setting up interplanetary gas stations. Once there is a healthy amount of stuff to actually do in the game, expand that to let you do all this neat stuff with your friends. If they roll out with multi-player first, I fear the novelty of being able to build a space station with your friends will quickly wear off when that space station doesn\u0027t have any other purpose other than looking awesome or refueling exploration missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, look at a stock install and another install with just Kethane installed. With Kethane you immediately gain so many extra things to do and decisions to make. Do you have one ship that does everything? Or do you split the process up into miners, freighters, processors, or storage? Where do you mine? And so on. There is such a large gain in depth from just one resource that just focuses on fuel. You still are essentially setting up gas stations, but instead of just shipping fuel from Kerbin, you are now involved in the location, acquisition, processing, and shipment of the fuel. All of which requires more thinking, more challenge, more time spent playing KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd in resources and resource utilization. Finish putting biomes on all the planets. Finish the basic mechanics like life support and re-entry heat. Then once people have a ton of stuff to do off-world, let them do that stuff with their friends. I feel that would be the best roadmap for the next several steps in development. I absolutely DO want multi-player, I just do not want it to come at the expense of a half-finished single player game. I do think that now that they have decided to implement multi-player that all further single player development should be done with an eye towards that goal. Perhaps even begin to place the code infrastructure into place similar to how people were talking about finding testium or whatever it was in the .21 resource definitions .cfg file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I do trust Squad to do what they think is best for KSP. They\u0027ve done a good job so far in my book. In addition, it\u0027s their game and their vision that they\u0027ll be implementing. All we can all do is wait and see what they decide to do. If they continue their daily dev post things, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll have a better picture as to what direction they are going to take sometime here in the next month or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metal_jacke1","CreatedById":111701,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T02:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts now May 2014.... still no Multiplayer? *facepalm*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T07:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, Metal_jacke1.
