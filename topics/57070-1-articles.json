But as far as those go, it really depends how big the KSP universe is going to be. Getting to Eeloo from Kerbin does seem to be the biggest challenge for kerbaled missions. When you think about taking kerbals out beyond to further planets and even further, I am thinking assembling a craft in orbit or on the Mun is the next logical step. Small as it is, Kerbin has one heck of a gravity well(something I have yet to see ksptv-er\u0027s and youtubers take advantage of in their interplanetary missions, btw), and unless everyone wants to play like Whackjob, which not everyone does, then there should be more to offer in assembling ships in orbit. Like the description for Kerbin says, \u0027Once you reach orbit, you are halfway there.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T01:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merinsan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Merinsan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI expect we will get a very limited repair ability, ie ability to replace broken solar panels.
