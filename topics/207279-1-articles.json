I would like to explore your claim that Eeloo is better than Dres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo is situated at an orbital inclination of 6.15 degrees, and Dres is at a 5 degree orbit. While that doesn\u0027t seem important, it shows that with Eeloo\u0027s inclination, you need more Delta-V to make a plane change. Also, Eeloo is farther from Kerbol, so it require more Delta-V to even get your orbit to Eeloo\u0027s. The only good thing about Eeloo is that it has a higher science multiplier, with Surface being 7 points higher than Dres, Near Space being 5 points higher than Dres, and Outer space and Recovery being 4 points more than Dres. I don\u0027t understand your point about the gravity, so I will not elaborate on that. Eeloo requires a longer mission time because of its distance and inclination, compared to Dres. According to the KSP wiki, Eeloo lacks any ground scatter. And while it did get a revamp, the absence of terrain scatter makes Eeloo look a bit plain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR - Dres could be better, just don\u0027t compare it to Eeloo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-15T16:54:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2022 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by BekfastDerp13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded a word\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal_thrower","CreatedById":210550,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-15T16:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mostly like Eloo because of how many interesting things you can find there.
