Slowly the game and the community matured. Currently however, the community has changed with new life. You will notice yourself, a lot of new users on the forums (joined anytime after Jan. 2016), and the majority of these complaints come from them. These users are coming to play the game based on nothing more than 1 or 2 youtube videos and are immediately diving into the game head first with no preparation or explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when they encounter an issue, they immediately reach out and complain, sometimes blaming Squad directly. Often, they\u0027re problems are one of 3 causes. 1, it\u0027s a problem with their design which with minor fixing would be solved. 2, It\u0027s a known bug, and they simply refuse to read up about it and work around it. So the simply complain and rage quit. And 3, it\u0027s simply the game not working to their expectations or desires. These players don\u0027t want to fail a few times to get to the moon, the \u0022fun in failure\u0022 aspect of KSP, does not exist to them. Rather than taking note of their problem, they complain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in 1.1, theres a built in player\u0027s manual to help explain things to new players, and this is nice to the portion of the community who uses it, however the ones complaining (especially the ones who post under KSP general discussion rather than Tech Support) don\u0027t want a manual. They think \u0022I don\u0027t need a manual, I know everything\u0022 so they sadly won\u0027t use it. This new community is sadly just not very cooperative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot EVERY new member will be sour. However, it seems the majority of new members, are. I hope this is just a phase of the community and they will come and go.

Slowly the game and the community matured. Currently however, the community has changed with new life. You will notice yourself, a lot of new users on the forums (joined anytime after Jan. 2016), and the majority of these complaints come from them. These users are coming to play the game based on nothing more than 1 or 2 youtube videos and are immediately diving into the game head first with no preparation or explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when they encounter an issue, they immediately reach out and complain, sometimes blaming Squad directly. Often, they\u0027re problems are one of 3 causes. 1, it\u0027s a problem with their design which with minor fixing would be solved. 2, It\u0027s a known bug, and they simply refuse to read up about it and work around it. So the simply complain and rage quit. And 3, it\u0027s simply the game not working to their expectations or desires. These players don\u0027t want to fail a few times to get to the moon, the \u0022fun in failure\u0022 aspect of KSP, does not exist to them. Rather than taking note of their problem, they complain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in 1.1, theres a built in player\u0027s manual to help explain things to new players, and this is nice to the portion of the community who uses it, however the ones complaining (especially the ones who post under KSP general discussion rather than Tech Support) don\u0027t want a manual. They think \u0022I don\u0027t need a manual, I know everything\u0022 so they sadly won\u0027t use it. This new community is sadly just not very cooperative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot EVERY new member will be sour. However, it seems the majority of new members, are. I hope this is just a phase of the community and they will come and go. But only time will tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell said.

In that time, I have seen much of what Zoo is describing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at the posts of users joining after 1.0. A lot of them are poorly spelled and\u00A0difficult to read. I get that some people don\u0027t want to put in the time to capitalize and punctuate, or English may not be their first language, but the quality coupled with these posts\u0027 content send a message.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It seems a lot of these users are posting just to complain, or get help, and then lash out when somebody tries to diagnose the issue without immediately solving it for them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften it\u0027s a very simple issue, even one addressed in the OP. This is really prevalent in mod threads. Go see for yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, 1.1 was a bit of a train wreck, but it was out of Squad\u0027s hands, at least in terms of the wheels.

Even modders have lives.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a lot of the moaning is from long-time users (myself included). A lot of us were mad that such a major update came out so flawed. It\u0027s always easier to blame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not trying to promote discrimination or any sort of animosity towards new users. I think too many people forget that we were all noobs once.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue isn\u0027t that the community is getting dumbed down. I think KSP attracts a certain kind of person. Those people are often very passionate about science and engineering, which I think is part of the reason our community does so well. Now, more people are playing KSP, which is marvelous. However, that means that more people are joining the forum who probably wouldn\u0027t have before. A lot of people just play KSP like any other game, and they expect it to be slightly different than it actually is-easier to understand, faster, and with more instant gratification. They expect games to be a certain way. That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re better than them, just that they\u0027re different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of deriding them for expecting it to be easy, celebrate the fact that these people are interested in space and science enough to keep trying KSP even though it is very different from any game they\u0027ve likely played. I\u0027ve always said that KSP\u0027s learning curve isn\u0027t a curve so much as a sheer 90 degree cliff made of diamond, with a giant ravine below littered with exploded rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe kind to the Noobs. Help them, guide them, teach them. Do not hate them for being different.

I think KSP attracts a certain kind of person. Those people are often very passionate about science and engineering, which I think is part of the reason our community does so well. Now, more people are playing KSP, which is marvelous. However, that means that more people are joining the forum who probably wouldn\u0027t have before. A lot of people just play KSP like any other game, and they expect it to be slightly different than it actually is-easier to understand, faster, and with more instant gratification. They expect games to be a certain way. That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re better than them, just that they\u0027re different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of deriding them for expecting it to be easy, celebrate the fact that these people are interested in space and science enough to keep trying KSP even though it is very different from any game they\u0027ve likely played. I\u0027ve always said that KSP\u0027s learning curve isn\u0027t a curve so much as a sheer 90 degree cliff made of diamond, with a giant ravine below littered with exploded rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe kind to the Noobs.
