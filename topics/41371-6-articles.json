It makes sense because the parts we added over the course of the project were the ones we felt were most necessary at each step along the way, so it stands to reason that as you progress in your own game, you\u0027ll feel the need for those parts in a roughly similar order.

There is no technical restriction that would prevent you from loading a ship that contains parts you don\u0027t already have researched, so craft file sharing and such should work.
