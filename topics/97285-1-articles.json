To realise that the ISP of my LV-N was at 220s. I was slowing down my descent by small burst and all was fine until that happen. Changing focus and coming back to my vessel fixed it. But it did it again later on. And now at 100m AGL, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a good idea to change focus. So I landed it like that, I had plenty more fuel on board so it was not so much of an issue. And again changing focus for another vessel and coming back fixed it. My LV-N was back to his 800s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already had the same issue back in 0.23 (if my memory is correct) with an LV-909. I was landing on the Mun when only one of my three reactors changed ISP. Making this side of my Lander burning fuel more quickly that the 2 other ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have pictures or screenshot, but you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I get it, ISP change in function of the atmospheric pressure. But here in both case it was in a Vacuum all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid somebody already had similar issue? What did you done to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T18:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is very strange and sounds like a bug to me. I don\u0027t think I have the answer, but I can try to narrow it down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How did you view the ISPs for either the LV-N or LV-909? By right-clicking on them and viewing the readouts? Because then, such a dramatic drop, resolved by simply focusing on another vehicle, is almost certainly a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fuel lines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Did you update MechJeb to be compliant with 0.90 (or whatever version you\u0027re playing)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

So I can easily done multiple small burst to control the descent and all goes well. But on this specific attempt it changed, I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tell if it was in the middle of a burst, or in between two bursts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I view the ISP by right clicking on the engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a really simple design, no fancy things here. Reactor, one Fuel tank, 2x hitchhiker (it was for a station in orbit contract of 9 kerbonauts), little can for the pilot, batteries, solar panels and mech jeb. Not even any landing gear. But landing on the greater flat on the engine is not so much of a big deal on Minmus, so I give it a try to collect ground samples, EVA and crew report. (and I landed it without any other problem that the one described here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes MechJeb is up-to-date for 0.90 and the career was started in 0.90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo Fuel line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can, later today, attach the craft file, but again it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to be specifically attached to this craft.
