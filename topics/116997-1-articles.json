Unfortunately I am posting this on my phone as my internet in the house has gone.\n\n I will update this thread with my mod list when it is back, also in my error log it is telling me ksp caused an access violation, this crash happens when I am in a plane, near the pyramids (which took me 30 mins to get to in a plane goddammit!), I come in to land, a part of the plane breaks off and explodes, and it crashes to desktop, does not hang, just immediately ctd. Happens everytime, is now unplayable. When opening task manager while ksp is running I can also see a steady climb in the memory usage.\n\nLogs and mod list will be on in the next couple of days.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T20:12:23Z","Content":"This memory leak thing...\n\nI\u0027m \u0027developing\u0027 a nice little proggy (actually it\u0027s pretty large) that does a shyt load of number crunching and loads of data pushing..\n\nand I can tell you from experience... that if you don\u0027t watch your memory management it\u0027ll bite you bad... as in KSP.\n\nSpeaking for Windoze, I\u0027ve watched my app slowly eating memory... and it\u0027s an OS problem, compounded by developer \u0027actions\u0027 - for want of a nice word. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI\u0027m using assembler, and explicitly managing my memory from the system.. yet it still munches away, albeit slowly.\n\nRAD packages like C-sharp (or even C\u002B\u002B) where you don\u0027t usually bother with memory management, the problem is more serious.\n\nSquad still have to get to grips with this.. but I don\u0027t see it happening in this lifetime, as cross platform development is never going resolve anything in particular.\n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
