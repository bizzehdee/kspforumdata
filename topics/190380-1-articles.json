I am looking at mods to increase realism. I found the \u0022Realistic Atmospheres\u0022 mod BUT it requires Kopernicus, The latest Kopernicus version I have found is 1.7 and I am running KSP 1.8.1 and it will not run. is there a work around or am\u00A0I out of luck for\u00A0\u0022Realistic Atmospheres\u0022 or any other mods that requires it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-15T18:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unfamiliar with the mod \u0022Realistic Atmospheres\u0022. When you say \u0022increase realism\u0022, do you mean the visual appearance of planets or the flight mechanics? More realistic flight mechanics can make the game much more difficult; it can be fun, but potentially frustrating when you are first learning. I recommend doing at least a Mun landing and return before trying mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKopernicus is one of the more technically complex mods. The change from KSP 1.7 to 1.8 made big changes to the underlying game engine, so Kopernicus might need an extended time to get updated. Mods are done by volunteers in their spare time. You didn\u0027t do anything wrong by asking, but these forums generally frown on pestering mod makers about new versions. It\u0027s a good policy or else the Kopernicus thread would be full of people asking when will it be done. It will be done when it\u0027s done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you bought KSP through Steam you can download older versions of it. KSP 1.7.3 will work with Kopernicus. For mods that were already updated to 1.8, you might be able to find prior versions wherever those mods are hosted, or by using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E is a separate program to help install mods; it\u0027s not required but I find it helpful playing a heavily modded game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jbdenney","CreatedById":201835,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T05:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that issue with \u0022Increased realism\u0022. I just wanted to make sure that there was not another way to bypass the need for Kopernicus. I also understand about the volunteers having lives of there own. My bigger concern is there is a Mod for putting in our solar system with real distances and it also needs Kopernicus. Ultimately i would like to be able to run in \u0022real space\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T12:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, any changes to the solar system require Kopernicus. Orbits, atmo, new bodies, anything. The author did his magic so anything you want to change is in easily editable file, instead of being squeezed in the game code. That makes making these mods much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, you either wait, or search for your mods compatible with 1.7 or earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
