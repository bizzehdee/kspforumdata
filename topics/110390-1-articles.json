Launch, docked to nuclear tug, fly to Mun, land, mine, suborbital jump, KAS connect to main Mun base for resource refuel, launch and dock with tug, on to Minmus and another landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly then reloading the game the bay want to blow up, reloading the game does not solve this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContent is some TAC life support equipment, 1.25 meter and an 1.25 meter probe on top, 4 RTG, an KAS wich and an mechjeb module on the tac stack. Nothing touches the bay walls or roof. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TAC stack weight 8 ton so the weight might be an issue, however my minmus base who was next to this has the same in its bay except the RTG was replaced with 4x 150 liter monoprop tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the problem was that the bay was open, then I closed it it stopped shaking, however I was also playing with unbreakable joints, in orbit the bay can be open. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Pt2NWEP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pt2NWEP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Pt2NWEP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty standard design, the heatshields are for Jool aerobraking, tug has lots of probes on it so can not enter engine first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short is it any solutions except not using it?
