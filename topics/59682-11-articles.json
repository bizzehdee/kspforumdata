Both .wav and .ogg use the Unity sound loader which I found to have longer loading times during testing. .mp3 uses the libmpg123 library which is faster, but doesn\u0027t seem to work with Linux. .mp3 also generally has the lowest sound quality. If your music is already in one of the supported formats, it\u0027s best to keep it with its current format. Converting will only cause loss of quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Creeperchair","CreatedById":106493,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T06:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ExtremeTrader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ExtremeTrader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWindows Media Player doesn\u0027t open .OGG\u0027s, so if (use this mod!) you want to do OGG\u0027s manually, you can use Audacity or VLC Media Player.
