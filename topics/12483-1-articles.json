I was reminded of years ago playing the space shuttle game on my atari and Worlds of Flight for the trs-80, and how we only dreamed of games like KSP. It\\\u0027s great to see Indie devs stepping up and making great games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, how do I go about changing the plane of an orbit? I\\\u0027m not sure how to go about this. I\\\u0027d like to be able to land on the same spot twice on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to mention how excited and proud I was of recently achieving my first successful Mun landing and Kerbal return.
