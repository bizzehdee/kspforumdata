While the mod is great as is, for MP implementation i kindof want to have more consistent damage, as i cant seem to make the guns balanced. Its either guns are too weak and take ages to destroy one bloody part (like the structural panels for instance, the 50cal is very random, sometimes 1 shots it, sometimes takes 100 shots before it dies), or when i up the damage every single thing gets 1 shotted (if i make 50cal acceptable 30mm becomes outright OP and 1 clips a entire capital ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am thinking of a somewhat HP based system (that used HEATING to destroy parts).

This means that there is still the possibility of a shot doing absolutely no damage, but also for guns that have high firepower that usually are 100% guaranteed to kill, they will instead raise a part\u0027s heat by a facor related to part mass, impact tolerace, and ofc teh bullet\u0027s firepower.

Also, outside of very lightweight stuff, do you gusy think that 1 shotting any part is a bad idea or not? Im thinking of making it impossible to instakill anything but super lightweight junk (solar panels, batteries, probe cores, perhaps anything super lightweight like below .01 ect). Also, what do u guys think of the 30mm turret? While i do think 30mm guns should get the firepower they deserve, should that thing get SO MUCH rof/damage/accuracy/bullet velocity that it has now? That one particular gun just feels insane even with my heat damage mod instead of stock chance to 1 shot part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a small update with my work, ive almost managed to get red/blue tracers implemented that switch colors based on team selection. This should make it super obvious what team is what, since im kindof envisioning MP to be more team deathmatch style initially (as ksp has no mechanics for objectives). While more teams are defenetely going to be added (im most likely going to have 4 teams implemented, A, B, C, D each with a unique tracer color), initially i think red vs blue would be good enough.

Im thinking of making it impossible to instakill anything but super lightweight junk (solar panels, batteries, probe cores, perhaps anything super lightweight like below .01 ect). Also, what do u guys think of the 30mm turret? While i do think 30mm guns should get the firepower they deserve, should that thing get SO MUCH rof/damage/accuracy/bullet velocity that it has now?

Those are quite powerful, and have a blast wave thing coded, but the guns do not even appear to have any target hit recoil modeled. I may be wrong, but when i was testing, it didnt seem that enemy fire pushed me around at all (just overheated crap on the underside).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest issue atm is trying to strike a good balance between balanced and useable. Damage alone is not the sole factor making something good/bad, as in MP hitting a target is actually hard enough as is outside of ground vehicles spaming at each other from stationary. So i do need to somewhat elevate damage levels, but i just wanna make it impossible to 1 shot someone, as thats a no fun mechanic in my opinion. Ofc shooting weakspots will still cut a ship in half with a good burst, but with my mod, its nolonger 10 shots of a 30mm cuts a capital ship in 2. Heating damage also is scaled by part mass and things like impact tolerance, so parts that normally would be able to take alot of hist require concentrated fire (such as capital ships made of alot of structural panels, or some command pods that have good mass and high impact resistances. So stuff thats weak, can be shot off quick, but itll take some time to cut through a entire armored tank, with things like 50 cals being almost unable to destroy some of the larger/impact resistant parts at all with just a single turret. Think of teh current damage modeling being SIMILAR to the old sunbeam lazer mod, except instead of continuous heating, the bullets each increase a part\u0027s heat level by say 1/3 of teh maximum heat or whatnot, with the 30mm basically 2-3 shotting MOST parts, and the 20mm doing moderate damage, but taking some more time to chew through heavily armored parts, and teh 50cal made basically useless against huge mass/super strong resistance parts. Eventually i plan to implement a damage multiplier against fuel tanks, as right now the larger the tank, the harder it is to destroy, which is somewhat true, but in general lfo or any fuel should ve extremely vulnurable to vaporization. Im most likely going to implement this with a probability to just 1 shot the tank, as we dont want people using unprotected fuel tanks as armor that is superior to bloody normal plate (as a mass of 30 tons has a very low heating per bullet, being as of now IMMUNE to 50cals entirely, and takes multiple 20s to kill, so you can kindof exploit the mechanics by having super massive parts be almost immune to smaller guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplosives may or may not be rebalanced, depending on how powerful the normal guns end up in the end. I obviously want to make all weapon typed equally viable, and i kindof want to avoid having one weapon dominate the game. Itll become a long process of balancing, especially if i find one particular gun overpreforming (like the 30mm turret which is insane atm). Im also going to massively buff teh stats of the fixed guns, due to their difficulty in use, and most likely increase turret weights to cut down on the ability to fly fighter styled jets with a ciws turret on the bottom using autoaim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing, im planning on redoing teh autoaim to not use the aim assists at all. This allows for point defense against missiles or very close targets, but wont allow someone to just enable autoaim with a ciws turret and get 4 kills within 10 seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall i plan to in the long term implement my own weapon models/stats, most likely featuring ww2/cold war styled guns, which all had less rof, and less accuracy, but for now ill stick to the stock guns, as i cant do everything at once, gotta get the plugin finished 1st.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genius Evil","CreatedById":72989,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T20:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow can I make the trajectory predictor show up for my bombs?

Now using alot of struts structural panels can yield a fairly tanky vehicle, although from testing, ill say ALWAYS bring more then a single gun, since getting your gun shot off is a rather annoying issue (ban AI for aimbotting me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). Anyways, now stuff seems to die much more realistically, although a single 50cal turret is useless against anything with even a slight amount of armor plating. Right now 20mm is the gun ive done MOST of the balancing around, as its suppost to be not terrible but not crazy powerful either. It takes a moderate amount of 20 to take down a armored target thats covered in structural panels, and it is possible to make a vehicle that is almost immune to 20mm frontally at least by heavy abuse of radiators (struts, extra stuff strapped onto the frontal armor, ect). Ofc such armoring is not viable on planes, so those are still fairly easy to bring down with a concentrated burst of anything but 50cals (well you COULD bring 10 50 turrets and get equal firepower to a 30 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may need to modify the cannons a tad, as the 105/120 is a little bit better then the low level junk now, but since it is kindof hard to hit with, its not that powerful, and useless vs planes too. Missiles/bombs are imo good stock, they are tougher to use then the cannons, and they allow for a hard counter to super heavy armoring that is possible on tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will upload a test version of my .dll, so hopefully i can have some people go in and try each weapon on a variety of targets (weak rovers, planes, heavy tanks, immobile bunkers, ect). I plan to keep the ai autolocking feature as it is much weaker now with the inability to 1 shot anything outside of some super weak junk with a 30mm, and i may or may not tone down the ai\u0027s accuracy when firing, depending on feedback as to how good it is (lets face it, we dont want everyone just making massive tanks with multiple 30s on them, and then just ignoring everything while their guns eat enemy alive, although one nerf to it is a fixed 1km max autotargetr distance, which SHOULD keep people from parking unmanned junk around and shooting you down with those. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the 30mm CIWS turret is going to get nerfed in some way or another, its so insanely powerful its not much fun to fight against, especially considering its the most accurate gun in game, has the best ROF, and does the most damage, all while not necessarily overheating too much. A few things im considering is making it overheat more, and take a much longer time to drop that heat, or cut down its turret traverse speed. But id like some ideas from the community on what i can do to make it a fair thing to use/fight against without ruining its firepower (as lets face it, a 30 is WAY more powerful then a 20 or a 50cal). Ill prolly buff the 50s though, by removing overheat entirely from those, as they are already more or less useless outside of large numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few pics of a basic rover i made using heavy armoring principles, notice it doesnt take ANY damage whatsoever from 2 50cal tanks and a 20mm vulcan until i get closer up and or expose my weakspots, this will make combat much more enjoyeable in my opinion, as it rerquires a little more then blindly spraying at CoG. Ofc i know that real bullets do not heat up the target, so lets just say the guns are loaded with plasma rounds or something. Also, i tested that it IS possible to armor vs a 30mm at mid-long range provided you have like 10-20 struts as well as some disposeable heat buffering parts strapped onto the frontal plate, but even then i do not reccomend tanking a 30mm as it will eat you alive if it gets a burst through a weakspot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/WYqDF#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

At ranges of 900m or farther, i can tank an indefinite amount of 30mm, supplemented by 2 50cal trucks and a 20mm vulcan all firing at once. Ofc real players will fire longer bursts, or use tactics such as flanking, but the idea is rather nice, that it is possible to reinforce stuff against the guns, although not with weak components like fuel tanks ect. Technically i can see someone making a maus using this armoring technique, and just eating everything shot at em, but hey, autocannons need some counters, its not like the maus will be able to take multiple 120mm hits or a good bomber. Anyways, as of now, the thing teh damage takes into account is bullet mass, bullet velocity relative to the target, and the materials impact tolerance, so only some structural parts and a few of teh pods are able to tank damage at all, most fuel tanks take over 10 times the damage from any autocannon due to terrible impact tolerance, as do most lower level things like generators ect. Max heat is also important, as the guns do a finite amount of heating to said part, independent of what its max allowed heat is, meaning that higher heat resist like in the case of the square drone core, is beneficial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough im quite tempted to make a p1000, a primary heavy battery, and then alot of flak on the backside......with armor to boot.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough heat damag emechanics can be somewhat exploited, i dont feel itll make MP combat unfun.
