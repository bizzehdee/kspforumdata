It could be an extension of TriggerAu\u0027s Transfer Window Planner, or a separate, similar program.\n\nFor example, let\u0027s say you want to do a free return mission to Eve, in which you launch a spacecraft to Eve, it swings by Eve, and returns to Kerbin with minimal orbital adjustments. The planner would give you a launch window to Eve, where the date of the Eve periapsis corresponds with an Eve--\u003EKerbin transfer window, so the spacecraft would return to Kerbin with a minimum of dV.\n\nMore complicated arrangements could be using the gravity assist of a planet, to reach a more distant planet with less dV. This time for example, it would give you a launch window to Eve, where the time of the Eve periapsis corresponds with a transfer window to Moho, so you could go to Moho with less dV than by directly burning to a Moho-encountering orbit from Kerbin.\n\nAn even more complicated arrangement would be a \u0022Grand Tour\u0022 where the planner would give you a launch window, with which you could visit multiple planets with gravity assists."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T22:49:44Z","Content":"[Trajectory Optimization Tool](forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476) has advanced mission planning tools, including a gravity assist planner."}]}
