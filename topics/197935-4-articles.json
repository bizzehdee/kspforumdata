The fundamental systems there are frozen, and cannot be changed or updated extensively. They could release new parts, planets or other DLC, but if there was a problem with the \u0022Physics LOD\u0022 for instance that absolutely crushed performance it wouldn\u0027t be fixable. Could it also be vaporware? Sure, but 2K has shareholders they\u0027re accountable to. This isn\u0027t a little indy company anymore, nor crowdfunded via \u0022Donations\u0022. This is a medium sized team backed by a large publisher who will want a release, otherwise they have to explain the losses to their shareholders.
