Lately mars has been the choice of private foundations or corporations. Its largely a public relations move to date. Selecting astronauts for a mission to mars that will not launch for at least a decade. The Mars mission in the video (c.1990) was not to launch untill 1999, of course never launched. In not trying to discount the value of a lunar facility, or someday a martian research facility, but one thing that researchers and explorers do not want to do is lock themselves into concretized thinking, particularly when it comes to choosing future research opportunities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. From a scientific point of view I like Lagrangian L2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -L2 is in a small gravity well that is half in earths SOI, it is a few more dV than reaching the moon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -There is no need for rescue vehicles of the like needed for mars and moon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -We have seen the great scientific benefit of observations from these orbits, but what we really need are much larger space telescopes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Imagine not having to fly to Ceres or have 10-20 year missions to explore the outer solar system, just point your telescope\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -We could have an array of space telescopes searching for asteroids and short period comets that can be exploited. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -It is still partially in earths magnetic shield. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -there is nothing there to exploit but it is theorized that passing NEO sometimes get trapped in the Lagrangians, so it may be possible to capture these smaller objects and collectively exploit them with out need large sums of dV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Problems - No gravity, radiation. Insolance is diminished\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Best Infrared observations in proximity to earth excepting the outer solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Very useful visible and UV observatory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Trojan asteroids and NEO asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Right, intersecting NEO from earth is a challenge, the logic is that if an asteroid is closes to earths elliptical, it eventually gets sucked into earth or thrown into the outer solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -But with some of the new highly efficient technology coming we could actually steer and asteroid into a more favorable orbit (say between earth and mars, or earth and venus) or even park the asteroid in L2 or L1 (a dangerous proposition). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -A parked asteroid in L1 or L2 would be the best of all worlds.
