Lately mars has been the choice of private foundations or corporations. Its largely a public relations move to date. Selecting astronauts for a mission to mars that will not launch for at least a decade. The Mars mission in the video (c.1990) was not to launch untill 1999, of course never launched. In not trying to discount the value of a lunar facility, or someday a martian research facility, but one thing that researchers and explorers do not want to do is lock themselves into concretized thinking, particularly when it comes to choosing future research opportunities. \n\n1. From a scientific point of view I like Lagrangian L2\n\n -L2 is in a small gravity well that is half in earths SOI, it is a few more dV than reaching the moon\n\n -There is no need for rescue vehicles of the like needed for mars and moon\n\n -We have seen the great scientific benefit of observations from these orbits, but what we really need are much larger space telescopes. \n\n -Imagine not having to fly to Ceres or have 10-20 year missions to explore the outer solar system, just point your telescope\n\n -We could have an array of space telescopes searching for asteroids and short period comets that can be exploited. \n\n -It is still partially in earths magnetic shield. \n\n -there is nothing there to exploit but it is theorized that passing NEO sometimes get trapped in the Lagrangians, so it may be possible to capture these smaller objects and collectively exploit them with out need large sums of dV. \n\n -Problems - No gravity, radiation. Insolance is diminished\n\n -Best Infrared observations in proximity to earth excepting the outer solar system. \n\n - Very useful visible and UV observatory. \n\n2. Trojan asteroids and NEO asteroids.\n\n -Right, intersecting NEO from earth is a challenge, the logic is that if an asteroid is closes to earths elliptical, it eventually gets sucked into earth or thrown into the outer solar system. \n\n -But with some of the new highly efficient technology coming we could actually steer and asteroid into a more favorable orbit (say between earth and mars, or earth and venus) or even park the asteroid in L2 or L1 (a dangerous proposition). \n\n -A parked asteroid in L1 or L2 would be the best of all worlds. Close to earth energetically, close to earth in terms of distance (though still to far for a true emergency)\n\n -A parked asteroid could shield crewmen from dangerous radiation from the sun.\n\n -A mined asteroid could shield crewmen from all directions. \n\n -Can also be used for observatory but the rotational velocity needs to be killed, better placed in tidally locked rotation with sun. \n\n-Problems. Initials fuel costs, lack of gravity, initial exposures to radiation. \n\n3. The smaller satellites (Deimos or Phobos) or planetoids of the asteroid belt.\n\n -We already seen that Ceres is showing signs that it may have volatiles under its sooty skin, this may be the best places to search for targets that produce lots of hydrogen. \n\n - There should be other asteroids that have similar compositions with high percentages of volatiles suitable for conversion to water and hydrogen.\n\n -As opposed to NEO asteroids, larger belt asteroids tend to have reasonable rotations.\n\n -Problems here include frequent impactors, but these could be intercepted. \n\n-It is suggest that the surface of these planets is soft, which may make it easy to dig down."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T15:22:36Z","Content":"I think the *real* fallacy is thinking we have to make a choice at all - the one-legged stool.

You design them for a set of requirements. If those requirements don\u0027t match the actual use, then you have pretty much wasted resources. The opposite example is Orion, which was originally designed for lunar missions (21 days of life support, dV and reentry speed calculated for lunar orbit).

They\u0027re already similar. And using a multi-flight deep space vehicle to amortize the cost per flight would be ideal.\n\nAssuming 9 flights to the Moon, Apollo works out at about 12 billion USD per mission, in today\u0027s money. If we assume that the built on orbit spacecraft took 10 years to make, and can only be in space for a total of 30 years, as well as it taking, oh, a whole year to refurbish the vessel and do a mission, costing about as much as the ISS, we get about 7.5 billion USD per mission (flight, in this case).

If one of the launches fails, you can delay the mission until the next launch window without having to relaunch everything. If a single rocket mission fails at launch, there goes your entire mission.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also in most cases you\u0027re going to have to use fairly big (Proton-class) rockets anyway, or even bigger if you don\u0027t want your stack to be a stupidly long chain of 20mt rocket stages.\n\nRockets don\u0027t scale linearly with payload. A rocket that can lift 75 metric tons is far less than half the size of one that can lift 150 metric tons.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Either way the program would end up with a similar cost and complexity to the assembly of Space Station.\n\nA large amount of the cost of the ISS is due to politics, and the use of the space shuttle (which had so many problems, I could dedicate twenty pages to describing how stupid it was as a launch vehicle). MIR is probably a better estimate of the costs of building an orbital station or large interplanetary ship."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T01:30:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And is anyone else skeptical about the SLS?

And if you\u0027re going to Mars, you probably want to use methane as your fuel (to take advantage of ISRU), reducing boil-off even further.\n\nBut it doesn\u0027t eliminate the problem. To use high-energy fuel you will need to launch the stage last, which means the astronauts might have to wait for a very long time. But even if you launch it last, and try for a first orbit rendezvous, the rendezvous might not be a success and it would take days for the phasing orbit to catch up, and by then the boil-off would be significant enough to affect mission operations. AKA mission abort.\n\nPlus you can only launch one stage,or in the time you launch, rendezvous, and dock a second one all the hydrogen leaks out. And limiting the stack to one Earth departure stage is a problem when you\u0027re trying to use *small rockets*.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If one of the launches fails, you can delay the mission until the next launch window without having to relaunch everything.\n\nIts not that simple. The on-orbit stack will be an extremely complex multi-module human-rated habitable space laboratory. You need to service it, or it will stop being habitable. That means large-scale logistics for the many months until the next launch window, on the scale of the logistics for any other piloted space facility.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rockets don\u0027t scale linearly with payload.

Any payload class larger than about 30mt will be dedicated to BEO missions anyway, because no other missions need such a large capacity. And operating and manufacturing a unique rocket will cost about the same whether it lifts 75mt or 175mt. \n\nThat\u0027s the reason orbital assembly is favourable (for large piloted space laboratories) - you can use launch vehicles that are already *in production*, amortized by their other missions."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T02:02:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That doesn\u0027t work if the multiple parts are mission-critical; it only helps if you can last through the time it takes to prepare a replacement for launch (which, unless you have a pipeline, will be a fairly long time).
