What\u0027s the best way to share a Power Point and a couple word documents so everybody who wants to can read them?\n\nAlso, while I can get to orbit in 1.0.2 manually, I\u0027m neither fuel-efficient at it nor consistent with my gravity turn profiles. Has anybody figured out the best beginner ascent profile for 1.0.2 yet? Something to replace the \u0022go straight up to 8 km and pitch to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022 (though I\u0027m guessing the newer version will be somewhat more complicated)?\n\nAlso, I like Ike (like, I really like Ike)! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T05:53:17Z","Content":"It\u0027s the moon of the hour! \n\nWelcome to the forum. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T13:42:50Z","Content":"Welcome!
