I have a ship with many docking ports and one of them has a lander attached. When I tried to undock the lander the \u0027undock\u0027 button doesn\u0027t do anything. It depresses but the ports don\u0027t seperate. I know I could dock and undock the lander before (it was not attached to the ship during launch), and other ports still work, but that one seems to be stuck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the picture the lander is on the left. I can undock the fuel tank inbetween the lander and the main ship, but even then the lander remains stuck to the fuel tank. I tried finding the docking port in the save file and even changing a few entries but without success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/itHjnlD.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/itHjnlDl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022itHjnlDl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I knew what I was supposed to edit the docking status to I might be able to narrow down the docking port entry by detaching at the fuel tank, which leaves only 9 docking ports to try (6 for the 3 science pods, 2 for the fuel tank, 1 for the lander)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T16:54:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GamerMitch","CreatedById":83492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T15:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley once had this problem, I suggest just spinning your ship very fast to try to get it off... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T15:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem.

I cannot undock another part, as the ship is an early apollo-style lander mission (ship\u002Blander). The lander remains stuck to the ship. The only work around I found was to slap a TR-18D stack separator between the docking ports, although then the clampotrons immediately attract, and require spinning/yawing the ship to fling the lander clear (as well as the TR-18D). Testing done on the launchpad with just a capsule docked to a lander module results in a proper decouple, though after launch, they will be \u0022glued\u0022 together when I attempt to decouple in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
