With that in mind, what mods should I be looking at to put together the most realistic Kerbol system beyond the basic FAR, DRE, RT2, and TACLS?\n\nStock equivalent of DRE is in 1.0. No word on quality or relevance of it. Expect something lightweight which will need modding.\n\nResources (fuel mining) are also in 1.0, but it is restricted to a single resource. The resource system is being built by a hired modder and, as such, is mod-friendly and looks like it will be expandable to cover life support. The author of the resource system will be [releasing a life support pack](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/31720x/something_new_from_usi_is_coming_d/) separately, so TAC-LS will have some competition.\n\nStock aero is being overhauled, but will almost certainly not come close to FAR.

Automatic texture conversion has been discussed in the devnotes, but there\u0027s disagreement on how that affects the overhead. LOD has been dead for a while. ATM is your best bet, if you\u0027re happy with potatoes for textures.\n\nMight want to wait until the post-release mod updates happen and see what\u0027s-what.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T18:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TMS**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T20:42:17Z","Content":"Is 0.90 really that broken?
