I think more or less a J-2 or F-1 like model would be best. Maybe instead of trying to directly copy irl parts, you could design something new for the KR-2L, based upon it\u0027s known stats. Also, I think the Launch Escape Tower should be really tall, and the nosecone part of it made sharp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the KR-2L needs to stay a lift engine as well as an upper stage engine if you want. Make a separate engine to be a low-power upper stage would be acceptable, like the dual-engine shown. Problem is that the KS-25x4 Cluster ought to be fueled, but then you run into a compatibility problem. Having fuel in that model for the Centaur-ish engine would be acceptable if it\u0027s a new engine. I think the best way to do it is to make the KS-25 a fuel tank to 4x 1.25m adapter, and have a big red warning (in forum posts and whatnot) that it has no engines, and make the engines separate, high gimbal, 1.25m parts. Or maybe do that but also make a part that\u0027s just the stock part with the new models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about the bulkheads on those tanks.
