Many things players think are Unity\u0027s restrictions are intended choices. Squad have done huge work to make basic spaceflight possible without all mathematical data but still keeping some sense of reality. I am sure that it is economically very good decision, but unfortunately they have loved little too much in their oversimple philosophy. They should at least allow mods to do axial tilts as they have done with data displays (MechJeb, KER) or aerodynamics (FAR).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwbrase","CreatedById":150131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T09:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222313174\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449564559\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154334\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, Hannu2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not believe that Unity does not allow axial tilt of simple spherical object.

There is in any case one coordinate transformation at SOI transition. It is practically a matrix product, rotation includes only few terms in transformation matrix. If there is not complete tool in Unity it is easy to program by hand. If needed, planets outside of SOI can be transformed to new coordinates for drawing. It is just couple of matrix products.
