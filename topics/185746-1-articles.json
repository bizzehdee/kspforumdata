In Star Trek; these things are completely commonplace. They can easily replicate anything or create a simulated reality. Wormholes, parallel universes and super-sophisticated A.I. would be considered emerging technology. What would be a good science or technology that a scientist could study only in theory in the Star Trek universe. We study the theory of the Alcubierre Drive in 2019 but we are far from creating a warp drive.
