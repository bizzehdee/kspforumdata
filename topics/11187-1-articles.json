And land them again. Total distance travelled must be over 2 km. \n\nInverse will do that death roll if you leave SAS on while it\\\u0027s in air, but if you turn SAS off you will break your engine off lifting off the pad (turn is too sharp or something). \n\nReverse... I don\\\u0027t know. Nothing I tried could get it out of its... brick fall. **NOTE**: All controls are also reversed. If you want to turn left, try to turn right. \n\nMinor modifications like more or less control surfaces are okay, but make sure they\\\u0027re inverse ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOtherwise use provided .crafts if you want to try this ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T12:33:56Z","Content":"You\\\u0027re insane for treating your kerbals like this and you should feel bad.
