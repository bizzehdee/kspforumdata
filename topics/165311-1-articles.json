I\u0027m getting there but it\u0027s been a long road, paved with the shattered remains of many planes and the splattered corpses of many Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a 2v2 AI fight, the Falkens shot down both of my planes. So I switched one Falken to Team A. It immediately went full throttle and took off straight up, despite having missiles left. The other Falken gave chase, with only its Vulcans available. After blasting the other Falken, it continued going straight up to where its engines ran out of air. Its peak altitude was over 23KM. After falling back to air dense enough to restart its engines, it flew back down to the set idle altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was a crazy yet amazing glitch in the BDArmory Continued AI. The max altitude was set to 3000 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
