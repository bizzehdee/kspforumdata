I mean look at it, in dry mode, it gets 9000, not worse then the wheesley\u0027s 10500, it gets WAY better thrust especially if you are using the wet mode (that btw is still not bad ISP, its comparable to the whiplash).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the only place the wheesley is arguably better is VTOLS, but its actually heavier (and thus less TWR then wet mode on panther, and usually VTOLs arent going to be flying around on VTOL engines for extended periods of time that the ISP difference matters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is there any reason for the wheesley now that i cant seem to notice? Panther is lighter, better TWR, comparable isp in dry mode, better thrust in wet mode, and you get some useable gimballing range that can be very useful on some builds. Sure the wheesley was useless before, and its a hair better now, but it still feels pointless compared to alternatives (if you absolutely need thrust take the big jet, if you are small take the jumo jet, and for mid range craft the panther just seems better in almost every way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T03:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewheesley is good for simple/long range designs...
