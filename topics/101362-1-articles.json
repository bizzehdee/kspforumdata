Is there a mod that will allow you to make your bases level? Example: Nice and level when built on Minmus on the flats. Perhaps a way to make with legs to level themselves out or a mod to allow a kerbal to flaten out an area for building? Done some searching and I haven\u0027t seen anything like this. Not even sure if this is possible. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T17:12:40Z","Content":"I made a request for self-leveling landing struts a while ago.
