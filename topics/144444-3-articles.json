It really needs to be balanced in a far more complex way (complex to \u003Cem\u003Ebalance\u003C/em\u003E, play should be straightforward). Also, since everything is connected in career, it sort of requires a total redo. Time also being a thing, frankly, not as complex as KCT, but have things take some amount of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are whole threads on what should happen. Suffice it to say that the goal of the tech tree should be to require the career player to make \u0022strategic\u0022 choices in terms of what line of technology they pursue, instead of what it is, road bumps to getting stuff done. That\u0027s how I see it, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use RL analogs, when you\u0027ve invested in the R-7 and related hardware (Soyuz), you craft a lunar mission using those tools, even to the point if using them unmanned as probes (Zond). The issue with this concept is that there are not enough parts for it, really, we\u0027d need more variability. In a modded world, I\u0027d break the different fuel types into branches, for example---\u0022Hmm, maybe I should not have put \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E my effort into hydrolox rockets, boil-off is killing my Duna mission.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplexity can add a lot to gameplay, but t needs to be the \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E complexity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about Apollo as another RL example. KSP lacks the complexity of gameplay required to make the Mun an interesting target. This is because of the mini nature of the KSP solar system. It adds \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E to have the Mun large enough that a trivially tiny craft cannot do a direct ascent mission. All of a sudden at ~6.4X rescale, staged landers become a thing. You need to \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E about design, which is kind of the point, right? So Apollo... hypergolics, vs hydrolox, vs kerlox. They used all 3. The hypergolics for reliability. Squad has said that reliability will not be a thing, which is a mistake, IMHO. A tech tree can fix this, because under a new tech paradigm, perhaps the parts come earlier as \u0022eXperimental\u0022 hardware that can fail, which become 100% reliable after they are unlocked. If the R\u0026amp;D is done right, that balance of X parts vs reliable parts becomes a thing. Then, certain tech can be more reliable anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m rambling, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T15:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222706315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144444\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470440975\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167171\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James M\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, James M said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry but some of us (Meaning me :/ ) Play the game on console.

True, but if I\u0027m plunking down my money for a game, I expect a game. I don\u0027t expect to get an engine and then to be told to build the actual game myself. By analogy, I wouldn\u0027t buy a book, expect to get halfway through it and then be told to write the rest myself or cobble something together from this collection of chapters written by random people on the internet. Likewise, if I bought an album, I wouldn\u0027t expect to be handed a drum track to play, a \u0027how to play guitar\u0027 book to go with it and be told to go away and finish the rest of the music myself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless of course I\u0027m told upfront that there is no game apart from what I make of it. If KSP had been released as Sandbox only, i.e. the game engine and a selection of parts to get you started, that would be absolutely fine. I\u0027d expect to have to mod the heck out of it. But it\u0027s not. It\u0027s released as a fully fledged game, with Sandbox, Science and Career modes, depending on how much gameplay you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if my software does not allow modding, that is, or should be, entirely up to the developers. Perhaps they have a vision for how they want their game to work and be played, and they don\u0027t want\u00A0half a ton of random junk bolted onto it by the \u0027community\u0027. You might disagree with that attitude but it\u0027s their choice. If you don\u0027t like it - go make your own game. After all, if you\u0027re happy building a game out of mods, surely it\u0027s only a small step to writing the whole thing yourself?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh - and those copyright mad producers?

As I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E I said above (I deleted a couple drafts here and there), one problem is a lack of choices regarding \u003Cem\u003Esimilar\u003C/em\u003E technologies. Right now, there is an obvious size/capability progression of parts, and for good gameplay, we really need more tech to do the same job, but with pros and cons. Sadly, that is likely going to stay in mod territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake part failures as an example. Squad doesn\u0027t like them, but in RL, reliability was a reason for many choices. Other RL considerations that we have in mods factored in as well, like boil off of cryofuels. So Apollo had 3 different propellants. Kerlox for the booster for thrust, then hydrolox for I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, then hypergolics for reliability. So realism shows us a few things that add not just complexity, but interesting gameplay. If you used hydrolox for your rocket, you\u0027d need to get your mission done without any messing around, since you\u0027d lose 1% of the hydrogen or more per day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what could be done short of that in stock... what about engine restarts, and throttling? Different engines might be available in a tree that follow a path towards deeper throttling. Add some monoprop engines (since we have that, it could be an analog for hypergolics) and allow deeper throttling of those, having the others only to 75% or something like that. Perhaps early\u00A0engines can only start once, then you can unlock the ability to restart multiple times. The idea is to make sure that if you looked at 10 people\u0027s career games after 10 launches, you might actually see different looking unlock strategies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal is gameplay complexity, which I\u0027d argue is always a good thing (that\u0027s different that complexity of play/controls, it\u0027s intellectual complexity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T15:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222708165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144444\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470577289\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111526\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, GoSlash27 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proposed tree layout in this thread may not be ideal for game play (or it may be... who knows), but it is *most definitely* better than the current tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I would preferably like to have a War Thunder-like research tree, but since the KSP tree doesn\u0027t allow for multiple starting points I figured that the mod I linked in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
