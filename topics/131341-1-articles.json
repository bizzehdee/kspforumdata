They are all theoretical at this point, with no realworld tests performed, but physics \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E allow it. One such plan, for instance, is turning the metal into some form of aerogel- or wool-like structure. Basically a small mass blown up to a huge volume. This would then be given a deorbit nudge. Due to the giant area versus almost no mass, the object would not experience any significant shock heating and would survive reentry unharmed.
