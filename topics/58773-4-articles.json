In the first the Mk1 pod is on the front of a rocket. I consider the parachute to be the front and the engine to be the rear. The entry hatch is on the top. If I want to pitch the craft down I press the W key. If I want to Yaw the nose to the right I push the D key and if I want to roll the ship to the right I push the E key.

The issue here is that those winglets are a single-axis control surface (like all/most of the control surfaces in the game), with a rotational axis pointing mostly along the yaw axis, or \u0022up\u0022 and slightly \u0022back\u0022 relative to the base of the part, as I\u0027ve indicated. The spoiler control commands surfaces to rotate in around the \u0022pitch\u0022 axis, with is nearly orthogonal to the control axis of the part. In KSP, control surfaces will rotate if they think they are capable of affecting the axis being commanded (and are allowed to rotate based on the current action). But, to determine that, they do some trigonometry based on their local transform vector and the commanded rotation vector and the center of inertia of the part, to decide if they can help and if so, which direction they should move to do so. So, because the rotation vector in question is pitch, and because they are both on the same side of the center of inertia relative to the pitch axis (\u0022forward\u0022 of it, probably), they both decide to turn the same way. What\u0027s strangest to me is that on the other side of the wing, they\u0027ve chosen opposite directions. This might be a 2nd/4th quadrant ambiguity or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I would question whether or not you actually want \u0022spoiler\u0022 behavior on those winglets. If looks like you\u0027re building a VTO spaceplane and those are your vertical stabilizers: you probably do not want them to actuate when you are trying to spoil your aerodynamics. Those are primarily for yaw stability, and I don\u0027t think you will get the behavior you want by commanding them on the spoiler controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all of this to say: I could make a tweakable that, in theory, would reverse the direction of a part when commanded as a flap or a spoiler. But, that would not work well with your configuration above because the winglet that is \u0022correctly\u0022 turning opposite its mate on the \u0022bottom\u0022 of the craft would also reverse (thanks to symmetry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-12-5-2-Aero-Fixes-For-Planes-Rockets-1-7-14?p=948846\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post948846\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecross-post this over to the FAR thread\u003C/a\u003E to see if ferram (or someone else who knows more about the aero code than I do) can comment as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022a__gun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022a__gun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHad any luck with this toadicus...?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was sick this weekend, and got no testing or coding done. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Sorry!

I do know that air brakes serve a different purpose from spoilers, increasing drag without significantly altering lift, but a meaningful \u0022right way\u0022 to accomplish this with the stock parts seems well outside the scope of this mod and beyond my current knowledge. I can -- probably -- make a tweakable to invert the control response of aerodynamic control surfaces, but IMO that will not function well to correct the behavior you\u0027re seeing into the behavior you\u0027re trying to produce (it would invert the normal status of the surface when used as a yaw stabilizer, so you\u0027d need to make sure the invert tweak was getting turned on and off with the brake control).
