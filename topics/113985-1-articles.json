Maybe try that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T01:31:45Z","Content":"\u002B1 for the rear steering enabled on long vehicles. If you want a kind of tow truck you could try with a claw with pivoting enabled. You can not connect it in the VAB and it might eventually summon a kraken as side effects.\n\nI would like to spend a word in favour of the big wheels: I agree with you that the small ones look cooler but they are pretty fragile for \u0022trucks\u0022 like this. Moreover they have got a steering that is better suited for such a big vehicle. I use my \u0022truck\u0022 to drill for resources and to push/pull things around on the surface and I must say I am a very satisfied customer.\n\n![p47IPa1l.png](http://i.imgur.com/p47IPa1l.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T01:33:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T01:51:18Z","Content":"This is an older version of my rover (It uses modded wheels: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84102-WIP-PARTS-PLUGIN-0-23-5-Kerbal-Foundries-wheelpack-anti-grav-repulsors](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84102-WIP-PARTS-PLUGIN-0-23-5-Kerbal-Foundries-wheelpack-anti-grav-repulsors) )\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The ones in the rear however.. There\u0027s a good reason why steering rear wheels is becoming more and more common on modern trucks / 18-wheelers. It adds a lot to the maneuverability of and control over the truck, while saving tiers in the process.

This is meant for Duna, not Kerbin. Next, divide them into three sections: front, middle and rear, with space in between. Both ends steerable. And have a 3\\* engineer on hand - despite being ruggedized the wheels \\*will\\* break on landing, it\u0027s the way it goes - you need to be extremely gentle for them to survive - but that\u0027s nothing the engineer can\u0027t fix.

You also may want to disable Torque to prevent offset motion while driving forward, or any direction for that matter.\n\nI also recommend putting an Engineer somewhere on there.

Locking steering on the middle sets of wheels helps. \n\nAckermann steering is coming with U5, apparently.\n\nFor towing (and mods), KAS/KIS has winches and tow cables... You\u0027ll have to experiment as to see whether they\u0027re a help or a hindrance in this case though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T11:08:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"},{"CreatedByName":"Abruptum","CreatedById":138119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:58:13Z","Content":"Thanks for all the help kind pilots. ill try some of the stuff you suggested. im sure ill find a nice solution using all the valuable info ;D"}]}
