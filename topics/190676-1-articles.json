The question in that case is how do we as a community want to treat Kerbin; do we want to highlight its \u0022playground\u0022 characteristics or do we want to keep it toned down to lend a bit more feeling of realism to the game? Normally I lean more towards freedom than realism but I have to vote against blatantly showcasing the unrealistic properties of Kerbin this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d entirely support would be any number of\u00A0much smaller space elevators being possible to construct\u00A0from colonies that sit on lower gravity bodies that have a reasonably high rotational speed, personally I\u0027d prefer to draw a hard line at the point where the whole thing can be built entirely using materials that CAN be mass produced with the tech of today as opposed to somehow shoving a rock through a magical grinder and getting 1km of perfectly knitted atoms neatly lined up to a level that the best labs in the world can barely replicate at the scale of a needle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the \u0022it looks cool\u0022 argument the only reason for a space elevator to exist is to shuttle small quantities of materials and crew at a time between the surface of a planet/moon/whatever and a point at least at the height of a stable orbit, in real life as a way to cut costs and in games simply for convenience. Given that some manner of yet unnamed\u00A0Craft Building\u00A0Thing for space is already in the game and needs to be supplied with loads and loads of materials to actually produce anything it would be reasonable to provide players an elevator as an option other than doing a\u00A0huge number of\u00A0supply runs for every large construction project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the day though I\u0027d be surprised if space elevators appear in KSP2 in any form at all, they\u0027d have to be a bit of a nightmare to make without completely disregarding any of several realism points and I shudder to think how powerful Kraken bait they\u0027d be...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-30T12:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223722289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221577657628\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s it matter?
