I can activate the engine and it\u0027ll say its running, but no fuel will be used and no thrust generated. But interestingly enough, if activated via staging (even after attempting to use action groups) then the engine actually works.\n\nI noticed that this happens with the stock LES and FASA\u0027s LES\u0027. Haven\u0027t tried to see if it does it with other parts."}]}
