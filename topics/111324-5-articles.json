Not in the SMT/HyperThread sense, and not in the multithreaded programming sense.\n- Each core \\*CAN\\* consist of a number of hardware threads/virtual cores. The processor I\u0027m writing this on, for example, does not (i5-2500K).\n- Each virtual core can handle multiple threads, but only one can actually be active at any given time. Same goes for real cores, if you\u0027re not on an SMT-capable processor.\n- KSP is definitely multithreaded. \\*HOW\\* multithreaded is a question I can\u0027t answer. How many of the 33 threads were doing meaningful work? I don\u0027t know, it\u0027d take deeper investigation than I did. The more evenly divided the work is between threads, the more benefit we see from additional cores in our processors.\n- It\u0027s not clear to me how much of KSP\u0027s time is spent calculating physics. Many people have stated that it\u0027s a majority, and it\u0027s definitely a possibility. Note that the more time spent in physics, the more the PhysX performance improvements help us.\n- If CPUs exist that present more than two virtual cores per physical core, I\u0027m not aware of them. They certainly could exist, I haven\u0027t kept up on this stuff nearly as closely in recent years."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T09:40:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - KSP is definitely multithreaded. \\*HOW\\* multithreaded is a question I can\u0027t answer.

I would imagine *(does not know for certain)* each of the 3 UI systems would be running in their own thread, so removing threads that could be updating / refreshing UI elements on screen, ought to help in some small way. If the UI performance hit could be tested by simply turning the UI display off with F2, that could be a benchmark. (Again, I don\u0027t know for certain, UI threads could still be taking CPU cycles in the background.) \nOur expectations grow to absorb and crush any advancement.

(EDIT - In a Unity5 Version of KSP, aka hopefully v1.1\u002B)\n\u003E First 3 reasons I can come up with for that are:\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nIt\u0027s primarily 2. A single vessel is made up of individual parts, yes, but the response of individual parts is dependent on the response of (all) other parts - they are *coupled.* You *can* break that into parts, but doing so costs management overhead, and if done poorly can result in even worse performance than single-threaded.\n\nIt should not be KSP doing this thread management. Not knowing anything else, it might not be Unity\u0027s responsibility either. Does PhysX do its own thread management, or does it only do the grunt work?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:26:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t understand what this means.\n\nIt means that, going by the context in which the remark on fairings was stated, we should not expect the way fairings decouple to be changed, only the way in which they shield parts for reentry heating, and their maximum temperatures / survivable reentries."}]}
