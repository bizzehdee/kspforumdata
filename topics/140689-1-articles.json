Identical models and textures... EXCEPT for color-coded stripes/decals to differentiate each parts\u0027 in-game resource storage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now, both identical parts, have the same 1MB textures/UV maps, EXCEPT for thin colored stripes across a couple of faces... Is there a way to share a single texture between them, and only overlay the different colors on the stripes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve looked thru several mods that have parts separated this way, but they all duplicate the full textures... So I wont be surprised if someone tells me what I want is not possible... However, it just seems like you should be able to make a layer for each color, inside a single texture; or at least export the layer for just the \u0022decal\u0022 externally, and be able to throw it back on top of the shared texture somehow...???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T01:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, totally doable. I do an enormous amount of texture sharing with my parts. If you make two separate MUs for the two parts, with only the UV mapping being slightly different between them, this is real easy. Make sure they use the same material name, and in Unity they will then both get the same texture name when you add the texture. You can then put both parts in the same folder to let them use the same texture there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other tricks for putting them in separate folders and still sharing the texture. But the easiest is just to throw them in the same folder. For examples of mine, you can look at Fuel Tanks Plus and Real Scale Boosters, and SpaceY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T03:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105424-necrobones/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105424\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105424-necrobones/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@NecroBones\u003C/a\u003E Huh...
