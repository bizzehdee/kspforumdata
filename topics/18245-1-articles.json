So for this mod I tried to combine the two, solve that annoyance and share it with the rest of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this mod does is make the stock command modules behave like the unmanned pods that MechJeb adds, but with crew. So you get a nice looking spaceship without MechJeb parts sticking out and a crew to play around with. Since v1.1 it also contains stock SAS modules with MechJeb integrated, for when you want .
