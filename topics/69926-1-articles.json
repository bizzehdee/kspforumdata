The higher the ground level the harder it becomes to land the plane safely due to lower atmospheric pressure, because you need to maintain higher velocity to glide down. You can counter this with enough wing surface area but that makes the second problem a lot worse, that being finding flat terrain suitable for landing. With large wings you are just begging for something to hit the ground and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the best idea would be to add some wings and control surfaces to make the targeted landing easier, but use parachute and drop slowly during the final phase.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaryulenko","CreatedById":76874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T22:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Othuyeg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Othuyeg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA crazy thought: Make a space plane.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor crazy it sounds, I think its the best solution for my need for a Descent vehicle, It could also be much more precise as i could do a powered glide to my destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad i can\u0027t test it well on Kerbin Atmosphere, so im gonna send my Prototype to Duna and see what happends.
