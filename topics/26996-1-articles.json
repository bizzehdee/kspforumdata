My program has slowly been progressing to where I want it to go. At first getting into orbit or even sub-orbit resulted with explosions and tears (although over time I have grown numb from the amount of Kerban\u0027s i\u0027ve killed), when I did my orbits were weird looking and could rarely be reproduced. Throw in that my rocket tech was widely inconsistent, not stable and really primitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver time though, my little Kerbal program has been advancing. We are now able to send the little guys into orbit consistently, giving them nice, flat, circular orbits. I even have gotten my rocket tech down somewhat, with my KHL series (Kerbal Heavy Lifter) being able to send fairly heavy loads into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current goal is to build what I\u0027ll call Station 1, a space station in orbit (at about 150k-200k km above kerbal. Its mission being to provide fuel to interplanetary missions, giving Kerbal a consistent space presence and to give me experience docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last part is where my difficultly comes in. To make my station, I need to perform about three docking operations to complete it. Even though the KHL series has made huge strides, it is not powerful enough to launch an entire space station. I have watched tutorials by Scott Manley, I am pretty good at getting it close enough to being able to see it on screen and seeing the little speed tracker change from Orbit to target. My problem is I can never get close enough to start using RCS to perform final docking procedure. So I was wondering if anyone had and tips or tricks, I am going to go back to the Scott Manly video again and see if I can get anything, but any suggestions would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL:DR\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need help docking, I can never get close enough to perform the final approach with RCS, how do I do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T17:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are dozens of tutorials on YouTube and on this forum that explain how to rendezvous and dock, as well as at least one or two threads everyday from people asking how to dock.

(within 100m or so) Adopting a higher orbit is one way of making this less of an issue, but the real solution is well placed thrusters(around your CG) and using the i j k l keys to re-orient your ship as it\u0027s coming in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T19:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf that gets too bad, I usually just time warp.

Now when it switches to target, your speed switches as well to m/s relative to your target. The prograde and retrograde (green indicators) switch as well so you know which way to apply thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis quick and dirty Tutorial will not be easy on fuel, but once you\u0027ve gotten it down, you can change the inefficient parts: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually I come in at the switch (orbit to target) at about 150m/s relative to target and when I get within 10k, or nearing as close to the target as possible, I will burn on the yellow/green retrograde to bleed off the speed. Here is where it isn\u0027t efficient, but easy to do: Burn off all the speed until you are at as close to 0m/s as you can. Now turn to the pink prograde (you should be pointed roughly in the direction of your target but use the navball for alignment) and accelerate towards the target to about 20 to 30 m/s (or slower depending on how close your initial encounter was. Of course since you are in orbit, the course will change over time and you will just have to repeat the above action over again once the distance to target tapers off). Once you make it within 1-2k from the target, keep the m/s much lower. Ideally you would want to keep your green prograde circle aligned over the pink indicator which will bring you to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you figure out the rough mechanics of it it become much easier and you can throw out some of the unnecessary burns as you progress, but the above guarantees you will get close to your target, just won\u0027t guarantee how much fuel you have left or how much time it would take, but you will get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to help you out, if you have unbalanced RCS thrust where you try to translate and it started to rotate your ship, you can use the asas with the rcs and it will keep your attitude and rotation constant and you can still manually adjust the translation, but this will burn quite a bit of RCS propellant...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-15T19:56:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2013 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tobmaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobmaster","CreatedById":57953,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T19:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you don\u0027t \u0022have to\u0022 start small...

After the burn, I set up a new maneuver node to match orbits, at the rendezvous.
