It is an armored assault vehicle with a flamethrower as its primary weapon. (Its actually just a rocket motor, but don\u0027t tell anyone, Nobody will buy it if they know the truth!) The Visigoth is capable of speeds over 20 m/s on flat terrain, and can survive most serious crashes with minimal damage. It has space for two Kerbals to operate the tank. But enough talk, you came here to SEE the tank, not to read about it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BJVkc8c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BJVkc8c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, here it is! The vehicle is popular among Kerbal tankers due to the flamethrower\u0027s ability to roast hot dogs and marshmallows when on low power.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cE6vpzV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cE6vpzV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Commander\u0027s station inside the tank.

Speaking of that, to fire the flamethrower, make sure that RCS and SAS are on, and that the legs at the back are extended. If the verniers don\u0027t fire automatically, press W and they should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C4mqjFp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C4mqjFp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb(standing on track) and Bill pose for photos during a patrol near the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things to remember when driving the tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Don\u0027t try and turn while going faster than 10 meters per second, or you risk flipping the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Don\u0027t fire the flamethrower unless the tank is fully stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Be careful when driving up hills, it likes to swerve back and forth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Never try to immediately brake the tank, especially when at high speed. Let it slow down a little first, then apply the brake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to invert the steering on the wheels. I\u0027m not sure why, but sometimes you have to press S to drive forward and W to go in reverse. A and D are likewise inverted. Other times, the controls are fine. I will fix this if I find out why it happens.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about all you need to know to operate the Visigoth, you can download yours here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/922/edit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/crafts/922/edit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to add other tanks to go along with the Visigoth in the future, if you have any ideas, just let me know!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T22:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red- the Engineer","CreatedById":123304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T23:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m terrible at tanks, and the fact that this one has a realistic interior makes me want to be good at them.

As far as I know, it\u0027s basically a cosmetic feature, as rocket exhaust doesn\u0027t seem to be that deadly in KSP. My future designs will hopefully have more functional features.
