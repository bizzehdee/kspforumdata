I then wanted to make them switch on and off in different patterns, one pattern per action group, by assigning the \u0027turn light off\u0027 / \u0027turn light on\u0027 action of every light into the action groups. So in the editor, I am adding either \u0027on\u0027 or \u0027off\u0027 for 36 separate lights (no symmetry) in each action group. So far, so good, the group actions column becomes a bit long but it seems to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever: as soon as I launch and I try out the different patterns, some patterns will work ok, but in others there\u0027s always a number of lights that decide not to participate. I revert, check back... and inevitably find that those lights are showing as if I had not set any actions for them at all. Ok... maybe I made a mistake. So I redo those lights, add their on/off actions again, save, and launch. Now some OTHER lights that were working before decide to go on strike on certain patterns, and it\u0027s not necessarily the same patterns affected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRinse repeat a couple of times, but I\u0027ve not yet managed to make all lights perform/remember their set actions. So, something keeps \u0027dropping\u0027 actions that were saved and properly showing in the editor before launching, and it\u0027s not always the same ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence my question: is there a maximum number of separate actions that will get triggered by an action group? Or a maximum to the overall total for all action groups together? Have I inadvertently stumbled onto a coded limit that I need to know about?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T05:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222681850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144103\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468887996\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152460\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swjr-swis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, swjr-swis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence my question: is there a maximum number of separate actions that will get triggered by an action group?

For example: Say you assign a light to toggle on action group 1 and also toggle on action group 2. Then you toggle the light ON with action group 1, then toggle it again with action group 2, it will stay ON (instead of turning off with the second toggle on action group 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T08:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222682133\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144103\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468904652\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100668\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Claw said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no limit, but what you\u0027re probably running into is that some of the actions are also sensitive to the state of the action group.

Which is why I did all patterns with an explicit \u0027turn on\u0027 or \u0027turn off\u0027 per light for all lights in each pattern, one full pattern per action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I explicitly tell every single light in the grid to either turn on or turn off... that should work, yes? Except it doesn\u0027t: there\u0027s always some lights that after having set their action, it won\u0027t stick once launched, and when I get back in the editor, the uncooperative lights show no action set. Somehow it\u0027s not actually being saved. I redo them, add the missing on/off actions, launch... and now thos work, but some other couple of lights decide they won\u0027t play along. Back in the editor... now those lights have no actions set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s acting like there some type of limit and as soon as I set more actions than that limit, it wipes some others. Not sure if it\u0027s by some type of order, or randomly... it seemed random.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-12T07:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could experiment. Get some structural plates and install a probe core, a battery and a grid of lights. Set your action groups and see what works and what doesn\u0027t Keep adding lights till you get glitches. Then your lights are in neat rows and columns. You can see exactly which lights (by order of installation and by order of action group setting) fail, and count out the amount that work.
