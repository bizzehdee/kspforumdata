(I don\u0027t have a thread yet, nothing is in game).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having trouble finding tutorials online for animating things in Blender, specifically things like landing gear (not modeled yet), animated docking ports (I have the base part modeled, but I have to add the whole docking mechanism and animate it etc), and a cargo bay. I\u0027m sure the tutorials are buried in topics that I\u0027m too lazy to find, although they are probably on the first page of the forum labeled\u00A0\u0022SGT! EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS HERE!!!1!!1!!!,\u0022 but the best way to find a book is to ask the librarian (that\u0027s probably a saying). I have an album that has the basic parts laid out, then I focus on the cargo bay. I\u0027ll explain everything with some text underneath the album.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3UR5l/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAll the parts so far, for now I\u0027m focusing on the center module and\u00A0or the cargo bay. Everything has to be remodeled, a certain CobaltWolf said I should base it off a 1.25-meter cube, when in reality to get the proper adaptation to 1.875 (BDB Transtage Size) I would need to base it off a 1 meter cube for the better-looking adaptation. However, before I remodel it would be nice to experiment on a canvas I\u0027ve already assembled.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClose up of the Cargo bay.
