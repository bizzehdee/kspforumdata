Why is the Kerbol System the way it is? Why don\u0027t we have a comet? Why don\u0027t we have a second asteroid? Why isn\u0027t the Mun inclined like the real one? Why don\u0027t we have a NKO (Near-Kerbin Object)? Well, I want a more realistic Kerbol system, without the rescales and packs. So, I\u0027m starting development for this. I need to find out how to fix the objects, and create the files etc. I expect this to be easy, as it\u0027s just moving and fixing bodies, so it\u0027s not going to take forever and ever. Here\u0027s what I plan to fix.\n\n**Inner System**\n\nMoho gets a thin atmosphere that extends to 20km\n\nEve becomes moonless, as Gilly will be a comet or a NKO (haven\u0027t decided yet)\n\nKerbin gets a Mun that has a 5 degree inclination (I wanted to do 23.5 like the real one, but I want to keep it simple), and Minmus will be a comet\n\nDuna\u0027s Moon Ike will get inclined to 10 degrees and sized down to 50km (Phobos analog sorta)\n\nDres will get neighbors, Pol and maybe Bop (again not sure)\n\n**Outer System**\n\nJool will get an atmosphere that extends to 300km, no other changes\n\nLaythe, Eeloo and Tylo will get orbits inclined of 3 degrees\n\nVall and Eeloo will get switched\n\nVall will get a moon (possibly Bop)\n\nThis is the plan for the mod, it may come out soon, depending on how long and how hard. Here we go, to restart the Kerbol System to a more realistic, fun experience."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:58:54Z","Content":"Is this a bad idea?

In my opinion, more than a changed and more challenging Kerbol System, a Real Solar System rescaled to Kerbol proportions will be more appreciate, while there are other mods (Outer Planet) that improve the realism and challenging of the Kerbol System without some changes that someone could love or not. \n\nJust my opinion of course. If I can help in any way, feel free to ask."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:21:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi, I think you had a great idea.

Stock size and realistic will be one of the best mod ever. In 0.90 there was many Re-sized Kerbol or Solar System that were really hard to handle, first RSS. But they weren\u0027t so much interesting, except for a few of them. At the moment there are just a couple of mods updated for 1.0.2 that changes the Kerbol System, in a interesting way, but not so beauty as a Kerbol sized RSS will be."}]}
