Evolution can\u0027t look forward and engineer for its goal. Fortunately you can easily imagine several paths towards biological rocketry. One example from the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you start with a species like the bombardier beetle, one with a chemical defense mechanism. Due to evolutionary pressure and random chance the predator feeding on these beetles and the beetles get in a biological arms race. The beetle produces an ever more potent reaction while the predator becomes more and more immune to it. At some point the beetle has such a strong reaction that it can use it as propulsion mechanism to fly away from the predator. This becomes the new focal survival strategy of the beetle and you\u0027re left with a rocket propelled beetle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step: long, sustained rocketry and orbital flights is a bit harder to imagine. There isn\u0027t really anything up there that life would want. The only resources life could exploit in orbit are unfiltered sunlight and safety from all predators. Sunlight is not exactly a premium resource that life wants. Plants only use a very small fraction of the sunlight they receive thanks to overheating problems. So it is hard to imagine any species migrating to orbital heights for light unless the entire atmosphere is saturated with dense airborne algea or something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong sustained rocketry is also very expensive from an energy PoV, so the payoff has to be really good. Safety might be able to do it, but I imagine evolution would take a different route. Not to mention that an organism with a lot of delta V has to be large, and thus has less natural predators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone is able to conjure up a reason for evolution to push towards orbital flight I\u0027d like to hear it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T10:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat distance does it assume \u0022g\u0022 is at in that equation?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI presumed that the topic starter means Earth-like life forms, so if the same \u0022g\u0022 and the same air pressure are on planet surface, the more-or-less same atmosphere thickness you will get above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat less because gravity will decrease faster due to greater height/radius ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T10:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...
