I don\u0027t know how to fix it, i have added an advanced sas module as well as having no sas module at all and i still get the same results, anyone know what im doing wrong, help would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T22:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Fergi182, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d help a great deal if you could provide the craft file and a picture, use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImgur\u003C/a\u003E to upload the pics, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epastebin\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMediafire\u003C/a\u003E works well for the .craft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T22:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS is a gyro that exerts forces itself to correct the course while ASAS co-ordinates other control mechanisms on the vehicle (canards, thrust vectoring, SAS modules) so to the same job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like the rocket is either not balanced (you\u0027ve got more engines or more weight on one side) or it\u0027s got so much wobble/instability that it\u0027s simply overwhelming the control mechanisms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple SAS modules will help strong-arm the rocket back on course but it may be easier to fix the design fault, but as Sal says we\u0027d need some idea of the layout of the rocket if you want some more specific idea on what it could be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
