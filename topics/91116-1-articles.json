You will vigorously be injected with knowledge beyond your liking, this will hurt. But seriously now. This thread will be my way of showing other people how to build SSTO space planes. \u0022But shouldn\u0027t this be in the tutorial section?\u0022 you might ask.

Simply said, I will make many crafts describing the basics of SSTO making. With each one, you will learn more about something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EChapter 1 - Planes in space you say?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Eft. Drittle - a little non air hogging SSTO\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To start off this series, I will give you one if the simple-iest SSTO crafts I have made. The \u0022Drittle\u0022 is very new player friendly and is very easy to use. Though very inefficient, you can just take off and point this craft at 45 degrees and fly up until the jet engine burns out. By then you have an apoapsis of greater than 70 km and you still have enough dV to circularize. I suggest building up as much speed in the atmosphere as possible, so just fly up to 10 km with your jet and point at 25 degrees until you flame out. After that, point up 45 degrees and activate your rocket engines until your apoapsis is above 75 km. After that you can cruise up to apoapsis and circularize or do whatever, you still have a lot of dV. Don\u0027t worry about stability or anything other than your fuel. It has batteries and no part clipping was used. Everything on the craft can be spotted from the outside and no tricks are done here. Just a simple and easy SSTO for getting your beginner into Space. This craft has a single jet engine and is therefor very light. It is easily carried through space with its 2 little rockomax motors, which are very very good for small crafts. They have a very high TWR and therefor can increase your dV more than ISP can. The Drittle has enough lift and control surfaces to be stable and easily controlled. It has two RAM intakes and one circular, all feeding one engine for a light craft. The lesson learned with this craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Keep SSTOs light\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You can build good looking SSTOs, but before that, you have to learn to make normal SSTOs. Keep part count, weight, and wings to a lower number for basic SSTOs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4pp61\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
