Such as setting parts to use voxel models during thermodynamic calculations instead of the stock drag cube system. If that a dumb question so be it, but I wondered if the drag cube are used at all with far, and if far was using a better system that is more robust than stock drag cubes.

Like, seriously breaking kinds of issues; I don\u0027t think all of your mods are up-to-date or compatible with 1.0.4. Your GameData screenshot seems to have been corrupted, so I don\u0027t even know all of what you had, and you do need to tell me the versions, not have me go on a goose chase to find them; lots of things happen in a week, and all of a sudden old information gets lost because it\u0027s replaced with a new mod version or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, the problem was solved. I unistalled FAR, opened KSP and played a bit to check it then I reinstalled and the issue was gone. I also noticed an increase of patches from module manager during load. I don\u0027t know if this helps. anyway, the problem is gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe over-overheating was HeatControl.
