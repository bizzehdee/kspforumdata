First noticed this because vehicles would start rolling down the runway from either end, regardless of which direction they were facing, and without any control inputs. I recorded a video showing how the height changes along the length of the runway. Testing was done on the south runway, and it goes from approximately 116m ASL on the west end, down to 95m ASL near the east end, back to 98m ASL on the east end (I\u0027m subtracting 3m from what the video shows since the rover\u0027s cockpit is about 3m off the ground).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C0rRUH48xsI?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 Runway Height Changes\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Note: video has been sped up approximately 16x\u003Cbr\u003E\n** Incidentally, the FPS counter appears to wig out while recording (using the Win\u002BG overlay in Windows 11).
