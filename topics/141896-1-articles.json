This caused the metal sheets to wobble (closing and opening its gap) each time it opened the thrust fluctuated from 0 to almost normal engine thrust.

It would work just the way you\u0027re thinking, too. It doesn\u0027t even need to rely on gyroscopic precession, it can just be \u0027the reaction wheel spins one way so the ship spins the other way\u0027, though folks have definitely made some more complicated designs! The trouble Snark is pointing out is that there\u0027s a limit to to how fast the little wheels can spin, so there\u0027s a crippling limit on how fast they can spin your craft. Once a wheel is spinning as fast as it can go, it can\u0027t provide any more torque for that direction, which is called saturation.That would mean that once you\u0027ve used the reaction wheel a certain (small) amount in one direction, it would suddenly stop working! Realistic max rotation speeds for crafts are slow, and the reaction wheels would also saturate really really (really) fast if they\u0027re fighting external torques like aerodynamic effects, misaligned engines or rocket-gimbal, as commonly occur in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo desaturate a reaction control wheel so it can provide torque in that direction again, you would need to give the wheel a chance to slow down by torqueing against it with (for practical purposes) RCS, so we\u0027d need to bring RCS anyways. Ultimately, the reaction wheels would be useful for gentle attitude control or very slow manuevers, while the RCS would be used for any typical KSP style maneuvering.

reaction wheels.\u00A0 Having the reaction wheels just means that they can use them for #1 tasks instead of wasting fuel on that.\u00A0 The thing that\u0027s wrong with KSP reaction wheels is that they can do #2, which in real life is impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, I hear you say, you keep going on and on about how \u0022it\u0027s impossible\u0022, Snark.\u00A0 What\u0027s so impossible about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the deal:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a really important law of physics, right up there with the law of conservation of mass-energy, conservation of momentum, and so forth.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAngular momentum is conserved.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Put simply, you can\u0027t make an object spin in one direction without making something else spin in the opposite direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, although angular \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emomentum\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is conserved, angular \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eposition\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is not, which is why reaction wheels are a thing.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say you have a spaceship that has a reaction wheel on board.\u00A0 The ship is floating in space, and is at a dead standstill, rotationally speaking.\u00A0 Nothing\u0027s rotating at all:\u00A0 not the ship, not the wheel.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say the ship is pointed east, and you want it to be pointing west.\u00A0 What do you do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple:\u00A0 you start the reaction wheel spinning.\u00A0 To start it spinning, you\u0027ve got an electric motor mounted on the ship.\u00A0 It exerts torque on the wheel to start it spinning up to, let\u0027s say, 1000 RPM.\u00A0 Doing that exerts an equal and opposite torque on the motor, which is mounted to the ship, so the ship starts rotating in the opposite direction to the wheel.\u00A0 But since the ship is much, much bigger and more massive than the wheel, it rotates much more slowly than the wheel does.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say it\u0027s rotating at 0.1 RPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... you just wait five minutes (with the wheel spinning the whole time), after which the ship has rotated 180 degrees and is now pointing the direction you want it to.\u00A0 Now you need to stop the ship.\u00A0 How do you do this?\u00A0 Easy:\u00A0 Just apply brakes to the reaction wheel and stop it.\u00A0 This torques the wheel in the opposite direction that you did when you spun it up... which means it torques the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eship\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the opposite direction that you initially started it rotating.\u00A0 And it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eprecisely\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E equal and opposite amount (that\u0027s what conservation of angular momentum is all about).\u00A0 So no high-tech is needed:\u00A0 just put on the brakes and stop the wheel.\u00A0 Presto, both ship and wheel are now precisely at a dead halt with no rotation, and the ship is pointed the opposite direction from what it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, that\u0027s what a reaction wheel \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecannot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do is supply a torque that permanently affects the rotation of the ship.\u00A0 In the above scenario, suppose I have a ship that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealready\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E slowly rotating at 0.1 RPM, and I want to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estop\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it.\u00A0 Well, I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E stop it with the reaction wheel (by spinning it up to 1000 RPM to counter the rotation)... and now I have the ship happily sitting there, stopped.\u00A0 That\u0027s what I wanted, right?\u00A0 Except that now my reaction wheel is spinning madly at 1000 RPM and I can\u0027t use it anymore for torque in that direction because that\u0027s as fast as it can go.\u00A0 This is what we mean when we say the wheel is \u0022saturated\u0022.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EAnd there is no way to de-saturate it without precisely mathematically UNdoing all the work that it just did\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Sure, you can stop the wheel rotating by applying the brakes... which will start the ship rotating again in exactly the direction and speed that it was going before you turned on the wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an analogy that might help to think of it:\u00A0 You have a big house (your ship), and one fairly small trash can (the reaction wheel).\u00A0 The house contains a certain amount of trash (unwanted angular momentum).\u00A0 Yes, you can clean up your house, to a certain limited extent, by picking up the trash and moving it into the trash can.\u00A0 However... you can only put a certain amount of trash into the can, and then \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eit\u0027s full and can\u0027t hold any more.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 Furthermore, there\u0027s no way to get rid of the trash in the trash can, because all the doors and windows are sealed shut and it\u0027s a closed system.\u00A0 The only way to empty the trash can is to take the trash out of it and strew it around the house again.\u00A0 The thing that\u0027s wrong about KSP reaction wheels is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E simply \u0022the trash can is unrealistically big\u0022 (though it is).\u00A0 Rather, they\u0027re implemented in a way that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emakes the trash magically disappear when you put it into the can\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 And \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is the impossible part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRCS isn\u0027t subject to these limitations.\u00A0 In the above analogy, if you have RCS, you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E empty the trash can, because RCS opens a window and tosses the trash out through that.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Edestroy\u003C/em\u003E the trash (which is impossible), but it gets it out of the house, which is all you care about.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

ship, and a little one-kilogram reaction wheel can rotate that giant ship by as many degrees as you like.\u00A0 (It will take practically forever, but give it enough time and it\u0027ll get there.)\u00A0 What it can\u0027t do (and which the KSP wheels can, which is what makes them impossible) is impart persistent rotation to the

doesn\u0027t seem like the flywheel can keep\u00A0accelerating infinity and never shatter; I was really just speculating on a couple of\u00A0hopefully computationally easy ways to simulate the\u00A0saturation effect.\u00A0\u00A0 So by limiting the amount of degrees, I\u0027m not saying that is the way it works in real life, I\u0027m saying that would be a quickie way (programming short cut)\u00A0of including saturation into the problem as that is programmatically probably a quick way of approximating RL saturation, sure your ship keeps rotating it\u0027s just the reaction wheel is no longer helping.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as to how to slow it down using \u0022brakes\u0022 i.e. get rid of the excess momentum,\u00A0well due to the complications my idea was to simply give a short period where the wheel no longer works, this way we don\u0027t have to calculate all the counter effects, while of course it\u0027s still not acting like it should in RL, at least it\u0027s a little closer.\u00A0\u00A0This method is also, of course computationally\u00A0easy (since you don\u0027t have to compute anything just wait a bit).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you can, if I understand how they work, use torque rods if you happen to be in a convenient magnetic field to bleed off the momentum without effecting the ship instead you bleed it of to whatever is generating the magnetic field (in LEO that would be the Earth, of course); sort of like we rob a planet of\u00A0a bit of its\u00A0momentum when we slingshot around it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce that is done and we have a more realistic wheel than we might go for the second part and\u00A0simulate exactly how the reaction wheel works if we want to get closer to the real thing than our semi-realistic wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, it may well be that 99.9% of people trying to use a realistic reaction wheel

fixing this in \u0022unwarped time\u0022 is trivial. \u00A0Just add a \u0022F=Gm1m2/r**2\u0022 for each body in the system. \u00A0Problem: you can\u0027t have \u0022physicsless warp\u0022 anymore. \u00A0I\u0027m not sure how they deal with that (and does it make ion drives functional?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0The planets/moons are on rails. \u00A0Well, first you have to fix Jool\u0027s moons, because they have been known to be unstable for quite some time (and early simulation showed a moon ejected only after a few orbits). \u00A0Then your calculations bog down as you get to compute that \u0022F=Gm1m2/r**2\u0022 as it scales factorally over the number of bodies you are willing to calculate. \u00A0Somehow I suspect that for anyone willing to get rid of Squads SOI hack, they feel fixing this is necessary (I doubt it changes the game at all).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, the problem is remarkably similar to the \u0022inertial wheel problem\u0022. \u00A0While doing the physics is *hard*, the reason you need to do hard physics is the UI (KSP players like warp and don\u0027t want to sit and watch in realtime). \u00A0Basically it comes down to how accurate you want your maneuver nodes. \u00A0Computing a maneuver node requires you to simulate all the physics for the entire length of time the maneuver node shows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing the UI for running out of available angular momentum is easy. \u00A0Using RCS to compensate while reducing the angular velocity of the wheels is something else. \u00A0I\u0027m sure there are kerbal players at APL (Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, the place that runs Hubble), can we find them and ask them how they control Hubble\u0027s reaction wheels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T16:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

know their work.\u00A0 And I suspect they know how to type \u0022PID formula\u0022 into the Google search box as well as you or I do.\u00A0 KSP has its share of problems, but those problems are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u0022because the developers don\u0027t know how to code.\u0022\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

don\u0027t have any more insight than you do into the answer to your question.\u00A0 However, speaking as an outside-observer-of-Squad for the past couple of years, not to mention as a professional software engineer with a couple of decades of industry experience, I\u0027d have to say that I\u0027d be astonished if they took you up on such an offer.\u00A0 If they want the code, they can just write it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that SAS has such problems is not just a matter of \u0022here, take a couple of hours from someone who knows what they\u0027re doing, bang out the code and it\u0027s done.\u0022\u00A0 There are good software-development reasons.\u00A0 They have finite time, finite money, and finite staff.\u00A0 They can\u0027t do everything at once.\u00A0 And this isn\u0027t just a simple PID controller; the game has a lot of complex interactions among multiple parts (including ships that can wobble), and something that sounds good on paper can\u0027t actually be released to the players until it has been extensively tested in just about every possible scenario (which, given the Lego-like nature of KSP, is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ea doubleplus much very big lot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.)\u00A0 This is especially the case since SAS is such a vital, central, game-unplayable-without-it feature to the game that they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E can\u0027t take any chances with breaking it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe TL;DR:\u00A0 whenever you\u0027re using a piece of software, and you see something that looks like it ought to be easy, and is obviously sorely needed, and isn\u0027t there... there\u0027s probably a good reason it isn\u0027t (yet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my guess is that the idea\u0027s a non-starter.\u00A0 But by all means bring it to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

didn\u0027t come across that way! I feel exactly the opposite, in fact. To explain my point of view, one of the many hats I wear in my day job is a control systems engineer including many-complex-interacting-parts systems, so you know, not wanting to stick my nose in, it just got me thinking. On the other hand I\u0027ve also written physics analysis software and simple/unpopular videogames, so we\u0027ll say I have a front line experience and appreciation for what squad\u0027s accomplished, which is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. A CAD system, which I pine for when using the professional alternatives. I\u0027m looking at you, autocad!\u003Cbr\u003E\nB. A multifacetted physics simulator that\u0027s accurate enough to be highly educational but simple enough to be highly enjoyable\u003Cbr\u003E\nC.

I also have an appreciation for how a small team can\u0027t have an expert in everything, so I don\u0027t worry too much when the control systems for my rocket start oscillating divergently. It was just a thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, hot topic, apparently!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
