It\\\u0027s a nightmare texturing the current model, and I find it quite unsatisfactory (and non-Kerbal), plus I have learnt a few new things regarding modeling so I\\\u0027m redoing it from scratch. The good news is that it\\\u0027s going to have twice as much connection points now, most likely. Which means more insanity.
