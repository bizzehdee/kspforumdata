I despise being made a fool by the actions of other people. When I\u0027m wrong, that\u0027s on me, but when someone else changes the supposed facts around so that I\u0027m wrong (but not actually wrong, but I think I\u0027m wrong, but I\u0027m right in the end), it just gets me frustrated. And not the kind of \u0022get up and do something\u0022 frustrated. I mean the kind of frustrated that makes you wonder why you even got out of bed in the morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd considering I have been diagnosed with depression, and some days already have enough trouble getting out of bed that\u0027s not very helpful, now is it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 2: It\u0027s coming from pretty much the same place in my psyche that makes me really hate dealing with people that can\u0027t just accept the well known and well proven facts (said facts having been proven independently countless times), rather than continuing to operate on their own (incorrect and/or harmful) beliefs. I can accept that I\u0027m wrong, when it\u0027s proven to me, why do I have to go beyond proving it to someone for them to believe the facts that I\u0027ve laid out for them? I do my best to give a complete picture, why do people have the need to reduce everything to a soundbyte or meme? I mean I like memes, but that format of information conveyance has it\u0027s limitations, as do soundbytes. And I tend to talk about subjects that are highly resistant to being reduced to so few words as those found in a soundbyte or meme. There is such a thing as an idea that is complex enough that you can\u0027t just \u0022explain like I\u0027m 5 years old\u0022. Sometimes the adults need to use a lot of big words in a single sentence. That doesn\u0027t meant the subject is bad. It just means you need to take a bit and actually listen for more than a minute or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a time and a place - ruining the fun isn\u0027t necessary, is it? \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WelshSteW","CreatedById":202966,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-03T10:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224110588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187338\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648924699\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210926\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tundra\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Tundra said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone did that math and the equation on the black board, when solved, gives you a number.\u00A0 That number, if it means seconds, would put the date that it is referencing as September 3.\u00A0 \u00A0That seems like an accurate ballpark, so I think it might be correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quite like the theory, but 3rd Sept is a Saturday.

All I was doing was explaining why in fact I am like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for an additional bit of information that probably makes it all click, I have in fact been diagnosed with an Autism-spectrum disorder (Asperger\u0027s Syndrome). I also have ADHD, MDD, and type 2 Bipolar disorder (tho that last one only manifests as a sleep disorder, and thankfully I take medicine that seems to treat it well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I hope you can pardon me if my head\u0027s not entirely screwed on right. Trust me, if I could fix it myself, I would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps I\u0027m transferring my stress from one topic to another, as current events in western Europe also have me worried for my own safety here in the US, not because I\u0027m not a native US citizen but because... well lets just say I\u0027d rather that long-range rockets don\u0027t get involved, no matter who pushes the button first. I think I\u0027m starting to understand the kind of existential fear my parents had during the Cold War.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe world is pretty rough right now, I don\u0027t think I can blame anyone for being a bit on edge. Honestly after 2 years of Covid and now this I don\u0027t know how anyone is keeping it together. Things got a little testy in the \u0027Is KSP dead\u0027 thread, but it feels like folks are settling back down. Im hoping we can all be really generous with each other, take comments and opinions for what they are and not harp too badly even when folks are venting. Sometimes we all need a good vent.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust as an aside I\u0027ve always marveled at your knowledge on the technical/engineering side.
