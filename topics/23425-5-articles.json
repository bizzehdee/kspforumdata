Just like lots of us in this thread Glushko looked at the NASA shuttle and told everyone it was a really bad idea. But his bosses insist that America built the shuttle to drop nukes on the USSR from orbit and they had to have one too. Now Glushko had this obsession with building a base on the Moon and he knew that to do that he first needed a Saturn V sized rocket. So instead of simply copying the shuttle like his bosses wanted he put all the big engines on the \u0022External Tank\u0022 instead of the orbiter and used two liquid fuel boosters instead of SRBs. The result was a moonshot sized rocket that vaguely looked like the NASA shuttle\u0027s ET\u002BSRB that could loft 100 ton of dead weight (eg, Buran which didn\u0027t have any engines) to LEO. Of course since none of the thrust actually came from Buran the Energia doesn\u0027t actually care what that 100 ton of payload is, thus instead of Buran you could put any thing else on there (say, parts for a moon base?). Glushko was gambling that once the bosses see that Buran didn\u0027t actually have much purpose they would switch focus back to the moon and he can then jump up and say \u0022oh hey, we just happen to have this 100 ton to LEO rocket in production to send stuff to the moon, isn\u0027t that convenient!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it probably would have worked too, if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that Soviet Union fall apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shuttle","CreatedById":5225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T10:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, we didn\u0027t loose RD-171 so we at least have a powerful engine.

I do want to see humans back on the Moon within a reasonable time scale. LEO is nice and all; the space shuttle was a beautiful craft which was an icon, both then and in the future, and I\u0027ll miss it, but not the program itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs our good friend Konstantin Tsiolkovsky said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEarth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T05:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf they just continued with Apollo and the Space Race still continued(although without violent conflict) I can\u0027t imagine what could have been the technology today, We might have a large moon outpost by now and a decent colony on mars and just starting to do terraforming\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T20:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENASA started off with a perfect combination of political will and government-corperate cooperation, and got to the moon in under a decade from the goal being set with an excellent booster rocket that managed 4000-8000 adjusted dollars per lbs to orbit. Afterwards it all collapsed because of political stupidy combined with nasa engineer in a euphoric high from the moon landings thinking they could do anything without considering cost or reality. Politics killed the Apollo program and NASA in a state of abject delusions put all its hopes and dreams on the space shuttle program, a program that really should have been put on the back burners until the technology was ready like by the 1990\u0027s or even 2000\u0027s to build a 2 stage fully-reusable rocket. The cooperate contracts really started bleeding nasa dry with request that the space shuttle use ATKs boosters, could luanch military payloads into odd orbits, etc, trying to turn the space shuttle already overbearing task of reusability into a swiss army rocket that appeased everyone, resulting in a design that appeased no one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the space shuttle should have started out as a much more limited reusable upper stage place on a standard Saturn I, Saturn downgrade or Titan rocket that would have revealed problems like the cermic thermal tiles being hell to manage and thus future designs using much stronger-easier to manage metal alloy tiles or even spray/plaster-on ablatives ala Space X. That knowledge would have allowed for the creation of truly excellent space shuttle with all the teething problems solves before it was designed and built. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk yes woulda-shoulda-coulda, what is the lessons to learn so a mistake like the space shuttle does not happen again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Politics can\u0027t be trusted: it worked once but now all it manages to do is create one bloated contracted-out program after another, the space shuttle then Constellation now SLS, each one an increasing degeneration of the former created by lack of money conflicting with goals too grand. The solution MAYBE to let corporations build it all for NASA, like SpaceX, this of course depends on if SpaceX can really deliver, so far they have, and may prove that single contracts with minimal sub-contracting is the solution to space travels cost problem, perhaps if SpaceX rally does deliver on their price promises they will have proven that the whole problem with space travel costs had nothing to do with space travel its self and everything to do with contract lawyers and lobbyist raping NASA and the government for every dollar they could thrust out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If it works don\u0027t replace it: This was a lesson most definitely not learn, not even after Mike Griffins jaring speech on how we should have stayed with Apollo. The Constellation program for example had the appearance of being a shuttle derived booster but in fact almost everything was changed out: bigger wider fuel tank, longer boosters, new engines, original upper stage, etc, etc. Instead of created a Direct style or Shuttle C rocket using as much of the shuttle parts as possible (and thus least money and time) that would have had a reasonable launch capacity of 75 tons to Lbs, thus tripling the lift capacity without having to pay the expense of refurbishing a shuttle, they set out for grander goals that was guaranteed to go beyond their pathetic budget, they wanted lift capacities beyond Apollo, a whole family or rockets before they even had the ones working, etc, the result was perpetual delays and over costs and rightful termination. Now they have returned to a more shuttle derived design but its too late, no infrastructure from the shuttle program remains, might as well build a whole new rocket now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenWolf","CreatedById":65798,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T06:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs has been said before, I won\u0027t miss the shuttle program, but the shuttle itself was pretty cool looking. Space travel is really in the hands of the private sector now, and that is a good thing. Look at SpaceX, they\u0027ve managed to accomplish every goal they\u0027ve set for themselves, and I have high hopes for their future endeavors. And then there\u0027s Ad Astra Rocket Company run by a former astronaut who have developed a working ion engine (look up VASIMR for more details). And while we wait for NASA to make a vehicle capable of getting to space, we still have Soyuz, which has an incredibley high safety record, especially when compared to say, a space shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also interesting to note that NASA\u0027s current budget is almost 10% of what it\u0027s budget was during the Apollo era, yet the government wants them to send people to Mars by 2030. At the current rate their going, NASA might not have even gotten back to the Moon by then, and SpaceX will be exploring the Jovian system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
