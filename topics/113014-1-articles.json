I created simple car, just four wheels and a sit.\n\nThe problem begins on the lanchpad (or runaway, I tested both) when I press W - car accelerate as it suppose to. But when I press S acceleration begins to increase till it reach max speed. Even from the first step, if I press S car just don\u0027t go backwards. I\u0027ve already changed keys to numpad, so nothing should interfere with settings. Does somebody know what is wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T07:58:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 07:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad\\_Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T07:55:45Z","Content":"Try ModuleWheelFix in[this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2e-3-10-Jun-15%29) see whether it fixes the problem"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad_Scientist","CreatedById":145581,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T16:41:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Try ModuleWheelFix in[this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2e-3-10-Jun-15%29) see whether it fixes the problem\n\nNope, did not helped.

First I deleted all folders in GameData (except Squad of course), and bug dissapeared. The next thing to check - what addon create such interaction with wheels. By adding addons one-by-one I found that [ksp-advanced-flybywire](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95022-0-90-AFBW-v1-5-1-%28Joystick-controller-mod-we-re-back!%29) does the job. I think there is a way to change it somewhere in settings of addon, but for now I just delete it.\n\nThanks everybody for help!!"}]}
