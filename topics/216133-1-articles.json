Currently, we can only invert all inputs in the parts manager, which won\u0027t do if only 1 or 2 deflections are reversed. I\u0027ve had to resort to splitting elevons into 2 wing pieces, one that only does roll, and an inverted one that only does pitch, for example. This results in weaker output, higher part count. wings that are even more fragile than they normally are, and an increase in weight since our procedural wings do not have procedural mass.

If you make a wing smaller and thinner than its default configuration, the mass of your craft shown in the engineering report will go down.
