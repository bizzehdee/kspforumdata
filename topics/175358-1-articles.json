I\u0027d make an intercept point that was very close, maybe down to 500m, and the relative speed under 5 m/s, but never completely circularized my orbit.\u00A0 This resulted in me watching the target get really close to me, and then start sailing away in the other direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest advice I can give from someone who struggled with this until last week, is match one side of the orbit (let\u0027s say the apoapsis are both the same) and keep the perapsis a few 1000m lower, so that your target craft is moving slower than you are in a complete orbit.\u00A0 Once your current craft and your target craft are pretty close, within 5km, circularize the orbit.\u00A0 I found that by doing that, I could then just make minor tweaks to radial in/out, prograde/retrograde, and normal/anti-normal, to get the craft closer together and the approach speed lower, until I could get the craft down to about 500-1000m and use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to get my current craft down to 0.0m/s relative velocity, and then use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to do the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
