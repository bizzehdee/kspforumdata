Out of the gate: Kerbal Space Program 1 is a fun simulator, but it\u0027s not a very good \u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E. Games, especially good ones, have certain characteristics: understandable and compelling mechanics,\u00A0a fundamentally sound and complete gameplay loop, and when they\u0027re especially good they provide relatively efficient and tight game balance across as broad a range of creatively driven\u00A0 solutions as possible. With KSP2\u0027s scope there are challenges to the first two points but I\u0027d like to focus on the third.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart of the reason KSP1\u0027s funds \u002B reputation based contract model never really worked well is because funds as a resource fails in two ways:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Funds are extraordinarily difficult to scale to a wide range of playstyles. Some players like to play one mission at a time all the way through one after another. Other players like to spread out several or dozens of missions simultaneously and juggle between them. What we\u0027re looking for is a resource system (including money or not) that is able to scale to both approaches. Having a single, universally fungible and transmittable resource like money actually makes this much harder. When you\u0027re designing a resource you\u0027ve got two main potential pitfalls: either the resource is so scarce that players must grind to acquire it, or its too abundant in which case it rapidly ceases to be a meaningful constraint. In an open world game like KSP this poses a problem for a resource like funds or money, because some players will prefer to do lots of missions around Kerbin first and others will set out and travel all the way to Jool, and there\u0027s no sensible way to scale the rewards between different player approaches. You\u0027re inevitably going to leave some players frustrated because there\u0027s not enough and other players underwhelmed because there\u0027s too much. Wherever you set the reward dial for local and distant rewards you\u0027ve in-effect hard-coded a preferential gameplay style.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving multiple, locally gathered resources doesn\u0027t fall into this trap because resources can be scaled to their local environment and the \u0027next hop\u0027 rather than needing to be scaled across the scope of gameplay. If methalox is abundant locally and uranium or He3 is not you might change the way you play, or choose to set up a supply route to combine a lucrative groove of materials at an opportune hub. You\u0027re not just looking to MAX MONEY, you\u0027re looking at the actual local situation and what its opportunities are. More fundamentally the thing you\u0027re harvesting isn\u0027t able to be magically transported from planet to planet. The very act of detecting it, gathering it, and transporting it is an integral part of KSP as a space traversal game. Money doesn\u0027t behave the way physical materials do. It\u0027s fundamentally non-physical, and so plays at best an oblique role in a game about physics.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) There\u0027s no sensible limit or constraint on the storage of money. Why is this a problem?\u00A0 Players don\u0027t usually worry about having too much of something*, but game designers do. Again, if a resource becomes rapidly overabundant it ceases to have meaning in the game. If I have 8 zillion funds I can build whatever I want as big as I want wherever I want and I\u0027m no longer thinking about efficiency or locality at all. Again you\u0027ve run into the scaling problem where some gameplay styles will rapidly reward players and max out the central currency and other gameplay styles will be relatively inefficient. The way to solve this is to make materials \u003Cem\u003Elocal\u003C/em\u003E and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ephysical\u003C/em\u003E. You\u0027re not just heaping up mountains of cash, you need to devote resources to storage and transportation. Players aren\u0027t just going to store oceans of methalox in mountains of tanks. They\u0027re going to produce what they need most and then proceed on to the next thing they need most. If you can keep players hopskotching from one resource to the next and each base to the next then as they say you\u2019ve got a pot of stew going.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Ideally, especially in a game that\u0027s about exploring space and efficient resource utilization players \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E care about having too much of something. If you have too much of something its because you didn\u0027t adequately invest in gathering and processing \u003Cem\u003Esomething else\u003C/em\u003E. Building an efficient, self-sustaining colony should be less like cornering\u00A0 or glutting a niche market and more like carefully balancing a few or several resources to maintain equilibrium and, if done well, produce a viable export. This is both more like the real wold and more engaging as gameplay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-24T04:19:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2023 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 24\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Book","CreatedById":213249,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-24T05:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224305065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690128473\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228506\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunarMetis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, LunarMetis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m not too sure how it would work for early-game, since you won\u0027t have any colonies or production facilities established yet on any celestial body.
