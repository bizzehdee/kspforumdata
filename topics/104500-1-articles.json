This is the video that really clarified the Oberth effect to me. \nOhioBob demonstrated the math very well above for this specific case. Another way to summarize and generalize the \u0022Oberth maths\u0022 (and how I think about it) is that that escaping a planet\u0027s gravity is about [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy) (\u0022E\u0022, and otherwise labeled simply \u0022orbital energy\u0022 from here), which is calculated using the equation:\n\nE = 1/2 V^2^ - mu/r\n\nV is orbital velocity\n\nmu is the gravimetric constant\n\nr is the orbital radiuys\n\nIt\u0027s basically the difference between the kinetic and potential energy with the mass term dropped (don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s cool, and I can show you why it doesn\u0027t matter if you want. It doesn\u0027t make a difference for this application). For any given orbit, E is constant at all points (all r) on the orbit. So long as E \u003C 0, you will have a \u0022closed\u0022 orbit (you\u0027re captured) and when E =\u003E0, you will escape the body you\u0027re orbiting. Put another way, you can escape a planet when your kinetic energy exceeds the gravitational potential energy the planet is exerting on it.\n\nSo you want to increase your kinetic energy to escape, and your KE is determined by velocity squared. You increase your KE and velocity by spending dV, and the change in E created by spending a fixed amount of dV at a given altitude is calculated:\n\ndE = 1/2 V^2^- 1/2 (V \u002B dV)^2^ = 1/2 V^2^- 1/2 (V^2^ \u002B 2 V\\*dV \u002B dV^2^) = V\\*dV \u002B1/2 dV^2^\n\nSince V appears in the expression of dE (the red term in the simplification), the amount of E changes when dV is spent is dependent on the vessel\u0027s velocity. Spefically, higher V leads to greater changes in E, so you want to be travelling as fast as possible when you spend the dV to escape.\n\nSo, since you tend have lower orbital velocities very high up (as high as Minmus) and you tend to have higher orbital velocities when orbiting at low altitudes, it should be clear that you want to spend dV at low altitudes/high speeds to maximize the effect of that dV.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T03:53:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LethalDose**"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T22:52:07Z","Content":"Nice explanation, LethalDose.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E E = 1/2 V^2^ - mu/r\n\nIt is from this same equation that we derive *hyperbolic excess velocity*.

As you correctly describe, this isn\u0027t completely relevant to KSP because of the use of patched conics. Likewise, the mathematically derived definition of escape velocity isn\u0027t applicable to KSP either. To \u0022escape\u0022 in KSP we just have to raise the apoapsis of the orbit until it touches the sphere of influence, thus it\u0027s possible to escape with what is technically an elliptical orbit. In KSP, the residual velocity that a spacecraft retains after crossing the SOI is greater than the calculated value of V\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E.

Similarly, \u0022effective V\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Eesc\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u0022 is the velocity needed to raise the apoapsis to exactly the radius of the SOI. The relative velocity that we require at the SOI is the difference between the orbital velocities of Kerbin and our planned interplanetary transfer orbit.\n\nWhile the escape velocities are calculated slightly differently in the game due to patched conics, the differences are pretty small. For example, the \u0022proper\u0022 escape velocity from a 70 km orbit around Kerbin is 3246.9 m/s (dV = 951.0 m/s) where the \u0022effective\u0022 escape velocity is 3234.1 m/s (dV = 938.1 m/s). That\u0027s a 13 m/s difference in nearly 1 km/s burn, just above a 1% difference.\n\nNow since these escape velocities are *practically* interchangeable, V\u003Csub\u003Einf\u003C/sub\u003E is a reasonable approximation of the relative velocity to the parent at the SoI change, and we can use your presented equations to answer some of the OP\u0027s questions that have kind of gotten ignored, specifcally this passage:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A = burn to heliocentric orbit/a orbit to the edge of kerbin\u0027s SOI\n\u003E \n\u003E B = the transfer burn from High SOI/heliocentric orbit\n\u003E \n\u003E C = The transfer burn from LKO\n\u003E \n\u003E I would expect that A\u002BB \u003E C, but that B \u003C C, and A\u003CC\n\u003E \n\u003E If I refuel after A, then my craft should be able get by with lower dV capabilties... but this seems to be wrong.\n\u003E \n\u003E But then I also have to consider some other things... like the oberth effect from orbiting Minmus, doing a bi-elliptic transfer (from minmus, lower PE to just above kerbin, then burn from there, but then the transfer window timing is even more complicated), departing from Mun instead... and so on.\n\u003E \n\u003E But... something just seems intuitively wrong here...

And, by my calculations, the dV cost of a burn from a Heliocentric orbit at Kerbin\u0027s altitude (which should be equivalent to the hyperbolic excess for the transfer) is greater still at 2760 m/s.\n\nI *think* what is being missed here is the speed of the vessel *relative to the sun* due to it\u0027s prograde orbit around Kerbin. When orbiting around Kerbin at 100 km, a vessel has an prograde orbital velocity relative to the sun of 9284.5 m/s (Kerbin\u0027s orbital speed) \u002B 2246.1 (Orbital speed around Kerbin at 100 km) = 11530.6 m/s. At 47,000 km, orbital velocity around kerbin is ~ 272 m/s, almost 2 km/s slower than LKO, and when starting from a slower speed *relative to the sun* you have to spend more dV to accelerate to initiate the transfer.\n\nI found it illuminating to to fully comparing the two sets of numbers.\n\nFor a 100 km LKO burn:\n\nV\u003Csub\u003Ebo\u003C/sub\u003E^2^= (2760 m/s)^2^ \u002B (3176 m/s)^2^\n\nV\u003Csub\u003Ebo\u003C/sub\u003E = 4208 m/s\n\ndV = V\u003Csub\u003Ebo\u003C/sub\u003E - V\u003Csub\u003Eorb\u003C/sub\u003E = 4208 m/s - 2246 m/s = 1962 m/s\n\nFor a \u0022near Minmus\u0022 burn (47,000 km):\n\nV\u003Csub\u003Ebo\u003C/sub\u003E^2^= (2760 m/s)^2^ \u002B (385 m/s)^2^\n\nV\u003Csub\u003Ebo\u003C/sub\u003E = 2787 m/s\n\ndV = V\u003Csub\u003Ebo\u003C/sub\u003E - V\u003Csub\u003Eorb\u003C/sub\u003E = 2787 m/s - 272 m/s = 2515 m/s\n\nSo while the *target burnout velocity* is **smaller** in Minmus escape scenario (i.e. C is reduced because A is reduced, and C \u003E B remains true) , it actually takes more dV to achieve that velocity because the starting orbital speed is lower. Essentially, I think A, B, C\u0027s presented by the OP work provided that you remember they\u0027re true for *velocities*, but are not true for the *delta Vs* in this situation, and I think this may have been where the OP was getting hung up. Certainly was for me.\n\nAnd this is math doing a *direct burn* from Minmus\u0027 altitude, *not* dropping down to LKO from Minmus before performing an ejection burn. The latter is still an awesome idea that works well.\n\nOkay, I feel way better about this now.\n\nP.S. the numbers are a little rough because I was dropping decimal places for expediency. Also they won\u0027t exactly match Alexmoon\u0027s calculator because he tweaks ejection phase angles, which I\u0027m not doing. Alexmoon\u0027s numbers should be more accurate.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One thing I haven\u0027t seen considered here is TWR differences. While burning from that high up would take more fuel than if done from lower down, the much weaker gravity means a much smaller engine can push much more fuel. Since the fuel-mass to ship-mass ratio is improved you have higher starting dV. I\u0027m not a math wizard, so I can\u0027t be sure if it\u0027s even possible that this can offset the costs of an inefficient burn (let alone save anything), but I thought it was an interesting idea (and sortof on topic). Any thoughts?\n\nIt\u0027s true that increasing TWR *can* reduce dV costs. However, It\u0027s basically assumed, for everything presented here, that the changes in speed are instantaneous (essentially TWR is infinite). In reality, all the transfers and burns presented with have slightly higher dV costs than what we\u0027ve calculated and presented, and as OhioBob pointed out, lower TWR is going to have less effect at high altitudes, but it\u0027s never really going to save you anything worth noting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T14:21:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LethalDose**"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:46:38Z","Content":"Another potentially big problem with performing the transfer from a high orbit is the timing.

(This was also before I started using Precise Node.) Once the injection was completed, I don\u0027t recall there being anything especially difficult about flying the mission. I may have had to perform a course correction at some point, but that\u0027s nothing unusual.\n\nI would never attempt a direct transfer to Moho when the encounter occurs far above or below the ecliptic. Such a transfer would be needlessly costly in terms of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T00:17:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T00:57:15Z","Content":"I think everyone who responded to me was missing the point entirely. Simply put... if you stick a an LV-T45 engine behind some FL-T800 fuel tanks, you can comfortably push around three of them at 70km orbit. More if a lower TWR is acceptable. Using [a=g\\*(R/R\u002Bh)^2] (from ksp wiki basic orbiting math tutorial), acceleration due to gravity at minmus altitude is about .001556 m/s. The ratio of acceleration due to gravity at 70km to acceleration due to gravity at 47,000km is about 5012:1. Since F=ma shows that the relationship between acceleration and force is linear, this shows that TWR follows the same ratio (inversely proportional). This means that our little theoretical craft (just an engine and three tanks) has gone from a cozy TWR of 1.7 (at 70km) to a whopping TWR of 8547. This little LV-T45 (up at minmus\u0027 orbital altitude) could push well over ten times the number of tanks and still maintain a healthy TWR. (Actually, it could push a great deal more... and still maintain a comfortable TWR) Assuming 30 tanks are used on our theoretical freighter if it leaves from minmus altitude, and 3 if from 70km... it has 5835.8 m/s dV with 3 tanks (@70km) and 7661.6 m/s dV with 30 tanks from minmus. \n\nThese numbers are really just for illustrative purposes. If your computer could handle it, you could launch your minmus freighter with 100 tanks (or 1000). And I obviously didn\u0027t account for things like solar panels (who needs power anyway?)... but the idea is sound. Higher TWR = more fuel per engine... and more fuel per engine = more dV. I believe this demonstrates that launching from higher up can more than offset the extra requirements.\n\nOf course, the real problem with leaving from that high up (as ever before) is the potential for missing launch windows due to being in a poor spot in your parking orbit... and launch windows trump pretty much everything else. I usually set up my parking orbits (and gas station) somewhere around geosynchronous orbit. Keeps line of sight with KSC (handy for rt2), gets some advantage of lower gravity, close enough to the mun (from which I launch mined/refined fuel), and Kerbin (from whence cometh my kerbals), all the while allowing me to still have potentially multiple launch opportunities within a single window."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T03:36:18Z","Content":"impyre,\n\nTWR as a function of local gravity I find useful only when I\u0027m launching from the surface of a planet. Once in space, TWR is not important. What is important is acceleration. I may sometimes incorrectly use the term TWR when referring to a spacecraft in orbit, but what I\u0027m really talking about is the acceleration expressed in units of standard gravity. I can\u0027t speak for others, but I assume they are doing the same thing. Stating that the TWR is 8547 I find to be completely useless information. What I want to know is that the acceleration is 13 m/s^2^ or 1.3 g. Acceleration is a function of only mass and thrust, so a LV-T45 isn\u0027t going to push around a stack of tanks any easier at 47,000 km than it will at 70 km.\n\nWhen we start adding tanks the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv goes up because we\u0027re increasing the mass ratio, but that has a diminishing margin of return. We can only add so many tanks before the gain in \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv is no longer worth it. The downside of adding tanks is that we decrease the acceleration and increase the duration of the burn. The only really valid part of your argument that I see is that we can more easily endure a long burn from a high orbit. For example, burning 30 tanks of propellant (120 t) with a single LV-T45 will take about 36 minutes. It is impractical to perform a 36 minute burn from low Kerbin orbit, but it is certainly feasible from a high orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T14:50:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T05:45:55Z","Content":"Aww.... now I wanna delete my post.

This is the video that really clarified the Oberth effect to me.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It takes kinetic energy to get to Jool, not potential energy. Being at Minmus\u0027 altitude gives you a lot of potential energy, but very little kinetic energy. Kinetic energy in this case is all about velocity, and you\u0027re going faster in LKO than you are at Minmus\u0027 altitude, so that\u0027s velocity you don\u0027t have to make up for by burning fuel.\n\u003E  As others have pointed out, you can save even more DV by leaving from a highly elliptical orbit with a low periapsis over Kerbin, which will give you even more velocity when you do your transfer burn.\n\nI find all this a little annoying, because in the first post I already said:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E doing a bi-elliptic transfer (from minmus, lower PE to just above kerbin, then burn from there, but then the transfer window timing is even more complicated)\n\nAnother way of thinking about it is to consider how much velocity you lose between perapsis, and crossing the SoI \n\nLets suppose that you need a velocity relative to Kerbin of 2.5km/s to planet Y.\n\nLets suppose that orbital velocity of kerbin is 2km/s, and 3km/s is \u0022escape velocity\u0022 (ie pushes your apoapsis beyond the soi... although in KSP, that can still be an elispe that is very close to going hyperbolic)\n\nIf you departed from orbit at the very edge of the SOI, you\u0027ll only have a few hundred m/s of orbital velocity at best. You\u0027ll still need to burn over 2km/s\n\nIf you simply burned to escape velocity (1 km burn, taking 2km to 3km/s), then at the edge of the SOI, you\u0027d have a few m/s relative velocity... you\u0027ve lost pretty much 3km/s of relative velocity due to gravity.\n\nIf you burned again, you\u0027d need to burn a full 2.5km/s (for a total of 3.5 km/s) - the worst way of doing it (yet I\u0027ve seen people suggest this for beginners to get yo easy targets like Duna)\n\nIf you instead burn for a dV of 2000 m/s, for a total velocity of 4km/s... you\u0027ll have lost far less than 3km/s by the time you leave kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\nIf you consider it like gravity drag... gravity acts on you for a far shorter time... lets suppose you only lose 1,500 m/s to gravity drag, and you\u0027ve got that 2.5 km/s that you need.\n\nMy mistake was I wasn\u0027t really considering the variability in how much relative velocity you lose between a PE just above kerbin, and crossing the SOI.\n\nWhich I guess is pretty much the same as the calculation of excess hyperbolic velocity.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nWell, some good news for Jool refueling, I calculated (ie ran the transfer window calculator) the Laythe orbit -\u003E Duna transfer, and it takes significantly less dV to depart from Laythe\u0027s orbital height (27184 km), than from low Jool Orbit (100km)\n\nSo I can have a craft capable of a dV of less than 1,500 m/s, and it can shuttle back and forth from Duna to the Jool system.\n\nJool @ 100 km to aerocapture at duna -\u003E 2,892 m/s\n\nJool @ 27184km to aerocapture at duna -\u003E 1,374 m/s\n\nThat number should be even lower from low laythe orbit (it should be a comparable advantage to starting in LKO, vs at the edge of kerbin\u0027s SOI, as laythe is very similar-\u003E 80% the surface gravity, 83.3% the radius)\n\nAnd it should be even lower if a bi-eliptic transfer is used (dropping PE to just above Jool), and then there\u0027s the chance of gravity assists and such.\n\nOnce fueling stations are setup... a craft capable of a dV of 1,500 m/s should be able to go all the way from orbit above eve, to kerbin and its moons, to duna, to jool, to Eeloo.\n\nOnly Moho and Dres would not be reachable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T11:08:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T11:43:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I find all this a little annoying, because in the first post I already said:\n\nWell, What you\u0027re describing really *isn\u0027t* a bi-elipitcal transfer, but sorry to have wasted your time.
