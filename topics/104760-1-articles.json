It went very well; several students stuck around after the end of the workshop to ask more questions about how it all works. Eventually I sent them off with links to download the KSP demo. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was nice of you to give them the link. =^.^= Still way to much math I understand a bit of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T04:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured if they were excited about orbital mechanics and wanted to learn more about it, a hands-on experience such as KSP would be the best way to do it. I did give them a warning that they should probably go to the website, bookmark it, and then not go back to download the demo until after they were done with their final exams for the quarter. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
