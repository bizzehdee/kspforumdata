I hope you\u0027re right, this movie looked amazing. I really hope we can get some news about it soon.

Sadly... it\u0027s sad.\n\nAfter many years of trying to get it made, and then stress from early backers wanting to see more for what they put in.... reach may have exceeded grasp. \n\nI don\u0027t think it was intended to have much in the way of conflict or explosions; the documentary style may have made it a hard sell to any studios the idea was shown to. It would have needed a ton more FX and green screen work to fill it out from 5 minute trailers, to 90 or 120. \n\nThe longer a project drags on, the more likely older work might need to be reshot. Actors become unavailable, or more expensive. I don\u0027t really know, just casting ideas about."},{"CreatedByName":"Pluto100","CreatedById":26442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:54:41Z","Content":"There\u0027s still no reply from the company, and reading that article, I kinda assume that this is, kinda, dead?
