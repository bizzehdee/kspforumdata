If a payload very nearly reaches orbit, but not quite, simply add a pair of SRBs or three to make up the slack. In real life, or course, it\u0027s not the same. Restrictions are draconian, and components are expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is: Do the most impressive mission you can, using any number of rockets, with any design of rocket you wish. However, that rocket must be able to \u0022clear the tower\u0022 on top of 1,500 kN of thrust, or \u00221 Mainsail\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mFrclf1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mFrclf1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo, not this.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA well-designed Apollo-Saturn analogue (3 Kerbals to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and back) usually requires 5 mainsails in it\u0027s first stage.

Have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After receiving some feedback on what conditions the challenge should work under, I\u0027ve drawn up some rules/guidelines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules: Must read.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Every craft must launch vertically. Those parasitic \u0022plane\u0022 things that suckle on the atmosphere, rather than punch through it like a badass, disgust me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Air-breathing engines, including RAPIER, are not allowed, for the aforementioned reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The maximum thrust of ALL stages must be equal to or less than 1,500 kN. Any combination of engines that stays below this limit (like 6 LV-T30s) is allowed. This includes any ships you assemble in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Speaking of assembly, you are allowed any number of launches to fulfill the goal you set yourself. If that Eeloo colony ship of yours needs 500 launches to assemble, be my guest. I\u0027m relying on the shear frustration and tedium of assembly to drive you towards minimizing the mass you have to put into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You win this challenge in the same way you win Dwarf Fortress. Do something so impressive, given the restrictions, and provide the evidence you pulled it off (pics of the mission) that everyone else has to crown you winner. You then receive 1000 internet points and a digital biscuit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. In regards to mods: plugins that display additional information (Kerbal Engineer or Alarm clock) are allowed, even encouraged for the sake of your sanity. Mods that bring in parts, even engines that stay below the 1500 kN limit, is a no-no. As a general guideline, try listing the mods you used in your post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Exploiting bugs, like infiniglide, is cheating, and not allowed. Everytime you exploit a bug, a puppy somewhere in the world dies.
