New research is bolstering the case for a suspected exomoon first detected last year, but scientists say the evidence is still not definitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo date, astronomers have confirmed the existence of\u00A03,851 exoplanets\u2014an impressive number given that the\u00A0first exoplanet\u00A0was discovered just 26 years ago. Yet during all this time, and after all those amazing planetary discoveries, astronomers haven\u2019t been able to prove the existence of an exomoon, that is, a moon in orbit around a planet in another star system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a surprising result, given that exomoons are surely ubiquitous across the cosmos. Take our own Solar System, for example. Our eight planets host 185 known natural satellites. Of these, 79 belong to Jupiter and 62 to Saturn\u2014an embarrassment of riches that showcases the potential of gas giants to harbor large collections of natural satellites. What\u2019s more, a hefty portion of exomoons are likely to be habitable, as argued in a\u00A0research paper\u00A0published earlier this year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut we still haven\u2019t found any of these moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, exomoons are proving to be frustratingly difficult to detect, and for obvious reasons. Unlike enormous gas giants and super-Earths, moons tend to be on the smallish side. Not only that, but they\u2019re spinning around an object that\u2019s also spinning around an object; after a few observations, astronomers can predict when an exoplanet will pass in front of its host star, but knowing when an exoplanet\u2019s moon might make an appearance is a different challenge entirely. So it makes sense that astronomers are struggling to make a definitive detection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs some of you may recall from last year, astronomers using the Kepler Space Telescope detected a faint dip in the brightness of a star called Kepler-1625, which was interpreted to be\u00A0a potential sign of an exomoon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe data wasn\u2019t definitive, but the observation resulted in the astronomers getting 40 hours access to the Hubble Space Telescope. With Hubble, astronomers Alex Teachey and David Kipping from Columbia University were able to collect data that\u2019s four times more precise than what Kepler was able to acquire. The\u00A0results of this second survey, published today in Science Advances, further the case for the existence of this exomoon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COur initial report was based on Kepler-data alone, which we always felt was not sufficient to claim a discovery,\u201D Teaching told Gizmodo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are basically two features of the new data that suggest the presence of a moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first is an apparent dip in the brightness of the host star following the planet\u2019s transit, which the astronomers attribute to the exomoon. The alleged exomoon is in orbit around a known exoplanet called Kepler-1625b, a large gas giant that\u2019s several times bigger than Jupiter. From our perspective, it takes Kepler-1625b around 19 hours to travel across the face of its host star. Astronomers can\u2019t actually see the planet, which is 8,000 light-years away, but they can detect a drop in the host star\u2019s brightness when it passes in front; it\u2019s this eclipsing effect, called a transit, that allows scientists to detect distant exoplanets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAround 3.5 hours after Kepler-1625b performed its transit, Hubble detected a second, significantly smaller dimming of the star\u2019s brightness. In a statement, Kipping said it was consistent with \u201Ca moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.\u201D Unfortunately, however, the scheduled Hubble observations ended before the complete transit of the supposed exomoon could be measured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second key observation was the presence of transit timing effects, which indicate there is something in the system tugging on the planet gravitationally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBasically, when a planet has a moon, the planet is of course pulling on the moon gravitationally, but the moon is also pulling on the planet, and they\u2019re both actually orbiting their common center of mass\u2014a point in space along the line between the centers of the two objects,\u201D explained Teaching. \u201CSo because the planet is orbiting this point\u2014called the barycenter\u2014it wobbles in its orbit around the star. What that does is, it affects the timings of the transits. Sometimes the planet transits a little earlier, sometimes a little later. Those are the transit timing variations, or TTVs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTeaching said the moon explanation is superior to other explanations, such as the gravitational influence of an undiscovered exoplanet in the Kepler-1625 system. The exomoon explanation also has the added benefit of being a single explanation for the two observed phenomena. But as Teaching and Kipping admit, the data is still incomplete, and something unknown may be influencing the observations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe would just stress that this remains an exomoon candidate,\u201D Teaching told Gizmodo. \u201CIt\u2019s a tantalizing result, certainly, but it really still needs to be confirmed by more observations and, hopefully, other teams replicating our results.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, a picture of this exoplanet and moon is beginning to emerge. If this is an exomoon, it\u2019s actually quite large\u2014about the size of Neptune. By comparison, Jupiter\u2019s Ganymede\u2014the largest moon in our Solar System\u2014is 3,270 miles (5,268 kilometers) in diameter, compared to Neptune and its 30,500-mile-wide (50,000 kilometers) diameter. This exomoon is about 1.5 percent the mass of its host planet, which, interestingly, is the same mass-ratio between Earth and our Moon, but on a far less grandiose scale. By the standards of our Solar System, this is a moon of gargantuan proportions\u2014an attribute the researchers say is largely responsible for its discovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNatalie Hinkel, an astronomer at Arizona State University who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study, was impressed by how the authors vetted their data and analyses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey considered a wide variety of angles, caveats, and avenues that could render their findings null and void\u2014but all lead them back to the likely presence of an exomoon,\u201D Hinkel told Gizmodo. \u201CHowever, because there have been no observations of this kind, I agree with their assessment that it is the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 which may make or break this discovery.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUniversity of Southern Queensland astronomer Rob Wittenmyer said the paper was thorough and that the authors did not overstate their claim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe result is not surprising, as evidenced by the abundance of moons in our Solar System,\u201D Wittenmyer told Gizmodo. \u201CAs moons go, this one is quite large, and hence detectable. I suspect that, like exoplanets and cockroaches, exomoons are everywhere\u2014when you see one, there are many more you missed. As techniques are refined, we will surely find more exomoons in the coming decades.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDavid Bennett, a scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, agrees that additional observations will be required to brand this a definitive discovery of an exomoon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlso, the planet is 10 times more massive than Jupiter, and the predicted mass of the moon is close to that of Neptune. So, if we saw these objects in isolation, we would consider them both to be planets,\u201D Bennett told Gizmodo. \u201CIf the observed companion to the planet is confirmed, there is a good chance that it would be considered to be a binary planet instead of a moon. It could be a Neptune-mass planet that was captured by a super-Jupiter planet during the formation of the planetary system.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is a good point. How is it even possible that this particular planet-moon architecture even exists? If it\u2019s confirmed that Kepler-1625b hosts such a large moon, astronomers will have the added challenge of figuring out how this particular star system took shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother neat fact about Kepler-1625b is that its orbit resides within its host star\u2019s habitable zone. Now, it\u2019s very unlikely that this gas giant, and its equally gassy, Neptune-like exomoon, could harbor life. But what if this purported exomoon has its own moons, and those moons are of a terrestrial nature? Could life actually emerge on the moon of a moon?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf there is truly an exomoon around Kepler-1625b, a whole new subfield could open up, one we scientists\u2014as well as sci-fi writers\u2014have only speculated about, regarding the discovery and possible habitability of exomoons,\u201D said Hinkel. \u201CEssentially, it could be like the TV show\u00A0Fireflywhere people live on core worlds as well as the outlying moons.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019ll be awhile before we can solve these sorts of problems, but this latest observation means we can at least start to pose the questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Science Advances]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-04T03:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/10/eaav1784\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe paper is currently open access.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d recommend checking it out, since even if you can\u0027t follow all the fancy statistics there\u0027s interesting commentary. eg:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blackbody equilibrium temperature of the planet and moon, assuming zero albedo, is ~350 K.
