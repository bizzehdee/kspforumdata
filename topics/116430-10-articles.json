Those are all superseded by props under Switch\\_Toggle\\_Modular.  For a specific example, the swTumbleAG01 prop is replaced by tggl\\_AG01\\_T4W-S.  Presumably, you can rename the props in your config, although they may have a slightly different footprint.  I\u0027m not entirely sure about which old buttons are being replaced, but the new ones are all in Push\\_Button\\_Modular (switch\\_B\\_Button01 and switch\\_B\\_Button02 are likely candidates).\n\nThere\u0027s definitely a bit of effort to migrate to the new props, but the modular nature of them also allows a great deal of customization options.  Take a look at the manuals on the first post for a fairly extensive coverage of what you can do with them (the first post in my MAS page has some examples - most of the buttons, switches, and so forth in that screen shot are modular props)."},{"CreatedByName":"JEB\u0026#039;S DESTINY","CreatedById":182658,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T20:40:12Z","Content":"aset props doesn\u0027t work for me.
