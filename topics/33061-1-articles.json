I even tried rearranging all my fuel tanks. So I\u0027m sure it isn\u0027t a fuel placement problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems fine while flying in the atmosphere, in fact it is a very good aircraft design, it flies very good. Also the launch vehicle booster it is strapped on functions very well, can take it to space using mechjeb. the problem is when in it is already in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been building spaceplanes before 0.20.0 and using this pack as well and I haven\u0027t encountered any problems. only now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe a bug or something?
