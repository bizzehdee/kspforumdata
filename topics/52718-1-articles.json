Afterwards, whatever symmetry option other than 1x i choose, it will always snap to this, forcing me to always use the lowest form of symmetry i will use on that part, or start placing things without symmetry, which im not particularly fond of. How do i get rid of this \u0027set\u0027 of symmetry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, say i\u0027d build an asparagus lifter. I\u0027d want to have 6 radial decouplers and tanks at all exactly the same height, which i\u0027d use the 6x symmetry for, but i need to asparagus-line my fuel lines, and some of the tanks will have skippers while others will have mainsails, making me want to use 2x symmetry, but it won\u0027t allow me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a way to remove parts added with symmetry without removing their symmetrical counterparts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Stage grouping. As aforementioned, i usually have to set my boosters with 2x symmetry for a 6-way asparagus. It groups the engines up in groups of 2 and one single one for the central stack, giving me four icons. If my upper stages have lots of actions, this can get really messy. How do i group these 7 engines together like it does for symmetry? I\u0027ve managed to ungroup them one time, not exactly sure how, and im not sure how to regroup them. Sometimes dragging them over one another works, other times it doesn\u0027t. I can also manage to surround all 4 with a green line just as it would when i click the groups of 2 (it unfolds them and lines the two grouped ones in green), but if they weren\u0027t pre-grouped, the green line will just disappear afterwards and they stay un-grouped.

In cases where you\u0027d like different parts, remove the symmetry option and place them individually. Also, if you have four parts but only want to use symmetry on two, it generally won\u0027t let you and attempts to place the part in groups of four even though you have it set for only two. Again, place individually to get around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can move an individual event from a group of like events by clicking on the specific one a second time and then dragging it to a new box.

Unfortunately there\u0027s no way around this, not even the editor tools mod can add this functionality. IIRC it works this way because in the craft file entire subtrees have a symmetry value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s two ways around this. The first is, as suggested, add the fuel lines (or whatever) with no symmetry and replicate manually as required. The second way is to build the original trees with the required symmetry. So instead of placing six radial boosters, place with 2x symmetry three times. Now, the problem with the latter method is that, as you mentioned, you want everything to be evenly aligned and this is almost impossible when placing manually. A workaround for this *is* provided by the editor tools mod: if you enable \u0022vertical snap\u0022 then radial parts will attach to the exact vertical center of their parent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T14:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding building asparagus stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more complicated approach: place separators and fuel tanks using symmetry, then place fuel lines in x1 symmetry.
