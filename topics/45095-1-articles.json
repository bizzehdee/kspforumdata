I tried to pull off everything underneath the large probe core so that I could add a docking port. One of the rovers (which was added using symmetry) didn\u0027t pull off and acted like it was still a part of the craft. Then when I tried to move parts off of that, they duplicated. Eventually the program crashed and now anytime I try to make changes to it, the program crashes.
