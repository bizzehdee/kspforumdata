There\u0027s a workaround currently, if you search the thread, in the form of a cfg file that shifts everything into the nodes that are available. Other mods may have similar issues and solutions.\u003Cp\u003EIf you CHANGE treeloader, that\u0027s a license violation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you paste the important parts of treeloader into a new mod, that\u0027s a license violation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you write a new mod, based on what you find by looking at the treeloader source, that\u0027s a license violation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the source, figure out what does the stuff you need, and DON\u0027T write a mod, that\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you tell someone what you found by looking in the code, and they write a mod, that might be a license violation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone tells you how to do it, but never says where they got the information, and doesn\u0027t give you any code... well, no one can tell if it is or isn\u0027t from treeloader, can they?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that has, in the past, been done with other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question on everybody\u0027s mind is whether someone can write their own code to add tree nodes using the same technique that TreeLoader used, given that the TreeLoader source is published \u0022for reference only\u0022 all other rights reserved. In other words, is the basic information on how to add tree nodes subject to copyright protection?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally believe that a modder cannot hold copyright over information about how Squad\u0027s code works, because the modder didn\u0027t create that information; Squad did by writing the code in the way it did. If you were trying to get creation of new nodes working in ATC and you compared your code to TreeLoader to figure out what about Squad\u0027s code was causing your code to fail, you could revise your code based on what you learned about Squad\u0027s work without violating the TreeLoader copyright because you wouldn\u0027t be using any information that the author of TreeLoader actually created. As long as any similarities in the final code were necessarily dictated by the interfaces that Squad provided, you would be legal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
