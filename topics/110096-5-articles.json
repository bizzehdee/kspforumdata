There was no requirement to make a running landing: parachutes, VTOLs, helicopters, whatever, were all welcome, as long as they could maintain aerodynamic flight within the other parameters. None of the parameters were that hard individually; the trick was meeting all the parameters at once. But those were the bad old days, gone and best forgotten.
