That\u0027s the Kerbal way. \n\nOP, it sounds like you mean you want the ships to come from orbit, impact the surface, and survive without benefit of lifting surfaces, parachutes, or retrorockets--basically drop a crewed brick from orbit and see what can survives. Yes? \n\nYou might want to think about a way to rank entries. Mass might be a good one: what\u0027s the minimum amount of hardware you can use and still survive? Also maybe specify which capsules/cockpits/cans are acceptable. For example the Mk3 cockpit has a VERY high tolerance, maybe enough to hit Eve surface at terminal velocity. I\u0027d make everyone do it in a Mk1 lander can if it were me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis is not a bad challenge at all if properly specified. It\u0027ll teach entrants about terminal velocity and design for survivability. I\u0027d encourage the OP to try a few crash landings himself, think a bit about how entrants are going to try to bend/break/exploit, and come up with a short ruleset and ranking system that makes it fun for everyone."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T18:11:56Z","Content":"I think this looks interesting too. As it stands its too vague though. \n\nMy suggestion would be for a ship containing a Kerbal that falls unpowered, without parachutes and without lifting surfaces (i.e. a dead weight other than than part drag) from a minimum stable orbit (70km for Kerbin) and survives so that it can be launched again to a 70km orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T18:20:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:35:39Z","Content":"What i mean is to survive an orbital drop."},{"CreatedByName":"Draconiator","CreatedById":133772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:38:48Z","Content":"NOTHING can survive an unassisted orbital drop.
