I had a station in LKO with escape pods and everything, not a huge station, but a station nonetheless. I had a base on the mun complemented with a super small compact 2 man rover that weighed like .5 tons. Then I had a pretty big station around minmus and a minmus\u00A0base. The station was designed to travel all the way to duna and orbit there, then send down a lander to land where my rover I sent previously landed. Minmus was simply a fueling up area for the station. I finnaly got the lander out to the minmus station after it launched from kerbin,\u00A0and everything was ready to go, the miner was docked, the lander was docked, solar panels out, tanks full of fuel, and I plan my transfer to begin my epic voyage to duna and beyond. And as I was a newb I didn\u0027t know that docking ports flexed so much. So when I applied the accelerator the lander and miner both ripped themselves off and I got so sad. And there was no way to fix it because KAS was barely a thing, and you weren\u0027t able to place struts from EVA yet. So I would basically have to relaunch the ENTIRE station with quantum struts on it....... So I gave up. The last time I ever have been to another planet was when I sent that rover to duna. I haven\u0027t been to another planet since..... Now most of my time has been spent inside of the Kerbin SOI and now that im playing with realism overhaul I guess I will eventually leave the Earth\u0027s SOI and send a manned mission to Mars, close enough right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T06:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably more fun and rewarding to install MKS and hunt for rich seams of Exotic Minerals and Rare Metals.
