Someone should test this.\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t think you will earn a profit since I\u0027m pretty sure the total \u0022re-funded\u0022 cost with recovered crafts is taken from the \u0022initial cost\u0022 values. I\u0027d assume that you would just recover the craft as normal and any gained fuel would simply be lost.\n\nThere is also the task of weighing the actual cost of getting to the location against the total return. At some point, you\u0027ll stop making money as it\u0027ll take more fuel to get there to outweigh what you bring back.\n\nBut, again, someone (myself possibly) needs to test this."},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:42:16Z","Content":"Should be fairly easy if you don\u0027t mind a bit of fiddling. Get your rig out there (somehow). Fill up a fuel tank. Detach the fuel tank and recover. Fly another (empty) fuel tank to the site. (Be sure to pick a site close enough that the refund from the fuel covers the loss from the tank). Rinse and repeat.\n\nDouble points if you rig up some loading crane so you can put the full tank in a vehicle to bring back to KSC for full recovery value."},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:55:53Z","Content":"The easiest way would be to go the indirect route.

Asteroids can be moved about the system, and they contain ore. So why not just move the asteroids to 72x72 LKO with ion tugs, then mine them with a developed-for-purpose station? You could easily bring up four of the small ore tanks at a time, each fitted with Seperatrons and \u0027chutes to deorbit. If you\u0027re using Kerbal inventory System you could easily loft eight or twelve at a time and attach the parachutes while in orbit. If not a profit, you\u0027d at least make back the station cost on savings for repeatedly lifting fuel stations. Somebody really should test this out.

The main value of Ore is that it is fuel outside the gravity well of Kerbin. To bring it down planetside would mean that it is just unrefined fuel.\n\nThat being said. I, for one, would like to see mining being expanded upon. Maybe three different resources. One for construction, at least one for energy/fuel (conventional and futuristic) and one to bring back for money/science. To set up a thriving infrastructure in the kerbal system is something I would like to spend a lot of time doing. Running it is also a decent backdrop for multiplayer. Deep space missions require little interactions. Running the \u0022family business\u0022 together would be a better premise for player interaction than one going to Duna and another to Jool.\n\nI also would like there to be more energy intensive stuff that would warrant a large solar array or nuclear reactor."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:35:45Z","Content":"Eh.

Oh, and no contracts. At all. I imagine an innovative prospection/mining company in a resource-starved world, with no-one left to pay for the science.\n\nThis makes mining ore (converted to fuel) for profit actually feasible, and also significantly increases the cost of launching. Side effects are that it actually introduces something that is a bit like a real budget, in that my income depends on the fuel flowing in at a steady rate, rather than the go-there-do-this-get-x-funds of stock contracts.\n\nTo avoid excessively tedious mining operations, I think big...\n\n![u7vtzmy.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/u7vtzmy.png?1)\n\n...and this Mk4 monster hauls in 22,000 units: that\u0027s about 180k funds over a period of about twenty days.\n\nThe scarcity of ore around the system also makes ore-rich asteroids much more valuable.

I had a station in LKO with escape pods and everything, not a huge station, but a station nonetheless. I had a base on the mun complemented with a super small compact 2 man rover that weighed like .5 tons. Then I had a pretty big station around minmus and a minmus base. The station was designed to travel all the way to duna and orbit there, then send down a lander to land where my rover I sent previously landed. Minmus was simply a fueling up area for the station. I finnaly got the lander out to the minmus station after it launched from kerbin, and everything was ready to go, the miner was docked, the lander was docked, solar panels out, tanks full of fuel, and I plan my transfer to begin my epic voyage to duna and beyond. And as I was a newb I didn\u0027t know that docking ports flexed so much. So when I applied the accelerator the lander and miner both ripped themselves off and I got so sad. And there was no way to fix it because KAS was barely a thing, and you weren\u0027t able to place struts from EVA yet. So I would basically have to relaunch the ENTIRE station with quantum struts on it....... So I gave up. The last time I ever have been to another planet was when I sent that rover to duna. I haven\u0027t been to another planet since..... Now most of my time has been spent inside of the Kerbin SOI and now that im playing with realism overhaul I guess I will eventually leave the Earth\u0027s SOI and send a manned mission to Mars, close enough right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T06:14:29Z","Content":"Probably more fun and rewarding to install MKS and hunt for rich seams of Exotic Minerals and Rare Metals.
