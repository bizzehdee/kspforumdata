Tried uploading again and a popup appeared after a few minutes with \u0022Application Error. An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. Please try again in a few moments\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh!! Ok I\u0027ve seen what\u0027s happened now. For some (unknown) reason the upload of your craft had been interrupted and the all important set_attributes_from_file method hadn\u0027t been called. That meant that some key info about the craft was not present and that was what caused that Application Error. So I\u0027ve added a fix (just deployed that now) that should ensure that method gets called, even if the upload gets interrupted. (fyi the upload can be interrupted if you reload the page after dropping a craft on the uploader but before the \u0022scanning craft file\u0022 message appears. Now if that happens when you next try to upload a craft and are promoted to resume uploading the previous one, it will correctly pick up from where it left off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you should now be able to attempt uploading a craft again, it should then prompt you to finish uploading the previous one and now (with the extra struts in place) it shouldn\u0027t blow up anymore!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has actually been really helpful for me and showed that there was a concepto in the upload logic. sorry its been a pain for you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022monababii\u0022 data-cite=\u0022monababii\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt did work though! Suddenly the craft window closed (without reverting my craft upload) and the craft remained in my crafts section (I think it was the Crafts section, could\u0027ve been my profile, can\u0027t recall). Whereas if I had pressed the X button to simply close the window it wouldn\u0027t have actually closed it, and pressing cancel would delete the upload.

I see what it\u0027s problem is, and its a really stupid one too! I wouldn\u0027t have realised if you hadn\u0027t listed the dir contents, but your GameData folder is called \u0022Gamedata\u0022 and the code is looking for \u0022GameData\u0022. the case of the \u0027d\u0027, that\u0027s all it is, grrr, I shall update PartMapper to not care about case! My fault for assuming that capital D was standard, doh!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, could you rename your folder to have the capital D and see if that works? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ere the strange temp folder, now I see what that actually is, that\u0027s normal (for this program anyway). Here\u0027s why (if you\u0027re interested); The PartMapper its written in Ruby, which is not a typical language for deployment into windows and I have to assume that the client machines won\u0027t have Ruby present. So the code is packaged up using a tool called OCRA (hence the ocr prefix on the temp folder) and it bundles together the bare minimum of the Ruby components that the code needs to function and packages that up as a exe, but really its more of a zip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you run it, it unpacks the contents into a temp folder and runs it from there (in a pseudo Linux environment) and passes in environment path info so the code behaves as if it was run in the original folder. (Jebretary doesn\u0027t use the temp folder because it does the unpack when you install it, so it get\u0027s it\u0027s own folder to run from, but I didn\u0027t want people to have to install the PartMapper so it needs the temp folder at runtime).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, for the notifications, Dismiss still doesn\u0027t do anything for me (still on Chrome).
