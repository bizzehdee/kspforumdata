However, it takes time, and doesn\u0027t even give you enough LqdHelium3 to run the same reactor, so it\u0027s a non-starter for me. And that doesn\u0027t solve the LqdDeuterium issue, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPI has a lot of ISRU capabilities, so I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to do it.

Of course, you still need to supply the Lithium, and anywhere except KSC, that\u0027s going to be...challenging. That said, if you build a silly enough structure on the launchpad, 40 or so reactors will produce it pretty quickly. You can then either have tanker trucks come pick the Tritium up (using KAS to transfer, or some such), or just recover the structure for stupid amounts of cash - which you can then turn around and spend on Tritium for the same net effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat still leaves having to send resupply tankers out from Kerbin, but at least alleviates the cost issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t fiddled with it, given the relatively inexpensive nature of Deuterium, but I think it\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003Escience lab\u003C/em\u003E that has to be splashed down to produce it, not the ISRU.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T01:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I figured out that all fusion reactors can produce enough Tritium to keep themselves running (plus a bit excess). So that\u0027s not going to be as much of a problem as I thought it was going to be, at least until those reactors run out of Lithium. And if they run out of fuel before I get fusion power set up around Jool, I can always just spam UF4 fission reactors with transmitters about 3-4 km from KSC launched from the runway (those huge rover wheels finally have a use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mining capable ISRUs can extract Lithium from oceans, so I guess I can send floating ISRU platforms to Laythe\u0027s oceans to get that, as it\u0027s the only planet or moon in Jool orbit that has a liquid ocean, and Jool is the only body in the solar system that has even a mention of containing Deuterium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose this all means I should get Exoplanetary Launchpads and the ORSX compatability patch for it, then send just the launchpad \u002B miners out there, instead of sending each thing individually. Since I make my power relays and generation satellites unmanned anyways, I should be able to get away without sending continuous crew ferry flights, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, unless you patched the costs yourself, you can actually get paid for destroying the 2.5m deuterium/tritium cryostats. It\u0027s something crazy like 16 million per each one that you don\u0027t recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t \u0022have\u0022 to destroy them, but its most efficent to just drop them from a high place on the launchpad. If it destroys the launchpad, so what? the money you \u0022unspent\u0022 on the cryostat will more than pay for any repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got tired of the nonsensical resource costs of the KSPI resources so I just made a craft of like 200 of the 2.5m cryostats along with a single 1 mg antimatter bottle, and let its antimatter containment fail. Made a bunch of cash, and didn\u0027t even destroy the launchpad (should have created a new bay in the ocean, tbh).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would think with the \u0022worth more than its weight in gold\u0022 price of tritium and Helium3, that antimatter would be more expensive, right? Somehow, it\u0027s free on my install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the time being I have my network powered mostly by 2 3m antimatter reactor satellites in 900km orbit around Kerbin. Each one has a few collectors on it too, so if it shuts off I don\u0027t have to trash it, just switch the antenna to recieve (for powering the antimatter containment) and wait for it to refill with antimatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m asking myself why I want fusion power when I have all the free antimatter I care to claim, and that 3m antimatter power satellite is available to launch whenever I need more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, 200Gw microwave power added per satellite is probably more than most people would know what to do with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, it makes my microwave thermal rockets produce way too much thrust and consume fuel far too quickly to be useful (basically like lighting a mainsail at full thrust with infinite fuel, carrying only an okto2 probe core). Of course, it probably also means I can already get useful amounts of power out at Jool, right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, perhaps this whole thing is better suited as a bug report for KSPI, even tho it\u0027s not exactly a bug as much as it is a \u0022this is working, but it\u0027s not working right\u0022 report.
