Unfulfilled. Even after 400 generations in villages and cities, we haven\u0027t forgotten. The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.\n\nSo I\u0027ve been working on adding the Kerbol system, along with almost every planet pack in existence, to [SpaceEngine](http://en.spaceengine.org/). It also comes with only 1 texture file, everything else is procedural. \n\n[![down1%255B1%255D.png](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g10j1xUi26U/T9LUI1ITo9I/AAAAAAAAAK0/J4jfgifA1ns/s1600/down1%255B1%255D.png)](http://www./download/8959n0t77u2r7rp/Space_Engine_-_Ultimate_Kerbal_-_Version_1.0.zip)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Remember to add the catalogs to your universe.cfg.\n\nNOTE: Planets may not look the same as in the screenshots, I beta-test 0.974 and also I have moved some stuff since I took the screenshots.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T15:16:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\_Augustus\\_**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T15:28:49Z","Content":"With Scatterer working for any and all planetary atmospheres in KSP, screenshots may be indistinguishable from space engine."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T15:29:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E With Scatterer working for any and all planetary atmospheres in KSP, screenshots may be indistinguishable from space engine.\n\n Pretty much."},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T17:49:17Z","Content":"Wut.\n\nWuuuuuuuuuut.\n\nThis... this is beautiful."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:33:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wut.\n\u003E Wuuuuuuuuuut.\n\u003E \n\u003E This... this is beautiful.\n\n Play with it!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylandro","CreatedById":80729,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T19:46:41Z","Content":"Oh man, oh man! \n\nThis looks awesome, and i love the fact that you acknowleged the fact that you added in Wexx and it\u0027s moons.
