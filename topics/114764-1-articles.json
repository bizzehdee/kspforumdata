I don\u0027t see a reason that KSP *wouldn\u0027t* run faster on an SSD; any time the game needs to pull something from its files (Save games, mods, craft files, etc.) it will be faster than on a HDD. \n\nI personally use KSP so often that it is one of the games I have on my SSD (256 GB).

Any thoughts?\n\nThe only difference will be a few seconds at best unless you are using a slow 5400rpm drive and have the game installed on OS/swap drive.\n\nSince I have 16gigs of ram I even tried installing it to a ram disk which is much quicker than a SSD and that made hardly a difference as well, so the bottleneck seems be with the way the game loads. It seems you will get more benefit from faster cpu than faster disk."},{"CreatedByName":"Johnny Wishbone","CreatedById":118096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:13:59Z","Content":"For what it\u0027s worth, here are the flash cards I am talking about:\n\n[http://www.e-itx.com/aps25m5a004g-pt.html](http://www.e-itx.com/aps25m5a004g-pt.html)\n\nThe stats aren\u0027t tremendous (145MB/sec sustained read, 50MB/sec sustained writes), but the price (free) is hard to beat! \n\nIt sounds like it won\u0027t be worth the effort, since the game already loads pretty quick to start with off my HDDs, and that\u0027s about the only place you\u0027d notice any improvement."},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:39:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s what I figured, but I didn\u0027t know if it was doing any other dynamic loading or swapping during gameplay.\n\nIf it did, we probably wouldn\u0027t have much problem with 32-bit KSP using too much memory."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T16:00:56Z","Content":"Not worth the bother. \n\nBut a proper big SSD makes a nice difference to everything, including KSP.
