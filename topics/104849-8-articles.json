When I was done I was hugely satisfied and that almost everything I wanted to be covered was. However the world the Stephenson created can easily be expanded in multiple entries and become an incredible Sci Fi series of books. If he could do that HBO could and undoubtedly should make a series out of it. Not a bad idea considering GOT only has about 2 or 3 seasons left. Honestly the first book alone is capable of being three or even four seasons.

It was a question of casting choice. After or during reading the book who you pictured in the roll of Watney. For example I think Matt Damon is the obvious choice. I think he is the safe choice because he will do a great job. However they had an opportunity choose someone out of the box like RDJ for Iron Man or Heath Ledger as the Joker.

Andy Weir said that they have kept a surprisingly large amount from the book in the movie and that it\u0027s very loyal to the plot of the book. So I trust Andy Weir, and based on the trailers we have seen it seems that it will be loyal to the book. Even though it looks like the Hermes crew will know Watney is alive from the beginning I still think they will stay true to the plot of not telling them as well. My theory is that they wouldn\u0027t cast Donald Glover as Rich Purnell and Sean Bean as Mitch. Why cast a great actor like Sean Bean as Mitch and why even bother having Rich Purnell if their isn\u0027t going to be the Mission Control mutiny? I know that theory is thin however I also feel it\u0027s too compelling of a plot. Also I am an video editor by trade and the trailer is heavily edited to make it look like watneys transmission is linear to mission control seeing it in conjunction with the Hermes. It\u0027s just good story telling in the trailer and they want to show the shock of everyone, in the trailer.

Although the second trailer seems a little lighter, it still feels like they stripped a lot of the humor out. For me the humor was what made the book really surprising and unique. And I still feel like the casting is all wrong. I\u0027ll go see it in the theater, but I won\u0027t be surprised at all if they screw it up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow many people read the Martian because of Tested and how many people are now reading Seveneves for the same reason?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read both, and I never even heard of Tested until just now. I\u0027ve actually been reading Stephenson since I picked up Snow Crash in 2000, and I\u0027ll say this: If you haven\u0027t read everything Neal Stephenson has ever written, you are doing yourself a disservice. He is a phenomenal author. Seveneves is a very good novel, but it is nowhere near his best. I just happen to be rereading The Diamond Age right now, which I haven\u0027t read in twelve years, and I have to say that it is completely different reading it again as a parent. (Yeah, I just said that about a science fiction novel.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes seveneves is on par with The Martian. I find it better only because it is so satisfyingly long. When I was done I was hugely satisfied and that almost everything I wanted to be covered was. However the world the Stephenson created can easily be expanded in multiple entries and become an incredible Sci Fi series of books. If he could do that HBO could and undoubtedly should make a series out of it. Not a bad idea considering GOT only has about 2 or 3 seasons left. Honestly the first book alone is capable of being three or even four seasons. But that is just me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveneves is actually a relatively short book by Stephenson standards. Most of his books are over a thousand pages. The Baroque Cycle is almost 3,000 pages, if you take all three books as one, which is the way he intended it to be read. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the Seveneves continuity would be ripe for more writing, and Stephenson has done that in the past, sort of. The Diamond Age is written in the same continuity as Snow Crash, but it isn\u0027t really a sequel since it is set about a hundred years later and doesn\u0027t share any characters or plotlines. In the same way The Baroque Cycle is a sort of prequel to Cryptonomicon: It shares a lot of the same themes, and many of the characters are related to each other, but the plots are disconnected. (Which is understandable, since the books are separated by roughly three hundred years.) So it isn\u0027t without precedent that he would write more in Seveneves, but I wouldn\u0027t count on it being a true sequel, or even anything that could provide a continuing storyline in the style of GoT. (If you want some insight into his view of that style of storytelling, read Reamde.) Besides, from what I hear he has been working on another huge historical fiction series and took a break from it to write Seveneves. So I wouldn\u0027t be expecting more science fiction from him anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T19:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo its Martinez\u0027s family. The wife and kid are Spanish. I am not saying that Watney couldn\u0027t have a spanish wife and son Its just that I remember the plot line now of Martinez. When they decide to do the earth gravity assist Martinez needs to tell his family that he isn\u0027t going to see them as soon as he they thought. So the clip is most likely from Martinez talking to his family. Just another case of them editing it so it looks like something else. If that isn\u0027t clear proof about how they edit it make it seem more compelling then I don\u0027t know what will. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI think it\u0027s less them lying and more them realizing they have thirty seconds to a minute to get people interested in the movie.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T20:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brethern\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brethern\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it\u0027s less them lying and more them realizing they have thirty seconds to a minute to get people interested in the movie.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s precisely my point!
