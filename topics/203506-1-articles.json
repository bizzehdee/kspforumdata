Other sounds (background music, support clamps detaching, etc) are still there, but not the rocket engines. None of the volume options in my settings are turned down to zero, so I don\u0027t know if there was some update I missed or if it\u0027s just a glitch.

I increased mine from 1 to 2 and it fixed my problem. Although since your sounds are a bit too loud, decreasing it might work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Henduluin","CreatedById":127932,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-02T10:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe I actually turned the normalizer off right after installing the game, but I\u0027ll take another look.
