I am playing in career mode and i am finding vehicles i just recovered still out there needing to be recovered. I also did my first rescue mission and just finished the space walk transfer and had time before my reentry so i went to the tracking station to clear the other ship and when i jumped back the kerbel was gone from my ship and my ship was reset back to where i was before where i am guessing it last auto saved. Lost that whole mission and cost. Leaving the tracking station to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has bad lag and graphics problems. And i do not like the throttle controls. They are reversed from your first attempt and it feels wrong. So i guess my question is, is there a way to change that? Tried the analog throttle but there was no change. On the plus side it hasn\u0027t crashed or lost my data. So maybe a hot fix in a week or two not a year or two.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-17T00:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry the Cursor preset.

I suspect that one guy tested the builds for about an hour each week just to say they worked on it. It seems clear that they continue to work on the PC version more even though modders are doing better work then they are. I wish they could have thrown us a bone since we had to wait so long like maybe mod support or just integrate a few. Mods like shine and planet packs are nice and i would love to get habitats and cargo mods but really i would be happy if they just integrate mechjeb and alarm clock into the base game if mods are never going to be supported. It will be interesting to read the weekly update this week to see what is said. I hope they look at fixing the bugs at least. However i do not expect anything from them for consoles past bug fixes. They may be a small crew but had they just put the PC expansions to the side for a month and thrown their full attention at this it wouldn\u0027t have been so buggy. I was concerned about this release since it has always seemed as an after thought its sad that my fears were correct.
