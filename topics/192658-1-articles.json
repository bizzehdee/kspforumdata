Fleets of seaplane bombers would form a mobile, resilient, and hard to detect striking force with the help and supply of submarines and dedicated support vessels. From there, they could carry nuclear payloads deep into the Soviet Union after launching from places where no Air Force bomber could hope to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nDespite the many marvels of Engineering that went into making the Seamaster a reality, it was doomed to the history books as a failed project.

The next video will likely showcase the F-111B Aardvark and tell the story of how a failed joint strike fighter of sorts led to the development of the greatest carrier-based interceptor ever - the F-14 Tomcat. As this is a new series, I\u0027d love to hear your comments on it below, or just ideas for future stories to tell in this medium.
