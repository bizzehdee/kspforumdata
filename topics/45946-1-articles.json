The most frustrating part is now we have to spend a whole bunch more time launching another vehicle. So I thought why not add user-created saves for use by the Revert Flight button?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that there are ways around many human errors like just using MechJeb for everything or click Space Center while the vehicle is still moving after a fatal crash. But using the Space Center loophole relies on the autosave which is iffy; sometimes you lose 30 minutes of progress while other times you only lose 5 seconds and can\u0027t avoid your error one way or the other. And using MechJeb is just boring and limits to user experience to just building the vehicle. I reserve MechJeb for ludicrously hard stuff like rendezvous but for everything else I like to pilot manually - its more fun and a whole lot more satisfying when something works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike for instance when I set a lander down 11.8 meters from another lander all manual. I was proud of myself for rivaling the accuracy and precision of a computer-controlled descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo quick saves - yes good idea? Or, no part of Kerbal is living with your mistakes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T20:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game already has a Quick Save/Load feature.
