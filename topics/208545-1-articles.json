Or, instead of a button, like engine plates, it could be a number input or a hybrid of both with the use of the quantity button at the top of the right click menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryaja","CreatedById":221431,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-11T21:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes!
