It\u0027s great to have finally got an account and so far, this place seems pretty gosh darn friendly! Some of my best moments in KSP were because of something here on the forums inspired me. Most of my missions to the Easter Eggs were because of here, before I had no patience or will to look for them. Now every time I even find a monolith, I get this great sense of accomplishment.

I love just about every aspect of this game, and I have spent a bit of time reading some of the tips and such on these forums, so I decided that I would actively join the KSP community here on the forums. I am a C# programmer and a hobbyist game developer, so I absolutely love the mod-friendly way that this game is being developed. I am also an extremely enthusiastic lover of all things science, physics, and astronomy, and I thoroughly enjoy the level of detail and realism that has gone into the KSP engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I am very glad to be joining such an active community and playing such a fun game. I have already played around a little bit with some very basic mod development for KSP, though I haven\u0027t been able to pull myself away from actually playing the game for long enough to get too far, so I am sure that at some point in the future I will be seeking some advice (and hopefully I may even be able to offer a little in return) as I begin to learn the KSP API\u0027s. Mostly, I just wanted to take the time to say thank you to Squad for such an awesome game, and to say hello to the community at large.
