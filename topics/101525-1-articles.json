There is no rush involved. KSP is damn near unique in this regard. Any other game having been in Alpha for this long would have been considered in \u0022development hell\u0022. Instead, Squad has been making money and building a customer base and volunteer developer base for years, long before even going to Beta. In fact, if Squad is still planning on adding features then the game is *still in Alpha*.\n\nDO NOT RUSH THE PRODUCT. Ubisoft rushed Assassin\u0027s Creed Unity out the door way too early, full of bugs, and has done huge damage not only to its bottom line but also its reputation.\n\nPushing a buggy 1.0 out the door will kill the golden goose.\n\nDo it right, admit it\u0027s still in Alpha, and continue development of new features up to 0.95 something along the lines of what Kerbart suggests, *then* call 0.96 to 0.99 the Beta tests. Use those only to squash bugs and optimize, not adding anything new to the game. Then when 1.0 finally is released, it will be polished, fast, and almost entirely bug-free.\n\nAnd then Squad can start making the **real** money. Right now, all you can buy from Squad is the game itself, T-shirts and coffee cups, a 3d printed kerbal, and that\u0027s about it. If 1.0 is a 4fps game when building a Minmus base with lots of parts, revenue will die. If instead the game runs fine even with a 1000 part base, then you\u0027re looking at KSP: the animated series and KSP: the movie and KSP: the lunchbox and KSP: the breakfast cereal and plush KSP dolls ... don\u0027t believe me?

Just temporarily weld the parts and be done with it.\n\nAgreed. If a Kerbal is in focus, then vessels in the vicinity should each just be one big collision mesh, one big display mesh and skin, and the locations and orientations of the ladders, hatches, and KAS grabbables relative to the root. If a vessel is in focus, then another vessel nearby should just be one big collision mesh, one big display mesh and skin, and the locations and orientations of the docking ports. Why treat a strut on a 500\u002B piece base as though it is going to move separately from the other stationary 200 tons of parts? There\u0027s no reason to do the calculations unless there is a collision, in which case the game could switch back to the full-parts description of the vessels. Doing this would increase the amount of RAM required to describe the scene, but vastly reduce the number of Physics calculations, probably by two orders of magnitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T04:56:07Z","Content":"Nah... 1.0 should be optimization. 0.99 should be where everything is released to the current owners of copies."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T13:50:46Z","Content":"McPoisoned is my twin.\n\nBut yeah, this would be great"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T15:43:53Z","Content":"the only problem I\u0027ve ever had with memory is the (slow motion)SLOW (exit slow mo) startups"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T15:53:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While true, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that we don\u0027t know. 1.0 could be rock solid optimized, or it could be a mess.
