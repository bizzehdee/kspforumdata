I\u0027m currently working on a part and before I get too far, I want to know the best way to position these colliders: How close can they be positioned? Can they overlap? should I leave a very small gap in between the colliders? Any guidance will be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T19:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eover lap them bit a little bit is best\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall Unity primitive icons can be manipulated via the component panel; or holding down SHIFT key and dragging the little square dots that appear around the collider\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mech_engr","CreatedById":117187,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T19:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!

Surface attachments - is what you usually want from hollow parts, no? So use it on your mesh or substitute low-poly and thrive with smooth part placement. That\u0027s step 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2 is deciding if your part will ever touch the ground or collide anything. If not, you may skip step 3, blue mesh collider will work fine for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf yes... then step 3 - you\u0027ll need some \u0022more physical\u0022 - GREEN Unity colliders. Those are box, capsule, mesh-with-convex and sphere... Add those exactly where you expect possible terrain collisions and skip the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at my mod\u0027s LTS core tank. Mesh is pretty much hollow. And I use only 2 small box colliders at top and bottom to prevent land-sinking. Nay... I lied. It\u0027s 3 physicals. Unity \u0022capsule\u0022 collider I used for central tank, as it\u0027s easier for game engine then mesh collider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso look at my Rugged Rover which have side hollows. Just 1 mesh collider (without convex) for all part-placing needs, 1 low-poly convex and 2 box colliders (for lids). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr RTG Rover - it has a single green physical - box collider for central... box. Why nothing on sides? Because attached wheels and RTGs will collide with terrain instead and... tiny enough physicals will still land-sink.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-24T18:36:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2014 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dr. Jet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T19:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the mesh collider in unity without checking the Convex box for a non-convex mesh (like your cargo bay). The only rule is that it must be a sealed object. This is that there are no holes in your mesh. I got caught by this when I did my stanford torus because I was trying to cut out polygons that would normally be invisible. Turns out this is worse for KSP than if I didn\u0027t remove the polygons, even though it should make sense from a stand point of model efficiency. KSP calculates the mesh tensor when you don\u0027t use the convex hull mode on the collider and if it finds holes it can\u0027t calculate the tensor. This can lead to models loading physics poorly and in some cases the ship blowing up because the physics glitched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Split the end caps of your cargo bay into separate model components. You can apply a convex hull to each of the components separately in Unity. This will let your model impact terrain correctly in KSP. Yes. You need convex hulls to hit terrain without going through it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The rest of the cargo bay hull uses the mesh collider without the convex hull. This will satisfy your cargo bay interior requirement. You can separate the doors and animate the physics for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mech_engr","CreatedById":117187,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T19:34:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a ton guys!!
