If I am correct and given your parents apathy (per your description of how long it takes them to do even an oil change) at getting work done, they are risking the wheel getting torn off the car. If it is the bearing and it fails completely there is a chance it could tear the hub apart and yeet the wheel.

I started up King Taco and it did not sound right. At all. Rough idle does not begin to describe it.

So I replaced the spark plugs, spark plug wires, and air filter, and I did a quick cleanout on the throttle body. It got better, but it still was rumbly, and the long-term fuel trim was running at about 13% at idle, then dropping to normal at 3,000 RPM, which still says minor vacuum leak. So I bit the bullet and bought a smoke machine on Amazon. It showed up this morning. I went ahead and popped off the intake hose, plugged it up with the smoke machine. Found the leak in about 30 seconds. (It\u0027s amazing how easy things are when you have the right tool.) There\u0027s this little 4-inch hose on the top of the intake plenum, it taps in just downstream of the throttle body. When I pulled it off, there was a giant crack on the side of one of the ends, totally invisible when the hose was in place.

As for the condition of your tires just yikes. Your parents terrify me with just how bad they let your car get. If I may be honest here, it feels to me they either do not understand just how dangerous a potentially bad wheel bearing (until your mechanic can confirm or deny my suspicion on that particular issue, but still even in general) or tires that badly worn are (which i hope is the case as its the lesser evil here) or worse dont care or cant be bothered to care (either of these last two are bad but the third is far more terrifying to me) but im so seriously not saying its either 3 but either way its scary. I think just to be safe you may (this is just a suggestion) need to have a long discussion with them about why they ignores your entreaties to check the car out and the potential (some of which can if it goes bad enough be lethal to you or others) outcomes of letting things go beyond no return. FWIW an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure.

I\u0027m putting everything back together after the compression test, running through all the stuff it could be in my head. Next logical step is a fuel injector, which is a colossal pain in the butt.
