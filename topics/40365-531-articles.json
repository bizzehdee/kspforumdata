Hah. Welp, at least, in theory, KSP-I is a bit ahead of the curve vis a vis heat management. I have no doubt that KSP-I will, at some point, have a mechanism to vent that heat out with, say, that produced from the fusion reactors. It just makes sense - I can see the lol\u0027s at having a perfectly cooled rocket nuclear thermal rocket craft explode because the secondary NERVA\u0027s melted down... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the mean time, I guess I\u0027ll have to ignore NERVA\u0027s, or settle for ridiculous part counts.

KSPI-E is a great mod and the developer is making great strides towards getting it all working in 1.0.2, but the direction he\u0027s taking it is... less than ideal. KSP has this really unique balance of realism and comic mischief that makes it fun; mods like TAC-LS and KSPI-E try to make it \u003Cstrong\u003Etoo\u003C/strong\u003E serious, and that ruins the fun for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E My biggest complaint about KSPI-E is its dependence on Community Tech Tree, the monster tech tree abomination that takes 5 months of real gameplay to unlock anything meaningful. I have a career save right now that had a bunch of cool stuff unlocked; I had a OKS station in orbit of Kerbin and was about to launch a UKS base to Mun/Minmus, and I installed KSPI-E to add more spice, and suddenly 75% of the parts I\u0027d already unlocked were locked again and wouldn\u0027t be unlocked for another 500-1000 science.

To be fair, Community Tech Tree did provide a neat and integrated solution to the ongoing problem of the KSP-I tech tree, but now that tech trees are contained in config files it\u0027s not strictly required. There is a growing demand for a port of \u0022stock\u0022 KSP Interstellar, so we can all have a go at emulating Scott Manley in the 1.0 release.

Take for example current generation aviation versus 1903; in less than 100 years, we went from looking at the sky as a dream to landing on the moon and planting flags. Now, flight is considered considerably more trivial, with children\u0027s toys having better flight capability than the flying machine the Wright brothers developed back in 1903. KSP-I is along those same lines; this is distant future tech we\u0027re talking about, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s positioned so end-game; it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Esupposed\u003C/em\u003E to change everything, and it\u0027s designed to be used in career mode, where it\u0027s expensive and takes a while to unlock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T07:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you think that the most advanced part of the stock tech tree is the NERVA, a 1967 project...
