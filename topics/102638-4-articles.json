KSP already checks for SOI transition and planet intersection, and Harv stated it will slow down the timewarp on SOI boundary approach.\u003Cp\u003ESOI is basically distance from origin; there is no real reason the same method for SOI transition can\u0027t be used to determine if you smack into a planet, or the planet\u0027s atmosphere for that matter, since both of those things on the scaled space level are essentially the distance from origin E: which is a simple trigonometric function. After that it\u0027s a simple exercise in letting the player be as idiotic as they want, damn the consequences, or treating them like they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing and slowing down warp if something catastrophic would happen. Any of the boundary checking functions can take advantage of the SOI boundary prediction code to either let the player crash at full timewarp or be allowed maximum timewarp with slowdowns before any boundary transition, as 5thHorseman suggests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T06:52:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kofeyh","CreatedById":39949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T06:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Damien_The_Unbeliever\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Damien_The_Unbeliever\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnless they\u0027ve been doing something silly with GC, the way that you reduce garbage collections is by reducing the amount of garbage you produce - so it\u0027s kind of implied that they\u0027ve been improving on their memory usage (probably by reducing unnecessary allocations or introducing object pools or something similar).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not so much \u0022doing something silly with GC\u0022, it\u0027s that there is virtually no GC.
