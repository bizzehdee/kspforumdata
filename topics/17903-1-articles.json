It includes a return module in case the station must be abandoned in an emergency (such as Jeb going on another rampage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Petulance-class LKO Lifter has enough fuel to get up to a circular orbit between the Mun and Kerbin, after which it discards its ascent stage and uses a single large LV-909 for maneuvers. It is equipped for a return flight but not for controlled landings on the Mun/Minmus/other bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I found was that the final maneuvering to bring the lifter to the station was very difficult to do manually. It mostly consisted of reducing distance by 100m, then turning in the direction of apparent motion, then repeating until within 100m of the target. (Getting within 100km was a huge pain too, but that was mostly because the orbital planes weren\u0027t perfectly aligned.) Anybody have tips for streamlining this process?
