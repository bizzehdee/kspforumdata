I know reusability on the Falcon 9\u0027s second stage has been shelved in favor of development of the MCT, and nobody else is even considering it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s say I was given the task of designing a fully reusable (aside from a few minor components like payload fairings) launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll assume the design is a multi-stage rocket, capable of lifting at least 10 metric tons into LEO - enough for a manned spacecraft, a space station resupply, and some GSO, Molniya, or other high-energy satellite launches. The basic design will be 2STO - the second stage of a 3STO design would have a very high burnout velocity, leaving it on a very difficult reentry trajectory. Strap-on boosters may be used to boost payload capacity as high as 20 tons to LEO. The upper stage will only deliver its payload to trajectories of similar energy to GTO - this is because a reusable stage will naturally have a poor mass ratio making it inneficient to send payloads directly to high-energy orbits, and you\u0027re throwing away a reusable vehicle if you put out on an Earth escape trajectory. Some type of \u0022kick stage\u0022 will be used for high-energy orbits; this may be a cheap hypergolic or solid-fueled stage, or a pricier cryogenic stage where maximum performance is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChoice of fuels: First of all, hypergolics shouldn\u0027t be fueling the main engines of a launch vehicle, because they\u0027re toxic, corrosive, and otherwise a pain in the ass to deal with. Kerosene\u0027s low specific impulse makes it decidedly suboptimal for upper stages. Hydrolox is very efficient, but a bad choice for lower stages because hydrolox engines have a poor TWR and atmospheric ISP. For upper stages, it may not be the best option either due to boiloff. Methane may offer the best of both worlds, offering reasonable density and insulation requirements (boosting mass ratio compared to hydrolox) as well as decent specific impulse and TWR. In addition, it reduces residue in engines compared to kerosene, making reuse easier, and as a gaseous fuel any leaks or spills are inherently less hazardous. Therefore it will be assumed that both stages will use metholox engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Recovery:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I consider there to be four main ways of landing a stage. 1: parachutes (highest vertical speed on touchdown, very poor accuracy, but easy redundancy by using a cluster of parachutes. 2: parafoils (low vertical speed, some horizontal speed on touchdown. Slight cross-range capability, hopefully allowing a runway to be targeted. Any long skinny object like a rocket would have to land on its side, making landing gear design and parafoil suspension a bit interesting. Harder to make redundant.) 3: wings (effectively zero vertical speed on landing, but very high horizontal speed. Wings are very heavy and add a lot of drag during ascent, but offer excellent cross-range capability). 4: propulsive landing (effectively zero vertical speed and horizontal on landing. Weight penalty is that of reserve fuel, not of engines, and is fairly small. In theory adds little mechanical complexity, but as the Falcon 9 has shown additional control systems may need to be added).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also three main places to land a stage: A: On land (this is the best option for an upper stages, but for lower stages this requires lots of dV for a turnaround manuever) B: In the ocean (requires the least dV and landing precision, but saltwater exposure vastly increases maintenance costs, especially for liquid-fueled stages). C: On a floating platform in the ocean (less dV for lower stages. Precision requirements similar to land, but platform drift and wave action make life much harder. Use of a semi-submersible platform instead of a barge like SpaceX has could make things easier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives us twelve options. We can immediately eliminate parachute landing for liquid fueled stages, because the touchdown speeds are unsurvivable for a high mass-ratio stage. An SRB should be okay as long as it lands in the ocean. Winged landing in the ocean is a near-guaranteed crash, and winged landing on a floating platform is unfeasible due to the runway length required. We\u0027ll also eliminate water landings of any sort for liquid-fueled stages because they make refurbishment a massive pain. Finally, a winged upper stage would interfere with the vehicle\u0027s aerodynamic stability on launch, and is therefore undesirable. This leaves us with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor upper stage: parafoil or propulsive landing on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor lower stage: propulsive or parafoil landing on land (with boostback), winged landing on land (with flyback), or propulsive or parafoil landing on a floating platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor boosters: same as lower stage if liquid-fueled. If solid-fueled, glideback and winged touchdown on land, or parachute landing in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the velocity of the lower stage and boosters will be kept low enough for a tailfirst reentry, but the second stage will be coming back from orbit, and can\u0027t just reenter on its engines. So, it needs a heat shield. With a monolithic heat shield, reentry must be nose-first, but what about with inflatables? Can an inflatable heat shield be designed that will cover the engines, and then be deflated in flight to allow for propulsive landing? For a nose-first reentry, how do you turn the stage around for a propulsive landing? Or is it better to just have special landing thrusters for an \u0022upside-down touchdown?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a launch to LEO, the upper stage must have a minimum orbital operation time of 12 hours (enough for the launch site to come below the orbital plane), but 24 hours is preferable to allow for multiple landing opportunities. For a launch to GTO, the stage must perform a small apogee manuever, aerobrake from GTO into LEO 10.5 hours after the initial GTO insertion, boost its periapse, and wait several more hours before deorbiting, again requiring at least 24 hours of on-orbit operations. Is it best to stay simple and use batteries, or are solar panels worth the weight savings? For that matter, since methane will have a little boiloff, what about siphoning off the gases to power a fuel cell or internal combustion engine (Apparently ULA\u0027s Vulcan is supposed to power its upper stage this way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any other ideas you guys have?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:25:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an upper stage, every kilogram spent on a heat shield, batteries, avionics, and fuel for deorbit and propulsive landing subtracts \u003Cem\u003Edirectly \u003C/em\u003Efrom the payload mass.

Once you hit the desired altitude for deploying the heli blades you unlock them from the side of the stage and aerodynamic forces automatically deploy them as well as spin them up. So now you have an upside down fuel tank with a nozzle pointing up slowing down due to the lift provided by the free spinning heli blades. At this point you have control and can fine tune your dive towards the landing pad by angling the blades. You dive in just like a lifting body would and right above the landing pad you set the angle of the heli blades for maximum lift, they spin up and allow you to make a soft, controlled landing, no engine required, just gravity, air, and controlling the angle of the blades. This method also allows for a glide slope so you can guide the vehicle to the pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe technique of diving in and allowing the blades to spin up for a soft landing is a proven technique employed by helicopter pilots in the event of an engine malfunction in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5; Rotors (zero vertical and horizontal speed on touchdown, with cross-range capability.
