I have been having memory problems with Windows 32 bit KSP for the last few versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using a few mods with parts, but none of the huge ones (like Interstellar or B9).

Is this actually how it is for most people using tons of parts mods or is there something up with my install, perhaps a mod is doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny input would be appreciated, even if it is \u0027yeah, we crash after a few launches too\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorey\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T23:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game does have some memory leaks in it..
