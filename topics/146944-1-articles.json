I have my own original style of drawing and i also enjoy doing it. I like trying new things to make art with, for example: i found a charcoal pencil and it makes drawing alot more fun while you play around with it. I also tried out painting, even though im bad at it, i do quite enjoy it.. So this is what i plan to do for the future: i think im going sell my art untill i become a rich enough to..., to what you might ask? Become a\u00A0space tourist. With SpaceX\u0027s current with at least 150,000 dollars. And since this piece of art costs thousands:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fx6lbxn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fx6lbxn.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022562\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think i can at least make 10 euros with my art. Alot of people say that i need to become an artist and study art more. But im not studying art. I want to keep my original style with me. Otherwise it will blend in with the other pieces of art, wich makes it hard to get more attention. Here is the best drawing i made that i could find on the internet (i am very sorry for bad photography ): ) (i could do better though, i dont have time to put the best piece of art on the web)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kapunka_by_tardigrade19-da3zsbp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://pre08.deviantart.net/329a/th/pre/i/2016/147/2/f/kapunka_by_tardigrade19-da3zsbp.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd before becoming a space tourist. I am also thinking of becoming a writer. Everyone can write a story, and sell it. I think writing stories is fun, it allows me to burst out some of my creative ideas. And i do have some ideas. (just a maybe not 100% sure if i can write good stories)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere some pro\u0027s and con\u0027s:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPro\u0027s: Becoming artists works perfect for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Making artist my job is better than working at McDonalds. (but slower)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-My orginal artstyle (especially of drawing people) grabs more people\u0027s attention than your regulair ultra-realistic or way-too-kawaii-anime artstyle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCon\u0027s:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-It does not do anything good to the world. It is pretty much useless (unless i give some money to charity)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you think? Are you jealous? Do you think im an arrogant boi who overestimates himself? Do you think i can\u00A0go for it? Do you think im an attention freak because i post these kind of things quite a bit? (just sharing my thoughts) Do you like or hate my artstyle? (only on image shown now probably need to post more) Is my art worth1000?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease note that the things above are just \u0027\u0027dreams\u0027\u0027 for now. Im not exactly sure if it could become the truth. But im becoming an artist for sure. Thats it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-02T17:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was a kid in grade school, all I wanted to be was a paleontologist. I loved dinosaurs, couldn\u0027t think of anything else I would want to do but dig up dinosaur bones. Knowing myself now, forty years later, I wouldn\u0027t have made it two weeks as a paleontologist. It\u0027s extraordinarily fine, detailed, tedious work, and I just don\u0027t have the temperament for that. But that was fine, because at the age of 10 I went to my first air show, and I was gobsmacked. From that day forward all I wanted to do was fly jets. I had all the posters on my walls, I knew all the tech specs, I kept up with all the latest developments in aerospace and weapons technology. I had the brains, I was a great student, I was in great shape.\u00A0I was going to go to college on ROTC, I was going to graduate and go to flight school, and I was going to be an aviator. That was my dream and I was going to work hard and make it happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then I turned eighteen and reality gave me a very rude slap in the face. It turns out, that if you have 20/20 vision, you need not even bother applying to become a pilot in the Air Force or the Navy. Because they get so many applicants with better than 20/20 vision, that\u0027s where the cut-off starts. As it turned out, my vision was so bad, I didn\u0027t even qualify to become an officer at all, never mind an aviator. And you can improve a lot of things with hard work, but you can\u0027t improve your vision.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that was that. I had been so focused on my dream that I had no other plan. I\u0027d been accepted to a bunch of colleges, but\u00A0I had no money, I hadn\u0027t applied for any other scholarships besides ROTC. I drifted aimlessly for a few months after I graduated. I had scored incredibly high on the armed forces vocational tests I took at the end of high school, so all the recruiters had my number, the phone was ringing off the hook. The Navy called and offered me a spot in their nuclear power program with a huge enlistment bonus, so I said, \u0022Sure, why not.\u0022 I did that for six years, really didn\u0027t like it, got out. Got a job at a pump company, fell backwards into computers there and found out I was really good with them, turned it into a career. But am I passionate about them, do I love working with computers, is it\u00A0my dream career? Hardly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, all that to say a couple of things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDreams are great. I will never tell anyone to not pursue their dreams. In fact, I will tell you that life is short, way shorter than you think it is,\u00A0and that you should pursue your dreams now, today, with all of the strength and passion you can muster.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat said, be prepared for the fact that your dreams may not pan out the way you think they will. You may not end up paying the bills with your dream job. You may end up having to give up your dream entirely. Have a Plan B. Have another skill that can pay the bills while you do your dream on the side, or if it just doesn\u0027t work out.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving to go with Plan B is not the end of the world. Today I have a great life. I have a good job, I have a wonderful family, good friends, I love where I live. I have had an amazing life with incredible experiences that I am sure would never have happened if I had taken a different path.\u00A0I look back on that dream of being a pilot, and in a way I\u0027m almost glad it didn\u0027t happen. I certainly wouldn\u0027t go back and change things if I had the chance. So if Plan A doesn\u0027t work out, have faith that Plan B will be just as exciting and fulfilling, maybe even more so.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T23:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA\u00A0 couple of tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get complacent in your skills, you can always do better- having a real mastery of drawing is a long road. Choose the teachers who everyone deems too hard, those that don\u0027t give out easy A\u0027s. These are the teachers that will push you to the next level, not the flaky \u0022everything is art\u0022 types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 It seems like you are getting caught up in your own particular style, but it is still good to know the the basic visual art rules so you have them in your toolbox.

Also, don\u0027t be afraid to take lessons if you want, I used to be just like you, avoiding lessons because of my style. I thought that if i took lessons my art would suddenly not have my touch in it, but that could not be further from the truth! I learned how to use proportions to my advantage, shading and some handy tips with contrast, and my sketchy style is still with me.

Even though it is fun and popular to bash a seemingly simple piece of artwork that raised a huge amount of money, most artists have to work very hard and with a lot of skills to make ends meet. They do it because they have a burning desire to do so. They cannot be stopped and they cannot be helped and that is why they do what they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
