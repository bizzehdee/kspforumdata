Built into the non-procedural planet/moon/Asteroid?\n\nA bit like the monument on the MUN only natural in origin.\n\nAn interesting additional reason for going and landing. Photo oportunity!\n\nPerhaps a cave with some natural but interesting formation inside.\n\nA deep narrow crevasse only accessible by EVA/jetpack with interesting formations at the bottom.\n\nA geyser that periodically shoots particles into space and from the ground looks terrifying!\n\nA weird hollow asteroid\n\nA forest of rock pillars that look like they could have been made by wind or water. Keep the scientists talking for years.\n\nMaybe my imagination is a bit too grand and it may be too difficult to implement but if they were all made of one part and any animation like for geysers could use existing rocket engine effects adapted for the situation.\n\nWhat do you lot think? too much?"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T14:41:29Z","Content":"You speak truth.

Keep the scientists talking for years.\n\nThis actually got me thinking about Lem\u0027s \u0027Fiasco\u0027. Once the terrain scatter gets solid I would like to get lost in one of those.\n\nI like the idea. Some more formations on the planets would be pretty fun to explore and drive around. I would especially like canyons with sharp edges. You drive your rover and then the road suddenly ends! Surprise sky diving! ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nI think that caves are impossible in the game right now.

The impact crater with the central island, several significant mountain peaks and valleys, numerous lakes etc. \n\n Maybe as a starting point some of these already existing features, and similar things on other bodies, could be officially named and marked in some way."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T21:44:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If the whole cave was actually a model made with the same texture as the planet?\n\u003E It could all be above the \u0027real\u0027 ground level just *seem* to be part of the planet.\n\u003E \n\u003E No different really than the monument on The Mun.

On the other hand the pyramid on Duna looks pretty good. At least it did last time I visited the place.

Imagine doing the same anywhere else.\n\nEventually you could rebalance science to make sure those place are slightly more interesting (yet only fully explorable in EVA/rover)"}]}
