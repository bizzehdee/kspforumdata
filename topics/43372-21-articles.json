While they don\u0027t specify what could cause an accidental bit flip, one possible source is cosmic radiation. Unfortunately that is extremely difficult to prove, especially if it\u0027s a soft error (I. E. It goes away after power cycle). I must admit that I help design IC chips for a living and the chips I work on often find their way into ground, air and satellite applications. So I am familiar with rad hard design and testing. However, in terms of electronics for Mars One, rad hard design is pretty well understood and there are a lot of things you can do to mitigate it. As an example, SpaceX Falcon uses triple FPGA voting system to avoid bit errors due to radiation. Now I don\u0027t know if they use something like Xilinx\u0027s rad hard FPGAs which is expensive and has the triple voting built-in, or if they have 3 separate industrial or military grade FPGAs and roll their own external triple voting system. Either way, these kinds of things can be done for Mars One, plus they should still see a lot less radiation on Mars surface than in the Van Allen belts or Geo (where many satellites operate for long periods of time). Overall, I would say that surface radiation would be more if a concern for people\u0027s health, and it even so, they have a lot of other technical hurdles that I am not convinced they can solve.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T23:41:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by VirtualCLD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T03:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was watching the Apollo 11 Mission Audio and in the comments someone said \u0022I hope we get to Mars one day\u0022 or something to that effect.

And if .... goes wrong, they can actually come back. Psychological problems would be very limited. Heck you could rotate people out every few months with a moon one. Almost all teh stuff that could be done on mars could be tested out on the moon. The hydroponic food, the solar power systems, the longterm effects of people living in pods. it would give us a 3rd data point in teh \u0022gravity vs no-gravity\u0022 on health effects. Only major problem is that the moon has markedly less water to work with and no carbon (most of the hardware Ive read from mars1 would be to extracting water and carbon from the martian soil)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck they could even experiment on a lot of other crap with a moonbase. I\u0027m sure every kerbal engineer has turned out a spacetug, ship that never sees any surface again after it launches the first time. Theres always that radio telescope on the opposite side of the moon shielded from all the interference from earth. Mars is just too far away, and too big of a step.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T05:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMerged into the existing Mars One possible-scam thread. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T08:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it has every sign of it being a scam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there is no slightest chance for them to get it going in a deadlines they announced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that mazes me though is that they keep on gaining support from various bigger or smaller institutions and companies.... even though good 90% of their project is made of \u0022potential suppliers\u0022 / \u0022negotiated vehicles\u0022 / \u0022concept studies\u0022.
