If you want to transport an entire base in one trip and don\u0027t want to sit around performing a burn that\u0027s an hour long, you\u0027ll need to scale up your propulsion system, both fuel and engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as geometry goes, I like to put the engines right in the middle for very large ships, and in a 4x symmetry or higher orientation.

Unlike a 1-shot rocket, you never know how a multi-part ship will work until you\u0027ve got it all put together after however many launches of parts and then tankers to top up the tanks. Will it wobble too much? Will it hold together? Is it so imbalanced that it won\u0027t fly straight? Does it have enough delta-V? Will the burn times be measured in months or years? It\u0027ll probably take several attempts to answer each of these questions, and each attempt will likely involve multiple launches of parts and tankers, with redesigns between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative is to launch a flotilla of smaller ships, maybe with the intent to connect them at the destination, maybe keep them separate. Smaller ships require less tweaking so fewer mulligans and the mulligans are less complex. The downside, however, is to have no more ships than you can handle at once, mostly meaning they arrive at different enough times that you can deal with them individually. This tends to work out pretty well by itself; a few hours difference in departure time at Kerbin gets amplified to days or weeks the further away you go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T06:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe downside, however, is to have no more ships than you can handle at once\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue.
