In the process of doing this, it turns out that the Raptr feature of AMD\u0027s portal has identified me as the #1 KSP player on Raptr - which simply means that I\u0027ve played a lot of Kerbal (and probably that the Raptr community doesn\u0027t have a very large user base). One of the advantages of the AMD Gaming Evolved portal is that it collects data from players and then offers the end user the option of optimizing their AMD hardware specifically for that game based on the results of the community data collection. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if anyone could help me with the KSP forum: I would like to add a signature to my KSP forum account posts but dont find a way to do that. Help appreciated. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screenshot of the portal, which I forgot to mention also includes a game overlay to activate clip and replay capture as well as automatic twitch streaming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www./view/1edc79ls4xlvjeo/FullScreenAMD_Raptr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FullScreenAMD_Raptr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will assist anyone with the AMD portal, overlay, and Raptr community features - kind of like an ambassador - until I get sick of doing that.
