All of that logic is in EL, and dependent on whether that EL\\_USI.cfg exists.  (Or other similar configs.)\n\nThis is the part that annoys me: That people act like other mods have to do something to be compatible.  Any EL part uses whatever recipes EL specifies. MKS changes the EL recipes, so therefore any EL part will use the MKS recipes if MKS is installed.  There\u0027s no extra step, no having to choose, it just works: If you have the MKS recipe file loaded, those recipes get used.  Regardless of what launchpad you use to build.\n\nNow, the \\*production chain\\* is a different story, there each part needs to specify what it consumes and produces.  But Keridian Dynamics doesn\u0027t attempt to provide a full production chain to MaterialKits anyway.  (Though it does have an optional config for the Furnace that lets you put it into the chain.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr Farnsworth","CreatedById":147177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-09T18:44:47Z","Content":"Wow, I didn\u0027t mean to \u0022annoy\u0022 you. \n\nUsing the  EL\\_USI.cfg  file to get EPL to play nice with MKS lite **IS** annoying because there was no information included with MKS Lite that explained this need **AND** it was not included in the mod\u0027s files.

So if I explained something incorrectly, made a comment, or asked a question that a mod maker would know automatically and ruffled some feathers in the process, I apologize. \n\nI do however love Kerbal Space Program and enjoy mods such as EPL, KPBS, and Keridian.

To have two variants for several adapters seems real overkill now.  \n\nThe non-passable series is pretty strait forward with three different tanks for each size and an adapter for 1.25 to 2.5 and one for 2.5 to 3.75 (I could add a 1.25 to 3.75 adapter, but is there a need for?):\n\nSpoiler\n\n![YPcFzuY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YPcFzuY.jpg)\n\nThe crew-passable series is more complicated.
