Try how fast you can get, and how high, with a 10m/s climb after you level at 20kms, and you will see what I\u0027m talking about. With practice you will be able to get to that speed and altitude, faster, but everybody needs to fool around with ascent profiles till they become comfortable with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stacking trick with intakes, BTW, is to clip them in a column of cubic orthogonal struts. Can be done without it, but the easiest way to replicate is through part clipping on the debug menu (ALT\u002BF12).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T18:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice job.

This is an example of my best flight, by the time I get up to 1200 M/s on jets I\u0027m practically out of air even with all these intakes, then I aim straight up best I can to get into orbit.

The wing connector doesn\u0027t line up with the whole thing, and you can\u0027t put it in the same direction as a wing without it going through and/or looking bad :/\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also wondering the point of adding just liquid fuel when you can take some from the rocket engines anyways. For now I only want it to get to orbit, interplanetary missions with stock parts won\u0027t really be good I think. I cant find a way to use the mk3 fuselage and cockpit that looks good because of this wing problem. Big gaps in the middle of the plane between wings look bad too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to stay with stock parts but I think the game has just too far to go with spaceplanes as it stands now :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPwings fix that. They are more stable, look nicer, etc. Also, you sound like me where you don\u0027t like to go above a 4-1 intake-engine ratio. The solution is to bring more rocket fuel so you can brute force your way to orbit. Also try to bring some reaction wheels and gimballing rockets (LV-45 offers better ISP and more thrust than aerospike, plus less weight and gimballing). Don\u0027t let \u0022most of the community\u0022 dictate how you play the game. I\u0027ve been fighting with SSTOs for months and I still haven\u0027t gone above 4 intakes to an engine. Another trick I use is to use the engine nacelle in place of a structural fuselage. It\u0027s actually lighter and gives you air. Win win. Use 4 jets. use a bigger plane with 4 jet engines. Then shut off two when you reach higher altitudes. This lets your intakes feed all their air to less engines and maximizes your altitude and speed. I can get to 24000m and 1300m/s on a 2-1 intake ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to cruise for a while to get that speed. For me, it takes about 60-70 liters of jet fuel per engine to get to rocket ignition. Also, the radial intakes lose almost all effectiveness above 20km. They become dead weight at that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T12:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XOIIO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XOIIO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow that I am a bit better at flying them I got similar results, although I had a bit less liquid fuel and half as much oxidizer.

It looks good, and as I\u0027m sure you have found out, the vertical speed indicator is crucial. What you do after flameout depends mostly on your T/W and speed, but it sounds like you are wasting tons of fuel pulling up too sharply. I know keeping inside the atmosphere will increase drag, so you want to leave it as soon as possible, but as long as you ascent speed is above 100m/s, you won\u0027t lose that much. So try to increase rate of climb just before you run out of air (when you are almost level at your top height and pretty much stop accelerating, pull up and build vertical speed until it flames out), and then only burn 10-30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA up from your prograde vector, depending on T/W, and you will see some gains. As long as you get the vertical speed indicator to go over 100 during your rocket burn, and end it close or above 40kms, you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to building tips, yeah, only the ram intakes really make sense, since they are the ones that work best at high speeds and thin air, where the others don\u0027t do much if anything. And RAPIERS aren\u0027t really inefficient at all, just 10s less of isp than the LV-T30s, they just have a lot of thrust so run through the fuel faster. But that means they will lift more! And also that you can thrust closer to the horizon on the climb, and be more efficient on your climb. Plus, the automatic switching is very noob-friendly, you just have to remember to close the intakes so they stop producing drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd contrary to what Sierra is saying (sorry!) smaller is usually easier. A single tank (you can tweak the fuel load by right-clicking on it since 0.23), and a single RAPIER, cabin, and a couple of wings will get to orbit practically on its own. The important things are the mass ratios of the propulsion plant, the fuel, and the payload. T/W and delta-V come from those, and big designs make it more difficult to keep track of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you want to go big (we all do!), there are indeed ways of making the stock wings look good with a lot of surface. You could do biplanes that don\u0027t look like it (i.e: my white Dart), or something like this, where not only the wings are a composite of small parts, but the \u0022hull\u0022 of the cargo bay also provides lots of lift:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bJXYY9G\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bJXYY9G.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bJXYY9G.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
