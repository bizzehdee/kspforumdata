Being able to see what you got, how much it\u0027s worth, and weigh that against your limited uses of the experiment and the promise of more valuable data ahead, that makes it very interesting. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is a much better system that discourages transmission spam. In fact, I\u0027ve found that it doesn\u0027t discourage the core type of mission that led to science spam (a very compact lander unit coupled with a mothership it returns to regularly), but rather speeds things up during such missions. If I had one suggestion to make, though, it would be to add a \u0022data bank\u0022 part (or functionality to the larger probe cores) so that un-Kerballed missions could also store experiment data and thus probes could be used in a similar fashion for the non-physical experiments. Returning probes instead of transmitting is a very real strategy that even we humans use in our space program, and it would make a lot more sense than sending a ship with 6 of every instrument to observe the Jool system, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T16:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HarvesteR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HarvesteR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy initial idea was in fact to have the experiments become inoperable immediately after use.

It felt very frustrating to have to \u0027guess\u0027 at a good spot to deploy, and risk losing a good experiment if you missed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realized then that it was because the game wasn\u0027t giving me a choice. When you run an experiment now, it will only become inoperable once the data is \u0027consumed\u0027 for transmission. So it\u0027s not so much like litmus paper anymore, but it still makes sense if you consider that the sample \u0027tray\u0027 or whatever the data gathering apparatus inside the module is will get destroyed in the process of being converted into something that can be transmitted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis then became a good way to separate the \u0027physical\u0027 experiments from the more \u0027digital\u0027 ones. The goo container and materials bay do have physical samples inside, so those have to be destroyed to be processed into transmittable data. The other experiments are either abstract, like reports, or are somewhat \u0027digital\u0027 in nature, like a temperature or gravity scan, so those can be freely reused since their data is already transmittable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a gameplay standpoint, I like how this means you now have to manage your science \u0027cargo\u0027. If you\u0027re doing a mission across several new subject types, you now have the choice to dump a less valuable experiment for a possibly more valuable one, and making informed choices is a key element of fun gameplay. This is why the initial idea also didn\u0027t work. You had to make a choice, but you didn\u0027t have any information to let you weigh the options, so that became frustrating.
