You can see this if you look in the science archives -- every experiment you\u0027ve done in every biome and situation is listed separately, with the amount of science you collected for it already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich version of KSP are you playing? There are more/different biomes in some newer versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, there are the minibiomes. Have you driven a rover/airplane around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and done experiments? Have you tried touching\u00A0every building? Have you flown to the other airstrips/launchpads and tried doing experiments there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are the natural biomes. Each land biome (currently) extends into the water (although mountains and highlands are mighty hard to find). And you can get one complete set of science while you are on land, and another complete set while you are \u0022splashed\u0022. The water biome also extends onto the solidified water, if you can think of somewhere to land on solidified water (because there are small pools of meltwater around).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is flying. Thermometers, Variometers, and Crew Reports can be done while flying low over every natural biome. Variometers can also be used while flying high (over 18km) over each natural biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn low space, you can do EVA reports, and Gravity reports over each natural biome. High in space (over 250km) you can still do gravity reports over each biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, many experiments can be done once while flying low, flying high, in space low, and in space high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt normal difficulty, all combined it\u0027s enough to generate well over 800 science points. Which is enough to take you very deep into the tech tree. And exploring Kerbin is fun! It\u0027s the most detailed world in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, it\u0027s trivially easy to send a one-way probe on a flyby of the Mun and then out of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E into orbit around the Sun.
