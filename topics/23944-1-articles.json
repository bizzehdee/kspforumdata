I thought I\u0027d share a couple of videos of this particular design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst one is a circuit at the Kerbal Space Center, second is climbing to orbit. I\u0027m using the FAR mod, although really just for flight surface assignments. The plane is stable in flight, a little wobbly and hard to control up to orbit though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the secret here was simplicity, keeping the weight down and airframe strong enough to stay in one piece. The only alteration is the addition of winglets when flying around the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyRuV76Gvpw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyRuV76Gvpw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_CrUgB6S2Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_CrUgB6S2Q\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T00:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting approach - a non air-breathing SSTO! I guess the question is, does this work just as well without the wings, as it seems to go pretty much straight into a vertical climb and use a rocket ascent profile, rather than a plane ascent profile?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zatie12","CreatedById":57823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T00:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is true - apart from the initial turn onto heading and pitch up, I didn\u0027t really make much use of the wings when ascending to orbit.

Given that your plane is rocket-powered, I\u0027m thinking doing an aerodynamic flight ascent rather than a ballistic ascent is just going to waste fuel fighting gravity. I guess wings on a rocket are useful in the event it doesn\u0027t have enough thrust in the lower atmosphere to climb, and so needs the wings, but otherwise it would seem more sensible to just go straight up if you are carrying your own oxidiser.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
