I think it has to do with attachment and that the bit you can select is now under the skin of whatever you attached it to. I say this because I have another problem with attachment/CoM. If you place the radar and the multispectral on opposite sides of a craft you would expect them to balance each other as they have the same mass. Unfortunately they don\u0027t and end up torquing the craft while thrusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking through the part.cfgs I have found another issue, attachRules is defined twice for all sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdward\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mjones1052","CreatedById":90415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T18:08:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESilly question ... is anyone still actively developing this Mod?

I feel as though mods like this are essential to the game, they should actually be in vanilla one day. But this mod with the updated parts is a great start and I hope it isn\u0027t abandoned. I did play around last night and got some of the science working so radars actually give science now when in orbit. But the actual coding still needs work to finish entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T18:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you can fix the multispectral part\u0027s unselectability and imbalance by editing its cfg and changing node_attach to node_attach = 0.0, -0.09, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0 and adding CoMOffset = 0, 0.0865, 0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperlynx","CreatedById":90829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T21:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot if you\u0027ve done the math.
