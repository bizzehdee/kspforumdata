Hard enough in real life, very easy in KSP. Therefore, a suitable mobility requirement would be to drive 25\u00A0kilometers from the landing site. However, you should use Bon voyage mod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMooncasts\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe real LXP states that two 8-minute pieces of video must be taken by the vehicle, one directly after landing and one after the mobility requirements have been completed. Instead of this, I think one video documenting the entire process of launching, landing on Minmus and completing the mission requirements would be good. In this video, the KCT build\u002Brollout times would have to be shown, along with the MET after all the requirements have been completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPayload\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse nanokube to make a tiny kubesat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrivate funding\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n50,000 kerbucks for the vehicle only (the rocket, supplied by me, would not be included in the cost)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeadline\u003Cbr\u003E\nMay 31.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nheres the rocket:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EPrize purse\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the real LXP, the first team to complete all the mission requirements gets $20 million, and the second team gets $5 million. Since this is KSP, and there\u0027s no significance in money, completing these bonus objectives will result in a specific time being deducted from the total time (these times are of course subject to change based on feedback).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo heritage bonus prize (1 kerbal day - 6 hours - deduction)\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor this one, instead of visiting landers, the player could visit monoliths instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRange bonus prize (2 kerbal days - 12 hours - deduction)\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstead of having your vehicle move the required 25 kilometers, travel\u00A0to the highest elevation on Minmus?

Of course, in KSP there is no need for this; you can just build your own rocket in a few minutes. Therefore,\u00A0I\u0027m thinking (bear with me, this is complicated) that we have a limited number and design of rockets, just like in real life.

At this point, the rocket that got the submission into orbit should be discarded, and any further maneuvers should be completed under the submission vehicle\u0027s own power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpacecraft communication\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvery submission vehicle should have an antenna with a range capable of talking to Kerbin from Minmus.
