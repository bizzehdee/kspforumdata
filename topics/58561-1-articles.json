I have a Logitec Extreme3Dpro, works great btw, best 29.99 Ive ever spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have no problems with the actual joystick bindings while in \u003Cem\u003EStaging Mode\u003C/em\u003E. I have the push forward and pull backward on the joystick set to the pitch and the pull left and pull right set to roll and I use the joysticks twist feature too yaw. Simple enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to set up a similar combination to the \u003Cem\u003ERotation Axis Bindings\u003C/em\u003E for the \u003Cem\u003EDocking Mode\u003C/em\u003E yet I would like certain axis inverted to suit my piloting style. Hence, the main purpose of even having a Docking Mode option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when I get set and ready to make my orbital rendezvous, I hit the little docking button, it lights up white to indicate I am in that mode yet none of the \u003Cem\u003ERotation Axis Bindings\u003C/em\u003E I have mapped to my joystick respond. Am I missing something here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T02:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking mode switches between, rotation and translation modes with the spacebar.
