It didn\u0027t matter if I was in the pod or with the last stage still attached, the atmosphere just pushes me all over the place. I fail to see what difference the drag from 2 radiators would make compared to the pod itself. If the radiators are placed in perfect symmetry shouldn\u0027t there should be equal drag/resistance ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the atmospheric resistance on the pod alone has the same effect, I still land to buggery away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randazzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randazzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a couple basic craft files available on dropbox, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131845-Plane-won-t-pull-up-well?p=2145696\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2145696\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eyou can find them in this thread\u003C/a\u003E if you are a visual learner like me.
