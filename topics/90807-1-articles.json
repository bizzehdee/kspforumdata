Rather than derail that thread (though I\u0027m afraid it has already happened), I\u0027d like to post the questions here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESynthesizing hydrocarbons from elements, or a host of other materials (straw, wood, what have you) is not only possible, but Germany has done it on an industrial scale during WWII. So, no question about it being possible at all. Building a space-worthy reactor could be difficult, but certainly not impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main question: What suitable raw materials could you expect to mine from an asteroid? What kind of refining would be necessary to make either usable in a reactor? In the case of water, that seems to be easy. But how much hassle before you have usable carbon(mono|di)oxide)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the mining even work? I expect that it would be necessary to scoop/dig up the material, break and heat it, then collect the vapors. Doing that in near-zero gravity sounds like some real fun. Could that even be done without a permanent crew? I guess that all parts close to the heating/collection will quickly be covered with gunk...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T14:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf asteroids were made of typical Earth rocks like limestone, then you could heat them over 1000 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C to get quicklime and CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E.
