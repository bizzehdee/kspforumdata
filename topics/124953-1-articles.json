I can say that now that 1.0.5 has hit the streets. I discovered KSP in July and I can say confidently that it\u0027s the most entertaining piece of software I\u0027ve bought in thirty years! I watched the Apollo landings, drank gallons of Tang, and joyfully played with my Major Matt Mason action figures in the 60\u0027s. KSP is the sim/game I\u0027ve been waiting for!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, my achievements have been modest, but I have big plans in the works. I spent the last couple of weeks (Earth time) prodding a class E asteroid into a 200 km LKO. My plan is to make that the anchor for a refueling station for exploration beyond Mun and Ike. I\u0027m trying to figure out how to do this without the Kraken associated claw. After that, the other planets await!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for insightful answers and brilliant ideas from the community,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---MachTurtle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S I thought I had a nearly unique (and hopefully clever) screen name, but I just learned there\u0027s a band called Mach Turtle.

I embedded that kraken bait during 1.04 into two different dres-teroids around Dres with a space station I built, the Dres-teroid Miner S.S., and there were no problems. I think latching onto kerbals and other ships was a bigger problem, as in pre-1.0, one of my saves experienced an unfixable phantom thrust glitch after I recovered a ship that had latched onto and deorbited a kerbal for a contract, and in .90, I had explosion problems upon timewarp on a ship that had a rover inside the cargo bay being clawed by the ship with the cargo bay. These problems may be fixed in 1.05, though, as stated above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
