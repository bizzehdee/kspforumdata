(\u002Brep if you can tell me just what painting I got it from. [an actual link to the picture])\n\nStep seven: Try over and over to get it to look right.\n\nStep eight: Put in the white tie thing.\n\nStep nine: Try and fail to add epaullete thingies.\n\nStep dec: Take a female head texture, use the darken brush to add wrinkles.\n\nStep el: Tweak the colors around until they look good.\n\nStep doh: Make RCS pack and helmet for completion (Just in case she wants to oversee some admiraly things on a Starbase.)\n\nStep dohone: Put the head and suit textures through the [Online Normal Map Generator](http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/)\n\nStep dohtwo: Make a how-to list in base-12.\n\nStep dohthree: ...\n\nStep dohfour: Profit!\n\nI think it turned out pretty great in the comic. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOf course, credit goes to Kuzzter for pasting in the cool hat.\n\nAnd, you\u0027re quite welcome, Kuzzter.
