Now let\u0027s imagine that I want to have a total thrust of 750 with the same burn time, does it mean that I multiply the amount of fuel and mass by 10 as well?

Do I have to get as closely as possible to 300 ( 75 of thrust -\u0026gt; I want 750 ... so 30 of solid fuel -\u0026gt; I need 300? ) of solid fuel ( as in the volume ) with the cylinder formula and after, I will be able to determine the rest of the values?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI therefor humbly ask for help because just changing the thrust value in the config file would be cheating!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T11:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBenoit, for wisdom to your \u0022problem\u0022...let\u0027s look at some real numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the Saturn. There were 4 retro-rockets on the S-IVB Aft Interstage that fired upon S-II separation. Each empty weighed 25kg and had a bit over 120kg of propellant and provided a bit over 154kN of thrust. S-II Ullage rockets (up to 8 of them) were very similar but about 30kg heavier worth of propellant, they provided 33% less thrust, but fired longer. The S-IC separation motors (also up to 8) were smaller, providing only 50kN each. Now obviously this staging is different than SRB separation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets look at the Shuttle SRBs, the largest solids ever flown. Each SRB had 8 separation motors on it, 4 forward, and 4 aft. Each weighed 73kg with 34.5kg being propellant, each fired for 0.8sec with a max of 129.5kN thrust with the average 82.6. Total impulse was 78.1 kNs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...The KW motors, which haven\u0027t been touched (yet) provides close to the same thrust (average), and propellant load, EXCEPT for weighing about 200kg over what it should, performance isn\u0027t that far off what an actual S-SRB separation motor is, though after adding 8...adds 1.6tonnes of dead weight that shouldn\u0027t be there PER SRB...this will be corrected soon as part of RealEngines, that will be included with RO. , After all, this is \u0022REALISM\u0022 Overhaul.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the question otherwise...You are not understanding what the variables are in a config file, or basic geometry. I\u0027ll give you this, if you want the same burn time, then multiply fuel load by the same as what you did thrust, so 750kN vs 75kN = 10x, then 30L of solid fuel x10 = 300L, IF, Isp is also the same. You need to think this out, while the volume (of fuel) may have increased by a factor of 10, the mass of the container would not, as that is more closely related to the surface area of a shape than the volume. Continuing...No, \u0027scale = x\u0027 and \u0027rescaleFactor\u0027 does not do what you think it does. Both scale and rescaleFactor, depending on how they are used, affects the visual model and nodes, not mass, or thrust, or other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T13:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes this error cause KSP to stop working???\u003Cp\u003EWhat did you do immediately previous to this error???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you followed the \u0027standard\u0027 steps of troubleshooting KSP???\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t cause KSP to crash but it will after 30min of it cause loss of function.
