(In my current naming scheme, C is for lunar missions. IE- A is sounding rockets/suborbital, B is LEO... C-1 was a lunar flyby mission.)\u00A0Almost reached LEO in my current simulation, probably cheated out of LEO by successive AJ-10 engine failures. (Although I\u0027d intended that to be my LEO transfer stage...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s weird though, is after stage sep, the AJ-10 on the lander is not gimbaling and despite turning on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, they do not appear to be firing, let alone actually doing anything. Which leaves me tumbling uncontrollably just shy of LEO and dumbfounded as to what is happening. I have signal connection, I have more than enough computing power onboard (If memory serves it\u0027s 7.321t/10t),\u00A0and I have the Hydrazine to run the thrusters (and yes they are set to run off of Hydrazine as well), so what gives? The 8x 1kN thrusts are running off Hydrazine too and they run just fine, but they lack any sort of gimbaling. Now, I admit I have made a few changes since my last simulation with the lander, but in that simulation the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E worked - albeit rather underpowered, which is why I switched from the quad thrusters to 3x linear thrusters at the end of each arm for each direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been awhile since I\u0027ve need to share a .craft file, so I\u0027ve forgotten how that\u0027s done on the forums here... or save file if that\u0027s needed instead...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLexieAssassin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS- I also noticed that my toggle antennas action group appears to be nonfunctional as well, if that helps anyone else out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
