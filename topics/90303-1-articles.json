I then thought of the concept that maybe someone could build a rocket in such a manor but instead of having the second stage a separate component they could build it into the capsule. The capsule would land much like the dragon 2 concept, only this would be a decent bit bigger. Heck, maybe if its big enough you could actually refuel the vessel and use it as a moon or mars lander!?

A built-in second stage can\u0027t launch anything but a capsule, such as satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the second stage has problem the capsule needs to be able to separate and land safely on its own. For a typical tailfirst reentry this means that the capsule will require a heat shield capable of bringing it back from LEO, which is never used on the vast majority of missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A tailfirst reentry will be very difficult, since with the fuel tanks nearly empty the weight of the capsule will move the vehicle\u0027s center of mass very far forward. A nose-first reentry has several serious issues, including:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3A: the ideal shapes for a low-drag launch and a survivable reentry are very different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3B: if your crew are \u0022lying down\u0022 during launch, this will be reversed during reentry. This means you have to rotate the seats 180 degrees. The Space Shuttle avoided this problem because the orientation only changed about 90 degrees and being a spaceplane it had a very gentle reentry (\u0026lt;3 gs peak IIRC) compared to a capsule. Even a capsule performing a lifting reentry, which this probably couldn\u0027t do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3C: The front side of your capsule has a bunch of stuff like the windows and exit hatch you REALLY don\u0027t want to have facing into a hypersonic airstream (again, the Shuttle\u0027s windows were fine because it reentered at a high angle of attack and the front windows were shielded by the nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Once in orbit, your vehicle is very heavy and bulky, making docking to a space station unwieldy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. During reentry the vehicle will still contain several tons of rocket fuel for landing. This presents safety concerns for a manned craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. On landing, the vehicle is tall and top-heavy (capsule on top, remember?), which makes it vulnerable to tipping over. This may be an acceptable risk in an unmanned vehicle, but not a manned one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Assuming you do land safely, your crew will be descending 3-5 stories of ladder to reach the ground. This is in Earth gravity, and if you\u0027re using it as a crew shuttle to a space station they may have suffered bone/muscle deterioration from spending months in microgravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplacing your second stage and capsule with a spaceplane would eliminate some of those problems, but also create new ones, such as the resulting plane being too big to fit in a launch vehicle fairing. How do you keep that stable? Well, what if we replaced the first stage with strapon boosters? We\u0027ll make them liquid-fueled, and maintain balance by running the second-stage engines the entire launch and keep the fuel tanks topped off using crossfeeding. Congratulations, you now basically have the Space Shuttle, but with fuel tanks replacing the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T23:24:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, problem is that you\u0027ll be making a bigger second stage if you\u0027re using powered landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T00:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I too reject the argument that rocket engines can\u0027t take reentry.

I then thought of the concept that maybe someone could build a rocket in such a manor but instead of having the second stage a separate component they could build it into the capsule. The capsule would land much like the dragon 2 concept, only this would be a decent bit bigger. Heck, maybe if its big enough you could actually refuel the vessel and use it as a moon or mars lander!? Now I doubt this could be done with the falcon 9, however I do think that this is an interesting concept and couldn\u0027t quite get it out of my head.
