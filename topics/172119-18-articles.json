Given this company\u0027s track record when it comes to how it treats fan content for its own games, I immediately became concerned when I tried to log in to the forums today and had to read through and accept new terms of service, which were ever so reassuringly titled \u0022TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. TERMS OF SERVICE\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne particular section of the new terms of service greatly concerns me, and I would greatly appreciate some clarification from staff as to what implications this will have in regards to fan content (such as mods, videos, fan art/ fan fiction, etc) for Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the section in question (with the particularly concerning parts underlined):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat exactly does \u0022Online Services material\u0022 mean in this context, and how does it relate to fan content posted on the forums?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I have been writing a fan-fiction novel intermittently for the past year and a half or so, which I have posted to my own thread in the \u0027KSP Fan Works\u0027 section of this forum. I did this for my own enjoyment, of course, and I certainly do not make any money off of it. Regardless, I did \u003Cem\u003Etechnically\u003C/em\u003E distribute artwork/writing that uses and is based off of copyrighted material, and I didn\u0027t ask for Take Two\u0027s permission before I did it. Nor did I have to, because as far as I am aware the Terms of Service at that time required me to do no such thing. Is that going to change now? Any time that I want to distribute fan art or writing related to KSP, am I going to have to ask for Take Two\u0027s direct permission, as these new terms seem to dictate?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this apply to mods as well?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do hope I am just misinterpreting this, but nonetheless I have become greatly concerned about the future of the KSP community.\u00A0\u003Cu\u003EFan content is the life blood of Kerbal Space Program. If you kill the fan content, you kill the game. Period.\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0Hopefully any staff who are reading this can understand my concerns, and I would really appreciate it if one of you could please clarify exactly what exactly these new terms mean with regards to fan content; and more specifically, if I can still write my fan-fiction novel without having to worry about getting sued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Third_OfFive\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027ll really change a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease note I\u0027m not a lawyer.
