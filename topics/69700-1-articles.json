Also in the past they\u0027ve covered up some serious environmental issues with certain pesticides. They\u0027ve also some time ago tried to aquire some kind of patent about pig breeding in I think 160 countries that would\u0027ve forced basically every pig farmer to pay a lisence fee to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the effects of GMO on health, the jury is still out and probably will be forever seeing as we can\u0027t even figure out if eating normal animal fat is good or bad for you in the end (low-carb vs low-fat diets). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne major issue also is that using GMO crops can increase the pest resistance and also increase the yield of the fields. And this really is an issue, because even old fashioned plants draw up nutrients from the ground faster than they replenish (hence fertilizers) and the more you increase the yield, the more fertilizer you need and those have some serious environmental impacts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPest resistance is on the other hand even greater issue. Because it\u0027s effectively directing the evolution of weeds and pests in a very rapid pace. First you ensure that the field is unhabitable to effectively all other life than your GMO-shielded crop. Then comes along a weed or insect population that\u0027s naturally not affected, which means they have a huge patch of living space with no natural enemies. So you need a next round of modifying to combat the new threat. But nature probably has an endless supply of enemies to provide so it\u0027s a battle you can never really win.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T16:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eindeed, monsanto patented GMO can cripple esp. in developing countries because the plants are engineered not to produce offspring. so the farmers can\u0027t grow crops unless they buy more seeds from monsanto.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s the terminator system-it\u0027s cropped up continually in anti-GMO arguments since it was first proposed, but it was never actually used in a commercial product due to public outcry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Creature\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Creature\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve understood that they have a habit of actually demanding 3rd world farmers to pay up if the wind carries Monsanto products from neighbouring fields. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a single case against a guy in Canada, Percy Schmeiser.
