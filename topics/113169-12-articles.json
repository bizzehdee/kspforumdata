KSP was never really going to be \u0022finished,\u0022 and thus, by some player\u0027s standards, there would never be an appropriate time to \u0022port\u0022 KSP to other platforms.

I have heard mention of some of the bugs in 1.0 and some people saying that the game was not ready to be called 1.0 at release so I have been checking here occasionally for news on progress regarding updates. I see this post expecting some good news about a patch coming out soon and all I find is something about a PS4 port?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether the negative impact of this on PC development is real or perceived does not matter, because the announcement and the reaction to it can really turn off a potential customer (me), who is now unsure of purchasing the game. I carefully choose what to purchase, watch videos of people playing, and read both positive and negative reviews. Seeing negative reviews on Steam from people with 100s of hours in the game not recommending it once it came out of early access because it didn\u0027t seem ready is a bad sign. Seeing YouTube streamers have to do little workarounds and have problems with glitches and even crashes and sometimes horrible frame rates for no apparent reason is another bad sign. Seeing them having to download several mods just to have a usable interface and decent looking graphics, yet another negative. Having to dig through this entire thread to find more information that should have been part of the main post was also quite frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I see so much potential with the game and how much fun people can have playing it, that I am very interested in it and want to see it succeed.

Are you mad that squad isn\u0027t spending all their time for you/ your platform specifically? Making THEIR game fit whatever image you happen to have in mind? Are you MAD that they want money to continue coming to squadHQ and spending all day working on KSP? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is a business that relies on (OM MY GOSH!) money to pay their employees. Without employees, THERE IS NO FURTHER UPDATES TO KSP. Its not a @(\u0026amp;%^@ charity people. Your one time payment of whatever does not buy you slaves that work for the rest of their lives updating, tweaking, supporting, and upgrading KSP. Its money that makes it worth their time. The costs continue month after month and if the income doesnt, IT GETS SHUT DOWN.
