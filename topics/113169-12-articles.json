Squad said in the run-up to 1.0 that they would continue development as long as they can manage it, despite player worries that \u00221.0\u0022 would be The End and see Squad drop KSP for some other shiny thing. KSP was never really going to be \u0022finished,\u0022 and thus, by some player\u0027s standards, there would never be an appropriate time to \u0022port\u0022 KSP to other platforms. But they are doing it, they are throwing their hats over the wall, as a challenge for themselves to find new sources of income, expand KSP, and clearly fix bugs along the way. \n\nNobody likes bugs, but it\u0027s a constant in software development. The developers are on record with embarrassment, in a couple Squadcasts, that 1.0.2 was needed just 6 hours after 1.0.1. The 1.0.3 patch is getting extra testing time in hopes that it will not repeat that scenario, hopefully it will be the last patch until v1.1 is ready."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T16:21:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My biggest concern is that they\u0027re talking about UI changes.

I love KSP and I still think Squad is a decent company, I\u0027ve got nothing against consoles and nothing against companies doing what makes the most business sense. \n\nBut KSP on consoles? KSP with no mods, on weak hardware, *without a mouse*? I just can\u0027t picture it being successful. It seems like a bad business decision. I can\u0027t imagine the additional sales will make up for the time and money invested in the port. And the company doing the port apparently has experience limited to third-rate mobile games, I just can\u0027t see how they\u0027re qualified to undertake a project like porting KSP to the PS4.

This is going to split the amazing community of KSP in 2.\n\nActually, it\u0027s not. It\u0027s going to add a community of players that will probably remain mostly silent. I play a lot of War Thunder and it\u0027s a cross-platform game and you rarely hear anything from the PS4 players, ever. And what is to say that just because they are playing on a console doesn\u0027t mean they will share in the experience and have just as much to contribute to the community as any PC player?\n\nKeep in mind that KSP is not for everyone and the players who get involved in the community are \\*typically\\* a lot more mature than those found on most gaming boards.

I have heard mention of some of the bugs in 1.0 and some people saying that the game was not ready to be called 1.0 at release so I have been checking here occasionally for news on progress regarding updates. I see this post expecting some good news about a patch coming out soon and all I find is something about a PS4 port?\n\nWhether the negative impact of this on PC development is real or perceived does not matter, because the announcement and the reaction to it can really turn off a potential customer (me), who is now unsure of purchasing the game. I carefully choose what to purchase, watch videos of people playing, and read both positive and negative reviews. Seeing negative reviews on Steam from people with 100s of hours in the game not recommending it once it came out of early access because it didn\u0027t seem ready is a bad sign. Seeing YouTube streamers have to do little workarounds and have problems with glitches and even crashes and sometimes horrible frame rates for no apparent reason is another bad sign. Seeing them having to download several mods just to have a usable interface and decent looking graphics, yet another negative. Having to dig through this entire thread to find more information that should have been part of the main post was also quite frustrating.\n\nStill, I see so much potential with the game and how much fun people can have playing it, that I am very interested in it and want to see it succeed. I wish you luck, but I think I will wait to purchase this until you have a stable 64-bit Unity 5 client."},{"CreatedByName":"Shawn28","CreatedById":143994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:00:41Z","Content":"awesome ! can\u0027t wait to get PS4... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:03:02Z","Content":"The entire discussion could have been avoided.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **In perfect world, this would have happened:**\n\u003E \u003E 1) Squad would have released the PS4 announcement in the proper \u0022Announcement\u0022 section of the forums.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 2) The announcement would have had not only a picture, but also the following information: The port will be produced by a different company, control issues will be adressed during the port, the port will be released 2016.

It\u0027s as simple as that.**\n\u003E \n\nEdit:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And finally, please be more respectful towards Squad. Constructive criticism, questions and even some scepticism are all fine, but in the end you\u0027re a guest on our forums and we do expect you to behave as guests.\n\nIn this forum every user may be a guest, technically speaking. But in your balance sheets I am your customer. Twice. I bought the game on Steam and then again on the website so I could have two parallel installs - and I didn\u0027t mind paying twice, because no game has given me the amount of satisfaction as KSP did. I have clocked in 2005 hours according to Steam - and I am pretty sure I am not the only one playing it that much.\n\nYour community are not merely guests. They have actively contributed to the success of your game, by basically financing if through early access, by providing you with feedback to make the game better, by promoting KSP to their friends an family. So please understand if we tend to get emotional about how things are being done regarding this part of our lives (yes, I have said it). And don\u0027t forget, where you are coming from. You have big time success and console deals and I am happy for you. But your backbone is the community. And the more you turn to other shiny opportunities the more you are risking to alienate said community - who are in reality your strongest marketing force. Do not forget this.\n\nWe get that you use Twitter and Reddit to reach a bigger audience. I myself do it as well to promote my own stuff. But why can\u0027t you show the forums more love? Why aren\u0027t you able to condense all important talking points into one forum post? You already have all the info somewhere. Put it here as well! It\u0027s little things like this that keep customers loyal to a product. Have you noticed how the mood of this thread changed as soon as you started reacting and trying to put our criticism into perspective? People do not *want* to react negatively out of principle. It is neglect for your roots and the people who contributed to your success that creates the increasing backlash. \n\nThis is me as a former seasoned journalist and communication guy, with IT experience, a degree in business administration, some law education and currently a very challenging job trying to keep customers and developers in our company from starting to hate each other because of wrong expecations and faulty communication. This is not bragging, I am merely trying to make you realize that there are some people here who have had experience in a lot of situations that you have went through in the past and are still going through. And I believe there are a lot of people here that can offer a lot more valuable input than me. \n\nYes we are guests. As are guests in a restaurant. But guests in a restaurant can still expect to be served what is on the menu and not what the chef suddenly decides he likes to cook. And like guests in a restaurant we pay for your product. Please keep that in mind. And keep listening. Thank you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T17:21:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowZone**\n  \nReaction to KasperVld"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:06:35Z","Content":"I still have that bad feeling...\n\nTime will tell.."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:16:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This (a few example links) looks like communication to me.
