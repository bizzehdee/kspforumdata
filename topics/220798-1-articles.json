Specifically, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E/MKS mod installed. I\u0027d had previous runs with it, but I always burned out when it came time to go interplanetary. I sent entire armadas of base modules off to Duna, in the hopes of setting up a base there, but the sure and certain knowledge that I\u0027d got \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E wrong, along with the arduous process of shepherding so many vessels into capture drained my enthusiasm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this time... this time, I was going to do things differently. And the Global Construction mod was gonna help me pull it off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy send fleets interplanetary, why assemble bases piecemeal (oh god the lag) when I could just send an engineering ship, and a metric crap-ton of Materials Kits? Why, indeed? So much simpler, so much neater, and I could test out my base designs easily enough on Minmus.

Good as Aurora is for mining Ore, it\u0027s useless for Substrate, Minerals and Metallic Ore. I set my sights on a location for a new base, one that would be a hub of industry!

My liquid-fuel transport, a Manticore FTV-L, hit the ground at high speed due to my failure to start the landing burn early enough. I hadn\u0027t taken into account the LV-Ns having significantly lower thrust than the Cheetah engines on the standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E Manticore design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wxqh9JY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wxqh9JY.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had it drag its backside like a dog over to the base, for later disassembly.

Centaur Station here is my fuel depot and science lab over Minmus, providing a destination for all the fuel Aurora cooks up. I\u0027ve since expanded it by adding another fuel tank, and moving the Orbital Workshop from Mirage Station in Kerbin orbit, once I was finished building my first two interplanetary vessels.

Since I didn\u0027t want to build stupid huge launch vehicles, or dock a ship together in orbit, I had Mirage build them in one go. Here\u0027s the IPT \u003Cem\u003EAdventure,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0ready for launch. Adventure was originally supposed to go to Eve, with that dinky lander for Gilly. Unfortunately, the Eve launch window was over a year away, so it was given a much larger lander and sent to Duna instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022v7gcc7v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002295.75\u0022 height=\u0022872\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/v7gcc7v.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AB0T6IB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.50\u0022 height=\u0022799\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AB0T6IB.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe IPT \u003Cem\u003EOdyssey\u003C/em\u003E, a somewhat more capable vessel (at least in terms of life support) which will be heading for Dres. It carries a lander and rover with skycrane. After landing, the engineer will move all the science experiments from the lander to the rover, which has a Bon Voyage controller on board. With that, it can visit many more biomes than the lander could, even taking into account the fuel Odyssey carries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the background is the Super Atlatl \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0 a very capable vessel, though not as reliable as the original Atlatl design. IIRC, this one went into a flat spin it was unable to recover from, due to the centre of lift moving too far forward and there not being enough liquid fuel on board to trim it out. I\u0027ve been working on a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, the Paladin, which looks to be much more stable in flight, though it\u0027s significantly more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iCXnD9n.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002294.42\u0022 height=\u0022723\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iCXnD9n.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter everything that went wrong at Meridian, I decided I wanted a fresh start for my industrial ambitions. About 7km away, I set up Wyvern Base. There\u0027s a few substantial improvements here, but the main thing to note is how I replaced landing legs with launch clamps. Landing legs bounce. They yeet reactors into the heavens. Even with Ground Anchor enabled, they go walkabout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch clamps have proven much more reliable, although the base is a bit higher off the ground than I\u0027d have liked. Still! The base works, and it didn\u0027t break in half! I also used much more resilient radiators, so I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ACmIhHn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002286.92\u0022 height=\u0022726\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ACmIhHn.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I was faffing about with uncooperative bases, Adventure arrived at Duna, performing a flawless aerocapture with an apoapsis high enough to capture around Ike afterwards. It occurred to me that since I had a Manticore FTV arriving a few days later, I could make more landings than I\u0027d anticipated. And since Duna has an atmosphere, and Ike is so easy to escape from, it was the logical choice to go to Ike first then make a Duna landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k6efxgW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022676\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k6efxgW.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this cockpit design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fIEw5Zi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002294.92\u0022 height=\u0022645\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fIEw5Zi.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAdventure\u003C/em\u003E made its way to Ike, and the lander did its stuff, getting data from 2/3rds of Ike\u0027s biomes. Unfortunately, it turned out to have less deta-V capacity than I thought it had, and despite the FTV, I ran out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 I felt it was more important to have a large margin of error on the interplanetary spacecraft than to attempt more landings. So, \u003Cem\u003EAdventure\u003C/em\u003E left Ike, dropping into low Duna orbit, where it rendezvoused with a garden station I\u0027d sent. That will keep it in Supplies for the year and 160 days until the Duna-Kerbin transfer window, when the crew will head home. Sadly, no Duna landing, but hey.

A MaterialKits workshop, and industrial module for refining metal, polymers and chemicals, an ag module for generating supplies, and an ag support module for generating Fertiliser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ag module didn\u0027t work for lack of water. I forgot to add a water tank, but that\u0027s easy enough to fix. The industrial equipment was also lacking in Machinery, so I used the Paladin to lift a resupply probe, which transferred the Machinery across. Now there\u0027s a new problem... not enough electricity! The reactor I gave the base can\u0027t keep up, even at 100% output, so I had to shut down some Fertiliser and Materials Kits production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy shopping list: Bigger reactor, water tank, and a\u00A0bit more Machinery.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven how little lag there is at Wyvern, I may well expand it further for SpacialisedParts and Machinery production.

When the FTV returned for a second shipment, however, the base provided 2000 units of fuel before claiming the 216,000 unit tank was full. Nothing I tried would get it to continue fuelling. Even restarting the game didn\u0027t work. In the end, I decided that since any mission to fix the Minmus infrastructure would require a base construction mission or a jerry-rigged solution, I might as well send Valkyrie to Kerbin orbit, refuel it there, and leave worries about infrastructure for \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 the ship headed off on its mission, rather than risk delaying its departure beyond the transfer window.

The \u003Cem\u003EStag\u003C/em\u003E DCC (Depot Control Centre) features genous living arrangements for a single Kerbonaut, and the fuel tanks used for getting it to Minmus ended up serving a second purpose of storing fuel that could be transferred to the FTV-H lander without waiting for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NyOHRB1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.79\u0022 height=\u0022832\u0022 width=\u0022993\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NyOHRB1.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI discovered only after reaching \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E that this vessel was incapable of roll, pitch or yaw.

Instead, I did the orbital assembly the old fashioned way. The Command Section and Propulsion Section are technically viable spacecraft when separated, in the sense that the Command Section could serve as a very basic space station, while the Engine Section may function as a tug. It\u0027s going to need some small upgrades before that would be possible, however, as it currently lacks the electrical storage for independent operation. 15ec isn\u0027t much and those LH2 tanks are hungry for spark juice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from construction, what most sets Endeavour apart from its IPTV cousins is the propulsion system.
