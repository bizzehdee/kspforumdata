Based on the behavior of mods like Telemachus, I\u0027d think it\u0027s at least possible. This would prevent the issue of memory usage in doing things like this in chatterer while allowing a lot of flexibility.\n\nFor instance, I\u0027d love to have a randomized event-triggered playlists (or tracks), based on certain variables. Like, once you enter Duna\u0027s SoI, it plays a selected playlist I put together that includes Holst\u0027s \u0022Mars, the Bringer of War.\u0022\n\nWhen you actually enter the atmosphere, it starts playing the opening theme from Dune.\n\nMore Examples:\n\n- At launch, by default, it can activate a playlist including the title theme from \u0022From the Earth to the Moon\u0022  \n\n    - If the pilot has the \u0022BadS\u0022 tag, though, then it plays \u0022Magic Carpet Ride\u0022 instead.\n\n    [\\*]Other ideas include \u0022Victory music\u0022 (Title theme?) when landing on a celestial body for the first time, or deploying chutes. Given that there are already mods that track individual acheivements and milestones for specific kerbals, hopefully the groundwork is already there.\n\n    [\\*]Jeb Buzzing the tower at KSC initiates \u0022Danger Zone\u0022 playlist.\n\nSo, any interest in making this a reality? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T17:57:26Z","Content":"Development has been slow of late, but [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65726-1-0-x-Soundtrack-Editor-3-0-Beta-available)should be interesting to you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tandoori","CreatedById":125040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T18:30:49Z","Content":"Thanks, Tellion! I\u0027ve actually looked into Soundtrack Editor in the past, and it\u0027s a very promising mod that I\u0027ve been meaning to tinker with. My hope is that the approach outlined in my original post may provide a simpler alternative to some of the hurdles that project faces, as well as making it more accessible to 32-bit users who can\u0027t risk pre-loading a couple dozen MP3s into memory at launch ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
