I was thinking it was about the size of an airlock but turned with a motor. This way the top \u0022thing\u0022 would turn and it would be possible to point an engine in a direction, or have a tower crane move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother part would act as a hinge for sticking 2 parts together. I\u0027m sure the models would be simple but I didn\u0027t want to recreate the wheel.

The real problems with multiple \u0022Parts\u0022 is that the overhead of each full part is massive compared to the overhead of just a gameobject; and if you\u0027re using parts, you have to fight the KSP spaghetti code to get them to behave the way you want.
