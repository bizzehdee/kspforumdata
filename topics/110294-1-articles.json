After gaining enough confidence in the game and a little mishap ([Reinstalled - Lost everything.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122240-Reinstalled-Lost-everything)) I started over and I no longer have Normal Career. Only one on Hard. \n\nI am trying to keep the realism to as much as I can, so when I rescue a kerbal I tag the capsule as Debris before I save it. \n\nSome day I am planning to organize a \u0022Triple C Team\u0022 (Cleaning Claw Crew), but nowadays I have other priorities and not much excess funds.\n\n\\*Writing this I am realizing I also lost all my screenshots\\* ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/c2XfY](http://imgur.com/a/c2XfY) (not sure how to post imgur album, please a mod help me)\n\nSo, there are kerbals stranded on modules that are not command ones, so I can not tag them as junk and their orbital lines are starting to interfere with my good gaming experience.\n\nI know there is the option to simply destroy them from the tracking station and I did that in my Normal save, but now I will not. \n\nSo, Except CCC deorbiting them is there another way ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T22:40:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mapoko**"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:15:47Z","Content":"Anti-satellite missiles? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:20:43Z","Content":"Small probes to deorbit them using cargo bays... you trap the target inside, do a deorbit burn, release the target, put probe in orbit again, rendezvouz to another target or go to a refueling station... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:21:44Z","Content":"Two things:\n\n- Try renaming them from the Tracking Station: click the capsule, then click the \u0022i\u0022 on the right, then click the name in the orange bar to change it and reclassify it as debris or whatever else.\n\n- If that bar is blue, the capsule is still being counted as an \u0022unowned object\u0022 in which case you can\u0027t reclassify it, but you can at least \u0022stop tracking\u0022 and once the contract is finished it will disappear."},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:27:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Two things:\n\u003E - Try renaming them from the Tracking Station: click the capsule, then click the \u0022i\u0022 on the right, then click the name in the orange bar to change it and reclassify it as debris or whatever else.\n\nThank you very much !

But in reality isnt blowing up debris leaving big amount of smaller debris ? Not in the game ofc.\n\nIn any case having a way of classifying them as debris, so their orbit lines do not ruing my experience on the Map worked well for me for now. \n\nAnd about KAS/KIS Those are 2 of my favorite mods, but they make the game easier and I will add them much later in the game when I feel complete, because now I am trying to make it as hard as possible, although I am reluctant to install TACLS.\n\nIn my new save Jeb and Bob had a mishap while taking off the Mun they went out of fuel on 6-2 orbit, but luckily enough they managed to achieve 6-6 orbit on EVA thrusters, so I launched rescue mission to save them in a hurry.\n\nBut when I did send my lab with barely 4600dV (and no parachutes, because who needs parachutes on LKO Lab, right ?) I had unlucky white shirt on board. I started my tilt 1km too early and it flipped. Poor Soul.\n\nI hope I will have funny and tense moments when I de-orbit stuff later, when I have good amount of funds, full research and no idea what to do next.\n\nBut for now what fixed my problem is the reclassifying from Tracking Center !"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T04:05:17Z","Content":"The KIS explosive doesn\u0027t sound right to me - realistically isn\u0027t it just producing more harder-to-handle smaller debris which KSP program just simply doesn\u0027t track?"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T07:21:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E if the game was all about realism wouldnt the orbits of the debris decay over time and deorbit themselves? but they dont so screw wasting time making a tug to deorbit when you can just \u0022rp\u0022 blowing up some sort of explosive planted on all debris.\n\nYou make your own roleplay.
