So baisicly, you can only get research points by recovering vessels, or sending manned missions places? I think thats retarted, because in real life, people send probes to many places, and it takes data and such. I think that should be added immediately, but the manned missions will definently get mroe science points though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paleorob","CreatedById":60059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T16:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you attach science experiments to your probe it can still run the experiments are send the results back via an antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zerois","CreatedById":74698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T16:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can still add the science instruments.

You have to plan your missions a bit as well, and be prepared to do them in baby-step stages to maximize science. Certain data lends itself more to being transmitted and therefore more satellite-ish, as seen by the percentages of science the data is worth through transmittal. Sensory device readings tend to be better for transmitting. Goo containers and science kits tend to be better for recovering intact rather than transmitting their findings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requiem762","CreatedById":82185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T17:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suggest you wait until you get batteries to start doing unmanned science missions.

Plob pods all over the different biomes on Kerbal and EVA for samples (and EVA reports of course). Take your goo with you for extra science. Don\u0027t even have to leave LKO. It is pretty easy to get to Mun and Minimus and back (~6000 dV as I recall). Don\u0027t try to land, just go orbit the local rocks and take your goo on vacation! Always do a quick EVA in orbit and get the EVA report while there. BIG science for getting out of Kerbin orbit will get you to level 4 in no time. I think I had over 100 science from my Mun orbit (including 2 goo canisters, EVA and crew report from Mun orbit, biome sample from where I landed back on Kerbin, and Mun orbit recovery).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022legodragonxp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022legodragonxp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe system is slightly skewed because you need power to get the antenna to work, but you can\u0027t get power until the follow on tier.

Also some of the manned missions have a 100% return rate for radio transmission of results - for instance, do an EVA report from Mun orbit and you can transmit it back to Kerbin for 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - Just noticed one more thing. I did my EVA report for 100% transmission from Mun then I landed back on Kerbin in a biome I hadn\u0027t visited yet. Since I had already transmitted my EVA report from Mun I could do ANOTHER EVA report from the new biome!
