It is called \u0022For All Mankind\u0022 by Al Reinert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe basically took the 16mm film that all the apollo astronauts shot on their missions and cut it together. It\u0027s edited together like it\u0027s all one mission to the moon, but of course it\u0027s actually footage from all the apollo missions spliced together. There are no talking heads, and the only narration is real audio from the missions or audio from interviews the astronauts did after the missions. They talk alot about the beauty and awe of it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do briefly get to see footage of the apollo 13 \u0022successful failure\u0022 where they could see their oxygen venting out of the ship through their window and desperately tried to fix the problem. Also, you get to see guys on the moon jumping around and giggling and rocking around in the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend the blu-ray release because it has the most beautiful HD transfer of the film stock with all the noise/scratches/speckles removed. Aside from the 4:3 aspect ratio it looks like it could have been brand new, modern day footage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, for those of you that haven\u0027t seen it, I think it\u0027s a must:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097372/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere it is on IMDB.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finnerty","CreatedById":61457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T21:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood stuff.

The soundtrack is amazing too, by Brian Eno, who among other things did the startup chime for windows 95. It\u0027s good music for playing KSP to, except obviously it\u0027s not written for looping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the blu-ray bonuses had one of the Apollo veterans exhibiting the paintings he\u0027d made of the moon, with bits of actual moon dust in them from the mission patches on his spacesuit, and the paint was textured with the actual outsole of the spacesuits.
