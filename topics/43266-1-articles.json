I think they were a mod originally so their quality isn\u0027t really all that great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, though...they\u0027re going to have to rework aerodynamics and all that stuff so they\u0027ll inevitably have to redesign a lot of the spaceplane stuff. I would say give B9 Aerospace a look. It\u0027s a mod, but it adds a LOT of spaceplane stuff. Even some regular plane stuff. There\u0027s a lot of parts in that pack, though...just throwin\u0027 that out there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dude who made B9 Aerospace was actually hired on by SQUAD and he\u0027s the dude(at least, I think) that redesigned the space center buildings. So we may see some of his shuttle/plane parts integrated in some way into the core game at some point...but it\u0027s probably not going to be anytime soon. For the time being, they\u0027re focusing really heavily on career stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s undoubtedly going to be more informed people than I posting here. I\u0027ve never made a spaceplane yet, I\u0027m trying not to do too much in the game before career mode gets implemented so if there\u0027s a simpler solution to your problem than downloading a big spaceplane-oriented mod, I wouldn\u0027t know it DX\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"petrichorAM","CreatedById":76235,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not planning a spaceplane, more a \u0027realisic\u0027 looking ship that I\u0027ll build in orbit, design is inspired by the ship from the Mission to Mars film - just trying to make it work visually, maybe I\u0027ll give the B9 pack a go and see if there\u0027s anything suitable in there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can try attaching a radial attachment node or cubic octagonal strut to the center of the Mk3 part and use that node instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T22:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a Mk3 Fuselage Expansion Pack on the Spaceport which includes a Mk3 to 2.5m adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePsuedoMonkey","CreatedById":58589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T22:30:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe nodes on the fuselages (except mk1) look off, but are actually in-line with their center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"petrichorAM","CreatedById":76235,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T22:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I downloaded the B9 mod (plus Mk3 Fuselage Expansion Pacl and H.O.M.E for other projects) and had a go fiddling around with a design and this is how it turned out. Pretty much what I intended and is built with docking ports in certain areas so it can be built in orbit in 3 sections - cockpit section, hab/science section (including the girder with 2x gigantors and 4x RTGs and the first grey/yellow RCS tank) and engine section. Obviously its not fully finished as I need to add a few minor parts to it such as RCS thrusters, a docking port for station docking, docking ports on the \u0027bottom\u0027 for two landers but all in all this is what I pictured in my head. My next question is: are the fuel tanks enough for transfer to Duna, retrograde into Duna orbit and then return home again or should I add more?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag60/petrichorAM84/KSP/screenshot14_zps7e115cea.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot14_zps7e115cea.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag60/petrichorAM84/KSP/screenshot15_zpsd47d0d0a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot15_zpsd47d0d0a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag60/petrichorAM84/KSP/screenshot16_zpsfa82feae.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot16_zpsfa82feae.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
