I\u0027ve also reconfigured much, especially the Centaur. I\u0027ve drcreased the thrust from 100kn for the RL-10 A4-2 to 60ln. This allows some more realistic mission profiles. The Centaur (SEC) can burn up to 6min, 10s, an orbital insertion of an Atlas V 551 with 19t max payload takes now about 6min 45s, you don\u0027t have to shutdown or restart the engine. You have to pitch up pretty much when you launch heavy payloads to prevent from falling back to Kerbin, but ULA does the same with its Centaur. I can confirm, for an efficient Orbital insertion of heavy payllads you\u0027ll also get a DEC engine Centaur, whose job it is to launch heavy payloads efficiently to LKO. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XkaOnslaught","CreatedById":72043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T05:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the people that use the so called RealPlume in Realism overhaul and then there some that use the HotRockets expansion plume and then there some the don\u0027t use ether.\u003Cp\u003EWhats Realism overhaul got to do with this anyway ?
