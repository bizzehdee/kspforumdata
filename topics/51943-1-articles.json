Love the progress they made in the start of career mode. Even as the game is now, it is incredible. Every patch seems to make it better and better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts and concerns though are about the rate at which patches come out and the content in them and the overall gameplay ability. I am sure I will get alot of negative feedback from posting this, but I feel I must speek my mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Yes the Squad team is limited. So I\u0027m not expecting HUUGE patches every month. But look at the last patch, I believe it was around 70 MB in data, which took around 3-4 months. Yes it was an awsome leap and added much more to the game, but other companies add 1-3 GB of data in the same time with the same size team. Look at overkill and payday 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I dont feel the devs, although they do a great job, deserve a break as many have said in the forums after every big patch. They are living on the money that we have payed as kind of a stock in them making the finished product they promised to deliver. I don\u0027t know about you guys but no boss in any job i have ever had has said, \u0022you did that last job great, take the next week off with pay!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I feel too much has gone into honestly what i see as stupid junk. I read for weeks in the weekly about how the astronouat complex was getting redone. All it ended up being was a nice pic in the background that gets blurred out cause of astronaut selection. So why even bother. How about putting purpose to the stats of the pilots rather than a background picture that noone will notice anyways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. BIG ONE. OLDER SYSTEMS. I have a system that meets all the requirements for this game, yet like tonight had to reload 20 \u002B times in i would say 3 hours because of crashes while reworking and launching my ship. I would rework, save, try to send to launch pad, game crashes. Reload select launch pad , select ship and crew, and say launch, ship messes up getting into orbit, if i stick around and watch it crash into the ground, or hit revert to anything,, game crashes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E( I am running no mods, have 4 gigs of ram, 2.4 GHZ processor, win 7 32 bit) According to squad that should be no problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship I am trying to get up is my interplanetary shuttle. It has around 580 parts I am guessing, so nothing too insane. many of the parts are struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes my comp is a good at least 7 years old, but if they say a comp with what ever specs as minimum can run it, then it should be able to run without crashing. Lagging is one thing, but to reload ever 5 minutes is another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAS I said at the begining I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this game, I just feel like things are a bit misprioritized at squad, I see more advertising than development for an alpha game (If i am wrong, look at the kerbal weekly and see how much was done for development than someone going here or there to talk about the game). I see more work on background graphics than gameplay. Gameplay is what us gamers want, the pretty graphics in the end to touch up are a nice detail, but overall we (or well at least I) dont care. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final note is that at the rate i see this game progressing, it will be at least 2\u002B years before 1.0 comes out, please someone tell me im wrong but be able to justify reason i am wrong behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T08:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E580 parts is insane!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most complex ship is 200 parts.
