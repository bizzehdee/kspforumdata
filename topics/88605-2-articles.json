I can also see a bunch of NREs in the log file that come from Extraplanetary Launchpads:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EXC 23:50:22.821] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ExLP.ExWorkshop.Update ()\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it was because of the dynamic adding/removing of modules but the stock EPL workshop has this problem as well. You might see if there is an update to EPL that fixes this issue; it would definitely slow down your game as the log is constantly being filled with NREs during each update. If you find an update, let me know, I use EPL too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-04T15:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2014 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Cadet","CreatedById":130826,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T16:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for this very useful addition to MKS /OKS mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T18:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Cadet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Space Cadet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for this very useful addition to MKS /OKS mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you like the mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I built it to solve my problem of fitting MKS modules into the KSOS Super 25 and am happy to share.
