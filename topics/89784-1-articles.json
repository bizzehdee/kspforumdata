It didn\u0027t work, it doesn\u0027t even get to the loading splash screen - just a few seconds of black, then a flash of the desktop, rinse and repeat. It completely freezes and I had to Alt-F4 out of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mods installed (or I wouldn\u0027t be using OpenGL), but I didn\u0027t change anything from last night to this morning when it booted fine from the shortcut. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA user on reddit had the same problem - OpenGL just suddenly stopped working. I was able to \u0027fix\u0027 it by launching the exe directly which of course led to a CTD halfway through loading. Try via the shprtcut again and it worked fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked at my log and the last entries are something about Atmosphere From Ground fallback shader not available or something repeated about 10 times then nothing and this other user on reddit reports the same thing. At first I thought it might be something from RSS, but removing that didn\u0027t help. Put it back in, leave it overnight without touching it and it works fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah... I\u0027ll be honest and say I haven\u0027t a scooby what all these fallback shaders and other various graphical display terms mean when talking about KSP so bear with me if I don\u0027t understand what you tell me. Let me know if you need my computer specs, I\u0027ll post a DxDiag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"slumpie","CreatedById":121922,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T21:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPut it back in, leave it overnight without touching it and it works fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean with left it overnight?
