The set up was Proton decoupler, Pavillo probe collar from kosmos, TR-2V stack decoupler, Mir docking port drogue, Mir Core. I was testing the configuration to see if it would error out with the proton, and it did not. In fact, it\u0027s in orbit right now. This would lead me to conclude that the physics engine is in need of some attention that it might not get till later in the year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal test conclusions: I replaced the Mir docking port drogue with a stock clamp-O-tron, same error popped up (mir core module in buran). This shouldn\u0027t be happening as I\u0027ve done this same exact procedure before, and had no errors. I do not know what\u0027s different this time around other than this is the .19.1 update.
