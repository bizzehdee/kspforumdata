Their weight will probably alter the thrust vector slightly, I usually have to go back and forth a few times to get everything balanced out. The system isn\u0027t entirely perfect, I guess because there\u0027s still room inside the yellow CoM marker to have a very slight imbalance, but this plugin sure helps you get a lot closer a lot faster than without it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew, sorry for the long-winded post.
