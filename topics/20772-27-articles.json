Just remember that the lower the circular orbit, the faster the orbital speed, and the higher the orbit, the more delta-v required to acquire it. My current assembled station I put into a 500k orbit, which allows a bit more ease in practicing rendezvous, but you do have to spend more time to organize windows for ascent, since the SS\u0027s orbital speed is much slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, it really depends what you are willing to put on your launch craft. If you wish a low-orbit station, say between 70k and 100k, then you won\u0027t need as much liquid fuel, though you may need more RCS to match velocities more precisely. For higher orbits over 100k, you will need more liquid fuel and patience establishing launch windows. This will become a factor in campaign mode when you will be playing on a budget. Your first station then will probably be a low-orbit one, as RCS is cheaper than liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething to keep in mind is that the ISS is a low-orbit station, which in rl terms would be within the KSP 100k altitude.

Learning all this through KSP definitely brings to light why it isn\u0027t such a good idea to retrieve the Hubble Telescope for preservation as it does sit at a much higher orbit.
