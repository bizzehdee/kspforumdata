Seems like it\u0027s only created negatives and little to no positives.\n\nWell there is at least one benefit from tying names to specialization: If a name appears between two different saves, they\u0027ll end up with the same specialization. Jeb is always a pilot, Bill is always an engineer, etc. That consistency is probably in-line with why they choose consistent planets rather than random planets between saves.\n\nIn any case, I don\u0027t see names and profession being correlated as being a mutually exclusive issue. If you get unbalanced specialization in a batch of applicants, the game could just re-roll names until it is balanced. \n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll point out something that I just noticed: If you wait long enough (several days) eventually applicants roll off the list and get replaced by new ones. It can take a while though, so it wasn\u0027t immediately obvious to me that was an option. So this suggestion is probably less important than I originally thought, less of a \u0022problem\u0022 and more of an issue of convenience."}]}
