No problems so far, I deployed the solar panels (boxed) to keep the charge up.\n\n2 shuttles followed, docked and fueled up the first one.\n\nOnce undocked, the solar panels were packed up again and the probe made its way to Duna. Now a critical bug (re-)occurred: I cannot redeploy the solar panels! An orange colored error message pop up: \u0022Cannot be deployed while stowed\u0022. I actually thought that this error was fixed.\n\nObviously, the panels are not blocked, as they deployed the first time.\n\nThe panels (boxes) are attached laterally.\n\nAny ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T08:48:51Z","Content":"Hi.\n\nHave you got a service bay on the craft and are the chutes anywhere near it? There\u0027s a known bug in the current version. The workaround is to open the service bay before deploying the chutes. See also [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126853).\n\nSilly I know, but it works until the bug gets fixed."},{"CreatedByName":"Kevin M.","CreatedById":198838,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T05:57:02Z","Content":"I built a craft and left the service bays open from the get go. Bad idea. Solar Panels won\u0027t open period. I hope they fix it soon."}]}
