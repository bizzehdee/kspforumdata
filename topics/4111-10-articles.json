This means its not very compatible with other parts as Soyuz has weird dimensions like, 2.68m dia for the first stage tanks, 2.95m for the main, 2.6m for the third. I also used the real ISP values for the thrusters and I gotta say this thing is pretty close to preforming how it does in RL. The first stage burn times are damn near the RL value of ~70 seconds. The second stage is off a bit, but that is because theres no way to throttle it down alone during the first stage burn. All in all its very true to form, a Simple \u0026amp; stable rocket for getting a craft into a low orbit of about 200-300km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf deus gives me permision I\u0027d be happy to uploaded a zip with the .cfg files for people to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleur","CreatedById":9954,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T19:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESigh.

If you want to send something to the moon, you\\\u0027ll need to use a more powerful upper stage, like the Angara 1.25m from the Kosmos pack. Burn durations for each stage are similar (in Kerbal scale) to the real durations on a Soyuz launch, and the actual thrust, mass and consumption ratios are closer to usual KSP standards, which allows you to mix the Soyuz parts with other addons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20340764/Soyuz%20Rebalanced.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/20340764/Soyuz%20Rebalanced.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a ready-built Soyuz U.craft in the pack to use with the Noyuz.
