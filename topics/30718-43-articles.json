On the cliff top, a snow griv dropped onto all fours and raised its muzzle to the sky, adding its own shivering howl to the mournful chorus, as if to welcome the ghosts of history home to roost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe squad leader suppressed a shiver as he studied the four mountaineers in front of him. Three tough, weatherbeaten kerbals, any one of whom looked like they could, and probably had, faced down a charging scallan. Their sergeant, Lukin, wore a band of dirty grey gronnek fur around the edge of his snow hood. Deep set eyes watched the squad leader from a nest of wrinkles and more than a kerbals\u0027s fair share of scars. \u003Cem\u003EGronneks don\u0027t shoot back though.

Safe behind its screen of sooty glass, the flame from the hanging kerosene lamp barely flickered. One the mountaineers flicked a sideways glance at the drapes, before turning her attention back to the squad leader.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did you find them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLukin snorted. \u0022Truly.

Then we knock them on the head, drag \u0027em behind a rock, and light off the trucks.\u0022 He scowled at the squad leader\u0027s approving look. \u0022Truly. We\u0027re Wakirans, not murderers.

Lukin snuffed out the kerosene lamp and cautiously poked his head out of the door, before gesturing for the squad to follow. They left in single file, rocking slightly on their unevenly soled footwear, snowflakes gusting into the hut behind them. \u00A0At a murmured command they headed out into the night at a loping trot, leaving fresh trails of griv \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003Epaw\u003C/abbr\u003E prints in the snow behind them.

Cautiously he backed up against the cliff edge, trusting to the weather and his nondescript clothing for concealment. Gradually, his eyes adapted, picking out the expected edges of shadow against the night sky. Four logging trucks formed a perimeter at the edges of the camp, big bowsers of fuel strapped to their trailers. A darker, square bulk occupied the centre, a flicker of yellow light suddenly revealing an open door to a well lit interior and dim figures within.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EConvenient. Six in there looks like, so another six on patrol by my last count.\u003C/em\u003E \u00A0He unhooked a chunky radio handset from his belt and tapped the transmit key twice, then held it for a longer burst. Then he waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sharp clatter of falling stones cut through the snow-swaddled night. There was a long pause and then another, fainter clatter. Lukin crept forward, ears straining for the sound of voices. eyes swivelling from side to side. He glanced up just in time to see a figure silhouetted against the skyline. Another, more distant, clatter reached his ears but still there was no response from the supply camp. Lukin waited patiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKerm. Too dumb to notice or they know exactly what we\u0027re about. Either way it seems we\u0027re doing this the hard way. \u003C/em\u003EHe tapped out a second coded transmission, two long bursts followed by three short, then dropped to the ground, edging towards the nearest truck on his belly, reaching for the weighted baton in his belt. One of the shadows by the cab resolved itself into the figure of a guard peering alertly around. Lukin backed away on fingers and toes; circling around, gathering himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELike taking down a gronnek.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sprang to his feet, loping across the snow, weapon held across his chest. The guard spun around, reaching for his belt, just as the baton snapped out and caught him neatly behind the ear with a meaty thud. He dropped to the ground without a whimper.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLukin flipped open the bowser hood, studied its innards for a second, then opened the main valve. Diesel gushed onto the snow, the sudden reek making his eyes water. Hastily he pulled out a rag, tied it round the valve to deaden the noise and struck it sharply with his baton. Satisfied that the - now badly bent - handle wasn\u2019t going to close again, he heaved the unconscious guard over his shoulder and took off in a crouching run. He laid the guard down behind the first convenient rock and pulled out his radio, thumb reaching for the transmit key.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo answering rattles of static told him that two of the remaining bowsers had been disabled. He clenched his fists, willing the last of the saboteurs to report in. The radio hissed in his hand in one long then two short bursts. \u003Cem\u003ERetreating. Cannot engage without compromising position.\u003C/em\u003E Lukin swore under his breath then sent his final message of the night.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree balls of brilliant white light lit up the sky in quick succession,\u00A0throwing jagged shadows over the encampment before dropping into the rapidly spreading, glistening slicks of fuel. The cabin door burst open, armed kerbals spilling out, just as the flares burst open with a loud crack scattering sawdust and burning magnesium shavings over the snow. With a deceptively soft whump, the diesel ignited, sending tongues of orange flame racing across the ground. Before the horrified Firesvarn guards could react, the flames reached the trucks, charring paintwork and igniting tyres in blazing clouds of choking black smoke. Metal warped and twisted in the heat, rivets popped, joints flexed open pouring out yet more fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guards ran.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmidst the chaos, three kerbals slipped quietly away into the night, leaving nothing but three trails of boot prints in the snow.

Ferl reported a steady stream of radar contacts from the west but after Val\u2019s terse warning to one patrol which came perilously close to crossing the border, the Wakiran forces kept a respectful distance. The tundra began to give way to scrubland and patches of conifer forest, and then to the first signs of cultivated land and kerbal habitation. A light flashed on Val\u2019s instrument panel accompanied by a chime from the waypoint indicator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll take the first delivery.

Val banked to the right, carefully adjusting her heading, then rolled level and uncaged a button on her control stick. \u201CVanguard, payload armed.\u201D Her eyes darted from canopy to waypoint indicator and back, judging distances, waiting for the exact moment. \u201CDeploying payload!\u201D She tipped her aircraft onto a wingtip, banking hard left, fingers clenching around the weapon release button. The torpedo pylon under the Cloudrunner\u2019s belly sprang open and a rounded tubular capsule tumbled away towards the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExplosive bolts fired, fragmenting the capsule and scattering hundreds of brightly coloured streamers across the sky, each tied to a small cardboard message tube. The wind caught the streamers, carrying them across the border and depositing them across swathes of Wakiran farmland.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one the other Vanguard pilots followed Val\u2019s lead: diving for the border then pulling away leaving nothing behind but a cloud of colourful streamers to flutter down over towns and villages, fields and Kerm trees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGunfire hammered down the road, almost drowning out the roar of heavy diesel engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesigned to stop a charging snow griv at a safe distance - and if that failed, to put another half-dozen rounds into it before it closed to an \u003Cem\u003Eunsafe\u003C/em\u003E distance - each shot from the heavy, semi-automatic hunting rifles was deafening by itself. \u00A0Together, they melted into a brutal, nerve-shredding din that bypassed mere eardrums and pounded the brain to an insensate mass. The Wakiran troops lay flat on the floors of their vehicles, cowering under seats, curling up in footwells, arms wrapped protectively around their heads. Bullets ripped through the air, smashing safety glass, ripping into upholstery, whining off door pillars, ricocheting around passenger compartments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe platoon leader flung open his door. Under no illusion that a few millimetres of steel would offer any real protection, he peered through the chink between door and hinge, trying to catch a glimpse of the approaching enemy forces. Seeing nothing, he steeled himself to lean out a little further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rebounding door slammed into its frame. The truck lurched on its suspension, throwing the commander hard against one arm. He felt, rather than heard, a dull snap. Sheets of jagged fire strobed before his eyes and he clenched his jaw in a futile attempt to not scream. The truck lurched again, steel shrieking against steel as it rocked wildly. The commander tumbled over the handbrake, the blow knocking the wind out of him. He fell against the opposite door and this time the fire was engulfed in black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe awoke to an ominous silence. One-handed he struggled to haul himself into his seat, not daring to inspect the throbbing weight hanging from his other shoulder. \u003Cem\u003EStrange - I thought it would hurt more than this. \u003C/em\u003EHis hand trailed over the edge of the seat cushion, the momentary friction enough to scrape bone against bone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAhh.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlinking exploding stars out of his eyes, the platoon leader looked around. The truck was ruined; buckled door wedged into its equally buckled frame, side panels bowing inwards and what remained of the roof riddled with bullet holes. Pellets of broken safety glass crunched unnervingly as he shifted in his seat. \u00A0The other trucks in his platoon hadn\u0027t fared any better. Knocked sideways, or in most cases, off the road altogether, one of them perilously close to fetching up against a tree trunk, their makeshift roadblock had been comprehensively demolished. \u00A0The commander screwed his eyes shut against more than the agony in his arm.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Squads - report in by truck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe waited, ignoring the shaken but heartfelt swearing from the back of his own truck. \u003Cem\u003EBesides - I couldn\u0027t have put it better myself.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlpha-one. Two kerbals down, sir! No fatalities.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alpha-two is all-in. No damage here but bruised egos, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bravo-one \u00A0- all-in, shaken but not stirred!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bravo-two - three kerbals down... and we\u0027ll be sending Calley back to her Grove, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio went very quiet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood, Bravo-two. Charlie-one?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll-in, sir. No shortage of bruises but nothing that\u0027ll stop anyone holding a spade for Calley.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy.\u0022 He clicked the radio off and carefully turned round in his seat. \u0022Sure wasn\u0027t hearing any bruised mouths back there. What about the rest of you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Count us in for spade duty too, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio clicked on again. \u0022Charlie-two reporting all-in. Anyone that can move, move. Barrim, Sidgan, please render medical assistance to Alpha-one and Bravo-two. Barrim - a word with you once you\u0027re done please. Everyone else - gear check on your transport and equipment. I don\u0027t care how much sky you can see through the roof - I want a scouting force after those Firesvarn seffleks before they do any more damage. Start at the two Groves up the road and for Kerm\u0027s sake keep your heads down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo of the six trucks were wrecked beyond repair and all of the remaining four were windowless, dented and badly shot up. Fortunately, one of them still had an intact set of tyres and, after a brief inspection, four kerbals from Bravo squad piled in with their equipment and weapons and drove off.\u00A0 After a brief conference with his sergeant, the platoon leader sent out two patrols drawn from trucks Alpha-two and Charlie-one. Whilst Barrim and Sidgan tended to the injured, the rest of the platoon set to work pushing their vehicles into the middle of the road and overturning them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the scouting party returned, the roadblock was back in place and a crackling fire built behind it. Bandaged kerbals stood by the warmth, sipping from tin mugs, their comrades busily stripping and cleaning weapons and repacking rucksacks. The side of the road was marked by a shallow mound of fresh earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReport.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They didn\u0027t go anywhere near either village, sir. Far as we could tell from talking to the villagers, they went out of their way to skirt around both Groves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA raised eyebrow. \u0022And you took their word for it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, sir. We recced the area. Checked the rest of the Groves in the group too - nothing doing. The last anybody saw of them, they were heading southeast. Too much territory that way for a quick look, sir and since they don\u0027t seem to be looking to take any nearby Groves, we came back to report.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe platoon leader adjusted his sling, scratching absently at the thick roll of bandage around his arm. \u0022If they\u0027re not capturing old Groves, they must be trying to claim ground for new ones. Not good but it beats the alternative. Break out the maps.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022 The scout ran back to his truck and retrieved a bundle of acetate rolls, which he quickly spread over the ground. The platoon gathered round, alternately studying the map or their commander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Southeast?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re going cross-country then.\u201D He jabbed a finger at a line of hills sheltering an expanse of forest. \u201CProbably heading for the Bouldertops - they\u2019re the nearest clear territory to here. We\u2019ve got them marked for Groves ourselves but they don\u2019t have any defending forces to speak of. Command didn\u2019t reckon we\u2019d need them this far over the border.\u201D The platoon leader grimaced. \u201CGive them enough time to bed in and knotweed would be easier to shift.\u201D He jumped to his feet and made for his truck, followed by his platoon sergeant. \u201CCommand\u2019ll need to know about this. For sure we\u2019re not going to be digging them out ourselves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke stole through the forest, creeping through the undergrowth, alert for Firesvarn pickets - or for a loose twig underfoot that would give away his position. Up ahead he spotted a tree liberally festooned with balls of twigs and moss, white feathers visible inside some of them. Automatically, he shifted course, working his way around a clump of thorn bushes, staying downwind of the woodjar rookery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA twig snapped. Lemke froze against a tree trunk, eyes darting left and right. A dip in the ground, fringed by more bushes offered better shelter, the hard ground and drifts of dried thorns underfoot sufficient to hide his passage. He dashed forward, lifting his feet high to avoid scuff marks and dropped to his belly. Silently, his hand dropped to the knife sheathed at his waist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe spotted\u00A0a pair of boots through the bushes and held his breath. They stopped and Lemke heard a muffled clink of equipment as the Firesvarn soldier dropped to one knee, fumbling with his laces. Lemke measured the distance between them by eye, mouth suddenly dry. \u003Cem\u003EUp, across, head back and slice. One less picket to warn the rest.\u003C/em\u003E He set his jaw. I can do this. The Firesvarn straightened up, waited for a nerve-jangling minute then set off again, Lemke\u2019s head swivelling to track him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI can do this. I \u003C/em\u003Ehave\u003Cem\u003E to do this.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke launched himself from the dip and threw himself across the forest floor, drawing his knife as he went. He flung his other arm out in preparation, ready to lock it round his enemy\u0027s throat. A mottled olive-and-brown jacket filled his vision, short neck and close-cropped black hair above it. Hair not so very different from his own. Hair that snapped round revealing wide open, terrified eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI can\u2019t do this.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blade swung up and back. Lemke lashed out, slamming the hilt of his knife awkwardly into the side of the other\u2019s head. The Firesvarn dropped bonelessly to the forest floor, eyes rolling back into their sockets. Lemke dropped the knife and fell to one knee, catching him, fingers feeling for a pulse. When he found the beat, weak but steady, he almost collapsed too, limbs suddenly shaking uncontrollably.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECan\u2019t leave. Must leave. Must hide. Crush berry.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe dragged the unconscious soldier into the dip he\u2019d just vacated and heaved him onto his side. He broke off a spray of berries from the nearest thornbush and crushed them between his fingers, gagging at the sudden rotting stench. He wiped the brownish juice over the Firesvarn\u2019s face and hands then scrubbed his fingers vigorously on the other\u2019s jacket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENot dead but smells dead. Smells bad. Need to find. Make trail.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHastily, Lemke scooped out a trench in the leaf litter. Removing the Firesvarn\u2019s belt, he tied the soldier\u2019s wrists together behind his back, rolled him into the trench and piled the litter back over him. Breaking off branches from the nearby bushes, he arranged them on top\u00A0 of the limp form until it was mostly hidden under a blanket of thorns. He climbed to his feet and cut a shallow blaze in the nearest tree trunk, not enough to damage it but clear enough for all that knew to see. He set off into the forest again, marking a trail as he went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first skirmish had been relatively short. Deprived of their scouts, the Firesvarn at the valley entrance were caught by surprise and then overpowered by superior Wakiran numbers. Although the fighting had been fierce, casualties were mercifully low, the Firesvarn commander unwilling to waste the lives of his troops once the true size of the Wakiran forces became apparent. After a brief foray into the forest to retrieve Lemke\u2019s and, he had been relieved to see, a number of other scouts, the prisoners were now on their way to the nearest town.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second skirmish had not been short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke skidded behind a boulder, leaned out, fired, ducked back. Incoming rounds tore chips of stone off his meagre cover in reply. Rifle fire echoed from the surrounding hills in a savage counterpoint to the screams and shouted orders coming from his radio. He heard a rapid burst of fire somewhere to his right and the bullets whining over his head abruptly ceased.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo me!\u201D Another Wakiran soldier waved at him frantically from behind a larger outcrop of rock. \u201CGo, go, go!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke grabbed his own weapon and sprinted across the uneven ground, throwing himself to the ground amidst another deafening exchange. The blue band on his companion\u2019s sleeve marked him as being from a different platoon. \u201CLemke - twenty-first,\u201D he shouted over the gunfire. \u201CYou?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNedrim. Fifteenth under Lenory!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThought your lot were taking the next hill over!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep! Got split up by those seffleks,\u201D Nedrim aimed a rude gesture downhill, \u201Cdown there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke caught a glimpse of movement to his left, turned and fired. His shots went high forcing the approaching soldier to the ground. Nedrim\u2019s rifle roared and the soldier rolled over once and lay still. He scanned the hillside, searching for cover, fingers busy reloading his own rifle. Nedrim grabbed his arm and pointed. \u201CThat way I reckon.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke nodded in reply, eyes darting from tussock to tussock, searching for more Firesvarn. \u201CYou go first - I\u2019ll cover you.\u201D He saw Nedrim sprint away in a crouching run, zig-zagging up the hill, head flicking back and forth. His rifle barrel twitched back and forth in sympathy as he tried to watch in all directions at once. Nedrim threw himself into a shallow dip, looked round, then gestured for Lemke to follow him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single shot rang out, startlingly close amidst the background chaos. Lemke slid feet-first into the hollow, just in time to see Nedrim topple forward. Time seemed to slow down as he stared at the other kerbal in sudden disbelief, barely registering the blood and tissues spattering his own uniform or fluids seeping into the grass from what remained of Nedrim\u2019s skull. From the back it seemed strangely undamaged.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe part of Lemke\u2019s mind that wasn\u2019t yammering in shock flung him sideways and round, desperately trying to bring his rifle to bear on the attacker behind him. Something flared in the corner of his eye and he felt a sudden dull pain in his chest. Hitting the ground awkwardly, he rolled onto his back, both hands patting the front of his jacket curiously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sky seemed to turn pale and grey, clouds gathering around the tops of the Bouldertop hills. Lemke touched his damp sleeve with a finger. \u003Cem\u003EMust be raining. I should get to shelter.\u003C/em\u003E He tried to sit up but nothing seemed to work any more. His joints felt as if they were packed with sand; gritty, slow, unwilling to move. His eyes felt suddenly heavy, the leathery rasp as they rolled back against his eyelids almost soothing. \u003Cem\u003ELike a\u2026 like a\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemke\u2019s rifle slipped out of his hands. One leg twitched briefly and then fell still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBleakly, the Firesvar commander surveyed the aftermath of the second skirmish, the remains of his personal platoon gathered silently around him.
