Got a really nice polar insertion and was very proud :-)\n\nI then swtiched back to the base on Kerbal, thinking to build another rocket. However, when I went back to see my M700 probe in orbit, apart from the scanner itself, everything else that was attached to the scanner has disappeared. And of course, now the scanner itself no longer works (no power, no communications). \n\nSame thing happens when I revert to an earlier save. The scanner is there, but the rest of it that I launched is gone. Nothing I can do will get the rest of the scanner back.\n\nTried deleting the game and redownloading from scratch, but the same bug appears. \n\nInterestingly, I tried to replicate the bug with another rocket using parts that were available in pre 1.0 but the bug didnt happen. \n\nPlease help, as I need a working scanner to look for ore! :-)\n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T13:33:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 01:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Bluey**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:43:25Z","Content":"Hi Captain Bluey, please see the support stickies as we need more information in order to help, but if you have made a scan the data will remain accessible, it only needs to be done once per planet ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gonumen","CreatedById":142252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:33:44Z","Content":"Hi, I have exactly the same problem and it\u0027s game-breaking as i cannot always get to the other planet/moon in one gameplay and after loading the flight everything is gone."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Bluey","CreatedById":142211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:53:25Z","Content":"Looks like we have a temporary solution: \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117832-Do-not-make-the-Orbital-Survey-Scanner-your-root](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117832-Do-not-make-the-Orbital-Survey-Scanner-your-root)"}]}
