Enory was a great pick! Good name, high smarts, great for marketing... Gerbles was the smartest one in the list and had a good name too.

In installing the mod, I sort of accidentally delete all the default control pods :I. I later realize this when the lander Gerbles and Enory were in is deleted. But if it was plain deleted, that would have been fine! Gerbles who was in the lander, materialized at base a few days later. Enory who was still sitting in the buggy on the Mun however, did not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EGerbles to the rescue! Sort of...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI leave Enory on the mun guarding the flag for a few days while Gerbles prepares a brand spanking new base a bit better than the last to try a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI planned to take the new lander to the Armstrong memorial where Gerbles could plant a flag, take off again, and then wait for Enory to circumnavigate and meet him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerbles goes in for a landing by the Armstrong crater, but as I descend, I notice that the fuel level on the corner and the fuel level above the engine are off. I managed to place the fuel lines backwards. Going in for landing... dropping... descending... and BOOM. Out of fuel :I 20 meters up, I start dropping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash I hit the ground at about 20 meters per second! I bounce once! Ha still good! I bounce twice... nonono! stop tipping stahp! The lander tips onto its side. WELP it looks like this craft won\u0027t be rescuing anyone. Now I have 2 Kerbals stranded on opposite sides of the Mun. I start getting Enory to trek back to Gerbles to see if I can use only 1 craft to rescue them both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a frustrating hour of me flipping the buggy over, plopping Enory back in the seat, and clambering out of yet ANOTHER crater, I realized that wasn\u0027t going to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile I was theorizing how to save them both with only one mission. I ended up making a tiny 2 capsule lander that would rescue them. Gerbles was coming up with his own plans though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe plan\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022the buggy when flipped upside down, made a perfect ramp.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realized that I might still be able to get Gerbles off the ground. The lander I built for Gerbles and the Armstrong base had a buggy equipped, and a detachable stage for the return trip. I detached the buggy used its flip proof landing gear to try and catapult the tipped lander right side up. This was of no use though so I went back to the drawing board. Eureka! I built the buggy with enough RCS on board to actually fly. I also found that the buggy when flipped upside down, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emade a perfect ramp\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI detached the return stage and used the buggy to flip the base without the final stage on top. I then rolled the final stage (crushing some solar panels) out of the way facing the best direction for orbit. I flipped the buggy over, and using RCS positioned it about 5 meters in front of the return stage. Gerbles was getting a bit anxious...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iIq4E79.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iIq4E79.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI switch over to Enory and send him into orbit after a hectic few extra days roaming the surface of the Mun while I start thinking of the best way to send Gerbles back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EBlast off!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sun rises over the blank gray hills of the mun and Gerbles begins final preparation for his life or death task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disable the engine and throttle all the way to max. I haven\u0027t tried taking off from the Mun yet with a nuclear engine so I really have no clue whether it even has enough thrust to take off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E! I countdown in my head while \u0022taps\u0022 plays in the background... 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! Blast off! The rocket lurches forwards and connects with the rover. They both grind against the ground for a few meters and then the rover gives. The rocket points skyward and takes to the sky!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuzzah! Gerbles stares out of his window and watches the rover bounce across the ground a few hundred meters below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the crazy takeoff Gerbles gets back to KSC quite easily and lives with his pal Enory happily for the rest of their life... Or not... I actually end up sending the 2 of \u0027em with a new Kerman named Scott (who I like to think of as the rich guy who decided to go for kicks) to a Jool station.
