The spot size of the microwave beam is too large for my relays. (I think.

I know the spot size has to be smaller than the receiver diameter. So if I had a 5m receiver with a spot size of like 0.05m, according to the wiki it should receive the full transmission power. But that doesn\u0027t make much sense, so I think I\u0027m getting something mixed up. It also mentions distance. It says it will receive less power the further it is from the transmitter, but I can\u0027t see a way to calculate that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does distance affect the power received?
