A more robust way, might simply be to indicate static atmospheric pressure in Bar. \u00A0Although the player would have to multiply pressure to current surface speed multiplied by gravity to get a usable Indicated airspeed in reference to aerodynamic performance at kerbin sea level. \u00A0 That was a mouthful. \u00A0 Maybe a \u201CArrodynamic factor\u201D that multiplies pressure by gravity would give us one number. \u00A0 Or maybe go back to a value called \u201CStandard IAS\u201D which is always displaying in reference to Kerbin at Sea Level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razor235","CreatedById":16436,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T15:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr... just use a Mach number display?\u00A0 That way it auto-corrects for density (well temperature really, but you get the idea).\u00A0 Have it auto-calibrate for other atmospheres like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s anyway since there\u0027s no other performance metric that requires active calibration by the player per body except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo reason to overcomplicate something that doesn\u0027t impact most of the game, spaceflight in vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-28T15:52:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2023 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Razor235\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzz313th","CreatedById":149043,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T16:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224247577\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213847\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677599502\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216436\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Razor235\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Razor235 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr... just use a Mach number display?\u00A0 That way it auto-corrects for density (well temperature really, but you get the idea).\u00A0 Have it auto-calibrate for other atmospheres like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s anyway since there\u0027s no other performance metric that requires active calibration by the player per body except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo reason to overcomplicate something that doesn\u0027t impact most of the game, spaceflight in vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, that it shouldn\u2019t be over complicated. \u00A0Although, considering that the devs seem to be taking the aerodynamic flight model to new level, it would be nice to see an aerodynamic performance metric while in flight. \u00A0 Any such number would also have to be corrected for gravity as well, since as you increase gravity, wing loading increases in the vertical lift vector. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T16:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas any of you tried opening the Aerogui?
