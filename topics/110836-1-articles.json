In real life tar sands(Oil sands) gives %0.03 oil after the sand and dirt is removed and refined. Lets assume that in asteroids you are looking for oxygen and hydrogen to turn into fuel since they are the easiest kind of materials you can find as oxydizer and liquid fuel. This is giving you %1 turn rate atleast.
