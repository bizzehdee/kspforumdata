A fighter can\u0027t live by it\u0027s machine guns in a modern world but unlike a missile the guidance for a bullet can be done internally and can\u0027t be tampered with. This plus the fact that there is a long history of people going back to 1918 saying \u0022dogfighting would be a thing of the past if aircraft reach speeds of just X mph\u0022 or \u0022long range missiles will end dogfighting\u0022 or missiles with thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically nobody knows what 5th generation combat really looks like so many approaches should be rewarded so long as they fall within certain speed requirements.
