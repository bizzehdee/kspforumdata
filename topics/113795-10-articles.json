Due to the unpleasant stimuli in the gluteus maximus caused by servicing such a setup, the points value of these stations towards points for # of stations should be halved... because *someone* has to represent maintenance and ordnance personnel.![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [\\*]Even if BD armoury isn\u0027t used, there should be a requirement for Structural Pylons or some such to represent weapon stations since that adds drag. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ^1^Yes, people do not normally pull 30G. We\u0027re talking about the safety factor built into the airframe - this is how many G the airframe can take before breaking up.\n\n1.25 is incredibly high for a fighter jet. They normally sit at around 1.0.\n\nI like your second and fifth suggestions.\n\nBDArmory is neat, but the weapons are not properly scaled to Kerbal parts.\n\nEdit: I suggest dropping the limitations on turbojets so that we can make some fun (goofy) single engine designs.\n\nDoes anyone know of any good Mac-friendly screen capturing software? I\u0027d like to record myself flying everyone\u0027s creations around.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You run KSP on a macbook air? I\u0027m using a 2012 macbook pro and I\u0027m concerned about heat generation\n\u003E Thanks for the help with the wings and you\u0027re welcome in regards to the challenge. I got the idea at first because of the F-35 and just how bad and compromised it is. At first I wanted the challenge to be something along the lines of build a better aircraft than Boeing can.\n\u003E \n\u003E But then I increased the difficulty by insisting that you build a real 5th gen fighter\n\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) There\u0027s an intrinsic problem to this challenge: what constitutes a 5th gen fighter? A larger multirole fighter like the Eurofighter or Rafale, or a something a bit smaller like the F-35 or Saab Gripen?\n\nThe Rafale replica that I built is arguably a much better multirole fighter than the flying bathtub/Boeing X-32 replica that I built, but I entered the X-32 into the challenge because it\u0027s a fun little... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI run KSP at half quality, windowed, and with minimal mods.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E KJR doesnt make things indestructible. They still come apart, just at more realistic levels. If I take my XF-150A and throw it into a 12G turn at mach 1.2 at low level the air pressure will turn it into confetti pretty quickly. \n\u003E If you attach something to a weak point structurally it doesn\u0027t matter what you use it will still break.\n\nHodo, I found out that FAR\u0027s Flight Assistance toggles were causing your plane to go wild. When I turn the flight assistance toggles off, the 150 flies perfectly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T20:48:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrisK**"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T20:04:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So if V tails are bad, what was the motivation behind the design of the F-22, and the YF-23?\n\nIf they have enough seperation between them I don\u0027t think that the 2 V-tail-wings are going to interfere much with each other.

This might lead to a stiffening of controls (which can be fatal) or the total catastrophic failure of the elevator and stabilizer assembly (which is invariably fatal)\n\nthe YF-22 doesn\u0027t have a V tail it just has 2 vertical stabilizers, this distributes the load adequately for a mach 2 capable jet.\n\nAlso @ Scoundrel, I\u0027ll consider that but I wouldn\u0027t discount super manoeuvre as unimportant, in fact for all that stuff about thrust vectoring sidewinders, there is no doubt always going to be a good counter measure. A fighter can\u0027t live by it\u0027s machine guns in a modern world but unlike a missile the guidance for a bullet can be done internally and can\u0027t be tampered with. This plus the fact that there is a long history of people going back to 1918 saying \u0022dogfighting would be a thing of the past if aircraft reach speeds of just X mph\u0022 or \u0022long range missiles will end dogfighting\u0022 or missiles with thrust vectoring.\n\nBasically nobody knows what 5th generation combat really looks like so many approaches should be rewarded so long as they fall within certain speed requirements. Also I don\u0027t want to limit participants\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T14:37:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**\n  \nNamed wrong OP for suggestions due to extensive quote"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T10:41:40Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-1-0-4-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-15-4-Glauert-7-12-15?p=2075520\u0026viewfull=1#post2075520](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-1-0-4-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-15-4-Glauert-7-12-15?p=2075520\u0026viewfull=1#post2075520)\n\nTime for reviews ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
