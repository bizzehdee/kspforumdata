The catch here will be that these AI cores are very large, thus its impractical to put them on a surface probe, meaning the surface probe will have to have connection to the large voyager probe in order for it to be controlled.

They just unlocked AM engines, why must they be in a rush to get it back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E when they can just play around elsewhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s another thing, I\u0027m sure we are all used to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E being the primary space center we use in KSP, but with KSP 2 well-developed colonies should be functionally identical to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E seeing as KSP 2 isn\u0027t a mod, but a different game whose systems are more robust than those in, say, the Kerbal Konstructs mod. What\u0027s the big rush to get a shiny new technology back to Kerbol if you\u0027ve already got a set of \u003Cs\u003Ecolonies\u003C/s\u003E space centers in a more interesting system whose interesting planets are more deserving of attention from rockets equipped with AM engines than the planets around Kerbol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what I\u0027m trying to say is that going into KSP 2 (especially with lightspeed delays) requires that you don\u0027t use the exact same mindset as KSP 1. It\u0027s a different game that might not even demand that you keep the original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E around when your other space centers ran under the same agency are low on funds. Maybe distant colonies can\u0027t even operate under the same agency because the physical distance between stars makes it impossible for them to remain connected to their roots back at Kerbol. Again, this isn\u0027t KSP 1, not everything is centered around the original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. If your AM engine blueprints take the same length of time as a super-efficient Jool mission to get back to Kerbol, so what?

It certainly does look as though it does not work in a way that would allow that to work, but the easy handwave is that we have been completely wrong about lots of things in science in the past (not a bad thing, just the nature of scientific progression), so why not just say this turned out to be one of them.

Although to say it literally doesn\u0027t matter is more accurately to say it doesn\u0027t matter \u003Cem\u003Eto you\u003C/em\u003E, which of course is a perfectly valid preference. I would suspect, though, that most people (whatever % that may actually mean) would not want to deal with different part selections in different systems (that said, I am perfectly into part limitation based on level of resource availability/infrastructure development, so there is a valid argument for you to ask how that is any different), and I still doubt that it is something that they would want to bother spending the man-hours with implementing differentiated tech trees. It would also raise the question of: is your only option that you have to just wait for transmission lag (and really, if you are wanting that tech for a project in a different system, how exactly do they know\u00A0(in-game perspective) that they will be getting that new tech and just have to wait for it) ? Can you just re-buy the same techs separately in different systems (and if so, why are they all somehow getting the exact same parts every time, even though they were researched differently) rather than wait for the transmission to arrive (time warp is a thing, as you said, but so are transfer windows, and some people might not want to wait)? Do you then have different science scores in different systems?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also certain limitations regarding lag time that cannot be done in game and would have to be self imposed. Example: you have two systems colonized and want to go for a third; you decide, for whatever reason, that the best way to do it is to launch simultaneous expeditions from both current systems. Technically, if you immediately build and launch both, you are breaking lag times, and it\u0027s literally impossible for the game to be able to know this. Now you can launch them separately based on transmission times, or wait a certain amount of time to account for coordination before launching both, but that\u0027s self imposed at that point. You can also say that, well missions are planned so long in advance that of course there was time for it to be communicated and coordinated, but at that point you are handwaving it away, and that raises the question of why are doing it for this, but not for these other things. Also, if there is already a head canon handwave for people about implicit transmission times, why is it so important that it be expressed explicitly. If we take it as read that these would be happening, then all you are left with is the fact that, for anyone who wants to synchronize their tech tree, an extra step of clicking the time warp button is not compelling gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I get your point about ones position of omniscience as \u0027director\u0027, no matter which side of the issue you fall on, it gets a little weird (but that\u0027s also just the nature of it being a game). Time lag like what are talking about is one issue if you are a real director person, for example. However, if you are a more godlike figure, why are they talking to you directly and giving you missions (and tutorials), etc. The actual reasons are obvious, but at a certain level of seeking verisimilitude, you really have to not think about it too hard, I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it is very true that this is a different game, and that interstellar travel raises questions and issues that were pretty safely ignored when confined to a single solar system in the first game.
