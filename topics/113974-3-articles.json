Anyone able to beg, borrow or steal the necessary clearance was crammed into the mission control room, and the warm press of bodies was made that much worse by the thick smell of wet paint and fresh plaster. Construction workers still scurried back and forth, finishing the last-minute renovations to the already brand new building. Few of the spectators noticed the smears and streaks on their fine suits or uniforms, their eyes drawn instead to the far wall, where the three largest video screens ever built stood ready to display telemetry, orbital track, and a live telephoto video feed from the roof of the VAB.\n\nBeyond the massive window panes, *Empress Alexandra I* stood ready on the launch pad, the mirror-polished aluminum skin of her fuel tanks glinting in the sun. Except for the oxium tank in the lower half, where frost from the cryogenic liquid stubbornly covered the \u0022UNION\u0022 of \u0022USSARI UNION\u0022 painted in large crimson Kerillic letters down its length. The white paint on her six solid rocket boosters and protective nosecone had been buffed and waxed like a fine automobile. Even the launch towers had been cleaned and painted.\n\nSurrounding this, all over the grounds of the cosmodrome, were people by the *thousands*. From all over they had come, or been dragged. Every State in the Union, every ally, every rival. Reporters and correspondents and respected dignitaries, bringing all manner of cameras, now pointed at the launch pad. This, security had expected. But they had not anticipated the *people*. Entire towns nearby had been virtually emptied, and descended on the grounds of their own volition. The police and security forces struggled to maintain some kind of order. Controlling crowds was something they had more than a little experience with, yet the sheer numbers threatened to just sweep them away.\n\nIn Crimson Square, the bleachers that had been erected lay crumpled and smashed in a back alley. People filled every square centimeter of the huge space. They hung from light poles, crowded balconies and rooftops, and had knocked over no less than a dozen broadcast antennas trying to get a view of the rocket as it would rise over the Dome of the Imperium. Here, the police had utterly given up on controlling the crowd, and had instead retreated within the ancient walls of the Fortress, hoping they would offer the same protection from this horde as they had in ages past. The Imperial Guards maintained a tenuous balance at the gates, some terrified they might actually have to use their anachronistic ceremonial polearms in ways they\u0027d never learned. In the days to come, statisticians around the world would try and fail to arrive at an accurate count on the amount of people in this one place. They all agreed, however, that the weight of the gathering transcended any mere number.\n\nAll across the expansive nation, from Kerbelsk to Kerliningrad, from the desert to the tundra, everyone within a day\u0027s hard travel of a screen was watching. Whether they wanted to or not. Even beyond the cloistered Union, in hovels and palaces, factories and farms. A sold-out Solpugids concert at Madison Tetrahedron Garden was preempted, a cadre of ranch-hands in east Exast gathered around a fuzzy, barely-working box with an antenna made from a pair of old spurs, the crew of a fishing boat in the middle of the Great Southern Sea listened intently to their radio, the patrons of a tiki bar on Pogagalas stopped their banter, the fighting in Cerima even paused for a few, precious moments, and the transmitter on a brand-new communications satellite burned out from the load. And of course, Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra II watched from her gilded cage, coolly aware of the significance of this rocket named for her predecessor. Indeed, the world was watching.\n\nAnd in the middle of it all, surrounded by an odd little pocket of space in the crowded Mission Control room, stood Valentina Kerman, fidgeting anxiously with a pencil. Whether it was from the look in her eyes, the scowl on her face, or... something else, no one came near. If she moved, the pocket moved with her, like fish evading a predator. Despite her stature, she alone had a perfect view of both the window and monitors.\n\nSergei. All this fuss for Sergei.\n\n*All this should have been yours...*\n\nShe shook the thought away. She didn\u0027t want it, she didn\u0027t want *any* of it, but... just some shred of recognition?\n\n*All his fault...*\n\nMost infuriating of all, he was actually *good* at it. He was completely composed and comfortable before all the attention, thriving even. Already given his *second* mission, commanding the first flight of the new ship, before even flying this, his first. The P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI had even given a speech-a speech!-before disappearing into the capsule a couple of hours ago. Some nonsense about duty and courage.\n\nDibella was, again, busily coordinating the final checkouts as capcom, and Tercella was standing by with a dozen Converters in the expected recovery zone, leaving Valentina alone in the throng with her thoughts.\n\nWell, not *completely* alone...\n\n*They abandon you, now in your time of need. But the darkness is always here... always waiting...*\n\nShe pushed it away, still twirling the pencil between her fingers.\n\n\u0022Fifteen seconds, *Empress*, all systems go,\u0022 she heard Dibella say.\n\n\u0022I am ready! Let\u0027s go!\u0022 Sergei practically squealed.\n\n*\u0022V\u00F3sem...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Sem...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Shest...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Pyat...\u0022*\n\n\u0022Main engine start...\u0022\n\nOut on the launchpad, the pair of ethanol fueled engines beneath the rocket sputtered and then roared to life, rattling the windows and sending thick clouds of smoke rushing from the flame trenches.\n\n\u0022Main engines running, one hundred percent!\u0022\n\nThe pencil flipped and spun.\n\n*\u0022Tree...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Dva...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Od\u00E9en...\u0022*\n\n\u0022Booster ignition!\u0022\n\nThe roar of the liquid engines was shamed as the six huge solid rocket boosters thundered and roiled, the sound slamming into the building like a landslide, shaking the windows and even cracking one.\n\nThe pencil twirled faster.\n\n\u0022Liftoff! We have liftoff! Empress Alexandra I has cleared the towers!\n\n\u0022Onward! Onward!\u0022 Exclaimed Sergei, his smug, smiling face bouncing slightly in the monitor, \u0022For the greater Glory of the Union, in peace for all Kerbalkind!\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s face drew into a sneer as the sheer power of the launch continued to assault the building.\n\n*There is power in you too... Great power... feel it, burning in your veins like fire... you cannot deny it...*\n\n\u0022Shut up!\u0022 Valentina snapped. Another onlooker gave her a nervous glance and inched away a bit more. The pencil went back and forth across her fingers. Back and forth, back and forth.\n\n\u0022*Empress*, tell me you have a pitch program...\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414! Pitch and roll! My systems checkout good. It\u0027s very smooth, acceleration is building slowly... I can see the horizon now, the landscape below is incredible, even now! I simply don\u0027t have the words!\u0022\n\nThat would be a *first*. Valentina ground her teeth. They\u0027d actually given him a window. A window! All that was necessary was to cut a hole in the nosecone in the right place! Back and forth, back and forth.\n\nThe clouds of smoke around the building were finally drifting off in the light wind. The rocket was just visible in the sky as it arced away.\n\n\u0022This is but one small step for a Kerbal, but a giant...\u0022\n\nLousy stuck-up no-goodnik. Even *now* he was still... speechifying.\n\nBack and forth, back and forth.\n\nGrinning in the monitor, pausing for dramatic effect, *enjoying himself*.\n\nBack and forth, the pencil went back and forth.\n\nBah, she hoped he soiled himself!\n\n*You cannot escape the darkness...*\n\nBack and forth, back and forth.\n\nShe hoped he puked in his helmet!\n\n*It is always waiting...*\n\nBack and forth, back and forth.\n\nWhy, she hoped he...\n\n*You can only...*\n\nShe hoped he...\n\nBack and forth....\n\nHoped he...\n\n*Embrace it.*\n\nHe...\n\nExploded.\n\nThere was no warning, no sound at this distance. A momentary puff of smoke in the monitor, then a cascade of fire. So much fire. Searing, raging, tearing. Beyond the window, the six mighty solid rocket boosters, now freed from their charge, bloomed into a death-flower that mocked in its beauty. In the crowded mission control room, and the grounds beyond, not a sound was made. Billions of people across the globe stood silent as the grave.\n\nNo sound, save for the soft noise of two bits of pencil dropping to the floor.\n\nIn the window, the cloud of smoke and fire grew, until finally, after a wheel of eternities, a thin sound like thunder in the distance, and the barest rattle of the glass.\n\nThen, chaos broke loose.\n\n\u0022Loss of signal, telemetry is null.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Empress*, control, do you copy?\u0022\n\n\u0022Range now tracking multiple signals.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Empress*, this is control, do you copy?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Signal still null, abort tower did not fire.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei, do you copy?\u0022\n\n\u0022Lock the doors.\u0022\n\n\u0022All channels still null, no beacons at this time.\u0022\n\n\u0022Secure your stations.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei...?\u0022 Dibella\u0027s voice began to crack, \u0022Sergei...?\u0022\n\nIn a maelstrom of confusion and chaos, of shouts and barks yells, in a little pocket of space, Valentina Kerman fell to her knees.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-02T05:48:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2016 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T23:48:08Z","Content":"**Chapter 19: Crow**\n\nA light, cold rain fell from a featureless grey sky. It slid from the top of Valentina\u0027s wide-brimmed hat, dripping down the back of her neck, but she took no notice. She stood stiffly, motionlessly, fingertips touched lightly to the edge of that wide brim. She stood in a line with others, but took no notice of them, either. Once again, Crimson Square was filled with people.\n\nOn a platform before her, rested the coffin. It was more of a formality, really. The capsule had disintegrated instantly, debris scattered over hundreds of square kilometers. They had found just enough to be... sure. It was empty, except for the medal. Hero of the Ussari Union. Awarded on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\nThe bureaucrat had just finished his speech, as a soldier held an umbrella over him. Some nonsense about duty and courage. At a command, the cadre of Imperial Guard surrounding the coffin, with their mirror-polished breastplates and gleaming helms, began folding up the flag. They moved stiffly, mechanically, with faces like stone. When it had been folded just so, a Guard turned, and handed it to Sergei\u0027s father. He didn\u0027t look anything like Valentina had expected. He looked old and tired and sad, and very, very... human. He nodded, the Guard saluted, and returned to his place in the sea of black. He, too, took no notice of the rain.\n\nShe didn\u0027t react when the cannon fired, as ancient and scarred as the wall it was mounted on. Like the Guard\u0027s armor, it was an anachronism of another age. Then the band began, a somber patriotic hymn older than the Union its self.\n\nValentina just stood, seeing and not seeing. To say the launch was an unmitigated disaster was an injustice, yet better words simply were not there. Over nine thousand liters of hypergolic monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide had ignited on contact, creating a toxic cloud of gas that drifted with the shifting winds, poisoning the ground and sickening thousands. Or worse. Smoldering boosters touched off wildfires whenever they landed, many of which still burned days later, including a huge one in the forest near the cosmodrome that nearly required its evacuation.\n\nAnd of course, the rumors. They spread even faster than the fires, despite the Political Corps attempts to extinguish them. *That* engine was bad. No, it was the *other*. No, the fuel was contaminated. No, it was an O-ring in a solid booster. No, it was an inherent design flaw. An engineering failure, just waiting for a minor manufacturing defect to cause a catastrophic failure. And it had happened before. Twice. But high enough that it could be kept hidden. But Valentina knew there was no truth to them. She knew the real cause of the tragedy.\n\nIt was *her*. *She* had done this.\n\n*...Great power within you...* \n\nThe hymn ended, and on a barked command, the Guards lined the track to the vault in the wall of the Fortress. With more precise, mechanical movements, they crossed their gleaming halberds over the path. A drummer beat a solemn dirge, and the casket slowly made its way along the track, disappearing into the Wall. Another bark, and the massive marble capstone slid down to cover the vault, slamming home with a noise like\n\nthunder\n\ncracked outside, rattling the window of Valentina\u0027s simple room. With the coming of darkness, the gentle rain had become a raging storm. Lightning crashed, thunder boomed and cracked, the roaring wind blew great sheets of rain against the glass. It was as if the very world was aggrieved, and now crowed its condemnation.\n\n*Darkness...*\n\nShe sat at her small table before the window, staring out at the cosmodrome as the flashes lit up the structures like waiting specters. On the nightstand stood the little bottle. Darnitol, 75mg. Sleep. Sleep, without dreams. There would be no need for that tonight. Valentina knew sleep would come sooner or later, of that she was sure. And knew what it would bring with it.\n\n*Only here, in the darkness, can you hide...*\n\nShe pushed the voice away again. Rain flowed down the window pane, the world outside wavered and drifted. She hadn\u0027t cried for the Director. She hadn\u0027t even cried for herself. But now, for Sergei of all people, she wept bitterly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-02T05:49:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2016 05:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T02:35:32Z","Content":"And also, a very special thanks goes out to Ten Key, who\u0027s editing advice has been absolutely invaluable.

She was still seated at her small table, her face dry and crusted. She sat a moment longer, just breathing, letting her heartbeat return to normal.\n\nIt... it was... whatever it was, was gone now.\n\nShe stared out the window, waiting to feel... something, but nothing came. She thought she should feel angry, sad, helpless, but instead there was just... nothing. Numbness. Not knowing what else to do, she washed, and went downstairs.\n\nValentina took her seat next to Tercella and Dibella at their simple table. They stared at empty plates, eyes red and puffy, just nods to acknowledge her. For a long time, the three simply stared.\n\n\u0022What will become of us now?\u0022 Dibella finally said to no one in particular.\n\n\u0022Back to the factory,\u0022 Tercella said softly to her plate, \u0022this is the end. They cannot recover this, the program will be shut down.\u0022\n\nSilence stretched out, before Dibella addressed her own plate, \u0022They say the fires have finally gone out. Maybe the trains will run again soon.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, trains,\u0022 Tercella shrugged, \u0022maybe I can take a train back to Nusad. It was peaceful there. I did not mind the yaks.\u0022\n\nShe idly played with the edge of her plate, \u0022do you think they would give me papers to go to Nusad?\u0022\n\nA faucet over the sink, not quite turned off, dripped a slow staccato.\n\n*Drip...* \n\n*Drip...* \n\n*Drip...* \n\n\u0022They say there was a riot in Kernobyl,\u0022 Tercella told her plate.\n\n*Drip...* \n\n*Drip...* \n\n*Drip...* \n\n\u0022No, it was Kerbul,\u0022 said Dibella to the table.\n\n*Drip...* \n\n*Drip...* \n\n*Drip...* \n\nThe door suddenly opened, and Igor entered, looking grim. In his hand was a large sack. It looked like it contained something very heavy. He raised an accusing finger.\n\n\u0022Tercella... you are--\u0022\n\nShe threw her hands up, \u0022he asked for it, I swear! Practically begged! I did not know he was under age.\u0022\n\nThe other two turned to her, eyes wide.\n\nShe looked back and forth, grinning nervously, \u0022the rash, it should have cleared up by now...\u0022\n\nThey scooted their chairs away.\n\nTercella kept looking back and forth, pleading, \u0022I did give him his money back...\u0022\n\nThey scooted a little farther.\n\nShe slammed her hand on the table and glared at Igor, \u0022he should have told me he was allergic to latex!\u0022\n\nNow Igor\u0027s eyes widened.\n\nTercella leaned back in her seat with arms crossed, accepting defeat, \u0022That was the best tattoo I have ever done! And I did not even get paid.\u0022\n\nIgor opened his mouth.\n\nIgor closed his mouth.\n\nIgor put a hand to his face with a loud slap.\n\n\u0022No...\u0022 he said feebly, \u0022you are *it*.\u0022\n\nTercella blinked, \u0022..I...I am *what?*\u0022\n\n\u0022You go to space next.\u0022\n\n\u0022But, the fleet is grounded,\u0022 Dibella began, \u0022how--\u0022\n\n\u0022You can\u0027t put her in one of those things!\u0022 Valentina nearly screamed, \u0022she\u0027ll end up like Sergei!\u0022\n\n\u0022Arrangements,\u0022 Igor retrieved the item from the sack, and dropped it on the table with a loud *thud*, \u0022have been made.\u0022\n\nHis gaze lingered on Valentina for a moment, \u0022you *all* read.\u0022\n\nCuriosity cut through the numbness for a moment, and Valentina pulled the object over to look at it. It was an incredibly thick binder covered in foreign letters.\n\nEyes pinched, she tried to sound out the unfamiliar writing, \u0022l... la... laa... w-wooo...\u0022\n\n\u0022Bah!\u0022 She pushed it over to Dibella, \u0022I don\u0027t even know what language it is.

It\u0027s going to start any minute!\u0022 Dibella was practically dragging her by the hand up the crowded staircase, with Tercella snaking along behind.\n\n\u0022Who *are* (\u0027scuse me) all these (sorry) people?\u0022 Valentina grunted as she squeezed past.\n\n\u0022I haven\u0027t the slightest idea,\u0022 Dibella was somehow able to cut through the press with a few stern looks, \u0022I was afraid they\u0027d break the door down, so I just unlocked it. They seem to be keeping out of the offices.\u0022\n\n\u0022This is insane (hey that\u0027s my foot!)...\u0022 Tercella managed, \u0022wait, how is it (creep!) you have the key?\u0022\n\n\u0022My family owns this building..,\u0022 someone, who\u0027d been enjoying themselves a little *too* much, could be heard *hurk*ing in a corner... loudly, \u0022we... were planning to renovate it anyway.\u0022\n\nValentina followed along, still numb and quite bewildered by the whole thing. It had happened so *fast*. The grumbling and unrest had been stopped dead in its tracks and was now looking around, confused, wondering what the P\u0426TI\u0419 had just happened and not quite sure what to do with its self. All around her, people were wearing those odd but oh-so-practical blue canvas slacks, and here and there strange tall boots with narrow, tapered toes, and even some very silly looking hats that looked several sizes too big. Someone had said they were measured in liters. And leather. Lots and lots of black leather.\n\nShe understood the significance of the last few days, but still struggled to pull her mind out its fog and relate to it. The voice in her head ebbed and flowed, but was becoming ever more insistent, ever more convincing. She didn\u0027t understand what it wanted, or even what it offered, but every day it grew more difficult to resist.\n\n*Here, in the darkness, there is solace.*\n\n*Here, in the darkness, there is peace.* \n\n\u0022Ah! This is it! Keep together, now,\u0022 Dibella said, pulling Valentina from her fugue as they topped the last staircase and went through a door into the muggy late summer night. The din was even worse up here, the press of bodies tighter. Valentina felt a peculiar sensation in the air that made the fine hair on the back of her neck stand up, like the feeling just before a lightning storm. Dibella seemed to have a growing talent to get people to do what she wanted, including standing just to the side there, bit more, thank you very much, vacating a strip of valuable real estate for the trio. Valentina finally stepped up to the railing at the edge of the rooftop, and despite barely being able to see over it, her mouth fell open.\n\nOnce again, every scrap of space in Crimson Square was filled with people. Every rooftop, every window, every balcony. The clear night was filled with voices and rattail smoke and... something rather unpleasant. The Great Banner with its gold-edged crimson star festooned the buildings, but a new form hung now, too. A dark banner with an odd silver form that resembled a large insect. All around, colored spotlights waved back and forth, occasionally illuminating the drifting clouds of smoke.\n\nAnd dominating it all was the stage. Erected against the Wall of the Fortess, a respectful distance from the Mausoleum, it was completely unlike the stages built for the bureaucrats. It was chrome and aluminum and *more* lights, an oddly entrancing amalgam of black and shiny. In the center, near the back, was an enormous drum set, and behind that, the expansive granite flank of the Wall.\n\nValentina was mesmerized by the sheer *weirdness* of it all. Everywhere, people were talking or cheering or randomly *woo!*ing. She could feel... something, too. An odd tingly-twisty sensation at the base of her spine. It was like the anticipation of hunting... or being hunted... At least, she realized, she felt *something*.\n\nShe grew frustrated with trying to see over the wide concrete railing, and simply pulled herself up onto it as others were doing. The entire expanse of the Square now spread out before her. Here and there she could see pockets of crowd control police, and even *they* seemed more interested in the stage than in shoving people. Even the GUM store was--\n\nA sudden surge in the crowd drew her attention. The noise, the *noise!* She was used to rocket launches by now, but this... The stage suddenly lit up, and the crowd grew *louder*. On the Wall behind it was that odd insectoid shape. It took Valentina a moment to comprehend, but somehow they were projecting it there. The very Wall of the Fortress had just become the world\u0027s largest screen, dwarfing the monitors at mission control.\n\nThe noise of the crowd slowly gained form, and people pumped their fists in the air to the simple triplet rhythm.\n\n*Sol-pu-GIDS!*\n\n*Sol-pu-GIDS!*\n\n*Sol-pu-GIDS!*\n\n*Sol-pu-GIDS!*\n\nThe chant grew and grew, Valentina could only stare and gape. Even Dibella and Tercella had joined in. She tried to say something to them, but no sound came. She could feel her vocal cords move, but her own voice in her head had been stripped away like breath in a gale. *Every* voice in her head.\n\nAgainst possibility, the crowd grew even *louder*, and movement on the stage drew her attention. The projection on the Wall was now a video feed of the stage, so Valentina could very clearly make out... the four strangest Kerbals she had ever seen.\n\nThe first one came out and she... *was* it a she? Valentina had never seen long hair on a *he* before, but this one was short, had long blonde hair, and a terribly receding hairline. S/he waved to the crowd while bouncing around the stage like s/he had had entirely too much coffee, then took his/her place at the enormous drum set.\n\nThe next one came out and ...he? also had long hair, but black and curly. A smoldering rattail dangled from ...his? lips, ...he? wore dark tinted spectacles despite the night, and had, of all things, a top hat on. On a strap around ...his? neck was an instrument that looked something like a balalaika but with far too many strings.\n\nThen the third stepped out, and there was no doubting he was a he, because he had short cropped hair... and wore nothing but his underwear. The edge of Valentina\u0027s lip curled up in a sneer of confusion. Probably. He, too, had a not-balalaika-thing, with a much longer neck.\n\nThen the last one came up, and she was *definitely* a lady. She had on a colorful, flowey blouse with long flowey bits at the wrists, carried a stand microphone with another flowey bit tied to it, and, of course, long flowey hair. It was all very... flowey.\n\nShe stepped to the center of the stage, and the crowd surged yet again, then she said something into the microphone, and Valentina realized she was *not*, in fact, a lady. She was a... what was that word they were using? Dude? Well he looked like a lady. He said something again, making the crowd cheer. Valentina couldn\u0027t understand a single word. She thought it might be Kerblish, but between the roaring crowd, echoing speakers, and the gravelly voice, she couldn\u0027t tell.\n\nFlowey spoke again, the crowd surged louder than ever before, then dropped strangely quiet. Flowey began to *whistle...*\n\nJust a simple, eight-note melody. Across the crowd, first one... then another... and another... Tiny yellow lights burst into life. They spread across the sea of darkness like a sheath of light, swaying and pulsing, thousands upon thousands. It again took Valentina a moment to comprehend, people were raising and waving their rattail lighters. And, being Ussari, there were a *lot* of them.\n\nAfter a couple of bars, Tophat began playing ...his? not-balalaika. This, too, was unlike anything she had experienced. It was clear and crisp, with amplified sound that let the chords ring on. Flowey began to sing, and once more the crowd surged. Valentina still couldn\u0027t pick out any words, but people in the crowd certainly seemed to know them. The melody repeated, the cheers ebbed and flowed, and the flood of lights waved on.\n\nQuickly the sound built, then Underwear and Hairline joined in, and the sound became *complete*. The drums pounded in her chest like a heart, and the melodies surged in her nerves. The Sound enveloped her, washed over her, yet pulled at her too. It was a Power inexorable, flowing in her soul. All around people were waving and cheering, and Valentina caught a soundless *woo!* from her own lungs, too.\n\nThen, for a few bars, the sound shifted, and dipped. It hesitated for just a moment, then surged forth on its own, building and building, until every spotlight in the Square was on Tophat. He stepped into the light, and did something different, and suddenly that wondrous *thing* around his neck burst into a new sound. It swooped and dived, twirled and banked in the muggy night air. It spoke, it *sang*, it flowed all around the crowd. It *soared* like a thing alive. The Power fed from it, or it fed from the Power, and together they built into something incredible.\n\nNow *everyone* was singing. All across the Square, from every rooftop, every window, every balcony. The police down below stood with their arms around others in the crowd, swaying back and forth with them. They weren\u0027t singing the right words, they weren\u0027t even singing the *same* words, but it didn\u0027t matter, and Valentina finally realized she, too, was singing right along. It was silly, she knew that. It was absurd. It was all patently ridiculous.\n\nBut somehow, in this closeted nation of hyperbole, it was *glorious*.\n\nThe band played on until the first violet tendrils of dawn touched the sky, and all the time the voice whispered in Valentina\u0027s mind. But somewhere, on that august summer night, she found the strength to fight on a little more.\n\nValentina never did find out what that dude (looks like a lady) was singing about. She thought it had something to do with flatulence and coins.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-02T05:58:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2016 05:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T09:47:02Z","Content":"Okay then..."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T05:04:06Z","Content":"**Chapter 22: Winds of Change**\n\nA single drop of sweat rolled down Vladimir Kerman\u0027s temple. He gingerly nudged the controls. Steady, now. Veeeery steady. Even professionals get nervous, he reminded himself. And his was an unusually... unique profession. He watched the hand signals from the rigging foreman far below. Up now, gently. The enormous white form, still in its protective shrink wrap, slowly lifted from its transport cradle.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t that it was heavy, far from it, it was just *huge*. The crane had been built specifically for this task, one of only two in the world they said, but a load of this size was stretching its limits. Vladimir couldn\u0027t see a thing beneath it, he relied entirely on the foreman\u0027s guidance as he translated the structure back from the train car. There we go, down now... easy... eeeeaasy... there!\n\nThe foreman give him a \u0027thumbs up.\u0027 Vladimir put a hint of slack in the lines as the rigging crew busied themselves below, then leaned back and breathed a sigh of relief. He scratched his arm absently, and looked again at the waiting train. Just arrived from Kerbelsk this morning, a thin tendril of smoke still rose from the locomotive. One down, five more to go. Then another half dozen tomorrow. Then more trains carrying upper stages, spare parts, and support equipment.\n\nThe rigging foreman yelled something rude, and Vladimir jumped back to the present. The gleaming white form crept off toward the VAB on its hundred-wheeled power dolly, an empty one already pulling in to take its place. Vladimir slewed the gantry crane sideways towards the next rail car, and scratched at his arm again. Yep, it was going to be a long week. And the damn rash *still* hadn\u0027t cleared up yet.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nValentina watched from her window as the train was carefully unloaded. It had all happened so *fast*. She sighed, and looked again at the massive technical binder. She\u0027d manage to force her way to page 6 by pure will. Tercella was scheduled to fly soon, and Valentina had to trudge through it all first. Her red eyes wandered over the other books scattered across her small table, the bed, the floor, and a particularly obnoxious one still embedded in the drywall. It wasn\u0027t the technical stuff, that much she could grasp. It was this P\u0426TI\u0418S\u041AI *language*. She picked up a thin, colorful book.\n\nS... s... see Spot.\n\nSee Spot run.\n\nRun, Spot, run!\n\nYes, Spot, you\u0027d best *keep* running. This was asinine! If this was how the Foreigners learned their language, maybe the Imperium was right about them after all. She paused, and rubbed at the wide flat spot between her eyes. Everyone in the Union knew at least a few words of other languages. Nihaciman was very common, as was Abvonovichatkaderivokistani, and Dachlandish for the educated who\u0027d been to the University. Kr\u00FCnian was becoming more and more popular too, being so near the city. The construction foremen favored it, it was a good language for yelling at people in.\n\nKr\u00FCnian, now *there* was a logical, efficient language. No extra letters. Well, except for the really important sounds like Phlegm and Spittle. It must have given all its extra letters to Dachlandish, which seemed to delight in using as many letters as possible to represent a sound, but even that had a certain order to it. But the entire manual was in Kerblish. It... it was...\n\nIt was just chaos! Pure chaos! Valentina paused for a moment to thump her forehead against the table a few times. It felt better. Beyond a few words the fool language made no sense at all! There were rules, so many *rules*... but then there were more *exceptions* to the rules than rules themselves. *I* before *E* except after *C*? What lunacy was that?! Then they followed with a string of times when *I* did *not*, in fact, come after *E*. It was madness!\n\nAnd then there was the alphabet! Honestly, why couldn\u0027t people just use nice, normal, Kerillic letters? This Foreign writing system... *this* letter *looked* like *that* letter but it *sounded* like this *other* letter. And what was *this?* What *was* this? Was it a letter or did someone sneeze on the page?! Bah! Anyone who could master such insanity must have the patience of a rock.\n\nDibella might have been able to help. She could speak (and read!) a half dozen languages. What was it she had called herself? A polygamist? Polygon? Either way, the word sounded unpleasant, but it meant all this nonsense came easily to Dibella, she was already fluent in Kerblish. Studying with Dibella might help. There was just one problem.\n\nValentina yawned, wiggled her jaw back and forth. She tapped at her eardrums, then made slow \u0027ooo-wah\u0027 motions with her mouth. The Flight Surgeon had said that her hearing would return in time, to which she\u0027d said \u0027WHAT?\u0027 He then sternly cautioned her against doing anything that again, as continued exposure to excessive sound levels *would* eventually cause permanent hearing loss, to which she\u0027d also said \u0027WHAT?\u0027, at which point he\u0027d given up and just written her a note. As it was, \u0027WHAT?\u0027 had become somewhat of a defacto *lingua franca* around the Cosmodrome. Since neither of the two could hear, studying together wouldn\u0027t be much use.\n\nValentina grunted in frustration, sat back, and looked out towards the crews unloading the train. It had all happened so *fast*. A dozen complete launch vehicles manufactured by something called a \u0027corporation,\u0027 a few incomplete ones, and spare parts to build several more. Then more would be built here in the Union under something called a \u0027license.\u0027 The Kerbal Space Administration and the Imperious Academy of Sciences had signed an \u0027Agreement of Non-Competition and Preface to Cooperation.\u0027\n\nLiving deep in the taiga, only making the arduous trek into the village a few times a month, Valentina had been spared from much of the... politics regarding the Foreigners. Most people accepted what the Imperium\u0027s Ministry of Truth told them with an eagerness that had always disturbed her. In the taiga, perceptions were often skewed by clever things looking to make a meal of you. She\u0027d learned not to trust what the world \u0027told\u0027 her, to see the truth beyond it. The greater World beyond the forests told that the Foreigners were something lesser, something alien. If not outright enemies, they were bitter rivals to be kept at arm\u0027s length. And certainly never to be trusted. Shake their hand, until you found a stick.\n\nThen their rocket had disintegrated, and Edmund Kerman had been fished barely alive from the sea. For a fleeting moment, there was... something, just out of reach. Then the propaganda had returned as strong as ever, and the Foreigners were once again something to be overcome. An obstacle to be surmounted at any cost.\n\nAnd then... Sergei. Valentina looked down at the books surrounding her. Not long ago, *any* Foreign goods except those from a few trusted allies were strictly forbidden, and now the Union its self was buying *rockets* from them. It was just so... logical.\n\nThe main engines of the Stolitsa launch vehicle were fatally flawed, and finding that flaw had turned up a litany of others that simply hadn\u0027t failed *yet*. A new launcher, new engines, everything would have to be redesigned from the ground up. It would take years, *if* nothing went wrong. Years that would allow the KSA complete domination of space, with any remaining niches filled by the more humble space programs of the world. The embarrassment to the Imperium, especially after such fanfare... well, it would be difficult to put words to. The Imperium was known to be boisterous, idealistic, and above all, proud. Buying Foreign rockets to maintain the space program, loosing a little face to save more in the long run... it was a cool, calculated, rational decision.\n\nThe Imperium simply didn\u0027t *do* that!\n\nWhat struck her the most as odd, however, was that this \u0027Layland Heavy Industries\u0027 had over a dozen rocket stages just sitting around waiting to be sold in the first place. She knew the Foreigner\u0027s economic system was quite different. Maybe it was normal for them to have lots of *stuff* just sitting around, waiting to be sold, if the sudden influx of *other* goods was any indication. People in Kermangrad bustled about, now, in their blue jeans and yak-kid boots, eating their McKerbal\u0027s\u2122, so of course they wouldn\u0027t wonder about where the rockets came from. Everything had changed, and yet, nothing had. It was all very... convenient.\n\nAnd familiar. She had experienced it enough to see the pattern. Valentina knew the Imperium was not the Great Advocate it made its self out to be, but such was just life. Such was the Agreement. Challenge the Imperium and, well, that\u0027s how you got the Troubles. She hated politics, *hated* them. But she knew *this* darkness. She could see into this forest, and in the shadows, catch a glimpse of a predator staring back at her.\n\nValentina sighed once more, rubbing at her tired eyes. Maybe she was just overthinking it all. Maybe it all *was* a turn in a positive direction. But either way, it wasn\u0027t helping her get through the manual. With a groan, she picked up another reader. Well, on the bright side, at least it wasn\u0027t Ceriman. With that one, blink your right eye instead of your left and \u0027hi, how are you?\u0027 became \u0027your mother has unnatural relations with farm animals and I will see you dead before the sun sets!\u0027 And *their* writing system seemed to consist almost entirely of various smiley faces. It was no wonder those people were always at war.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-02T06:01:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2016 06:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**\n  \nAbvonovichatkaderivokistan really needs a shorter name =\\"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T05:09:35Z","Content":"Moar!"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T10:24:30Z","Content":"Loved the rock concert - could almost feel that bass through the screen.
