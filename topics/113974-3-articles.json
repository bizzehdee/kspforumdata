Anyone able to beg, borrow or steal the necessary clearance was crammed into the mission control room, and the warm press of bodies was made that much worse by the thick smell of wet paint and fresh plaster. Construction workers still scurried back and forth, finishing the last-minute renovations to the already brand new building. Few of the spectators noticed the smears and streaks on their fine suits or uniforms, their eyes drawn instead to the far wall, where the three largest video screens ever built stood ready to display telemetry, orbital track, and a live telephoto video feed from the roof of the VAB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond the massive window panes, \u003Cem\u003EEmpress Alexandra I\u003C/em\u003E stood ready on the launch pad, the mirror-polished aluminum skin of her fuel tanks glinting in the sun. Except for the oxium tank in the lower half, where frost from the cryogenic liquid stubbornly covered the \u0022UNION\u0022 of \u0022USSARI UNION\u0022 painted in large crimson Kerillic letters down its length. The white paint on her six solid rocket boosters and protective nosecone had been buffed and waxed like a fine automobile. Even the launch towers had been cleaned and painted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurrounding this, all over the grounds of the cosmodrome, were people by the \u003Cem\u003Ethousands\u003C/em\u003E. From all over they had come, or been dragged. Every State in the Union, every ally, every rival. Reporters and correspondents and respected dignitaries, bringing all manner of cameras, now pointed at the launch pad. This, security had expected. But they had not anticipated the \u003Cem\u003Epeople\u003C/em\u003E. Entire towns nearby had been virtually emptied, and descended on the grounds of their own volition. The police and security forces struggled to maintain some kind of order. Controlling crowds was something they had more than a little experience with, yet the sheer numbers threatened to just sweep them away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Crimson Square, the bleachers that had been erected lay crumpled and smashed in a back alley. People filled every square centimeter of the huge space. They hung from light poles, crowded balconies and rooftops, and had knocked over no less than a dozen broadcast antennas trying to get a view of the rocket as it would rise over the Dome of the Imperium. Here, the police had utterly given up on controlling the crowd, and had instead retreated within the ancient walls of the Fortress, hoping they would offer the same protection from this horde as they had in ages past. The Imperial Guards maintained a tenuous balance at the gates, some terrified they might actually have to use their anachronistic ceremonial polearms in ways they\u0027d never learned. In the days to come, statisticians around the world would try and fail to arrive at an accurate count on the amount of people in this one place. They all agreed, however, that the weight of the gathering transcended any mere number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll across the expansive nation, from Kerbelsk to Kerliningrad, from the desert to the tundra, everyone within a day\u0027s hard travel of a screen was watching. Whether they wanted to or not. Even beyond the cloistered Union, in hovels and palaces, factories and farms. A sold-out Solpugids concert at Madison Tetrahedron Garden was preempted, a cadre of ranch-hands in east Exast gathered around a fuzzy, barely-working box with an antenna made from a pair of old spurs, the crew of a fishing boat in the middle of the Great Southern Sea listened intently to their radio, the patrons of a tiki bar on Pogagalas stopped their banter, the fighting in Cerima even paused for a few, precious moments, and the transmitter on a brand-new communications satellite burned out from the load. And of course, Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra II watched from her gilded cage, coolly aware of the significance of this rocket named for her predecessor. Indeed, the world was watching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in the middle of it all, surrounded by an odd little pocket of space in the crowded Mission Control room, stood Valentina Kerman, fidgeting anxiously with a pencil. Whether it was from the look in her eyes, the scowl on her face, or... something else, no one came near. If she moved, the pocket moved with her, like fish evading a predator. Despite her stature, she alone had a perfect view of both the window and monitors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSergei.

A momentary puff of smoke in the monitor, then a cascade of fire. So much fire. Searing, raging, tearing. Beyond the window, the six mighty solid rocket boosters, now freed from their charge, bloomed into a death-flower that mocked in its beauty. In the crowded mission control room, and the grounds beyond, not a sound was made.

It slid from the top of Valentina\u0027s wide-brimmed hat, dripping down the back of her neck, but she took no notice. She stood stiffly, motionlessly, fingertips touched lightly to the edge of that wide brim. She stood in a line with others, but took no notice of them, either. Once again, Crimson Square was filled with people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a platform before her, rested the coffin. It was more of a formality, really. The capsule had disintegrated instantly, debris scattered over hundreds of square kilometers. They had found just enough to be... sure. It was empty, except for the medal. Hero of the Ussari Union. Awarded on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bureaucrat had just finished his speech, as a soldier held an umbrella over him. Some nonsense about duty and courage. At a command, the cadre of Imperial Guard surrounding the coffin, with their mirror-polished breastplates and gleaming helms, began folding up the flag. They moved stiffly, mechanically, with faces like stone. When it had been folded just so, a Guard turned, and handed it to Sergei\u0027s father. He didn\u0027t look anything like Valentina had expected. He looked old and tired and sad, and very, very... human. He nodded, the Guard saluted, and returned to his place in the sea of black. He, too, took no notice of the rain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u0027t react when the cannon fired, as ancient and scarred as the wall it was mounted on.

To say the launch was an unmitigated disaster was an injustice, yet better words simply were not there. Over nine thousand liters of hypergolic monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide had ignited on contact, creating a toxic cloud of gas that drifted with the shifting winds, poisoning the ground and sickening thousands. Or worse. Smoldering boosters touched off wildfires whenever they landed, many of which still burned days later, including a huge one in the forest near the cosmodrome that nearly required its evacuation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, the rumors.

An engineering failure, just waiting for a minor manufacturing defect to cause a catastrophic failure. And it had happened before. Twice. But high enough that it could be kept hidden.

With more precise, mechanical movements, they crossed their gleaming halberds over the path.

It had happened so \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E. The grumbling and unrest had been stopped dead in its tracks and was now looking around, confused, wondering what the P\u0426TI\u0419\u00A0had just happened and not quite sure what to do with its self. All around her, people were wearing those odd but oh-so-practical blue canvas slacks, and here and there strange tall boots with narrow, tapered toes, and even some very silly looking hats that looked several sizes too big. Someone had said they were measured in liters. And leather. Lots and lots of black leather.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe understood the significance of the last few days, but still struggled to pull her mind out its fog and relate to it. The voice in her head ebbed and flowed, but was becoming ever more insistent, ever more convincing. She didn\u0027t understand what it wanted, or even what it offered, but every day it grew more difficult to resist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EHere, in the darkness, there is solace.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EHere, in the darkness, there is peace. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah! This is it! Keep together, now,\u0022 Dibella said, pulling Valentina from her fugue as they topped the last staircase and went through a door into the muggy late summer night. The din was even worse up here, the press of bodies tighter. Valentina felt a peculiar sensation in the air that made the fine hair on the back of her neck stand up, like the feeling just before a lightning storm. Dibella seemed to have a growing talent to get people to do what she wanted, including standing just to the side there, bit more, thank you very much, vacating a strip of valuable real estate for the trio. Valentina finally stepped up to the railing at the edge of the rooftop, and despite barely being able to see over it, her mouth fell open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, every scrap of space in Crimson Square was filled with people. Every rooftop, every window, every balcony. The clear night was filled with voices and rattail smoke and... something rather unpleasant. The Great Banner with its gold-edged crimson star festooned the buildings, but a new form hung now, too. A dark banner with an odd silver form that resembled a large insect. All around, colored spotlights waved back and forth, occasionally illuminating the drifting clouds of smoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd dominating it all was the stage. Erected against the Wall of the Fortess, a respectful distance from the Mausoleum, it was completely unlike the stages built for the bureaucrats. It was chrome and aluminum and \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E lights, an oddly entrancing amalgam of black and shiny. In the center, near the back, was an enormous drum set, and behind that, the expansive granite flank of the Wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina was mesmerized by the sheer \u003Cem\u003Eweirdness\u003C/em\u003E of it all. Everywhere, people were talking or cheering or randomly \u003Cem\u003Ewoo!\u003C/em\u003Eing. She could feel... something, too. An odd tingly-twisty sensation at the base of her spine. It was like the anticipation of hunting... or being hunted... At least, she realized, she felt \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe grew frustrated with trying to see over the wide concrete railing, and simply pulled herself up onto it as others were doing. The entire expanse of the Square now spread out before her. Here and there she could see pockets of crowd control police, and even \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E seemed more interested in the stage than in shoving people. Even the GUM store was--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden surge in the crowd drew her attention. The noise, the\u003Cem\u003E noise!\u003C/em\u003E She was used to rocket launches by now, but this... The stage suddenly lit up, and the crowd grew \u003Cem\u003Elouder\u003C/em\u003E. On the Wall behind it was that odd insectoid shape. It took Valentina a moment to comprehend, but somehow they were projecting it there. The very Wall of the Fortress had just become the world\u0027s largest screen, dwarfing the monitors at mission control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe noise of the crowd slowly gained form, and people pumped their fists in the air to the simple triplet rhythm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESol-pu-GIDS!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESol-pu-GIDS!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESol-pu-GIDS!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESol-pu-GIDS!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe chant grew and grew, Valentina could only stare and gape. Even Dibella and Tercella had joined in. She tried to say something to them, but no sound came. She could feel her vocal cords move, but her own voice in her head had been stripped away like breath in a gale. \u003Cem\u003EEvery\u003C/em\u003E voice in her head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgainst possibility, the crowd grew even \u003Cem\u003Elouder\u003C/em\u003E, and movement on the stage drew her attention. The projection on the Wall was now a video feed of the stage, so Valentina could very clearly make out... the four strangest Kerbals she had ever seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first one came out and she... \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E it a she? Valentina had never seen long hair on a \u003Cem\u003Ehe\u003C/em\u003E before, but this one was short, had long blonde hair, and a terribly receding hairline. S/he waved to the crowd while bouncing around the stage like s/he had had entirely too much coffee, then took his/her place at the enormous drum set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next one came out and ...he? also had long hair, but black and curly. A smoldering rattail dangled from ...his? lips, ...he? wore dark tinted spectacles despite the night, and had, of all things, a top hat on. On a strap around ...his? neck was an instrument that looked something like a balalaika but with far too many strings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the third stepped out, and there was no doubting he was a he, because he had short cropped hair... and wore nothing but his underwear. The edge of Valentina\u0027s lip curled up in a sneer of confusion. Probably. He, too, had a not-balalaika-thing, with a much longer neck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the last one came up, and she was \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E a lady. She had on a colorful, flowey blouse with long flowey bits at the wrists, carried a stand microphone with another flowey bit tied to it, and, of course, long flowey hair. It was all very... flowey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stepped to the center of the stage, and the crowd surged yet again, then she said something into the microphone, and Valentina realized she was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E, in fact, a lady. She was a... what was that word they were using? Dude? Well he looked like a lady. He said something again, making the crowd cheer. Valentina couldn\u0027t understand a single word. She thought it might be Kerblish, but between the roaring crowd, echoing speakers, and the gravelly voice, she couldn\u0027t tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlowey spoke again, the crowd surged louder than ever before, then dropped strangely quiet. Flowey began to\u003Cem\u003E whistle...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a simple, eight-note melody. Across the crowd, first one... then another... and another... Tiny yellow lights burst into life. They spread across the sea of darkness like a sheath of light, swaying and pulsing, thousands upon thousands. It again took Valentina a moment to comprehend, people were raising and waving their rattail lighters. And, being Ussari, there were a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a couple of bars, Tophat began playing ...his? not-balalaika. This, too, was unlike anything she had experienced. It was clear and crisp, with amplified sound that let the chords ring on. Flowey began to sing, and once more the crowd surged. Valentina still couldn\u0027t pick out any words, but people in the crowd certainly seemed to know them. The melody repeated, the cheers ebbed and flowed, and the flood of lights waved on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuickly the sound built, then Underwear and Hairline joined in, and the sound became \u003Cem\u003Ecomplete\u003C/em\u003E. The drums pounded in her chest like a heart, and the melodies surged in her nerves. The Sound enveloped her, washed over her, yet pulled at her too. It was a Power inexorable, flowing in her soul. All around people were waving and cheering, and Valentina caught a soundless \u003Cem\u003Ewoo!\u003C/em\u003E from her own lungs, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, for a few bars, the sound shifted, and dipped. It hesitated for just a moment, then surged forth on its own, building and building, until every spotlight in the Square was on Tophat. He stepped into the light, and did something different, and suddenly that wondrous \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E around his neck burst into a new sound. It swooped and dived, twirled and banked in the muggy night air. It spoke, it \u003Cem\u003Esang\u003C/em\u003E, it flowed all around the crowd. It \u003Cem\u003Esoared\u003C/em\u003E like a thing alive. The Power fed from it, or it fed from the Power, and together they built into something incredible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E was singing. All across the Square, from every rooftop, every window, every balcony. The police down below stood with their arms around others in the crowd, swaying back and forth with them. They weren\u0027t singing the right words, they weren\u0027t even singing the \u003Cem\u003Esame\u003C/em\u003E words, but it didn\u0027t matter, and Valentina finally realized she, too, was singing right along. It was silly, she knew that. It was absurd. It was all patently ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut somehow, in this closeted nation of hyperbole, it was \u003Cem\u003Eglorious\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe band played on until the first violet tendrils of dawn touched the sky, and all the time the voice whispered in Valentina\u0027s mind. But somewhere, on that august summer night, she found the strength to fight on a little more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina never did find out what that dude (looks like a lady) was singing about.

He gingerly nudged the controls. Steady, now. Veeeery steady. Even professionals get nervous, he reminded himself. And his was an unusually... unique profession. He watched the hand signals from the rigging foreman far below. Up now, gently. The enormous white form, still in its protective shrink wrap, slowly lifted from its transport cradle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t that it was heavy, far from it, it was just \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E. The crane had been built specifically for this task, one of only two in the world they said, but a load of this size was stretching its limits. Vladimir couldn\u0027t see a thing beneath it, he relied entirely on the foreman\u0027s guidance as he translated the structure back from the train car. There we go, down now... easy... eeeeaasy... there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe foreman give him a \u0027thumbs up.\u0027 Vladimir put a hint of slack in the lines as the rigging crew busied themselves below, then leaned back and breathed a sigh of relief. He scratched his arm absently, and looked again at the waiting train. Just arrived from Kerbelsk this morning, a thin tendril of smoke still rose from the locomotive. One down, five more to go. Then another half dozen tomorrow. Then more trains carrying upper stages, spare parts, and support equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rigging foreman yelled something rude, and Vladimir jumped back to the present. The gleaming white form crept off toward the VAB on its hundred-wheeled power dolly, an empty one already pulling in to take its place. Vladimir slewed the gantry crane sideways towards the next rail car, and scratched at his arm again. Yep, it was going to be a long week. And the damn rash \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E hadn\u0027t cleared up yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina watched from her window as the train was carefully unloaded.

Tercella was scheduled to fly soon, and Valentina had to trudge through it all first. Her red eyes wandered over the other books scattered across her small table, the bed, the floor, and a particularly obnoxious one still embedded in the drywall. It wasn\u0027t the technical stuff, that much she could grasp. It was this P\u0426TI\u0418S\u041AI\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elanguage\u003C/em\u003E.

This was asinine! If this was how the Foreigners learned their language, maybe the Imperium was right about them after all. She paused, and rubbed at the wide flat spot between her eyes. Everyone in the Union knew at least a few words of other languages. Nihaciman was very common, as was \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAbvonovichatkaderivokistani\u003C/span\u003E, and Dachlandish for the educated who\u0027d been to the University.

No extra letters. Well, except for the really important sounds like Phlegm and Spittle. It must have given all its extra letters to Dachlandish, which seemed to delight in using as many letters as possible to represent a sound, but even that had a certain order to it. But the entire manual was in Kerblish. It... it was...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was just chaos! Pure chaos! Valentina paused for a moment to thump her forehead against the table a few times. It felt better. Beyond a few words the fool language made no sense at all! There were rules, so many \u003Cem\u003Erules\u003C/em\u003E... but then there were more \u003Cem\u003Eexceptions\u003C/em\u003E to the rules than rules themselves. \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E before \u003Cem\u003EE\u003C/em\u003E except after \u003Cem\u003EC\u003C/em\u003E? What lunacy was that?! Then they followed with a string of times when \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E did \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E, in fact, come after \u003Cem\u003EE\u003C/em\u003E. It was madness!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there was the alphabet! Honestly, why couldn\u0027t people just use nice, normal, Kerillic letters? This Foreign writing system... \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E letter \u003Cem\u003Elooked\u003C/em\u003E like \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E letter but it \u003Cem\u003Esounded\u003C/em\u003E like this \u003Cem\u003Eother \u003C/em\u003Eletter. And what was \u003Cem\u003Ethis?\u003C/em\u003E What \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E this? Was it a letter or did someone sneeze on the page?! Bah! Anyone who could master such insanity must have the patience of a rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella might have been able to help. She could speak (and read!) a half dozen languages. What was it she had called herself? A polygamist? Polygon? Either way, the word sounded unpleasant, but it meant all this nonsense came easily to Dibella, she was already fluent in Kerblish. Studying with Dibella might help. There was just one problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina yawned, wiggled her jaw back and forth. She tapped at her eardrums, then made slow \u0027ooo-wah\u0027 motions with her mouth. The Flight Surgeon had said that her hearing would return in time, to which she\u0027d said \u0027WHAT?\u0027 He then sternly cautioned her against doing anything that again, as continued exposure to excessive sound levels \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E eventually cause permanent hearing loss, to which she\u0027d also said \u0027WHAT?\u0027, at which point he\u0027d given up and just written her a note. As it was, \u0027WHAT?\u0027 had become somewhat of a defacto \u003Cem\u003Elingua franca\u003C/em\u003E around the Cosmodrome. Since neither of the two could hear, studying together wouldn\u0027t be much use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina grunted in frustration, sat back, and looked out towards the crews unloading the train. It had all happened so \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E. A dozen complete launch vehicles manufactured by something called a \u0027corporation,\u0027 a few incomplete ones, and spare parts to build several more. Then more would be built here in the Union under something called a \u0027license.\u0027 The Kerbal Space Administration and the Imperious Academy of Sciences had signed an \u0027Agreement of Non-Competition and Preface to Cooperation.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiving deep in the taiga, only making the arduous trek into the village a few times a month, Valentina had been spared from much of the... politics regarding the Foreigners. Most people accepted what the Imperium\u0027s Ministry of Truth told them with an eagerness that had always disturbed her. In the taiga, perceptions were often skewed by clever things looking to make a meal of you. She\u0027d learned not to trust what the world \u0027told\u0027 her, to see the truth beyond it. The greater World beyond the forests told that the Foreigners were something lesser, something alien. If not outright enemies, they were bitter rivals to be kept at arm\u0027s length. And certainly never to be trusted. Shake their hand, until you found a stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen their rocket had disintegrated, and Edmund Kerman had been fished barely alive from the sea. For a fleeting moment, there was... something, just out of reach. Then the propaganda had returned as strong as ever, and the Foreigners were once again something to be overcome. An obstacle to be surmounted at any cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then... Sergei. Valentina looked down at the books surrounding her. Not long ago, \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E Foreign goods except those from a few trusted allies were strictly forbidden, and now the Union its self was buying \u003Cem\u003Erockets\u003C/em\u003E from them. It was just so... logical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main engines of the Stolitsa launch vehicle were fatally flawed, and finding that flaw had turned up a litany of others that simply hadn\u0027t failed \u003Cem\u003Eyet\u003C/em\u003E. A new launcher, new engines, everything would have to be redesigned from the ground up. It would take years, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E nothing went wrong. Years that would allow the KSA complete domination of space, with any remaining niches filled by the more humble space programs of the world. The embarrassment to the Imperium, especially after such fanfare... well, it would be difficult to put words to. The Imperium was known to be boisterous, idealistic, and above all, proud. Buying Foreign rockets to maintain the space program, loosing a little face to save more in the long run... it was a cool, calculated, rational decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Imperium simply didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat struck her the most as odd, however, was that this \u0027Layland Heavy Industries\u0027 had over a dozen rocket stages just sitting around waiting to be sold in the first place. She knew the Foreigner\u0027s economic system was quite different. Maybe it was normal for them to have lots of \u003Cem\u003Estuff\u003C/em\u003E just sitting around, waiting to be sold, if the sudden influx of \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E goods was any indication. People in Kermangrad bustled about, now, in their blue jeans and yak-kid boots, eating their McKerbal\u0027s\u2122, so of course they wouldn\u0027t wonder about where the rockets came from. Everything had changed, and yet, nothing had. It was all very... convenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd familiar. She had experienced it enough to see the pattern. Valentina knew the Imperium was not the Great Advocate it made its self out to be, but such was just life. Such was the Agreement. Challenge the Imperium and, well, that\u0027s how you got the Troubles. She hated politics, \u003Cem\u003Ehated\u003C/em\u003E them. But she knew \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E darkness. She could see into this forest, and in the shadows, catch a glimpse of a predator staring back at her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sighed once more, rubbing at her tired eyes. Maybe she was just overthinking it all. Maybe it all \u003Cem\u003Ewas \u003C/em\u003Ea turn in a positive direction. But either way, it wasn\u0027t helping her get through the manual. With a groan, she picked up another reader. Well, on the bright side, at least it wasn\u0027t Ceriman. With that one, blink your right eye instead of your left and \u0027hi, how are you?\u0027 became \u0027your mother has unnatural relations with farm animals and I will see you dead before the sun sets!\u0027 And \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E writing system seemed to consist almost entirely of various smiley faces.
