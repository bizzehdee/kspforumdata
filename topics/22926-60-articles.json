Like the LLL prefix, the current structure is a relic of previous versions of KSP and their part loaders. MODEL{} initally wasn\u0027t very reliable at all and tended to need to load cross-referenced models and textures in sequential load order. It\u0027s a lot more reliable now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe careful with the textures though.
