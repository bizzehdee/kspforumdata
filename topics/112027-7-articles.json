(August 22, 2021)","CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T04:37:37Z","PageNum":7,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:51:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I did some thermal testing with a multi-nuke tug, it seems to me that the radiators don\u0027t cool the entire craft at once, just the hottest part. If you have multiple equally hot parts the radiators cycle through them. The number to watch in the action menu is \u0022Internal Flux\u0022, that\u0027s where the heat flow into the rads (and out of parts being drawn from by rads) is shown. It also looks like the rads quickly reach the temperature of the hottest part on the vessel, which is OK as they have a high heat tolerance.\n\nLooks like the \u0022kick threshold\u0022 for the radiators that Darth Lazarus mentioned is per-part, then. The radiator sees all parts of the vessel, but chooses to take heat only from those that exceed the threshold.\n\nThat of course leads to the question whether or not there is any priority order to the parts in a vessel... for example if you have two 8 MW heat sources, two more parts which are heated up by conduction from those heat sources, and one 12.5 MW radiator that manages the entire vessel, which parts get cooled first? Does the capacity get spread evenly all four parts, leaving both heat sources partially cooled but also protecting the ship? Does it cool each part it finds above the threshold by as much as it needs and then proceeds to the next, which could lead to one heat source fully cooled and the other only half? Does it intelligently identify heat producing parts to cool first, or does it just crawl the Unity part tree and grab whatever heat it finds in that exact order? Perhaps something else entirely? And if there are two parts above the threshold, but one is more above than the other, does the radiator take from both or only from the one with the highest temperature?\n\nThe vessel-global heat mitigation kind of removes a potential gameplay dimension... sure, it is convenient when you don\u0027t have to think about where to put the radiators, but at the same time, it means that radiators are \u0022boring\u0022 parts. They have no gameplay in them. People just throw one on wherever because the LV-N forces them to, not because it\u0027s actually interesting to put radiators on spaceships. For some parts, like solar panels, that level of abstraction is okay. For other parts, like engines, not so much. You do want people to think at least a little about fuel flow in constructing their rockets, because it makes things more interesting. Similarly, if radiators are not vessel-global, then people will need to become invested in how heat flows through their vessel, and plan accordingly. The question is, should radiators be abstracted like solar panels, or not?\n\nI suppose Nertea is going to have to decide (and possibly poll the players) on whether to go forward with radiators localized as they currently are for interesting gameplay reasons, or with vessel-global radiators like the stock models for convenience reasons. You can\u0027t really have both, they\u0027ll be mutually exclusive.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Balance is going to be problematic. Medium radiator pulls 12500, costs 2250 and has a mass of 0.25. That\u0027s twice the heat dissipation for 1/10 the cost and 1/4 the mass of my largest radiator. Grr....\n\nCareful, that is not heat dissipation, that\u0027s just transfer... and in the stock radiator language, \u0027transfer\u0027 just means \u0027ability to equalize temperature\u0027. The stock radiators have a harder time dissipating heat than your radiators, because they cannot exceed the hottest part\u0027s heat. And since the ability to reject heat is directly related (in a very much exponential relationship) to radiator temperature, that likely means your radiators will have noticably higher heat rejection ability per surface area. Mass can be tuned accordingly... but I also agree to some extend: the stock radiators seem a little bit too much a minimum-footprint band-aid in response to the LV-N heat, and not really an attempt to have an interesting gameplay system (which was probably beyond scope of what RoverDude was trying/allowed to do here). Just like the LV-N heating, isolated on its own, was a poorly thought-out thing. It amused a select few users with the engineering challenge, but only because they chose to intentionally trawl the part catalog for things with conveniently the right stats to emulate the gameplay system that Squad failed to properly include.\n\nYou know, the more I turn this over in my head and add more and more edits to this post, the less impressed I am with the stock radiators. Not to lessen Roverdude\u0027s effort and good intentions, but it just feels... I dunno. Like Squad hasn\u0027t really made their minds up on what to do with this super-complex thermodynamics simulation they added. First, 1.0 creates a problem with no gameplay mechanic to properly address; then, 1.0.3 adds a solution that\u0027s laid out to have as little gameplay in it as possible. It kind of doesn\u0027t make much of a difference to a LV-N that doesn\u0027t produce any heat in the first place. The amount of design consideration the player needs to put into their vessel is hardly different (and that\u0027s a lot of development effort indeed spent just to arrive back at this point!). And beyond the LV-N, the radiators are pretty much just cosmetic. Which is okay, there are other parts like that in KSP, and they\u0027re popular enough among creative builders. But all the same it\u0027s wasted potential. They could be looking interesting *and* have interesting gameplay in them. Heat Control proves that handily, doesn\u0027t it? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T14:23:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:50:38Z","Content":"First thought: hide stock radiators.\n\nHC radiators can heat up more than parent part, which means they pump heat carrier through a circuit with pressure difference, like fridges.

This is one of the many reasons the Nertea Suite of mods remains at the top of my must-have list.\n\nSorry Cap\u0027n, but you got something wrong there... :s\n\nNear Future as a whole has always been rather more \u0022stockalike\u0022 than not, despite not super-obviously broadcasting it via the name. All the engines in NF Propulsion are balanced with an eye towards stock engines, particularly the LV-N and the Dawn ion engine. All the reactors in NF Electrical are balanced with an eye towards not redefining what 1 Ec means, so that they mesh well with stock. Everything Near Future does is meant to be done completely neutral towards a stock KSP instance. It\u0027s only when stock KSP makes completely bonkers changes, like buffing the ion engine by 800% out of the blue, that Nertea needs to go and step in with a tweak patch to prevent that change from destroying the mod completely. That\u0027s also a result to being closely stock-aligned: the mods are very sensitive to what Squad is doing.\n\nThese radiators have the potential to be another \u0022bonkers\u0022 change that\u0027s really difficult to adjust to without a patch that nerfs them massively. See, the mass of the NF and HeatControl radiators isn\u0027t arbitrary; they have the mass they do because the NF Electrical reactors are tuned to specific performance targets, which include enough radiator mass to keep them at nominal temperature. If you suddenly have radiators available which weigh a quarter or even less, then that upsets the balance of the reactors, and that in turn upsets the balance of the entirety of NF Propulsion, because those engines are statted up with the reactors as reference power sources...\n\nSo nerfing the stock radiators isn\u0027t really a thing to be happy about. But it may be the necessary to keep Heat Control from losing all relevancy and NF Electrical from downright *breaking*. More testing is needed, though. We\u0027re going to need a  1.0.3 1.0.4 compatible test build so we can judge how well stock radiators handle Near Future items.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind, for instance, is that NF Electrical reactors rely on being kept rather very cool. If the stock radiators only match the hot part\u0027s temperature, then they may be unable to keep a reactor below nominal temperature simply by virtue of the radiator not having any significant radiating ability at those temperatures. To reject a lot of heat, you really want them to get extremely hot, that\u0027s how blackbody radiation works. On the other hand, of course, it appears that you can easily mount 4-8 times the amount of radiator area for less mass and even less cost, so maybe what temperature can\u0027t do, sheer area might. That\u0027s why we need testing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T18:36:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:41:31Z","Content":"Well hmm, I gotta think about all of this quite heavily.

The plus side is that if you continue with HC, it would be the stock radiators that need adjusting, not yours."},{"CreatedByName":"billkerbinsky","CreatedById":136995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:05:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So nerfing the stock radiators isn\u0027t really a thing to be happy about. But it may be the necessary to keep Heat Control from losing all relevancy and NF Electrical from downright *breaking*. More testing is needed, though. We\u0027re going to need a  1.0.3 1.0.4 compatible test build so we can judge how well stock radiators handle Near Future items.\n\nIn a little bit of play with 1.0.3 and current HC bits last night it looked like the largest HC radiator (and, well, probably the rest of them, but it\u0027s the only one I tried) at the very least needs a tweak to let the radiator skin heat up and start radiating - the radiator core temperature went way up, but the skin didn\u0027t and they ended up exploding."},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:11:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well hmm, I gotta think about all of this quite heavily.
