VAB (and analysis)","CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-22T20:36:12Z","PageNum":2,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T15:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for my thoughts on what of science we have seen in general, in short I think some of it is incredibly promising, some of it is more mediocre. The presentation shows that youll need to unlock the top right node to move on to the next tier, which seems interesting, I like how that changes how you move through the tech tree. Also xenon is unlocked way earlier in the tech tree which is good. The science parts seem like a mixed bag, to define what I think makes a good science part, using it must actively change your flight profile. The ones earlier on the tech tree can be simple as their point can be there just to introduce concepts to people, the latter ones should be more complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start off with what I think is by far the best science part we have seen, its the diving bell. Having to send a crewed diving bell to the bottom of Eve\u0027s oceans then return it sounds like an incredibly interesting and difficult challenge, especially if we get ballasts to go alongside it. Since the diving bell probably has to be crewed, if you want to save your kerbals this leads to interesting engineering challenges (such as returning the crew in the diving bell to your rocket) that sound really fun to plan around. More science parts like this that promote you to do novel, interesting, and challenging missions would be very fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what I think is the worst part, its the large purple one thats likely unlocked by orbital report (Science Sr). The craft we see the Science Sr on doesnt seem to have any power generation, likely its only thing is just it needs to be in orbit and generates over time. For the last science part we unlock, that is incredibly simple and boring. I\u0027d be fine with a single part that is just like this that way it forces you to stay in orbit for crafts instead of just flybys, but having multiple parts whose only thing is that just seems unneeded and boring.\u00A0 Science Sr. seems to need a crew requirement as well, but with no life support that isnt really all that interesting of a challenge, its only in orbit so its not particularly hard to return those crew. I think an easy way to make Science Sr. more interesting would be to give it large amounts of EC consumption, making you have to put like two nuclear reactors or lots of solar panels on your craft actively changes how you design your craft and makes putting it on more interesting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s definitely ways to add more parts that are more similar to the diving bell, and I hope they do. I think the grand slam passive seismometer from ksp1 was honestly pretty well designed, and something like that in ksp2 would be great. If I were to suggest how to make that part better for ksp2, have it generate science passively over time to promote landers, but generate spikes of science upon impacts with the planets with diminishing returns (bonus points if crashing into different biomes would reward you differently for the seismometer).\u00A0 it would have interesting synergy with the sounding rocket nose cone for planets with an atmosphere as well. Also a Solar Science part that makes you do a parker solar probe esc mission by rewarding you for getting close to the sun would be cool as well. Bonus points if you get extra science points for going over the suns poles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T15:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224332586\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220160\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698076315\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222150\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Strawberry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Strawberry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso xenon is unlocked way earlier in the tech tree which is good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I see here is very simple: it does not require you to run tests in xenon-rich environments to get access to the technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T16:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224332530\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220160\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698066342\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid they remove celestial bodies from the Kerbolar system?\u00A0 Because it should be absolutely required to telescope them before you go there.\u00A0 You should have to image Eve or Tylo or wherever before just blindly flying there and hoping for the best.\u00A0 Heck, you could make the argument that you shouldn\u0027t know they exist until you image them.\u00A0 Until then, they are just lights in the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds great on paper but when restarting Exploration mode for the 5\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E ti e it will get old and grindy.

It allowed for some pretty interesting ideas such as eschewing heat shields, but then deliberately rotating your craft if you desired in order to put overheating parts into the lee of your your trajectory, letting htem cool off as other parts heat up, only to rotate once again in order to cool off that new section, etc. In one of the dev commentaries in a heat discussion thread (I can\u0027t recall or find it off the top of my head) they said that they wanted to do heat on a whole-ship basis, essentially in the name of intuitiveness. At least in regards to how radiators work as I recall in dissipating heat. It doesn\u0027t matter where you place them, it\u0027ll sink from the ship\u0027s heat pool, not from an individual part or localized area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/218512-developer-insights-21-rockets-red-glare/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/218512-developer-insights-21-rockets-red-glare/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheehaw Kerman","CreatedById":223516,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T20:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224332641\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220160\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698088589\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same can be said of anything when restarting a campaign for the nth time.\u00A0 \u0022Need to go here and take that temp reading again.\u00A0 And then I have to launch a sounding rocket to unlock that part\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u00A0 No difference there, IMHO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u2019t really mind that in KSP1 - sounding rockets are fun. \u00A0Heck, pretty much anything that you can launch in the game is fun. \u00A0What got to me after a while was the Contracts system being procedural and frankly a bit nonsensical. \u00A0If Exploration Mode is a bit less like a business plan for SpaceX written by a pre-alpha release of ChatGPT based on a prompt written by a second grader, hooray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PicoSpace","CreatedById":224964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T21:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall Really Excited about \u0022For Science!\u0022 and it looks like a soild update from what we have today (and the last 9-10 months once its out).
