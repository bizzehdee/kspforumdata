You can find parts by module and see their properties on the web, instead of having to download every addon and figure out which part does what in game. Once you\\\u0027ve found parts you like, you can easily download the package. You can also see how others feel about the packages based on package ratings and part ratings. There\\\u0027s even a (simple) comment system! Furthermore, screenshots for packages and parts can be added so you\\\u0027ll know exactly what you\\\u0027re getting. You can even see how a part stacks up to the stock version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddon creators are easily able to upload their packages and tag their properties. Screenshots are also easy to add, and how many views and downloads a package receives are recorded. Addon creators can also have multiple versions available, in case new versions are not compatible with older versions of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a brief overview of the features, and by no means is it complete. I have several exciting ideas that I hope to add in the near future. I am releasing this now though in order to gauge general interest. I would love to hear any of your ideas as to how to improve this. I really want to make this the best website to help the KSP community find addons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003EThe Site: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kspyard.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kspyard.com/\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some example pages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA package page: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kspyard.com/mods/packages/C7\u002BAerospace\u002BPack\u002B-\u002BExperimental\u002BVersion\u002B2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EC7 Aerospace Pack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA part list: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kspyard.com/mods/category/fueltank\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kspyard.com/mods/category/fueltank\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA part page: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kspyard.com/mods/parts/Silisko\u002BEdition-RCSFuelTank2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kspyard.com/mods/parts/Silisko\u002BEdition-RCSFuelTank2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures: (these are screenshots from an old development version but they give you an idea...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KoILZl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KoILZl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yI8bAl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yI8bAl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/476yWl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022476yWl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EUploading is open to any addon creator!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E - However, sometimes there are issues.

Furthermore, we also sometimes have other files in the zips besides the parts folders, like ship saves, alternate skins, readme files, or whatever. So if you\\\u0027re going to scan zip files and propagate a parts list, you must limit it to a specific subfolder.
