The robot can do /some/ piloting things (perhaps the basics of a robot core: Stability Assist, but not much more?). Can use KIS/KAS Engineers tools (wrench, mallet, powered screwdriver, etc), but doesn\u0027t actually count as an Engineer for other things. (so no major repairs.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd simply isn\u0027t a scientist (so it cannot reset tests) - perhaps it can give a small bonus to science given by tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[And perhaps it interacts with Extra-planetary Launchpads, and would be more productive than your average Kerbal]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobots require no Life Support (and consume no life support supplies).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am thinking that they, like regular Kerbals, do have names and gain experience points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that last one is important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne part I am thinking of having is a \u0022Builder\u0022 which will allow Robot-Kerbals to be \u0022constructed\u0022 - and if any robot-Kerbals \u0022Die\u0022 they can have their experience-points saved.
