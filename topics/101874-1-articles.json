The eclipse will be at its peak around 9:30 am GMT. I live in Belgium, for me the eclipse will be 81%. People in the netherlands/great Britain/northern France can probably expect much the same, I\u0027m not sure how countries further away will be affected. I believe that the eclipse will be more complete the more noth you go, but I\u0027m not sure.
