This is for a couple of reasons. One is that my computer only has 4GB of RAM and an old processor, and flying a SSTO all the way to orbit can take 30\u002B minutes, where as rockets are much quicker. Another reason is that due to my limited experience returning a space plane from orbit, most of my SSTOs turn out to be MPTG (Multiple pieces to ground). This means that for the most part (outside of mods), I\u0027m stuck sending three Kerbals up and down at a time. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI was never a big fan of the real life space shuttle. It took people up. It took cargo up. And it took both back down. And it was never most efficient at either. Shuttles have also been very tricky to build with KSP. Requiring lots of balancing of COM and COT, and usually throttle up and rolls to get the accent profile to work. Then there was the same problem with me not knowing the best way to return a winged craft from orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWith the introduction of the vector, I decided to give shuttles another shot, and I have to say I am very happy with what I came up with. It has an extremely simple accent profile (100% throttle, launch, gravity turn, and stage to orbit). It is also 100% recoverable. (or would be if the single SRB didn\u0027t drop out of physics range before reaching space) The external fuel tank gets into space on a sub-orbital trajectory, and then spins through atmospheric heating and has parachutes. The orbiter even has parachutes for poor pilots like myself. The one part that is not stock is a fuel valve release from the \u0022smart parts\u0022 mod. This is so I can drain the fuel to decrease orbiter weight.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI present my creation to you here. It draws heavily on the MAKS, but is not air launched. I really like the asymmetrical design, with the single SRB. It doesn\u0027t do cargo. It holds 6 Kerbals. It has plenty of DeltaV for orbital maneuvers, and RCS for docking. It doesn\u0027t have enough DeltaV to make it to the Mun, but that isn\u0027t what it is designed for. I don\u0027t think I took a picture of it, but there is a MK2 docking port on the belly of the orbiter.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vj0Gl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The Vector is almost certainly too heavy for such a small orbiter, so it might be possible to move it onto your external tank.
