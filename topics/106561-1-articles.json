Spread some heat-absorbing material on top of the polar caps. Maybe it could be as simple as just spreading some black carbon material. It will absorb heat and cause the CO2 underneath it to sublimate during the Martian summer (when the Sun will be above the horizon continuously). At some point, run-away global warming is supposed to take over and melt the rest of the CO2.

Maybe now, the Sun is bright enough that Mars\u0027 atmosphere is in a sort of \u0022metastable\u0022 state, and if we melted all the ice caps, then it would settle down into a permanently unfrozen state, and not slowly revert to its current state (at least, until atmospheric loss impacted it).
