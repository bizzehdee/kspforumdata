Yes KSP prides itself on being cartoony and accessible, something I feel like the dev team may have leaned a little too hard into at times, but at the end of the day this is a physics-based sandbox game trying to emulate real-life rocketry, and in real life rockets don\u0027t wobble or bend when they encounter shear forces, they break. Often catastrophically. At this point my vote is to echo what @regex says and implement node to node welding of parts of the same size or cross section. You can still calculate shear forces and aerodynamics per part, and if shear forces reach a certain threshold, *bam*, explode the part, decouple the nodes, and then you\u0027ve got a realistic emulation of a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd @Nate really hits the nail on the head around the 4 minute mark when he says \u0022When a player sees a rocket, if the structure itself appears to be unitary....you\u0027d sort of expect all those cylindrical elements to basically be constructed as one solid piece\u0022 (paraphrase).

I saw that rocket tumble, fall sideways, and then the FTS kicked in and exploded the rocket, all without the slightest bit of (observable) flex or bend. Yes, I agree that lateral nodes with a cantilevered weight out on the end should experience some bend, but the core of my rocket should, as Trigger so eloquently put it, \u0022Fly straight and true like a brick house\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the team is getting there, I know they\u0027re really putting a lot of work into finding an implementation that includes the best of both worlds.
