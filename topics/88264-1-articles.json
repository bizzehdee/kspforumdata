Ion engines are highly efficient because they accelerate nearly all of the propellant, which extracts as much kinetic energy as possible from them. Chemical engines, on the other hand, spend a lot of energy accelerating the exhaust, plus they lose a lot of efficiency due to all the heat generated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Ion engines work by accelerating small particles, it\u0027s very difficult to make one large enough that pushes enough small particles to give a higher thrust output. Plus the energy (electricity) requirements for an Ion engine are fairly high. Especially considering that a chemical rocket pretty much only needs electricity to get started, then can generate electricity as it runs (through thermocuples). In some cases, a chemical engine might not even need electricity to get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, both engines have tradeoffs.

Ion engines in KSP are about 1000-100,000x more powerful than real ones (and have 20-1000x the thrust to weight ratio), and use less electricity than real ones too. In real life, an ion engine might need the equivalent of two or more of those Gigantor solar panels (to get its 2200W electricity), and generate only about 0.00012 kN of thrust out of its 6kg mass.

Welcome to the forums! I wish you the best of times here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairly generic introductions aside, to answer your question of rocket efficiency, there are a few things that come into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of these topics have been touched by Claw already, but I can add in a bit more detail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP is very dependent on the propulsive element you are using. For example, small Ion engines kind of work in the same context as a particle accelerator, but does have it\u0027s differences. These similarities, though, include the method of acceleration and the sheer amount of power required to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this is not a powerful engine, however, is because the amount of thrust these particles produce is laughable, due to the mass and energy transferred from them being so small, regardless of being in a decent sized field. It\u0027s like a car taking 5.8 hours to make one right turn. However, they are efficient due to the fact that the propellant used transfers all propulsive energy to the probe in question, which allows this so called \u0022probe\u0022 to use every ounce of energy this propellant has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can go into more detail about the chemistry if you want, or I can leave it at this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemical rockets are as powerful and inefficient as they are do the fact that a lot of propulsive kinetic is lost in the exhaust. To explain this properly, lets go back to the basics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific impulse is describing the efficiency of an engine by referring to the amount of thrust you get from each unit of fuel/energy expended. Or chemically, how much energy is being transferred from one body to the next per unit of energy expended. So chemical rockets do not exploit all the propulsive energy from the fuel as they could, thus must use a very high amount in order to get that sweet thrust we find so appealing. This is why I love the nuclear rocket. Provides a fair amount of thrust while keeping that lovely Delta-V so high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upside to chemical rockets is their alternator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemical rockets are much more complicated than I\u0027m putting down, but that\u0027s the basic gist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd greetings again!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T05:06:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMust fix grammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T19:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of these thoughts originated from playing with Near future and thinking, Since i\u0027ve brought up all these solar panels to drive electric thrusters, and nuclear also for the heavy lifting, why not use that electricity to augment a standard rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore this thread dies, i must ask one final question that im sure has been asked a dozen other times.
