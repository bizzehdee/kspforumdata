I am wondering if there is a mod out there right now that allows the player to transmit data from one ship to another instead of directly to Kerbin. That way my probes, instead of sending their data to Kerbin, could say send it to a research station for further analysts.\n\nBut if nothing like this does exist, could some one kindly make it exist?"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T20:31:22Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know of any current way, and endorse this request."},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T06:28:06Z","Content":"I have been thinking about what I would like to see.

I have to say I like your idea of a receiving antenna!\n\nIdeally for me, any new modded utility should use stock foundation as much as possible. I\u0027d like this to be doable from the Science results window, just by clicking \u0022Transmit data\u0022 like you would normally to KSC, but having an antenna set as receiving would make a copy of the data in that vessel?\n\nCome to think of it, the \u0022receiving\u0022 flag should be set on command pods, not antennas, since they are the ones who store data.\n\nSo, if you set a pod as a receiver, anytime you transmit data and there is a link between the sender and receiver (regardless of KSC being connected to either), the receiving part has the data.\n\nOf course, if KSC receives it too, it will lose it\u0027s data value, but the science data is still there.\n\nHow does that sound?"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:04:35Z","Content":"Sounds like a pretty good deal. The reason I was thinking about the Antenna over a specific command element would be the mbits could just be shunted to any available \u0022storage\u0022 based on priority (Research lab, Data Storage Mod, Command Pod) reducing how much transferring of data you need to do. But that was just the thought really. Plus setting it to receive would extend the antenna and could be set up to be perty on the vessel.\n\nBut either way would work as long as there are not limits on the mbit storage of a module.\n\nAs for KSC...It would be best to override the transition to KSC, I mean it would already be a little cheaty being able to utilize a lab for the science unless you place some limit like...the reverencing vessel can only collect data from in a bodies SOI. So you could not send a prob to eve and process the results on the Mun. But you could collect samples and data on the mun from all over and still have a static base. That would be a little less cheaty I think."}]}
