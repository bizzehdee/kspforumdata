Government funding was at it\\\u0027s lowest point ever, and the public interest had turned to other things. They needed something to happen. But nothing did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKRM-12 was on a standard mission to resupply the Mun Colony, Spatium. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerald Kerman casually manuveured into a High-Kerbin-Orbit, watching the illumination from below. The majority of visible Kerbin here was in darkness, a spectacle of light that always entertained him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small communications satellite lazily drifted by his ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe computer beeped, indicating Gerald was close to the Mun. He put down his book, titled \\\u0027The Great Munar War\\\u0027, and peeked through the small window. The Mun sat there, hanging in space. He stayed for a few seconds, admiring it. He imagined what the Mun would look like during The Great Munar War from this distance. Then he looked to his right to check the auto-pilot. It was on. He went back to reading his book. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe computer triple-beeped to indicate a stable orbit. Gerald looked out the window again, watching the Mun slowly revolve under his ship. The base was still a good distance away. Gerald thought back to Kerbin, being out in space gave him time to think. He admired Kerbin. And that hot girl who worked in Mission Control. Boy, she was a sight on his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base was approaching rapidly. Gerald closed his book and placed the bookmark neatly inside. He typed a few commands into the auto-pilot, and the lander with supplies separated from the transporter. The lander shuddered for a split second, then, with the assistance of RCS, began it\\\u0027s journey down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander shuddered again as the engine activated, bringing it to a halt some five-hundred metres above the landing-pad. Gerald assumed manual control and parked it in the centre-right of the pad. Donning his space-suit, he left the lander, and climbed down the ladder. Then, opening a box containing a few buttons, he tapped in a command and the side of the lower-half of the lander opened, revealing eight medium-sized metallic crates, placed neatly onto two rows. His eyes scanned on of the crates, labelled \\\u0027This way up\\\u0027, however the crate was ironically placed upside down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerald radio\\\u0027d Mun-HQ, telling them to get their forklift. He turned around, and watched the large store-room doorway open, and a forklift emerge. He was sure at least five of those forklifts could be placed next to each other to cover the door width. He took a step out of the way and watched it approach, the forklift reached out and took hold of the bottom row, reversed and began driving back. As quickly as it had done that, it returned, collected the top row, then returned once more. The driver signalled to Gerald to take the metal row pieces off of the forks, and place them inside of the lander. They would take up precious space in the storeroom. He neatly placed them inside, then began his Mun-walk up to the base. He loved jumping in the low gravity, it beat playing on his trampoline as a child. He thought back to the hot girl at Mission Control. Not like he\\\u0027d ever get a date with her, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerald pressed a button and listened to the loud noise of the airlock unlocking itself. He opened it, stepped inside and closed it again. It hissed as air was pumped inside. A voice called through his radio, indicating for him to come in. Taking off his helmet after the room pressurised, he opened the second door and stepped inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\\\u0027Welcome, Gerald,\\\u0027 said the familiar voice of Nova Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA smile crept across Gerald\\\u0027s face.
