I mean its a shader quality problem. Any low quality texture have a fix this problem.

Also previous versions on HD5770 without any problem.\n\nOn a i3 laptop with HD3000, it battles but on minimum-ish graphics it runs OK enough that its fun to play. Think the intel graphics is the problem, it particularly seems to battle with terrain (as in space its is ok).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T11:54:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dilli**"}]}
