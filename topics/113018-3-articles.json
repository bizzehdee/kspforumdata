Currently I\u0027m working to adapt all the parts to this mod, but it\u0027ll take some time to achieve. So for now I\u0027ve adapted the 2.5m Refinery from Asteroid Cities into the new Virtugenic Refinery! This new refinery functions like a scaled Dust Processing Unit, but instead of having a Xenon gas extractor secondary function, this one converts dust into virtual particles. This variation of the virtugenic series produces far more particles, but at the cost of resources beyond just power. Hopefully this new part can provide adequate virtual particle generation! The other part added in this update was Dust Collector Ring, which for all intents and purposes is a heavily scaled up inline Dust Accumulator. Same function with the same mechanics, just more powerful and inline. To address the issue of reactors consuming ore faster than can be produced via accumulators and dust processors, all reactor-type parts have had their efficiency\u0027s increased by a factor of 10. This should hopefully make them reliable over longer missions and make vessel truely self-sufficient. A few parts were moved around the tech tree to make room for the new parts. And of course a few tweaks here and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the downloads and enjoy the mod guys and gals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T09:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA smaller update, just to keep things fresh!

To that end I changed it to \u0022nukeRcs\u0022, so I hope nobody has a mod that name either... Besides the name change I\u0027ve introduced two new 3.75m engines for some serious rocketing around the Solar System! The first is based on the Nuclear Salt Water Rocket by Dr. Zubrin that uses a continuous nuclear explosion contained in propellant water, thus I present the Zubrin Nuclear Drive! It has a fairly ridiculous amount of thrust with a good ISP, but at the same time it uses both Ore and Liquid Fuel to power it. The other drive is meant a little more \u0022Rule of Cool\u0022 vs realistic, but whatever. This other drive is the Micropulsed Magnetic Drive that uses vast amounts of virtual particles and a built-in magnetic charge for a huge burst of speed. This is meant as a cross between the normal Kannae drives and the true ftl Warp drives. To help facilitate the control of the engine as an acceleration unit instead of a cruise unit, the engine requires a magnetic charge to function and can only regenerate it at a very slow rate, almost 6 hours in-game time for a full recharge. Both engines are in need of balancing, so feedback and suggestions are welcome! And as always requests and cool ideas for future updates is encouraged!

Fixed the pixel issue with the particles and rebuilt the magnetic charging system, to make it friendlier. Now the engine won\u0027t fire at launch, the ability to toggle the magnetic charging is gone, so its always on. The engine now is more stable and actually practical. It functions like a 3.75m Kannae Drive on Oversurge but uses a self-recharging supply of magnetic charge to limit the duration of bursts. At full power you get 3.9 seconds of acceleration and have a 90 second recharge cycle. Now the delta V is no longer fixed, but recharges itself overtime. It still requires a very large amount of virtual particles to use for full duration. A test vessel about 750 tons had a total delta V of 600m/s using 3 Micropulsed Magnetic Drives and had enough virtual particles for at least 3-4 back to back burns. Hopefully that makes it practical enough for gameplay.

I mean, not only when I am flying the ship but when i\u0027m flying others. I need dust to recharge my ship \u0022vp\u0022 tank and the process is very, very slow.... I know this is a general issue of the game with electric batts i have the hope that it will fixed in future versions. Currently I have flying 44 ships and is frustrating when after a lot of time you return to one of them only to see that is resource empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonOctavio","CreatedById":153056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T00:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that the Zubrin engine is a bit out of balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the description in game and on the first page it says that it should \u0022compete\u0022 with the Indominous, but it is massively over powered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E600units of fuel and 540 of ore will give me 17k of delta v with 19 twr, while the same 600units of fuel on the indominous will give me 4.5k delta v and 5.4 twr.
