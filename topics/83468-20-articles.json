Whereas with a dynamic Tube (like flexotube) system, you simply EVA up to an open connector, access it\u0027s UI, select the tube button, then the Kerbal can simply walk the end of the tube up to the second connection (within a certain range), and link the two that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that would be a great way to \u0022Attach\u0022 sections of a Mun Base together. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flexotube uses the same modules as KAS\u0027s pipe, just with models that look big enough to walk or crawl through.
