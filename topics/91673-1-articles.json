What do you all think?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current funding/contract model in KSP is not much like a space agency. NASA is the one handing out contracts, overseeing projects, operating missions, and performing research. By and large, they do not handle rocket construction. That\u0027s the part that they contract out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current contract system is much more like the business models of the aerospace industry. Customers want satellites, rockets, or whatever to do this or that, and they\u0027ll pay some money to make it happen. If the mission succeeds, the company gets kudos and more customers come to them, and if it fails, customers look elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get why the contract system is the way it is (both of those aspects of aerospace are interesting, and contracts do make nice ways for encouraging players to try new kinds of missions -- I think I read someone in the Fine Print thread saying that they wouldn\u0027t have tried building stations or whatever without Fine Print giving them the idea), but I think that the model could be tweaked to be more like the way that real space agencies work while keeping those nice features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than getting funding per-contract, the agency could be funded more like XCOM or Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Space Program Manager, receiving a certain amount of funding each month (30 days, plus six extra to be distributed to a few months each year, plus leap years) as a budget, with the value growing or shrinking depending on the agency\u0027s reputation at review time. Most of the contract and strategy system could stay as-is, representing the wishlist of whatever political body it is which funds the agency (or the companies which fund their re-election campaigns). This would also have the effect of spreading out the agency\u0027s launches over time, much like Kerbal Construction Time does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the quick-and-dirty modification. With the new upgradeable-base system coming in 0.90, the funding and research system could be overhauled much more significantly. Rather than chasing parts-testing and other simple contracts, the agency could receive monthly funding with minor adjustments based on reputation, and then big changes at yearly reviews on progress towards bigger goals that start with \u0022get something into space\u0022 and ends with \u0022Kerbalkind ascends into the cosmos\u0022 (cf.

Or maybe even not tie the budget to rep at all - at the end of every month, all activity is taken into account (SoIs entered, orbits achieved, bodies landed on, recovery of vessels after X, Science from surface of Y etc. The game can already track the first instance of these, just make it track on a month-by-month basis as well) and budget awarded as appropriate. This has the added bonus of neither penalising nor rewarding inactivity (such as Jool transfer) - if you do nothing, you get nothing. Gotta keep them launches and explorations going if you want to keep the money rolling in. Course, you\u0027d have to severely nerf or eliminate the cash payouts for contract rewards as otherwise, you\u0027d quickly end up with more money than you know what to do with. It would depend on the contract though, I guess.. the Explore X contracts would have no cash reward (you use the budget to fund those), Science From X would have no cash reward.. survey contracts (on Kerbin at least) would be mainly cash reward though - no science or rep to be gained from exploring your own planet. Come to think of it, survey contracts everywhere would be mainly cash reward too - you already have Science contracts and Plant Flag contracts to get science and Rep. Part testing and Asteroid Wrangling should be a mix of all three, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking of Science contracts, only make it count if a non-zero amount of science is transmitted/recovered. Would stop the exploit of putting a thermometer on the Mun and saying \u0027yep, still pretty cold\u0027 every time someone asks. The game already knows how much science is available and where (see the Science Archives) - make contracts based on that rather than arbitrarily. Once all Science in the system has been gained, you\u0027re able to unlock the tree anyway so you don\u0027t need them any more (but you could still get Science from part tests).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrategies.. they\u0027d be roughly the same as they are now, just a bit of rethinking/rewording needed. Or maybe they could be targeted to affect specific contract types, rather than globally? Globally would still be an option, though (see SKB for suitable examples). Like, make one give cash instead of Science for Science From X missions, under the guise of an agency wanting to know how cold Eeloo is for their own private needs.
