One annoying thing that happens to me all the time in the VAB is that they have a feature that I never, ever use on purpose, which is to turn on \u0022symmetry around parent part\u0022 rather than \u0022symmetry around ship.\u0022 It\u0027s toggled by F. It seems to come on all the time in symmetry x2 situations when I don\u0027t intend it, and hilarity ensues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible that when you were placing these things, they somehow got attached to the same radial decoupler?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still have the .craft file from when you saved that ship, it might be interesting to take a look at the parts and see what the parenting looks like on those xenon fuel tanks-- for example, is it \u0022correct\u0022 (i.e. each xenon tank is parented to its own radial decoupler), or munged (more than one tank parented to the same decoupler)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, if this is a runtime problem, what mods are you running? I assume you haven\u0027t done any manual tinkering with the .sfs file or you would have mentioned it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T22:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal alarm clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a 99% vanilla install, and I haven\u0027t manually edited anything.
