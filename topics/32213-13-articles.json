I think part of it is that the command pod section is one of the most texture heavy pages, which is why it might help to have it not load on first entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crimor","CreatedById":18370,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T11:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a fast way to clear a search?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T11:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClicking a tag again deselects it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crimor","CreatedById":18370,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T11:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean the text search, if there isn\u0027t, how about something like..
