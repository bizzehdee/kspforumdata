This satellite was made with the word reusable in mind! After disconnecting off the 4 \u0022boosters\u0022, they pop out parachutes! Then, for the orbital burn stage, try to release it a bit before making a stable orbit! If you won\u0027t it won\u0027t be much of a reusable design. I say this because that stage doesn\u0027t run out of fuel until you completed your orbit burn. Then, after disconnecting your satellite from the last stage, you can switch back to it and deorbit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the first craft from us at the International Aerospace Corporation, expect more from us soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/zz328ti2bup4682/RSLV_I.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T18:32:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by JelloTickles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot to put the download button :/\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JelloTickles","CreatedById":70657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T18:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just put the download button after remembering I actually never did, so enjoy I guess!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
