Anyway, after uninstall, all the game settings are preserved, including all the crash and ship files, everything. As if it didn\u0027t uninstall. It appears Steam kept everything.

I will try this. Although, note... \u003Cstrong\u003EI don\u0027t have an issue with crashing with other space ships either\u003C/strong\u003E. Unless they have lots of parts or are a bit complicated. When it crashes, the screen sometimes makes it to the hanger, but the Kerbals inside are not moving, and then the crash. \u003Cstrong\u003ENote I have not had any crashes, all the way through Scott Manley\u0027s videos, \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Euntil the Duna Rover, and Space Plane missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E. \u003C/strong\u003EI never had any crashes before this. Even now, I don\u0027t have crashes with simple ships. I can build a Kerbal orbiter now, and it does not crash either system on revert launch. I thought it was a ship problem because it was built on it and I transferred the saved files to the 64bit sys. Hence, I built a duplicate of the ship in the 64 bit sys, but it still crashed. Maybe its the ship? Complicated ships with many parts do crash. No crashes with simple ships. The only ship that is crashes for me, is the Scott Manley\u0027s Duna Rover, and Space Plane Mission Ships, from You Tube. I figured his were bullet proof designs. My new system is fresh, as it was just reformatted prior to the crashes, and only has Win8.1, Office, a VPN as I work in China, and Norton running. It was in the shop, at that time, the 32 bit sys was cashing Scott\u0027s Duna Rover. When the 64 bit came out of the shop it has higher specs - powerful - and would eliminate the crashes. I don\u0027t mind deleting KSP and reinstalling from scratch all the science if it would solve the problem. I am at a loss now, now I know, I don\u0027t know anything. It is all vague now. I will try a clean boot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for replying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacejohn\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Targa","CreatedById":116596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T17:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game will always crash after a certain amount of time playing if you do a lot of scene changes, especially if you enter the VAB, launch, revert to VAB repeatedly. There\u0027s an ongoing issue with the game utilizing more and more memory until it crashes. I don\u0027t know enough about Unity to know if this is an issue with Unity itself, or with the way KSP is programmed. If you can start the game and launch/fly a \u003Cstrong\u003Esingle ship\u003C/strong\u003E for a long period of time without crashing, but always crash after a number of scene changes and/or reverts, it\u0027s this \u0022out of memory\u0022 error that has plagued the game for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what KSP does is when you start the game, it loads \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E into memory (which is wasteful). It also has no \u0022cleanup\u0022 method (this may be a limitation of Unity, or not) of removing things from memory on scene changes. So even though you\u0027re only looking at one scene during play, everything else that you\u0027ve done/loaded is still taking up memory. Make sense? In other words, you enter the VAB, the VAB scene is loaded into memory. You exit to the launch pad, the launchpad scene is loaded into memory (but the VAB scene is still taking up memory), your ship crashes so you revert to the VAB, now the VAB scene is loaded a second time (now you have the first VAB scene, Launchpad scene, and the 2nd VAB scene taking up memory). At least this is the way it seems to work to me. I can reliably crash the game by going to VAB, launching, reverting to VAB a number of times. How many times it takes depends on the number of parts in the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only \u0022solution\u0022 I\u0027ve found is to regularly quit the game and re-start it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spacejohn","CreatedById":148274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Sal-vager, Rune, and Targa, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe clean boot did not solve the issue.

There comes a time when efficiency and frustration outweigh the fun and educational benefit, unfortunately. This is an awesome game - One last time, I may delete all KSP files, reinstall from steam and play a new game from scratch.
