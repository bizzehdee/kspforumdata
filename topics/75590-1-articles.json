Solar panels do not provide any power at all, and the orbital speed is 0.0 m/s - unless you burn (presumably you hyperedited yourself out here), in which case your speed is, well, whatever your burn determines.

First, it seems to confuse KSP about the location of the launch pad (my next launch was in high Eve orbit for some reason), and second, if you detach anything from the ship and then you ever time accelerate even a tiny bit, that piece will be lost forever in the infinite void.
