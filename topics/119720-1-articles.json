Therefore ksp rockets don\u0027t always mesh well with realish aerodynamics. that being said giving players parts that let them build more like real rockets (separate lf and ox tanks, lighter engines, earlier control surfaces, may be some changes to how fuel flow works just to be safe) can mitigate these problems and help cut down on the drive to return to the old and familiar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
