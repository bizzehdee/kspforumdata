Place 4 repulsors in symmetry mode in the VAB underneath something simple, but place them so that they are angled roughly 45 degrees from straight vertical. I used a GoodSpeed station command core for this for convenience (handy 45-degree angled corners). You can see in the pic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In flight, figure out a way to flip your craft so that only one of the four repulsors is pointing straight down toward the ground - flip the craft up onto one of its corners with a repulsor. The way I did this was to raise the height on one of the repulsors to 8, but I think anything could work. Like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/weirdrepulsor1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdrepulsor1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you manage to do this, your craft will no longer fall back down onto the other repulsors, and has a hard time falling any direction at all - it will remain \u0022perched\u0022 on that one corner, like it is in the picture, even if you lower the height of the repulsor you raised and try to use the reaction wheel to rotate it back down to normal. You can get it to flip over by lowering the height of the downward-facing repulsor a lot. The reaction wheel in the part there was insufficient to flip it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond strange behavior (still surface-mount repulsors):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make a long tube craft (AKA a long fuel tank with a probe core and some juice).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Place repulsors at either end of it, again angled in relation to the ground: put mine at 60 degrees from the ground, or 30 degrees tilted down from horizontal. Four total. Like so (here shown after it flipped over so you can see how I placed the repulsors):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/weirdrepulsor2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdrepulsor2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In theory, you\u0027d think the repulsors would kind of even out and make the craft sit upright in relation to the ground (played around with height, no difference), but it will actually fall to one side or the other instead like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/weirdrepulsor3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022weirdrepulsor3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this is how they\u0027re supposed to work though?

When height is set to zero, the repulsors are turned off and no longer drain ElectricCharge. I\u0027ll update the OP to be a little clearer. Consumption is open to debate, but general consensus seems to be that it\u0027s about right. Fighting gravity should come at some cost, though future plans are indeed to have it variable depending on height setting maybe weight carrying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an Auxiliary Power Unit in the works which will burn available fuel to generate EC.
