So my question is, what would you say are some of the best mods for KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning to construct a launch complex on Minmus to begin with. I have the Outer Planets Mod in mind with Near Future, TAC Life Support and OKS/MKS to colonize the heck out of the solar system. Suggestions for additional mods that would compliment that goal would be appreciated.
