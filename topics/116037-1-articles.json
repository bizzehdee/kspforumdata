So my question is, what would you say are some of the best mods for KSP?\n\nI\u0027m planning to construct a launch complex on Minmus to begin with. I have the Outer Planets Mod in mind with Near Future, TAC Life Support and OKS/MKS to colonize the heck out of the solar system. Suggestions for additional mods that would compliment that goal would be appreciated. Thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T06:41:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 06:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by leptoon**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T05:06:27Z","Content":"Not new, but RemoteTech is one of my most appreciated one."},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T05:31:50Z","Content":"Anything at the top of this list is awesome, also a few others....\n\n[http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/browse/top](http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/browse/top)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T07:57:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anything at the top of this list is awesome, also a few others....\n\u003E [http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/browse/top](http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/browse/top)\n\nAlso, RasterMonitorProp for in-flight MDFs which make it possible to fly significant bits of a mission from the IVA view; Docking Port Alignment Monitor (which plugs into RasterMonitorProp as well as being standalone) - an essential for safe docking; NavBall HUD for when you need to walk somewhere over the horizon; Chatterer for the bleeps; Kerbal Alarm Clock, which if you\u0027re running multiple missions simultaneously, is a no-brainer.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T08:16:31Z","Content":"Instell experimental technologies, add some wonderful new air engines.
