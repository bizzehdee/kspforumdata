Also, try the standard stuff like checking to make sure KSP is on your Antivirus approved list. If you can, also try to check your processor and graphics card temps. That can cause KSP to lock up as well, although overheat usually causes more computer problems than just locking up KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf KSP was working before, you can also check and see if your system updated itself recently.
