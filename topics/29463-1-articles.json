Sometimes it is nice to see that even seasoned veterans that can pull off amazing missions and creations can have bonehead moments. Makes the newbies feel better, like myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will start with the story of my first Mun landing. In the \u0022Post a Pic thread\u0022 I mentioned my first Mun landing and posted a pic, seen here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r219/VAPER_2007/screenshot89_zps31deb1b6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot89_zps31deb1b6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did not mention is what a cluster of fail it was and that it took two retries. First, I got frustrated after my three man lander repeatedly crashed into the Mun. So I decided to step back to a one man lander and slapped one together. I did so without testing it. This will be important later. I also thought I would get fancy and set it up with asparagus staged drop tanks and then later drop the outside engines and fly home on the central core. \u0022But Mastodon\u0022, you might say, \u0022there is no engine on the central core\u0022. Yeah, that was one of the fails, and why it is important you should test things first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I drop down towards the Mun everything is going well until the last few dozen meters. First I realize that I can\u0027t eject my now empty drop tanks because derp, I need the landing legs attached to them. I have also picked up a little lateral drift but got scared that I was too close to the surface and did not want to try and correct for it and smash into the Mun. so I am about to touch down, my lander is drifting, I am equally excited that I am this close to success, panicked that I am this close to failure and my heart is pounding in my chest. I thump down at a little under 11 m/s and OH GOD WHY IS THERE STUFF EXPLODING OH GOD I AM TIPPING. Fortunately for me the only thing exploding was the central engine that unfortunately stuck out below the landing gear because someone didn\u0027t bother to test the lander. Also, the lander tipped up on its two legs before settling back down gently. So Malton Kerman (my brave pioneer) climbs down, steps on the surface, explores a bit, poses for pictures and gets back into the lander for takeoff. He lifts off, ditches the drop tanks, tips over to begin his gravity turn, and is almost to a comfortable apoapsis and DEAR GOD HOW ARE WE OUT OF FUEL. Well, we aren\u0027t out of fuel. In the excitement of my first Mun landing I forgot to drain the fuel out of the central core (which no longer has an engine on it) into the outer tanks with engines intact. But I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t panic. I mean, I landed on the Mun. I can handle this. So while my lander is gently floating towards apo I begin to transfer fuel to the outer engines one at a time. While still throttled up. So my lander proceeds to do loop-da-loops over the surface of the Mun as the other engine is still fuel starved. So I reload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to my descent and everything is going the same as before. I have some lateral drift, choose to ignore it, my lander touches down, center engine explodes, my lander tips\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and falls over. Dammit. But that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ok. I have seen plenty of people right themselves after tipping on their side. So I retract the landing gear and then extend them just as the lander is almost upright and voila. Upright lander. I skip the whole small step thing as I already did it and begin transferring fuel. Before I take off this time. Guess I have to learn things the hard way. So I get up to my apo, circularize, ditch the drop tanks, set up a direct Kerbin reentry from Mun orbit (because I like to come pounding through atmo at 3,000 m/s like a boss), ditch the engines, ditch the central core and then pop my para\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.OH DEAR GOD WHERE IS THE PARUACHUTE! Apparently, when I pulled what I thought was a slick maneuver righting my lander I knocked the parachute off. Which I am just noticing at Mach whatever. Malton did not go home that day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I reload again and everything goes exactly the same as landing number 2, including my lander tipping over. But this time I am prepared and I am paying attention to the parachute, ready to rotate the lander (if I can) so I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t knock it off. So I do the whole \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cretract and extend lander legs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 procedure and\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6nothing. Try it again. Still doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t right itself. So there I am, my stupid lander jitter bugging across the surface of the Mun as I try about 7 or 8 more times. Finally it rights itself and the parachute miraculously stayed on. So I go through the whole process of fuel transfer, getting into orbit, getting into Kerbin reentry and\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6holy hell we actually made it.

The first \u0027in-character\u0027 plan was to get some kind of life support platform up there. The result was my first unmanned mission. A core with a lander module, designed for a one way trip and a goal of trying to get it within walking range from the crash site. This, at the time my fourth landing on Mun, proved difficult, and required several perilous surface-to-surface \u0027hops\u0027 to get it within walking range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i38.tinypic.com/es9tw2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022es9tw2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, came the attempt to bring them home. Over a dozen different modifications to the lander that crashed there (albeit now with a core attached to keep the capsule empty for pickup) were tried, and all failed. Ultimately I was forced to just add an extra 1 man capsule to the first rocket I sent to Mun, and bring them back one by one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was basically hours 3-7 of gameplay for me, and easily hooked me on the premise. Especially with the self-imposed limitations of \u0022no man left behind\u0022 and \u0022no unnecessary casualties\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i33.tinypic.com/24g0xfn.png\u0022 alt=\u002224g0xfn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, getting back onto the important subject, the failures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the \u0027Munshot II debacle\u0027 I discovered how to dock, and getting ambitious, launched my first space station. Naturally the next step was to design an one-way unmanned tanker so I could re-fuel the station and the future planned vessels that would be taking gas off the station. While I could get a small tanker to work just fine, the desire became to get as much gas as possible up in one go (1 X jumbo, 2 X R1 RCS usable delivery). The design (using newly discovered to me \u0027Asparagus-Staging\u0027) was this monster:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i35.tinypic.com/2m4xbbs.png\u0022 alt=\u00222m4xbbs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, well, let\u0027s just say after almost two dozen tweak and attempts, the file is currently filed in the \u0022Rejected\u0022 cabinet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i34.tinypic.com/ih1o3t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ih1o3t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little long winded, but hopefully the account provided some amusement!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T11:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I sent a Kerbal to Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aXum5BH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aXum5BH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the planet frenzy of 0.17 I didn\u0027t plan any return trip.

What I hadn\u0027t counted on was the effects of aerobraking on Duna being far, \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E less drastic than on Kerbin. I only had radial-mounted drag chutes. The first simulation run revealed that, were I to try to land, they would rip the craft apart like a chew toy held by a Jack Russel terrier. Worse still, I was already beginning my aerobraking/landing maneuver when I\u0027d run the simulation, and not landing would be just as bad an option as trying to escape back to Kerbin at that point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I made a tough call and simulated a powered landing. But as it turned out, due to the steep angle of my aerobraking maneuver, I was not going to have enough fuel! (I\u0027d counted on not having those heavy rovers on board when I returned to orbit, and I wasn\u0027t going to ditch them now!) So I had to compromise: I did a semi-powered landing, busting out the chutes when slowed sufficiently, and I did my best to not crash horribly. It... didn\u0027t work out so well. The capsule (and amazingly, the rovers) survived, but the drive stage was toast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp/ksp/rescue_3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rescue_3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I had to send an automated rescue vessel, with far more fuel and much better parachutes than its predecessor had.
