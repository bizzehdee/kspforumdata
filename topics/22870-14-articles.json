I\u0027ve got a number of other tweaks to parts, and for this set I also have a bunch of welded bits, mainly to cut down on assets. With a 1.25m standardized truss length, you just weld 3 together and you can toss the 3x one and it eliminates a model that needs to load. I have lengths from 1.25m to 12.50m. Helps with framerates a bit as well. I\u0027ve done the same with the HOSS tanks, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a number of specialized welded THSS parts that are designed to mate properly with FusTek, so you can have a truss length that matches the length of the Karmony modules. Then you can snap everything together like legos. Stuff like that. Takes a lot of testing through, and I need to go back through all the FusTek stuff to make sure it lines up with his redesign properly. We\u0027ve got a community established standard for diameters, but not for lengths, and even within a kit getting everything to line up can be a bit of a pain. For example, the tri-strut is 3.855m long, but the tri-strut-short is 1.326m, so 3 of those together is .143m longer than the tri-strut. A small scaling of the latter to 1.25m is barely noticeable and welding them up to make the longer lengths means everything lines up perfectly. Even the stock parts suffer from this kind of problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T23:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I always thought lengths for parts in mods should be standardized along the 2.5 meter stock tanks.
