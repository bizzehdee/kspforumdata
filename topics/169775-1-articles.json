However, species names in video game fiction look like common nouns rather than proper nouns, and are not capitalized in subtitles or documents. My most recognizable examples come from BioWare\u0027s Mass Effect series that refer to \u0022asari,\u0022 \u0022turian,\u0022 \u0022human,\u0022 and most recently, \u0022angaran\u0022 and \u0022kett.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, \u0022Kerbal\u0022 is a real world trademark as well, and is a proper noun as such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a consensus on capitalization for this?
