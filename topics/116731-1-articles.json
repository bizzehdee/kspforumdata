I don\u0027t need help learning the game or anything, I thikn I have everything figured out. I just wanted to start an account on this forum as well as one on Steam so I could stay up to date on things like upgrades. I\u0027m very, very excited about version 1.1.... bring on the antenna\u0027s... antenni??? lol\n\nCurrently I\u0027m in my 3rd year of a fantastic career game I started right after 1.0 was released. Had some issues when 1.0.4 came out, but survived without too many things exploding... lol. I now have space stations over Kerban, the Mun, and Minmus, and the Sun. And one currently headed to Ike. And I have bases on the Mun, Minmus and one headed to Duna. My fleet has survey platforms, shuttles, tourist landers, refueler/oredrillers and advanced science landers... lots of cool stuff. I will gladly share screenshots as soon as I figure out how to post them.\n\nSo anyway, I just wanted to say hello to y\u0027all."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T20:16:13Z","Content":"Hello back, Just Jim. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Welcome to the forum."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T13:32:13Z","Content":"Hey Jim!
