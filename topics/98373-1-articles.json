Ive been playing stock career for almost a year now and haven\u0027t done DR in a long while. Its going to be a funny thing to balance, especially early in career when you wont have access to much on the tech tree. To my thinking most parts should be able to survive a nearly ideal shallow descent from LKO, but anything steeper or faster than that only command pods and engines will survive without a shield. You should also need them for interplanetary aerobraking. Ive never been a huge fan of procedural components, but now that they\u0027re doing the fairings that way I guess its okay. To keep parts down I think they could do 3 inflatable heat shields: a 1.25m shield that can inflate as wide as 3m, a 2.5m shield that can be as wide as 5m, and a 3.75m shield that can inflate as wide as 8m. Do we need anything wider than that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T20:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey should get the contractor who figured out how to fit their high gain antenna into such a tiny package to design the inflatable heat shields.

If you clamp the lower end size and the mass to the upper end size you could end up with a situation where it is more preferable to build the craft thinner rather than ship a larger, heavier heatshield into orbit.
