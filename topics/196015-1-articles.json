Orbital launch works perfectly, and suborbital flights straight up without the boosters/ET work as well. However, re-entry is proving to be really really tricky. The plane alternately wants to pitch up/down/spin on entry from 60km and orbital speeds all the way down to about 20km and 1000 m/s. I started out with a small delta and canards and moved to a larger delta without canards, and eventually got to the design in the second photo which handles well in atmosphere and can make it through re-entry, but only just and there\u0027s lots of shaking and fighting the controls from 6km/s down to about 600 m/s still. Airbrakes help but it\u0027s still fussy-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to increase wobbling but it\u0027s pretty hard to manage angle of attack without.
