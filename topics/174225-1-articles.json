It\u0027s not only dishonest, but downright despicable. It undermines the entire review system. I don\u0027t trust a game developer to tell me how awesome their game is. I trust\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E, my fellow gamer, because I assume we\u0027re honest with one another. This is the same crap that happened the last time KSP had a negative review spike. Then, it was Chinese players angry about changing that \u0022you must be a real man to get to the Mun\u0022 thing in the 1.3 version. This, I think, is even worse. A lot of those players had just bought the game for the localization of 1.3 in Chinese. This time, these are actual players. One guy has over 600 hours. If you actually play this game and give it a negative review, you are a liar. This is not an opinion. It is a fact. Someone can say this game is not for them, and that cannot be argued, but you cannot say it is a crappy game.

It was Steam\u0027s bombardment of ads that showed me KSP when 1.0 was released, but it was the reviews that sold me. I watched the first video on the store page like I always do, then scrolled down to the reviews. I always read a few good reviews and a few bad ones. There were no bad reviews near the top at that time. By the second review I knew I would buy the game. It simply said \u0022I think I have a problem\u0022. I didn\u0027t get it at first. Then I looked at his hours played. It was well over 1,000. That seemed to me to be absurd at the time. I now have over 3,000 myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese reviews matter. Giving a negative review to an obviously great game is an outright lie. You are stomping your feet to show how angry you are; and disparaging an obviously great game in the process.
