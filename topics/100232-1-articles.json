Placing RCS at 45 degree angles would leave their control out of place when translating, you would have them firing at angles, which reduces their ability to go in the direction you want to go. You really can\u0027t put RCS in any other place, your only option with other pods is to rotate the pod 45 degrees and put a docking port/probe on normally that you can control from. That is really less than ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, an offset hatch is a good thing, and the pilot position on the Mk1-2 is good.
