I\u0027ve always like the idea of playing with life support, but it always ended up to be tedious and all the extra parts are just too much sometimes. So I created Snacks to fill the casual life support gap. The main goals of this mod are one resource(snacks) and no new parts. Kerbals and the agency are penalized when snacks run out. Kerbals will not die from lack of snacks, they simply get very grumpy, perform poorly and your reputation will go down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMain Functionality:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Snacks are added as a resource to every module that can carry crew 50 snacks per capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Snack capacity of non-command modules is 200 snacks for each capacity. Some modules may have more or less depending on built in snack compartments, or lack of space! The idea is that non-command modules are the main means to transport snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerbals randomly consume snacks on average every 6 hours, 1 snack each time. This averages to 1 snack per Kerbin day or 4 snacks per Earth day. You cannot predict with certainty how many will be required for a given mission. There are a few extra twists here as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome Kerbals, especially courageous ones may sneak an extra snack at snack time, others may forget to eat if their stupidity is to high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerbals on EVA take 1 snack with them. This should be enough for about 1 Kerbin days. Plan accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-If you deprive a Kerbal of snacks, the next time he attempts to eat snacks, your reputation will go down. Each subsequent time the Kerbal is deprived your reputation decreases. Reputation decrease is based on your current reputation. If you are a reputable space agency, your reputation will drop faster than a less reputable agency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELatest Release:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Snack production. Snacks can now be produced via the Lab module with the Snack Cultivator. Ore and lots of electricity are required inputs to produce the necessary hydrogen, carbon and oxygen from the Ore to create deliciously bland snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Snacks per meal now increased to 1(was .5). I felt snack consumption was a bit low previously. This essentially doubles the rate of consumption, but now snacks can be created from Ore, so it should still allow long duration missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Snacks are now massless!

A way to do snack generation could be to implement a warm up period. basically picture this a kerbal brings a soil sample into the lab be it from an asteroid, the planet below them, or right outside if they are landed, and you right click on the lab and hit a button like \u0022farm snacks\u0022 they then start using the sample to grow and farm snacks. A timer will then start to tick down because the snacks will take time to grow so you still need to have enough stored up to last through this \u0022winter\u0022 which means a lab equipped base, station, or ship will still need to include storage and living space and maybe even require a small resupply to tide them over. At the end of this warm up period you then click harvest snacks and the lab instantly resupplies all snack storage within the 2km loading range up to a random percentage (some harvests will get you through the next several warm up periods but some won\u0027t and the kerbals will either need a resupply or will need to tough it out and cost you rep).
