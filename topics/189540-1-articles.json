When I press the m key now, nothing happens. When I press the map view on the left hand side that has all the docking/orbit maneuvering things, it gives me the map. But when I close the map, it glitches out. Kerbin disappears, and other times I get this weird rainbow. But when I am in the tracking center it works fine, no glitches of any kind. I have no idea what i did, other than I shut my computer down last night for the first time since I downloaded it (I just recently got back into playing so I downloaded a couple of days ago), and then when I logged on this morning, no map. And as a lot of you know, the orbital map is kinda crutial. I tried starting a new sandbox, and the map worked fine there. I don\u0027t want to have to start over again, as I have a lot of satellites launched right now. Maybe I could some how transfer the data to the new sandbox, like launches and orbits, etc. If someone could help that would be great. I have no mods/add-ons of any kind, I am running the current MacOS version of KSP. My Mac is OSX Mojave currently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
