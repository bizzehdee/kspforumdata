I am right now writing for myself a patch that will make make duplicates parts of it, so that I will have one of the fission, and one of the fusion, KSPI reactors, as well as the two different generator parts. I am wondering if it would be possible for you to create a model for a dedicated generator part... I can also just duplicate the reactor part for them, as I am doing now, but it is not quite as aesthetically pleasing - whichever you prefer, I guess.\n\nAlso, would you like to include the configs I am writing as a NEEDS[KSPI] patch in your release, once I have completed them? If not, I\u0027ll stick them on Kerbalstuff \u0026 CKAN with you and KSPI as their needs."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T23:25:03Z","Content":"@ABZB: A generator part?

As for the MM patches, I can include them, it seems simpler that way.\n\nin KSPI, there are many kinds of nuclear reactor parts - basically there are seperarate parts for different kinds of nuclear reactions. reactors generate some combination of thermal energy (i.e. they get very hot) or charged particles (protons and stuff moving very fast). the electrical-power-making part is a separate part, there are two - one for each reactor energy-output. A few pics of a craft I built with the preliminary MM patches can be found here:\n\nthe two reactor parts are respectively a fusion reactor and a direct conversion (charged particle) generator. the ion engine is a VASIMR.\n\nat the moment I am working on properly balancing the various reactor parts, etc - I am trying to determine what scale mk2 parts make sense to be (KSPI generators work with tweakscale, presumably mk2 should have stats corresponding to be larger than radius 1.25 parts, smaller than radius 2.5 parts - does anyone have a good cross-sectional area measurement of mk2?)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
