I am wondering if it would be possible for you to create a model for a dedicated generator part...

A few pics of a craft I built with the preliminary MM patches can be found here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe two reactor parts are respectively a fusion reactor and a direct conversion (charged particle) generator. the ion engine is a VASIMR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat the moment I am working on properly balancing the various reactor parts, etc - I am trying to determine what scale mk2 parts make sense to be (KSPI generators work with tweakscale, presumably mk2 should have stats corresponding to be larger than radius 1.25 parts, smaller than radius 2.5 parts - does anyone have a good cross-sectional area measurement of mk2?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/7pvKO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
