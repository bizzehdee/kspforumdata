The part will be mostly hollow, except for a few support beams (somewhere inside or along the perimeter)? Yes, the shadows will usually do the right thing... or pretty close to it. I\u0027ve found that where the beams/bars get really close to the surface of a larger component, the shadows my vanish in that last 0.25m or so. But it still looks pretty good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the colliders, just add separate simple colliders for each structural beam, or break the exterior up into several rectangular colliders. They don\u0027t have to be super precise, unless you\u0027re making a cargo bay in which case you need the colliders to completely enclose the interior. Otherwise, small gaps and the like aren\u0027t that big of a deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Badsector","CreatedById":118465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T16:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParts are those\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XAn4xT6.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XAn4xT6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare 2.5m and i want separate the beams from the circular sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf is possible add more colliders to the same part i have to learn how to do that in unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the explanation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuca\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T17:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can add colliders in blender. Just add in some (stretched) cubes (colliders have to be convex!) that touch the faces of the original geometry. Colliders for the rings could be just disks with the same thickness as the rings,and same outer diameter. (meybe reduced to 12 sides). You can see the basic workflow of adding collission meshes (aka colliders) in blender and configuring them in unity here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRJ1qI8uoY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRJ1qI8uoY\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
