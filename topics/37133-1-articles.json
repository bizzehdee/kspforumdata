Case-in-point, that one says 3250 m/s to get from low Eeloo orbit to Kerbin intercept, which is ludicrous. A Hohmann transfer from a 10km Eeloo orbit to Kerbin intercept takes something like 1360 m/s, plus a small bit for an inclination change, and because Eeloo\u0027s orbit is eccentric, you can do it for about 1000 m/s when Eeloo is close. Likewise, it says about 4100 m/s for an LKO to LEO transfer, but you can easily do it for under 3500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T14:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe chart does have markers for transistions for which you can use aerobraking, for which you can normally ignore ~90% if that cost.

They aren\u0027t hard and fast numbers for every case, so sometimes you can get away with having less delta-V available (and sometimes you need LOTS more). Think of it this way: if you wind up using less delta-V for a transfer than the map says you need, you\u0027ve got that much extra available to you in the event of a screw-up later in the mission.
