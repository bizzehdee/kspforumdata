Moho is, hands down, the hardest planetary body to make a return mission from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, the ground-level ascent from Eve is well respect as hard.. but everyone knows what they are in for with that. What engine did your lander have? Because it looks like the ant engine to my eyes but there\u0027s no way that would provide the TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T09:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just did Moho about 3 weeks ago. I built an interplanetary vessel with 15k worth of delta V that could travel to Jool and back. I ran out of fuel on the return trip and had to do a rendezvous in orbit around the sun with a rescue ship. I almost made it entirely in one trip. Next time I have additional boosters in a new designed ship that can probably get me there easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
