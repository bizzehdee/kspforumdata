I know what the second one is - in the SC scene when you click on the delete on close or close button if the button is over a building the game grabs the click before KAC does and thus you enter the new scene instead of cleaning up the alarm. I normally have my default alarm position on the right of the screen and havent really hit that myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that behaviour maybe it is related to the first one. I havent been able to get it to happen here myself, but perhaps when you are jumping to the ship it is trying to go to the ship and enter a building at the same time and getting very lost. If you can fiddle there, perhaps try ensuring you arent hitting a button and a building at the same time and let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure someone has asked about Mods being able to own clicks before, but I\u0027ll ask about that one too - at least that would solve the second issue for sure \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know how you go\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: When I say havent been able to get it to happen - I do end up in buildings instead of the vessel I\u0027m trying to jump to, but havent had the loss of control or wonky SC Camera\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T14:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to be out of town for a few days here, I\u0027ll play around when I get back, and keep you posted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sutima","CreatedById":101439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T15:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022godefroi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022godefroi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe log is at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/riR27JFK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/riR27JFK\u003C/a\u003E.
