Even hovering is difficult to do. It\u0027s damn near impossible to adjust the throttle exactly right. Most of the time you\u0027re either climbing or falling slowly. Going straight is fairly simple, but when you want to stop at a specific point, you\u0027re likely to either overdo the breaking or overshoot ...or flip your vehicle completely.\n\nSo here\u0027s an idea: make a mechjeb-style autopilot. It would have to calculate the exact throttle level to make the plane hover. It would have to be able to keep the plane hovering at a specific altitude and also change the altitude automatically when desired by the pilot. And it would have to make the plane go at a specific speed in a straight line and then stop the plane and make it hover in one spot without losing or gaining altitude.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it can be done at all but if it can... pretty please?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T13:46:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 01:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yasashii**"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:57:54Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library) Check here.\n\nHint: look for \u0022Avionics\u0022 or \u0022Davon\u0022, depending on your exact needs."},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T23:19:08Z","Content":"For vertical speed control, that is exactly what my Vertical Velocity mod is for. It should be able to handle everything altitude related you are looking for.\n\nFor the moving to a point, I think my Landing Aid mod will do that. It can zero your horizontal speed or move to a specific point, but only within the current physics bubble (2.5km).\n\nThe other common issue with VTOL\u0027s is balancing thrust, which I recommend Davon\u0027s Throttle Control mod for. My Vertical Velocity mod actually interfaces with Davon\u0027s Throttle Control and will only control vertical engines while you can throttle the horiziontal thrust engines on one of the additional throttles Davon\u0027s mod gives you.\n\n(Links in my sig.)\n\nD.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T23:28:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasashii","CreatedById":8027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T13:45:58Z","Content":"Thank you very much! I had no idea this existed already. I guess I should have looked harder.\n\nAnyway, I just tested the three mods and all of them combined provide better VTOL control I could have ever asked for. I can finally enjoy VTOLs! (I hated them before)."}]}
