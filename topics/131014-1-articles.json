Second easiest might be something like Spaceception\u0027s suggestion, which I\u0027m going to interpret as attach a Project Orion drive to the side of killer asteroid and keep detonating nukes beside it until the asteroid is diverted.

If the killer asteroid is big enough and fast enough, collisions from parallel trajectories (even direct head-on) would not be enough to cancel out all that momentum. You could only divert, not stop, a killer asteroid. Even then, you need a considerable distance between a killer asteroid and its target for the few degrees you could divert it to make a difference.

The idea depends on an object of comparable (although not equal) momentum to the killer asteroid. Remember, the most important part would be momentum, which needs both mass and speed. This plan assumes that capturing and manipulating an asteroid could be done with a craft smaller than itself. Otherwise it would be easier to just put the capturing craft on that perpendicular trajectory.\u00A0 I figured that you either have to bring that momentum (either as larger craft, or speeder craft) from your starting point, or you need to find that momentum out in space. This idea assumes that a even a smaller asteroid would have enough momentum, by virtue of both mass and relative speed, to divert a larger asteroid, even if it couldn\u0027t stop it. By the same token, you would not want to mine or hollow out any asteroid you wanted to impact a\u003Cbr\u003E\nkiller asteroid.

Just remember that unless the impactor craft had comparable mass, it would need much greater speed to compensate.

Second easiest might be something like Spaceception\u0027s suggestion, which I\u0027m going to interpret as attach a Project Orion drive to the side of killer asteroid and keep detonating nukes beside it until the asteroid is diverted.
