It\u0027s the first step towards a space station and has to do with timing and fine feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is: \u003Cstrong\u003EDeploy something in an orbit, leave the orbit and return to do a rendezvous maneuver.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1.

Return to the original orbit and rendezvouz with the station. (Proof is a picture with ur pod and the station on one screen)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4.

It\u0027s gets a little mathematical and i\u0027m not sure if my calculations are right, but read on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI left the station in an nearly circular orbit at 40576m altitude (Orbit period: \u003Cem\u003ET1 = 28.567min\u003C/em\u003E). Then i did a Hohmann Transfer to an orbit at 150000m altitude (Orbit period: \u003Cem\u003ET2 = 36.2min\u003C/em\u003E). The transfer time was \u003Cem\u003ETtrans = 16.157min\u003C/em\u003E. Here i had to wait for a specific time interval \u003Cem\u003ETwait\u003C/em\u003E until i could do a second Hohmann Transfer back to the initial orbit.In order to estimate \u003Cem\u003ETwait\u003C/em\u003E i did the following calculations: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince there are two transfers involved, the number of full orbits of the station is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003En1 = (Twait \u002B 2 * Ttrans) / T1\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne transfer performs half an orbit.

They were designed in the way, that the sum of both secondary orbits periods matched two times the target orbits period. I also created three different solid booster parts, each producing a exact calculated amount of delta v and burned 0.1 seconds. By using them i minimized adjustment errors during orbit changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe apogees were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etarget = 72858m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecondary1 = 75196m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecondary2 = 70556m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result worked ot pefectly fine,as you can see in the images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st: Shot after launch, notice the three colored boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd: Decoupling the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd: After first orbit change, the target slowy starts to get distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4th: Rendeuvous after the maneuver and a few burns for closing in.
