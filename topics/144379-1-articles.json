Enough for a 10 minute burn, 5330 m/s Delta-V without any cargo. That ought to be enough. It also has a high efficiency mining and refining rig build into the Klaw module. Once the asteroid is in position, probably a low polar orbit of Jool, the Klaw module will serve as the foundation of the space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tug is a tractor, not a pusher.
