Basically looking at the current feature list we need to look at our work in general and consider working on polish, bugfixing and balance in certain areas of the game instead of some of the new features we\u0027re working in. Going specific instead of going wide.

The clear and singular focus should be taking on contracts, and building and launching rockets to complete them. All other aspects of the KSC are in support of this central goal and should be introduced later, as appropriate. Here are some specific suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should only be one completed building to start with: Mission Control - the VAB and Launch Pad would be shown as \u0022under construction\u0022 with a tooltip or something that states, \u0022Visit Mission Control, these buildings will be ready by the time you get your first contract.\u0022 Walk the user down the strait path of get contract, build rocket, launch rocket, blow up - try again - eventually win by learning Rocket Science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER\u0026amp;D - Under construction at beginning of the game, and cannot be used. Unlocks after the first contract is completed that returns Science or after the first successful recovery of a ship (since recovery of a rocket that survived launch gives 5 science). Automatically adds ability to do Crew Reports and EVAs while landed on Kerbin. \u0022We didn\u0027t expect you to be so scientific!

QA and Experimental testing will only get you so far, and with the major fundamental ways that the game is being changed for this final release, the chances of catastrophic-level issues getting released is very high. I have history back all the way to 0.11 or so and it tells me that the big changes always need a followup patch to fix things or make changes that aren\u0027t quite right. Before, it was just another beta release so it wasn\u0027t a big deal. But if you 1.0 patch lands with a giant thud and needs an immediate patch then you have a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the patch was just:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Aero model and attending features (Heat, Fairings, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal part re-balance because of Aero\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer/Science Tweaks as described by Harv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen that is a massive amount of things to test or go wrong.
