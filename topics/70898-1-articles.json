Duly noted, and I think that the cannon and engine parts will be rather easy to make modular, though the body segments may have to remain one or two monolithic pieces. As it stands, I also plan on using this stuff as a showcase of my prior experience in modelling and texturing, so I think I will have to produce multiple versions of each ship in that case. The ships wouldn\u0027t have things like weapons and docking ports built in in the first place, those would be separate parts to add on for customization and the ship was simply going to be just a base for the player to expand upon with various weapons. I wanted to do this as a monolithic build, because people, myself included, often have lots of trouble with lots of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will at least get the frigate finished before cutting it up into parts (Which will be monolithic in themselves) at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I drew up a plan for the modularity of the ship.

It also may be too big for the SPH, which is where I will assemble the ships, before hyperediting them into orbit.

I want each class to have many different possible configurations that the player can configure to their taste. For instance, the Command tower will be radially mountable at its base, so instead of the central tower, you could have two towers, one on each nacelle, or even move it under the cargo/drop-pod unit if you wanted. This is the kind of modularity I want, along with having a couple of alternatives to almost each part for a class. The only Major part that will define a class is what body it is built on. So each Frigate will have the same central core section as this one, but anything could be changed out for something else, or even just left out altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for OP engines, these engines will be very OP. I\u0027m talking ISP of ~5000, at least, and running on monoprop. That way you don\u0027t have to use fuel lines, or other weird layouts and setups, and the huge RCS thrusters can use the main fuel of the ship, to limit complication. I plan for the engines to have enough thrust to give each original configuration between 1 and 1.5G\u0027s of acceleration. I don\u0027t expect this stuff to be compatible with stock, especially considering the immense size difference, and this is only the frigate.

Also, with the new SAM functionality that e\u0027s working on, it could be wholly possible to get near a target and just have a hailstorm of missiles get launched at you when you get near, providing it works in space.

Dropships are also planned, and are planned to be customizable as you described, though I never though about using the Klaw in that way.

Go ahead, just build a MAC with engines and a control tower, or even attach a second hangar, and then a MAC in front of that, or hell, add on a million and one engines to it to give it a ridiculous TWR. Anything that I would call a frigate would be built around this core though, and fighters or dropships, or carriers would all have the core a common part among them, but other than that you can go nuts.

I have yet to do the VTOL or RCS, though the RCS may not even be necessary to model, as the textures could probably manage it pretty well. I\u0027ll see what I can do for the rest of tonight, and maybe update again, but for now, this is Deathsoul097, signing off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPOST MERGE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Because Triple posting isn\u0027t cool, but double posting is alright, sometimes.

Of course, the carrier will need a larger dropship, and one preferably with dedicated weapon mounts, but I\u0027ll cross that bridge when it comes to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-03T11:51:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2014 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Deathsoul097\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T11:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFelt like this would be a post worthy progress report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Landing Leg\u0022 animation for the Dropship has been done, now I just need to get the ting textured and add a few little things such as a docking node, so you know, you can actually attach it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVIDEO!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4ZR18MlGYU\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4ZR18MlGYU\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
