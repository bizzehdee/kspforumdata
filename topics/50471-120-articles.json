Proton comes close at 0.86. Delta II, Delta IV, and Atlas V all have around 0.25 starting TWR, but they\u0027re optimized for GTOs. You probably want to start somewhere around 0.5-0.7, as you say, depending on how high your lower stage is lofting you, how much dV your upper stage must make up, and how high a final (or parking) orbit you want. The lower the orbit, the larger the proportion of dV is in the stage, the higher a TWR you\u0027ll need (really, that is to say, the shorter the amount of time you\u0027ll have).\u003Cp\u003EWhen you circularize after apogee, i.e. into a lower orbit, you must then burn radial to lower your apogee; that\u0027s part of the circularization process (accelerate to orbital velocity \u002B counteract gravity, rather than traditional circularization where you just do the former). And yes, you\u0027ll have to make your lower stage loft you higher. However, this can still be more efficient (or at least cheaper! Since tanks and fuel are cheap, and engines are expensive) than investing in a higher-thrust upper stage, even one that would lead to a lesser expenditure of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have essentially three \u0022good\u0022 options for your orbital stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Super-high-TWR solids that fire at apogee (Juno I/II, most all-solid launchers, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Medium-thrust liquid stage that circularizes at apogee (or shortly after). TWR as you say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Low-thrust liquid stage that circularizes well after initial apogee (needs to be lofted higher by lower stage(s), and spend time burning at \u0026gt;0 pitch after apogee).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 is best when you don\u0027t have reliable startable engines or good upper-stage guidance (\u0022point level to earth, light fuse at apogee\u0022 is much easier for 1950s tech).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 is best for LEO, especially low parking orbits prior to other things occurring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 is best for GTO, but can be used for LEO missions as well (probably not as efficient, although perhaps as above cheaper, than #2). But for GTO, your payload mass is less, you get lofted, if not higher, certainly with a higher initial velocity from your lower stage, so 0.25 TWR makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4 is high-thrust liquid upper. It\u0027s like a solid impersonating a liquid, IMO. You have to treat it more like a solid: don\u0027t fire it until you know it won\u0027t finish the burn until after apogee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epingopete: I will check the ocean-gray thing, which I haven\u0027t seen. But EVE Overhaul *does* mess with specularity, and removes normal maps and the blue ramp shading at the world\u0027s edge. Also, nothing past Overhaul-8 works right with RSS, and even -8 doesn\u0027t work if \u0022wrap\u0022 is on in RSS. rbray is aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for launch sites: no icons are being displayed on the planet in tracking center?

While I know I don\u0027t need to worry about surface vs. vacuum, now I\u0027m curious how much my first stage should have compared to my second. Experience tells me it only takes about 4000m/s to get a good distance out of the atmosphere, so is that enough for my first stage? I normally go for about a 50/50 split, with around 4500m/s on this first / first\u002Bbooster stage and then about 4500m/s on the second stage. I\u0027m guessing that there are lots of different ways to do this, but am I doing it generally right? Or should I be putting more DV in the second stage and less on the first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question I\u0027ve got now is aside from cost, is there any reason to go with one over another? One wonderful benefit of working in the game world, at least for right now, is that you don\u0027t have to worry about budgetary constraints telling you to go for the cheaper option, at least for now, so engines are as cheap as fuel (free).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T10:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reply, Yeah I\u0027ll give it a try with O8.

I\u0027ve since upped my descent stage to 3000m/s, but it\u0027s *huge* (3m diameter by 1.5m height) and this is just a probe lander, I can imagine what its going to look like when I try to land a two man pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: 300!
