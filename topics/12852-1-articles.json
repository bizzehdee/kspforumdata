You should see the prograde marker in the center as you are going straight up (90\u00C2\u00B0 vertical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you get to around 15000m, start pitching the rocket by tilting to a 70\u00C2\u00B0 pitch in direction of the East (marked as 90\u00C2\u00B0). Watch the prograde marker slowly catch up with your direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As you go up, progressively tilt the rocket to 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10\u00C2\u00B0 pitch, in order to be pointing towards the horizon (0\u00C2\u00B0) when you leave the atmosphere at 70000m. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"invalid8","CreatedById":29411,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T16:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have another question which isn\\\u0027t actually anything to do with this one but I didn\\\u0027t really fancy making a new thread, especially since I\\\u0027m not sure where the right place for it would be!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does \u0027simulate in background\u0027 do?
