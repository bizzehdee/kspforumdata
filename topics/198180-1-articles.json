How detailed can I make a model and hitbox before it starts to negatively affect the game? In this particular case, I\u0027m making a docking port with several animations and moving parts/meshes. How complex can the visual model\u00A0get before it starts to hurt the game, and how complex can the hitbox/mesh get?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-18T06:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a scale from 0-100, I\u0027d say about 58.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-27T21:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never seen any suggested rule of thumb - the more complex you make the part the more players will have problems with it. You can actually make fairly detailed models (see Squads 18K tris (if memory serves) Mammoth engine - what really eats processing is the colliders. And even here the mesh colliders are a lot heavier than the primitive (Box, Capsule, Sphere) colliders. So keep collider count down and use primitives if you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-27T21:44:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2020 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"/not/pol/","CreatedById":172548,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-18T08:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe answer is F-ing insane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni put this thing in KSP with no problem about a year back, unfortunately it never saw the light of day because Western Digital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022When-she-speaks.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002254.75\u0022 height=\u0022616\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/LXcLD4Nf/When-she-speaks.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a more practical example you can go basically as far as anyones sanity could hold up detailing a model just for KSP, be mindful of potato computers though,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-18T08:17:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2021 08:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by /not/pol/\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
