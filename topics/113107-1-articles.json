However, if you render the map with resources on, the difference is quite obvious: as long as you haven\u0027t used the surface scanner, the entire biome is rendered in one hue (it\u0027s average density). After the surface thing, you see varying densities within the biome.\n\nI guess the Lollipop Scanner can be used in a similar fashion. Fly low enough to use it and if the terrain below you is all the same shade of pink, you haven\u0027t done a surface scan yet. (Update) Even better: **mouse over the small scanner gui: if the given density is doesn\u0027t change at all, you still have to do a surface scan.**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T09:19:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 09:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T12:17:30Z","Content":"That\u0027s why I give flags sensible names, and put \u0022Jeb Wuz Her e\u0022 in the description instead of the title."}]}
