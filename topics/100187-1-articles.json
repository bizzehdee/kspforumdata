That\u0027s on commercial high-bypass turbofans. On low-bypass fighter engines, turbojets, aspirated rockets and regular rockets, the wash is much more powerful. The Rocketdyne F-1 blew the asphalt off a road running parallel to the test site. The 30 engines used by the N1 were the most powerful leaf blower ever. The smoke from the exhaust would be blown far out of sight, not lazily sit around in the 10000 mph winds behind a rocket engine or the 1000 mph winds behind a high-bypass jet."},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T17:48:05Z","Content":"Remember, the thrust power output of the N-1 it\u0027s roughly equivalent to the electrical power consumption of the present-day EU.
