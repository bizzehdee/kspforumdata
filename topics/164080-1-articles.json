While this does make the craft much more complex in some ways, not having to worry about engine collisions plus the ability to lock in any location make it, in my opinion, worth it.. It is capable of getting an orange tank into orbit, but cannot \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E with it.

The craft features an actual cargo capacity over the original, re-dockable spacers, and the ability to lock the engines not just vertically and horizontally, but anywhere in between. This craft works on the principle that the small spider engines are very very weak, and you can easily build a bend into it. This is the same as before. Like before there are to bearings that surround a decoupled\u00A0spacer\u00A0that restricts this flexibility to rotation of the engines only. This time however this spacer re docks easily, and the locking mechanism is much more secure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/N23LLgorJ8Q?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines are controlled by W and S when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is on. To lock them in place, for long term or really any maneuvering,\u00A0auto strut\u00A0one of the main body parts (i use the cargo bay) to the root part (as the root is technically on the engines)\u00A0and remove/change the auto strut on the same part\u00A0to rotate the engines again. The engines will likely re dock to the\u00A0spacer\u00A0when set horizontal (this can be a little finicky, but really only matters in space). This is the ONLY time when time warp is supported, and to help with the reliability of the craft, use the auto strut trick even now. The craft can be changed at any point in time (even in flight) but do not be going over ~50 m/s while doing so\u00A0The reason the craft is\u00A0able to redock this (even if the engines are on) is the fact that the \u0022spacer\u0022 has parts auto strutted to both the heaviest part (main body) and the engines (root part).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis craft took me quite a while to build, mainly because I could not find a happy medium for \u0022soft lock\u0022 or what I eventually used the auto strut trick for. Nothing had either the speed, or strength of this, but I usually dislike making the user of the craft click things like this. (IMO a very important part of craft building, especially complex things, is to make them easy to use.) I more favor action groups due to the simplicity, but unable to find a better solution (and KSP not updating action groups in forever, even if we have more tweakables)\u00A0I believe that this trick should work, as the player can pick practically any part on the craft. It is also the strongest possible soft lock that I could create.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E capabilities, this craft has a very simple ascent. Due to its inherently high T/W ratio, simply point 10 degrees above the horizon until flameout, and then tilt up to around 25-30 degrees when making the rocket burn. Then simply circularize\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Action Groups\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Undock spacer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Toggle Rapiers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Toggle Rapier Mode\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Toggle Cargo Bay\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Decouple Payload\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0) Deactivate spider engines (in case you press space by accident)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EKerbalX/Download \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Bubbadevlin/Binary-2-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-08T02:50:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2017 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Bubbadevlin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-05T03:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYo.
