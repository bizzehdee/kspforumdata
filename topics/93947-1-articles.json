My goal is to earn as much science with probes (Preferably satellites) as possible to unlock parts from the tech tree, so that I\u0027m free to make landers and space stations later on. (Which is my true passion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never left Kerbin\u0027s SOI; It\u0027s scary.

My play style has been specifically exploration of the Mun and Minmus and quite frankly you can earn enough science on the Mun alone to unlock everything I want. (Lander, rocket, and rover parts.) I\u0027m familiar with orbital rendezvous and docking, and not too bad at landing. That is the gist of my skill in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer to bring experiments back physically, but if satellites with science equipment sent to other planets will help me get what I need I\u0027m willing to compromise my usual playstyle.

The 7S is either about as efficient or more efficient than the LV-1 for that tank, and iirc marginally cheaper (I don\u0027t currently have the game open). The tank\u0027s small enough that the same launcher works just fine (as does the next one up, but that makes the launcher less efficient) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe-size tanks have a lower fuel/mass ratio and are much more expensive for the same delta-v \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T15:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI prefer the insulated ring tanks and 48-7S\u0027.
