A spacecraft at this higher orbit has a minimal battery reserve, so the power isn\u0027t going there. The only way to get rid of the power is by shunting it back through the arrays and generating heat. Which on a spacecraft designed to be passively cold, is a very bad thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is simple expense on a program already spiraling in cost - solar arrays of decent output and space compatible materials aren\u0027t all that cheap, and nor is launching the extra mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts an interesting thought as I had to wonder for a moment on it myself (if its gonna be in the sun, \u003Cem\u003Ewhy not?)\u003C/em\u003E, but theres big reasons for not doing it once I thought about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T22:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/James_Webb_Telescope_Design.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis Diagram\u003C/a\u003E, it appears the torque plate (labelled \u0022Momentum Trim Tab\u0022 in the diagram) is significantly smaller than the solar array already attached to the telescope. Furthermore, it looks like it is designed to be moved so as to adjust solar radiation pressure, and may spend long intervals hardly facing the sun at all. If the main solar array was too small to power the telescope then it would be unable to rely on the additional array you suggest, and if the main solar array is large enough then the additional array is redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I, personally, am fond of redundant design. Unfortunately it is very hard to create redundant design that actually reduces the risk of failure - each additional component introduces additional ways things can go wrong, and with things like power systems those failure modes can all too easily cause other components to fail:- for instance, a short in the flexible cable leading to the Momentum Trim Tab would very likely cause a system-wide short and power-down the whole craft, and flexible cables in space are very prone to mechanical wear and electrical shorts. So the designers need to add a whole additional set of components to protect the craft from such a contingency (over and above those already needed to deal with electrical failures in the primary solar array) and since they have a small chance of failing you end up with an increased risk of major failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, NASA put a great many redundant systems and components in the Apollo craft. This was necessary because the engineering was considerably less reliable than it is now, and it was possible because there were so many fewer components that it was easier to isolate failures between systems. Still, they got a few things wrong: nobody in NASA or its contractors thought the Apollo crews would have to use Command Capsule CO2 scrubbers in the Lunar Module, and the incompatibility between the design of the two types of scrubber very nearly killed the APollo 13 crew when the LM scrubbers became saturated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T05:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah those trim tabs seem to be just what I expected. GEO satellties are sometimes fitted with the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027ve mentioned flexible cables that brings up another reason - \u0022Flexible cables\u0022 Typically isn\u0027t how transfering power from a solar array is done, least if its moveable. That usually involves a SADM, which is an integrated gear box, drive motor and slip rings for power transfer. They are a bit more expensive and heavier than their non-slip ringed counter parts. And as you say - they aren\u0027t actually that reliable either. If I\u0027ve remembered the figures right, at 1-2 satellites launched a year WILL have DEPLOYABLE solar array failure (often resulting in no power from the array whatsoever) Although the hold down mechanisms can also be to blame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically though, Solar arrays themselves are quite robust. They are often made up of individual strings with their own connection to the power supply unit, and some damage to an array does not shut it down entirely. They are also designed too large in the first place. Solar arrays will decay over their lifetime in space, and there will be a typical mission profile used to work out maximum power consumption in W/Hr. this is used together to size the solar array to have plenty of power up until the mission end, where it has just enough power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the event of damage, the array early in its life may still be just fine. Later in the missions life, the mission plan may be slightly altered to change how the power is consumed, and keep running at lower power levels. This is how missions can be extended - since they won\u0027t have the power levels they were supposed to by this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
