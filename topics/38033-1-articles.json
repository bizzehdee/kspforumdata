But it only has a 120mm main aperture (i think its called that) and it has that Goto feature which i really dont want because i want to unveil the skys for myself, not just write what i want to see and just be like \u0022oh cool, next\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also read that the refractor is better for viewing planets because of the contrast, but are more expensive, but the newtonian mirror scopes is cheaper, but requires cooldown, maintenance etc, which is not my thing but i can go with it if its significant.

The larger the aperture the more light you\u0027ll soak in which means objects will seem brighter and more detailed. A 70-90mm telescope will get you some shots of the moon and maybe Jupiter and Saturn. You can take pictures through any telescope but with varying difficulties of success. If you want to take deep space pictures of nebula and galaxies then you will need a telescope with tracking features so you don\u0027t end up with just a blurred mess of star trails. On a regular telescope you can easily take pictures of the moon and any planets/stars you see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve even used my Galaxy Nexus smartphone with a pretty bad camera to take some decent pictures of Saturn with my Dobsonian. If you get a good telescope then the camera will usually be the deciding factor on the quality of pictures. If I use my DSLR camera with my telescope then I can get some amazing pictures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a good telescope for a low price and don\u0027t care about go-to and tracking then I would recommend a Dobsonian hands-down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final note: I owned an Orion XT4.5 before my 8\u0022 dob and it is a very nice scope for a lot less.
