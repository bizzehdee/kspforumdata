I also feel like this is the sort of thing which probably would have been implemented if it was easy but no harm in checking right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to cut down on the number of physics calculations the game needs to compute for very large structures by having small and light parts be rigidly connected to any heavy parts they\u0027re connected to, such that they\u0027re treated as a single physics object. I\u0027m not sure what the best ratio for deciding when this occurs would be (maybe 3:1 or 5:1) but it would be ideal to scale the effect so that it occurs more strongly the more parts are having physics modelling applied to them. The only downside I can see to this is that if a collision occurs the spectacular spray of debris would be much smaller, with larger chunks coming off. For the sake of some degree of realism (and also probably for stability of the game engine) this effect would have to not apply through docking ports or any kind of stage separation or struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny problems with this?

I\u0027m not sure how KSP handles physics but if all it needs it mass and center of mass (although you wouldn\u0027t get rotational inertia from that so I dunno) then it wouldn\u0027t be too hard to recalculate after a part is destroyed. If the rotational inertia is calculated by simply assuming a constant density of each part (probably how I would do it) then there\u0027d need to be some new calculations to take care of that, but it shouldn\u0027t be too hard I think. The physics engine would basically be calculating this anyway in order to do its thing, this way it only needs to be calculated once then treated as a rigid body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SyX","CreatedById":38409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T10:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PsykoticCreations\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PsykoticCreations\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI hope something is done, I like building huge structures and one that I\u0027m working on currently has almost, if not over, 1500 parts made entirely out of stock parts.

You just need to be intelligent about what you weld together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.5m RCS tank directly on top of a 1.5m fuel tank?

This can preserve destruction of individual objects, although doing so would necessitate recalculating the base structure for physics interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
