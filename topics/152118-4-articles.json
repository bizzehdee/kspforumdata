You\u0027re not suggesting one side or the other has experienced any less horror in war? That was not the point. The point was that war is \u003Cem\u003Edestructive\u003C/em\u003E; and that destruction has a catastrophic and deeply traumatic\u00A0effect on Human life. We can chat casually about \u0027great\u0027 tanks, machines, etc. but consider if YOU are the person FACING that machine...the focus shifts remarkably. I said I didn\u0027t want to be a killjoy. Military machinery and topics CAN be cool; but let\u0027s just keep the reality of those things in sharp focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an analogy; we can\u00A0consider the sword. The sword is perhaps the most well-regarded and admired weapon; it is a beautiful, elegant and wonderfully-crafted piece of work; a finely-designed and desirable tool. Swords have shaped legend - as the Wootz sword pulled from a form in Damascus did (the linguistic root of Excalibur has been firmly traced to Syria.) Swords have been objects of desire; of story. Swords define heroes in story and legend. From (according to Mallory) Arthur\u0027s God-given weapon to the superbly balanced swords of the Samurai; the sword has always held the forefront of our imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow think for a moment what that lovely piece of metal does to the Human body when it is being used for the purpose it was designed for. If you\u0027ve ever seen a Katana - for example - actually used for its specific purpose, its glamour fades sharply; replaced by a much more sober and serious consideration of its capabilities. When a sword - great as it might be - is used to effect, the effect is death, agony and butchery. For the record I, myself, have never seen a Katana being used in combat; though I have seen machetes, axes and knives used. The difference between us is that for me and for those that like me served in combat, this is not an academic exercise; it is personal history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have NO wish at all to disrupt this thread; simply to point out that what is cool to some is a horrible, personal reality to others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add in a positive way to this thread, I can tell a story of my second tour in Bosnia, 1992. I was second-in-command of a Pioneer Section of the Patricias - the finest fighting Foot on Earth -\u00A0operating in support of UNPROFOR, about three months into our tour of duty. For weeks, we\u0027d been taking sporadic but increasing small-arms fire on our patrols; regular sweeps were more and more becoming active engagements. These were usually just locals with Kalashnikovs and too much Slivovitz taking potshots; but not always.\u00A0Sometimes we took serious fire; we returned it in spades...NO-ONE fires on Canadian soldiers without a major fight on their hands. We never lost anyone in our platoon but overall the Battalion had 3 men hurt, for at least a dozen attackers (including a number of RPG\u0027s) wiped out. We were winning, but the Brass decided something needed to be done. So we did it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe arranged a fun event for the locals: a \u0022Firepower Demonstration\u0022. It\u0027s a chance to show off a little, blend with the locals and chat them up. After all, we\u0027re strangers in their country; we should show them who we are, right? Keep in mind that as Peacekeepers we have to keep our \u0027friendly\u0027 faces on at all times. Not the easiest task, I assure you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, it\u0027s much more serious, though we\u0027d never say so. They want to see, to assess our tactical ability. We get the chance to clearly see their weaponry and strength. It\u0027s like a \u0027fun day\u0027 sponsored by the NRA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a joke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe firepower 2Bn chose to demonstrate was our vehicle-mounted TOW launcher - a powerful and effective anti-tank missile platform. Its HEAT rounds are devastatingly effective against armour; but hardly spectacular...so we put on a show. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe night before the demonstration; I was assigned to take four soldiers - my entire fire-team - plus a fully-crewed M113 APC to act as security escort for a party of Canadian Combat Engineers out to the destroyed Russian T-55 tank we\u0027d be using as a target. We set up a cordon; our APC\u0027s twin\u00A0guns and thermal sights watching as the Engineers went to work. I don\u0027t know much about explosives save what I learned in the Infantry - I can only blow things up; I can\u0027t blow them down - but as far as I could see they wired that damn thing up with high explosive, a ton of black powder, a few gallons of naphtha and a drum of diesel fuel; all wrapped up in a few dozen yards of detcord.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can honestly say that loading my guys up and driving away from that thing was one of the scariest moments of my life.

You\u0027re not suggesting one side or the other has experienced any less horror in war? That was not the point. The point was that war is \u003Cem\u003Edestructive\u003C/em\u003E; and that destruction has a catastrophic and deeply traumatic\u00A0effect on Human life. We can chat casually about \u0027great\u0027 tanks, machines, etc. but consider if YOU are the person FACING that machine...the focus shifts remarkably. I said I didn\u0027t want to be a killjoy. Military machinery and topics CAN be cool; but let\u0027s just keep the reality of those things in sharp focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an analogy; we can\u00A0consider the sword. The sword is perhaps the most well-regarded and admired weapon; it is a beautiful, elegant and wonderfully-crafted piece of work; a finely-designed and desirable tool. Swords have shaped legend - as the Wootz sword pulled from a form in Damascus did (the linguistic root of Excalibur has been firmly traced to Syria.) Swords have been objects of desire; of story. Swords define heroes in story and legend. From (according to Mallory) Arthur\u0027s God-given weapon to the superbly balanced swords of the Samurai; the sword has always held the forefront of our imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow think for a moment what that lovely piece of metal does to the Human body when it is being used for the purpose it was designed for. If you\u0027ve ever seen a Katana - for example - actually used for its specific purpose, its glamour fades sharply; replaced by a much more sober and serious consideration of its capabilities. When a sword - great as it might be - is used to effect, the effect is death, agony and butchery. For the record I, myself, have never seen a Katana being used in combat; though I have seen machetes, axes and knives used. The difference between us is that for me and for those that like me served in combat, this is not an academic exercise; it is personal history. I have NO wish at all to disrupt this thread; simply to point out that what is cool to some is a horrible, personal reality to others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add in a positive way to this thread, I can tell a story of my second tour in Bosnia, 1992. I was second-in-command of a Pioneer Section of the Patricias - the finest fighting Foot on Earth -\u00A0operating in support of UNPROFOR, about three months into our tour of duty. For weeks, we\u0027d been taking sporadic but increasing small-arms fire on our patrols; regular sweeps were more and more becoming active engagements. These were usually just locals with Kalashnikovs and too much Slivovitz taking potshots; but not always.\u00A0Sometimes we took serious fire; we returned it in spades...NO-ONE fires on Canadian soldiers without a major fight on their hands. We never lost anyone in our platoon but overall the Battalion had 3 men hurt, for at least a dozen attackers (including a number of RPG\u0027s) wiped out. We were winning, but the Brass decided something needed to be done. So we did it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe arranged a fun event for the locals: a \u0022Firepower Demonstration\u0022. It\u0027s a chance to show off a little, blend with the locals and chat them up. After all, we\u0027re strangers in their country; we should show them who we are, right? Keep in mind that as Peacekeepers we have to keep our \u0027friendly\u0027 faces on at all times. Not the easiest task, I assure you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, it\u0027s much more serious, though we\u0027d never say so. They want to see, to assess our tactical ability. We get the chance to clearly see their weaponry and strength. It\u0027s like a \u0027fun day\u0027 sponsored by the NRA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a joke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe firepower 2Bn chose to demonstrate was our vehicle-mounted TOW launcher - a powerful and effective anti-tank missile platform. Its HEAT rounds are devastatingly effective against armour; but hardly spectacular...so we put on a show. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe night before the demonstration; I was assigned to take four soldiers - my entire fire-team - plus a fully-crewed M113 APC to act as security escort for a party of Canadian Combat Engineers out to the destroyed Russian T-55 tank we\u0027d be using as a target. We set up a cordon; our APC\u0027s twin\u00A0guns and thermal sights watching as the Engineers went to work. I don\u0027t know much about explosives save what I learned in the Infantry - I can only blow things up; I can\u0027t blow them down - but as far as I could see they wired that damn thing up with high explosive, a ton of black powder, a few gallons of naphtha and a drum of diesel fuel; all wrapped up in a few dozen yards of detcord.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can honestly say that loading my guys up and driving away from that thing was one of the scariest moments of my life.

Top of the line; look how clean it is; how new. Those notches in the stock? Ignore them...not important.\u00A0Is that your Kalashnikov? How nice! Let me look! Hmmm....some rusty rounds in there; I\u0027ll make a note. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Ohhh....that guy has a Dragunov!

My whole childhood was just steeped in the military.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I graduated high school my plan was to go ROTC and become a pilot, but my eyesight washed me out from even becoming an officer. My next plan was to join the Army and go armored cav, be a tanker like my dad. But then the Navy came along and flashed a lot of big enlistment bonus numbers in front of me, so I changed my mind and wound up as a nuclear mechanical operator running nuclear power plants on submarines. Which sucked. So I did my six years and got out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yeah, all sorts of war stories, history, interesting stuff to discuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice story you got there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T06:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone interested in WW2 Aviation?
