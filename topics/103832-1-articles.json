You being a pilot know that is FAST. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext if you look at your last screen shot, of the graph you are looking at 25km ASL, at Mach 4, and your level flight is going to be 15deg AoA. which is quite steep for a delta wing aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets take this aircraft for example, I wish I had taken pictures of the FAR readouts on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ynZSnIr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ynZSnIr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it is simple delta wing design with a tail, much like a Mig-21.

On the way to space the wings are there to minimise gravity losses and the powerplant is airbreathing because we\u0027re spending long enough at low altitudes that it\u0027s worth doing - the only maneuvering you\u0027re likely to do is to turn to align with your orbital insertion plane. Compared to optimising mach 4 high altitude flight - which really would want either drastic sweep or just minimal span - takeoff speed is really not worth optimising, I think.
