Check carefully how they connect and to what, if there are any asymmetries or too many things connected to light-ish parts it can lead to explosions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHeavy payloads connected by weak decouplers/docking ports, or insufficiently (auto)strutted in the bay/fairing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne that happens very often: with heavy rockets, make sure there is some room between the lowest part and the launch platform deck. The rocket will start with a spring motion downwards as gravity kicks in and before the launch clamps can stabilize it, which without headroom will bang it onto the platform, hard. No amount of launch clamps avoids this if you surpass certain weights, not even when placed at the bottom (the swinging will happen right through the clamps anyway).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA similar thing happens with heavy (space)planes, but not much you can do there to mitigate this due to unclamped \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E vessels stubbornly deciding their own launch height. You could try with launch clamps and \u0027dropping\u0027 it once stabilized, and experimentally finding the best compromise between swing room and drop height that allows it to survive for take off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIronically: too many launch clamps can be a cause too sometimes. Not exactly sure of the explanation for this one. If you have a lot of clamps, try removing a few. Or try separating them a bit away from the craft, with the offset tool... I\u0027ve come to accept \u0027magnetic clamping\u0027 as an inevitable workaround to avoid the clamps themselves from being the catalysts sometimes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFairing bases and TT-38-D decouplers have a tendency to almost unnoticeably break their top or bottom stack connection when the top is very heavy or even just from the initial swing motion when physics kick in. You can tell sometimes because the stack will \u0027lose\u0027 stages right when loading, or if you had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on and it suddenly turns grey as if you lost connection (you didn\u0027t, the vessel focus just went with the severed part of the vessel that does not have a core/manned cockpit). Explosions tend to follow very closely so it\u0027s hard to notice sometimes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are a few parts that have a tendency of creating in-vessel collisions/forces when clipped, even though this is supposed to never happen: most notably landing gear, wheels, the klaw, and kerbals in command seats.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlmost forgot, but this one is difficult to check for because the game does not show it and it doesn\u0027t happen consistently: if you do clip parts, especially heavy parts in symmetry, either ensure their (invisible!) collision meshes are well apart, or clipped a good bit into each other. If they are just barely overlapping, it sometimes causes them to violently push each other apart when physics kick in.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-18T14:20:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2017 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eone more\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
