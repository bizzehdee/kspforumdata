See image for comparison, diameter wise the can is almost twice the size of the bay top to bottom, side on, well it may be possible to re engineer a version that would sit 1 or two can positioned as in image, but as i say some of the trade off\u0027s may be unsatisfactory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sFBSeVQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sFBSeVQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T14:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour better off asking for a smaller lander can IMO.
