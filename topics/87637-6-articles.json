I just think that\u0027s too technical for a game. There\u0027s probably a lot of factors that go into exactly how much hydrogen evaporates or whatever it is. I suspect it would be too difficult to implement. Having perfect reaction ratios is enough IMO. I\u0027d love KSP to be a sim, but even I have my limits.

My point was that to find out what what ratios of fuel and oxidizer to use in KSP engines, you should look at real-life rockets to find out the ratios they use...because there is more to designing an engine than getting a 100% burn of fuel and oxidizer. You may need to use more or less propellant or fuel to cool the engine. You may want to use more hydrogen in an LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E/LOX engine because unburned hydrogen in the exhaust makes the average molecular weight of the exhaust gas lighter, and therefore results in higher exhaust velocity and greater I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E. But you don\u0027t need to simulate that in the game. You just get your propellant usage ratios from real-life rocket engineering and build them into the game. Why be less realistic than you need to be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to point out that liquid hydrogen is not a good match for liquid fuel in KSP. The tanks would need to be huge. You simply can\u0027t get the mass of fuel we use into the size tanks we use if it\u0027s hydrogen.

I mean does is there any practical sense in collecting ammonia on laythe, returning it to orbit, carting it to duna and mixing it with water when you could just launch more fuel at kerbin for cheaper?

A simple \u0022poke your drill into one place and get everything you need\u0022 is too easy to be appealing to me. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d want to haul ammonia from Laythe to Duna...I was thinking of shorter trips than that. Anyway, I would expect that you could get ammonia and water on Laythe, and just make fuel and oxidizer that you could ship to Duna.

The spectra of comet tails indicates that ammonia ice is part of their makeup, so icy bodies or bodies with subsurface ice could be expected to have some. Some people have suggested that Laythe\u0027s oceans are a mix of water and ammonia. Tylo seems strangely lacking in volatiles (since it lacks an atmosphere), so I wouldn\u0027t necessarily expect to find it there...but maybe there are nitrates in the rocks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in any case...I really don\u0027t want to ponder this whole thing TOO much just because if I DO come up with some idea for how to do resources that I really like, I\u0027ll just be all the more disappointed with what Squad comes up with if it\u0027s different (as it likely would be).

I came into KSP as a space enthusiast with very little physics education and despite being a somewhat bright person I struggled mightily with figuring out how to build ships and get around in orbit and with developing my piloting skills.
