Add to that lots of people and a precise aim!

So, Torres secretly funded the (now-defunct) shipbuilding company Changzheng to construct a one-man ballistic submarine called the S.M.G. \u003Cem\u003ESalvation\u003C/em\u003E. Some time after his discharge, his hidden funds were running dry and he heard from one of his old navy buddies that the Marxan police were on to his operation. Refusing to be stopped, he forced his way to the incomplete prototype and set sail. Though the submarine could navigate its way through the seas with excellence, its defense and missile launch systems were not ready yet - and the engineers had not yet labeled the buttons. Fearing a retaliatory strike in case Torres\u0027 plan succeeded, Marx\u0027s government warned Kerbin\u0027s air force about him and told them where to expect him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter Torres had surfaced, he noticed dozens of fighters - Marxan \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/207707-united-states-air-force-museum-replica-collection/?do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=4307175\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EFishbeds\u003C/a\u003E among them - approaching him. The \u003Cem\u003ESalvation\u003C/em\u003E carried surface-to-air missiles, so he had expected to hold off the attackers long enough to fire without a hitch. However, since the engineers at Changzheng had not yet separated the weapons controls from the navigation systems, Torres lost his primary target every time he aimed to take out a plane. He then saw the big red encased button in the middle of the sub and punched it, hoping to prepare the missile for launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat he did not know was that it was the button to activate\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESalvation\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s self-destruct sequence.
