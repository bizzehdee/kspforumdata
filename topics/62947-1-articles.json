Here are a few examples that i came up with. sure they aren\u0027t totally necessary, but it does shave down on parts count and engineering your rocket, and for certain designs, you can only cram so many solar panels/engines and add more flexibility when designing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolar panels:\u003C/strong\u003E Form the small solar panels, we go from 2 e/s to 18 e/s with the gigantor. Perhaps a 2x6 solar panel with 4 e/s like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi57.tinypic.com/2h4lxsz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222h4lxsz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a 2x9 with 6 e/s as well. Also larger static solar panels would be nice for atmospheric ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERocket engines:\u003C/strong\u003E Maybe a engine in between the skipper and mainsail with 900-1000 Kn of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have been arguing that the 48-7s is better than the 909. 48-7s is supposed to be better than it\u0027s radial counterpart, but it should not outpace the 909. Perhaps drop the thrust from 30 to 25 (still better than the 24-77) Maybe buff the lv-909 to 60 kn of thrust? Also if that\u0027s the rule, the inline LV-1 should be buffed (maybe from 1.5 to 2 Kn?) to be a little better than the LV-1R as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore ideas coming soon\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-12T05:29:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2014 05:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteWeasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
