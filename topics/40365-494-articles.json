Is that the reason you did it? Just to make it less of an ultimate technology? After all that Infrastructure and Science investment... you killed AM isp. I can\u0027t stop these tears of betrayal. I might have to just use the 10.0 settings. I really don\u0027t want to have to redesign all of my best ships. The temps inside the AM reactor are insane! Hence the higher ISP!
