It\u0027s a fun pastime than can be a great way to stay sharp with development skills and lets you be extremely creative. There\u0027s nothing wrong with tinkering with an existing program/demo in order to find out how it ticks; it\u0027s a great way to learn. Keep at it and you\u0027ll be amazed at how rewarding it can be. I wouldn\u0027t really recommend showing off something like Earlybird as it is now as \u0022your own game\u0022 as it could be viewed as disingenuous to some people. If it\u0027s just a personal project you\u0027re kicking around, that\u0027s cool. Just let us know, more power to you. If I could offer one suggestion, it would be to find a specific idea or something you are interested in and focus on it. In the case of Earlybird you have a working base program already made for you courtesy of Unity. That\u0027s great for starting out! Ask yourself, \u0022What do I want do with this game?\u0022 and more importantly, \u0022How will I do it?\u0022. Be specific though, things like \u0022Make it totally rad!\u0022 are fine but hard to know how to get to where you\u0027re going. Try and find a goal that you will be able to tell when you\u0027ve reached it and how you\u0027ll get to reaching it. Any problem or goal can be achieved if you break it down into manageable parts. Take what you\u0027ve learned from each part and use it to make the game into something more and, more importantly, something of your own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, if you have time I\u0027d strongly recommend reading some game \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pixelprospector.com/the-big-list-of-postmortems/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epostmortems\u003C/a\u003E. They\u0027re a great way to see how different studios and groups handle development and all manner of things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
