\u00A0I then downloaded a fresh install, bought dlc.\u00A0 Then proceeded\u00A0\u00A0to play a new vanilla game.\u00A0 \u00A0 Within an hour of playing I found a bug that disabled my ability to finish further contracts and even reach new milestones, such as orbit, which I tried.\u00A0 \u00A0I was a little annoyed but have never witnessed a game breaking bug in ksp before so thought maybe it was a fluke.\u00A0 Started a new save file and within an hour again the same bug.\u00A0 \u00A0I had by this time figured out, I think, what was causing the bug.\u00A0 So I used debug menu to give my self enough cash to lvl fully the building with contracts available in it.\u00A0 \u00A0I then avoided all missions with tourists in them.\u00A0 \u00A0This seemed to work and I got 20\u002B hours in on my 3rd save.\u00A0 \u00A0 Then i was working on a contract to save someone stranded in space, and this time there was one of the new capsules.\u00A0 \u00A0I thought little about it and proceeded with mission.\u00A0 \u00A0As soon as I switched to the new capsule i got an error message on my screen.\u00A0 \u00A0and again found myself unable to do anything with contracts.\u00A0 \u00A0I decided since i could no longer use contracts and didnt want to waist all my time or start a new save file, to treat my current save file as a science only play through.\u00A0 So I went to the moon and was going to land, when low and behold, yet another bug......\u00A0 At which point i threw my hands up in disgust and exited game.\u00A0 \u00A0I have seen a few other minor bugs to that are mainly graphical.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0But game seems to be unplayable to me atm.\u00A0 Going to give it a few weeks...\u00A0 Hope i dont have to reinstall 1.3 again in a month.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T01:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

mods...\u00A0 First time that I have done so.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I am used to 2.5x scale mod, which makes things much harder, I see now.\u00A0 \u00A0 Anyway lol I have maxed tech already, and have barely touched minmus or kerbal science points.\u00A0 \u00A0Just have a station above minmus\u00A0 that gave me all the science that I needed to max everything out.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I built one above the Mun too, but have not even bothered landing on the Mun yet, as why bother....\u00A0 \u00A0 The science alone from putting a station into orbit around the Mun gave me at least 2k science.\u00A0 \u00A0 That with the 5k science i got from Minmus station after only having landed on two spots, gave me enough science to nearly max science tree out.\u00A0 I have sent two probes out of system to the closest two planets to the Sun, but only got 300 or so science for that.\u00A0 \u00A0 Perhaps Take Two could spend some time making an actual career mode, that informs you of difficulty before you start a vanilla play through.\u00A0 \u00A0 Instead what we got was.......\u00A0 \u00A0Drum Roll please........\u00A0 \u00A0Missions!!!!!!!!!!!\u00A0 \u00A0 Yes missions, do exactly nothing for base game play.\u00A0 \u00A0We did get a few more parts, yes....\u00A0 \u00A0Mods already did a great job of that task.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 What seems to be lacking from this game is only in the career mode and overall scale of the universe.\u00A0 \u00A0Mods have covered the later well, but the former is really out of modding hands and if polished off could add so much dimension to this game that its not even fathomable to the Devs, apparently.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR :\u00A0 \u00A0Ksp is currently a AA game, for 40 USD.\u00A0\u00A0 DLC\u00A0 Worth 3.50 USD.\u00A0 \u00A0KSP, has potential to be a AAAAA game\u00A0 Worth 70 USD for base game.\u00A0 \u00A0 On top of that if Take Two was smart, they would offer \u0022cosmetic DCL\u0022\u00A0 for those who have extra money to spend on a game they love.\u00A0 \u00A0 Updates should be done bi annually, to give modding community time to keep up, and all Updates should be major, adding AAA content into the game.\u00A0 \u00A0 Take two has enough money to make this game into what it should be.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Will you take up the challenge, Take
