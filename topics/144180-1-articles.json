Right now I stuck in low orbit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T03:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim sure we will get some good answers, but ill do my best in a half asses way. im a relative novice i guess.\u00A0 your burn point for the node doesnt have to be to perfect, especially if your just testing the waters to get there.\u00A0 If you place the moon at 12oclock,\u00A0 i generally place my node at 4-430, no idea how efficient that is but works for me even when flying without nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand im a bit confused what you mean about pulling it back, but it sounds like you are still holding the prograde simple?\u00A0\u00A0 if so its a simple mistake, as instead you must grab the retrograde and pull on it to cancel out that extra bit you didnt want.\u00A0 youll get the hang of it!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe cumbersome map is something you will have to learn to cope with, as its the same way on PC.\u00A0 Especially when you get to interplanetary stuff lol\u00A0 its good to practice focused on the moon or minmus and adjusting your nodes with them way off in the background to get ready.\u00A0 its one of the things i did lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"danowat","CreatedById":166732,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T07:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole map view is broken on consoles, you can\u0027t select waypoints, controls freeze, the maneuver mode sometimes doesn\u0027t work, the camera is difficult to orientate, the writing on the periapsis and apsis are tiny, \u00A0despite scaling the UI, the controls are overly sensative and the slow down control doesn\u0027t always work in map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketOReilly","CreatedById":166801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-23T13:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks DD, \u00A0your suggestion to\u00A0place the\u00A0moon at 12 o\u0027clock helps a lot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
