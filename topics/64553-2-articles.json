I particularly like how NPM has an indicator like \u0022last updated 2 months ago\u0022. For mods, another decent indicator could be the KSP version when the mod was released.

Some projects are licensed such that anyone can distribute the work, so that\u0027s fine. As you mention, direct-linking can bypass such license restrictions, which isn\u0027t an intended effect. My personal opinion is that direct-linking isn\u0027t worth what it costs. If a modder isn\u0027t comfortable with the repository hosting files, he can give feedback on why.

As mentioned, having a comprehensive listing is very important for such a project and both users and mod developers tend to be lazy. That means who ever launches first to get a head start will most likely win, regardless of its usability features (competing against spaceport with lots of modders behind you is one thing, but but an open competition sth else).

I have doubts about both the efficacy and necessity of this. I doubt its efficacy because I\u0027ve seen too many cases on the forums where the masses get it wrong. I doubt its necessity because ultimately, only the mod developer can say whether a plugin is intended for use with a particular KSP version. Yes, an unmaintained mod might still appear to work in a newer version\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand this is the sort of information, with all its caveats, that\u0027s best communicated on forums.

You offer a middle ground where comments are highly restricted, but again, I wonder what the point is.

The most obvious push method would be an email (w/user selectable frequency). For a passive notification, logging on to the site would yield a notification icon that would link to a page listing mods that are newer than the version last downloaded by the user. This requires two significant elements. First, users must be logged in when downloading for this to be tracked. However, requiring registration as a barrier to entry is probably not what we want. Second, date and version of download must be tracked by the server for logged-in users.

First, when a mod is uploaded it will be required to have some version information. The key element is that ordering must be easily obtained. A simple comparison of two versions must be able to determine which one is later. Furthermore, when a mod is updated by the author, it must have a version that is higher than the last uploaded version. This allows for update notifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of versioning is more version archiving. This would mean that versions other than the current mod are stored on the server, and can be downloaded by users. The main purpose for this would be to allow users to download versions of mods that are compatible with historic versions of KSP. It might be useful to allow some author curation of these archives, say to remove a version that has a catastrophic bug.

We already have to support our own mods, other people\u0027s mods (since bugs are mis-attributed when multiple mods are in use), and KSP itself (since some stock bugs are exacerbated by mod behavior). A mod manager of any kind will simply be one more thing that we have to support, since everyone will blame the mod author for a botched installation, not the author of a mod manager; it\u0027s even worse since Nexus has a 3rd party mod manager not even intended for KSP alone, which means there are likely to be more issues with it. If some type of issue comes up, I\u0027ll need to change my mod to get around whatever edge case in the manager it\u0027s hitting, even if it\u0027s otherwise perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on how the mod manager handles dependencies (are they bundled with the mod download, or is the manager supposed to find and download all the dependencies?) users who don\u0027t want anything to do with the mod manager for security reasons or because their favorite mods have issues with it can end up having a much harder time dealing with the installation of mods that involve any kind of dependency. It basically pressures users into using software that they don\u0027t want to because the distribution standard punishes anyone who doesn\u0027t use the mod manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, it lowers the barrier to entry below the already stupidly low bar that it\u0027s currently at. Currently a mod user has to have a minimal understanding of how to navigate directories and move files around, which is pretty much Using a Computer 101. What happens when we have to deal with users who can\u0027t do that? Users who report bugs, but can\u0027t even be lead to the output_log.txt, or that treat programming more as some kind of magic voodoo that we just make happen rather than carefully figuring out how to make the computer do exactly what we want. It\u0027ll just give all of us more support trouble to deal with and there\u0027s no incentive on our end; it\u0027s not like any of us get paid by the download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic, I think that most of what Trueborn put down is good, but I\u0027d ask that we get free control over what type of tags we set in the mod metadata.

Either by limiting the number of tags, grouping them up, or having that be a thing users can flag; however it gets done, abusing tags is harmful to the system as a whole.

With Spaceport, it sometimes takes hours for for an update to go live, which causes this infuriating period where you have told players that you updated, but they\u0027re not downloading the new archive that you gave spaceport; so you\u0027re getting all these confused people reporting bugs because either the last version was incompatable or they\u0027re not able to use the new feature or whatever, point is you get pissed off and punch a hole through a dog.
