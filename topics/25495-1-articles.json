It had 5 major separation events, two of which (outboard strap-on decoupling and second stage engaging) had a good change (20\u002B% of crippling the craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Egu96yu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Egu96yu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new launcher uses 2 liquid fueled engines and 2 solid fuel engines (counting escape tower), ~10,000 units of solid fuel (which I\u0027m writing off as very cheap in my faux-campaign space program), and only ~6,000 units of liquid fuel. It gets the CM to orbit with a decent amount of fuel left in the large second stage, which is great because it can make it out to geostationary orbits and to orbiting ships bound for Duna without issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yPwIadH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yPwIadH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve changed the RCS placement, tanks and thrusters, so that it doesn\u0027t bear any significant weight as the KW RCS tanks are nasty in that they wobble like jello.

It\u0027s why god created Sepatrons. At the separating stage find the mid point of the boosters and place sepatrons firing away from the main body but at 45 degrees away so the thrust hits the other boosters rather than the main body. Get it right and the boosters will peel away rather than crippling your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
