I don\u0027t need to land on the moon and take back off as I\u0027m leaving a probe on the moon and a science station in orbit. The vehicle I\u0027m using would need to re-establish a stable orbit around kerbin too as its re-usable. Also if I was going to mine one of jools moons which one would be the best to bring ore to laythe orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current craft has just short of 7000 delta V and would be more efficient after releasing its payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T12:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime for a deltaV map.
