This is because the game doesn\u0027t keep track of ore and fuel production for craft which are on rails. When you go back to it, the game checks how much time has gone by and then calculates chunks of that time (6 hours, I think) to see what is produced and consumed. If you have a tiny ore tank, it will be filled too quickly and you\u0027ll get very little fuel per chunk of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also means that when you want to get the best out of your mining operation, make sure that when you go away, it is working optimally (100% efficiency, plenty of room for ore and fuel, full batteries etc.). I\u0027m not sure how complex the \u0022return-to-craft\u0022 calculations are (like, for example, do they apply a day/night cycle for solar power?), but I\u0027ve had some odd results before with far too little produced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne final thing to take into consideration: ore tank connecting nodes, especially for the large ore tank, are \u003Cu\u003Eextremely weak\u003C/u\u003E. Weaker than 1.25m fuel tank nodes.
