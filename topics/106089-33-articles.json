If your rocket is just meant to go up to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and come back down, it\u0027s probably not worth using cryogenic engines, but they\u0027re much more economical if it\u0027s going to be spending most of its time in space, where bulky fuel tanks don\u0027t matter.  For example: a crew transport used to move kerbals between a station orbiting Kerbin and one orbiting the Mun.  Cryo/nuke engines let you make more trips back and forth before having to refuel.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you mine asteroids to refuel your craft in orbit (which is generally cheaper than launching tankers from Kerbin), LH2 will give you more total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from each asteroid.\n\u003E \n\nOk so that\u0027s the all point in using Cryogenic Engines?

LH2 is less dense than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, so the same-sized tank only holds about half as much fuel mass.  You need to use a bigger tank.\n\nHere\u0027s a better comparison.  Build a ship with a stock Mk1-2 command pod, stock 2.5m monopropellant tank, stock Rockomax X200-16 fuel tank, and stock Poodle engine.  It weighs 18.27 tons and gets 1977m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.  Then replace the fuel tank and engine with a HI-M-21 hydrogen tank, configured for LH2/O, and CT2X \u0022Tunguska\u0022 engine.  It weighs 19.31 tons and gets 2293m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.  That\u0027s 16% more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for just 6% more mass.  (And note that it\u0027s only 6% more mass even though the LH2/O fuel tank is physically twice as big as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O one.)\n\n(The command pod and monopropellant tank are just to have some extra mass besides the propulsion system.  Comparing just the fuel tank and engine alone, there\u0027s much less of a difference in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E because the Tunguska engine weighs more than a Poodle, which offsets its greater efficiency.  But on a real spacecraft, that difference is a smaller fraction of the total mass.)\n\n(**Edit:** The \u0022HI-M-21\u0022 tank mentioned above is now named \u0022H250-64\u0022 in later versions of the mod, and has *slightly* different stats, so the ship will weigh 19.526 tons and have 2260m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.
