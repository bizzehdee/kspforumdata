Hoping someone else knows of this or can reproduce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0RoveMax Model XL3 wheels have a very interesting behavior in my game. They appear to be able to drive a vehicle much faster than the motor max speed suggests while turning and going forward. I was able to make a runway dragster hit 150 \u00A0m/s on EC alone! I did this simply\u00A0by holding forward and alternating turn keys. I suspect that turning and going forward glitches to make the motor\u00A0produce way more power than 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
