Multiplayer adds almost nothing that can\u0027t be accomplished by sharing a save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that resources would be localized would give players new tasks (map and sample resource distributions, deliver hardware to gather/process resources, deliver infrastructure to get resources off planet, and it would also add a useful purpose for space stations), but it would also invoke or strengthen the importance of new skills (targeted landings and larger-scale mission architecture planning). It also gives more opportunities for the devs to challenge us in different ways on each world (put resource-rich areas only near the poles of one planet, or have one planet with propellium at the equator and oxium at the poles, Duna and Ike have complementary sets of resources, requiring you to develop a method of transporting material between them, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer adds... what exactly? Docking is a one-player operation. Two players trying to actively dock with one another would be annoying, so what will usually happen is one player will just point at the other and hold his craft still while the other docks. That is exactly zero percent fun for one player and exactly the same amount of fun as solo mode would be for the other player. You can do things like build a space station together... which you can already do by sharing save files. You can race each other to the Mun... which you can do by just setting your laptops on the same table, or calling each other on speakerphone. You can fight each other... but KSP isn\u0027t a war game, and the devs don\u0027t want it to be a war game! I just fail to see much reason you would want to add multiplayer to this game that can\u0027t be done already. The best I can come up with is that you could simulate a Falcon 9 or White Knight/Spaceship 1 reusable mission where one of you flies the first stage back to the launch pad while the other flies the second stage into orbit. But then part of the excuse given by Harv during the interview as to why resources weren\u0027t fun was that they required you to master the game to use them. I feel like being able to design and use a reusable, multi-stage launch vehicle comes pretty close to being a master of KSP. And yes, at the far end, resource utilization in some ways can be as difficult to make use of, but there are many simple applications that most people could simply bolt on to their missions (Say, attach a processor and drill to your Mun lander to refuel your ship after landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf resources are complicated, then why are we adding parts specifically designed for space planes? It doesn\u0027t get much more complicated than balancing the CoL, CoM, and CoT in a space plane and also trying to find places for all the parts and remembering that the weight will shift around during flight. It\u0027s certainly more complicated than \u0022you need a drill and a processor and an extra tank to mine resources\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fail to see a single reason why multiplayer makes sense but resources do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to say that I\u0027m not trying to be rude or angry, I\u0027m just honestly pointing out how\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cesarcurado","CreatedById":60073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T02:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Horn Brain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Horn Brain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe following is my opinion.
