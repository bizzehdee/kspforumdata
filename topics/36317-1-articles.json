Right now, it is tearing through the cold void to Duna. It will enter orbit around Duna, the lander will detach, and make history. Then it will make the climb back into orbit, redock to the mothership, and come back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/361/f/b/aerobrake_by_smpritchard-d4keeiq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aerobrake_by_smpritchard-d4keeiq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my entire voyage, my mother ship can only use 3,616 m/s of delt-v. Already, I\u0027ve used about 1,020 m/s for trans-Duna injection. The less I can use to enter a stable orbit around Duna, the better. So, aerocapture is the best way to go. However, if the entry into the atmosphere is too shallow, I\u0027ll just skip off, going back into Solar orbit. Too deep, and the whole thing will rendezvous with the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is: Assuming a near-perfect TDI (I had the assistance of protractor), what should my closest approach be to enter a nice, relatively low orbit around Duna (closer than Ike), without assistance from thr main engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Yes, I know that I\u0027ll need the engines to raise the periapsis after the aerocapture.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-08T15:53:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2013 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Drunkrobot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBeen answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T14:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on my own experience, 10.5 Km is the perfect altitude to aim for. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever\u003C/strong\u003E, Dunas atmosphere is very picky, going just slightly too low will have disastrous consequences,.
