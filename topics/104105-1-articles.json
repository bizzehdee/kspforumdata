It\u0027s actually pretty easy to build something with 6000-8000 m/s dV, but from then one it\u0027s hell. Lightest build so far had 400t. I have no idea how to get that into LKO or land it on Eve...\n\nSo, tell me, what did you build to get down to Eve and back up?

If your efficiency is 6 liters/100km (~40mpg) and you want to go 200km, you carry 12 liters of fuel. If you want to go 500km, you need 30 liters. If you want to go 10,000 km--well, that\u0027s when it starts to go non-linear, as carrying 600 liters around is going to hurt your fuel economy. Up to that point it really doesn\u0027t matter, because over the ranges involved in surface transport it does not take many grams of fuel to move around. \n\nBut fighting gravity, ESPECIALLY Eve\u0027s gravity, costs loads of fuel. *And it costs fuel to lift fuel.* It\u0027s easy to build a ship that weighs about 10tons, has enough thrust to lift on Eve, and gets 1000dV. But then you have to add a stage to lift 10t of dead weight for the next 1000dV, and maybe that stage weighs 15 tons. Now you have 25t of dead weight to lift for the next 1000dV, and maybe that next stage weighs 30tons. Etc, etc, etc. \n\nYou probably know all this, but getting familiar with the math really helps. If you can do logarithms, you can solve dV equations by hand rather than relying on mods like KER.

This limit derives directly from the fuel mass fraction of the fuel tanks used in that stage.\n\nWithout going into detail here (though I could if you wanted to see math), that limit for LF/O in Kerbal Space Program is 21.5 times the stage\u0027s Isp. That\u0027s the theoretical maximum, for carrying the entire observable universe\u0027s mass in fuel while using only massless parts for everything else, including a massless engine. In practical application, you\u0027ll find 20 times impossible to achieve and 15 times still a major chore. Most rocket stages in KSP have around 10 times their Isp in dV, which is a reasonably efficient middle ground between the diminishing returns of staging too often and the diminishing returns of trying to cram too much fuel into one stage. For really high performance cases like Eve return missions, though, you probably want to shift the balance towards a higher dV number per stage simply because you\u0027d like for things to remain somewhat compact."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T17:15:58Z","Content":"I just successfully completed my first manned launch from Eve. It took what essentially amounted to eight stages, giving me a total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of about 12.8 km/s. In simulations I determined it could achieve Eve orbit from an elevation as low as 500 m, though I launched it from about 900 m. From that elevation I got into a 120 km orbit with 200 m/s to spare. All I launched was a Kerbal in a command seat and my total liftoff mass was 83 tonnes (the landed mass was 91 tonnes). The total delivered to orbit was about 320 kg. I also did an unmanned practice launch using a smaller design (also capable of 12.8 km/s). The unmanned version delivered a little over 200 kg to orbit with a launch mass of 51 tonnes.\n\nIn both cases I\u0027m getting a payload fraction of only about 0.004. There are probably others who have done better than that, but the point is, it takes a huge vehicle to launch a small mass from Eve.

That is, the best you could ever hope for (in KSP), assuming no other parts have mass, is:\n\nExample A.\n\nLn(9.3/1) ~ 2.23\n\n2.23\\*Isp\\*G = ~17,483 Dv for the best engine in the game (The LV-N).\n\nBut to get close to that, you have to have only one engine, and so many fuel tanks that the cockpit and rocket motor have a negligible fraction of the weight. (hint, it would be MASSIVE, and have a thrust to mass ratio so low it would be practically useless)\n\nIf you used a rocket motor with more umph, you get more thrust, but less ISP. The theoretical best (assuming a 9.33:1 full/empty ratio) looks like this:\n\nExample B.\n\nLn(9.3)\\*370\\*9.8 = 8,099 Dv. A far cry less than 10,000.\n\nNow, you can get over 10,000 by adding staging, but doing so requires you to add the entire upper stage as part of the empty mass of the stage below.\n\nBut if we turn the math around for the bottom stage (let\u0027s assume the upper stage looks like the one in example ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) we need only 2000 more Dv.

FLT-800 \u002B Aerospike is the basic building block for most Eve lifters, but if you take that to it\u0027s logical extreme, you first stages will run for like 5 seconds each. You may want to try Skippers with Rockomax-32 tanks at least for the outer stages. Performs well and has no overheating troubles. If you need even bigger stages, the Kerbodyne Quad Cluster isn\u0027t half bad.\n\nStay away from Mk3 parts, or get the Joint Reinforcement mod. In the stock game, vessels built of Mk3 parts tend to fall apart at the slightest provocation; trying to land them on Eve is frustrating to the highest degree.\n\nMost Eve landers can SSTO to LKO if you increase their fuel capacity by ~20%. Someone who\u0027s more math-savy than I am could probably tell you why this is so; I only know from experience that adding a small number of large tanks will take you to orbit in one piece. Refueling them in orbit usually isn\u0027t much of a problem; the big big tanker may be 150 parts on the pad, but by the time the vessels meet in orbit the tanker will be like 7 large tanks plus perhaps 20 bits an pieces (rcs, probe core, etc). The real problem with oversized vessels is that refueling them requires you to do three or five runs.\n\nEve is relatively close. If you\u0027re constrained by part count, you may find that just slapping on a few more tanks (like, re-using those from the launch) and doing the transfer on the lifter engines is totally affordable, while adding Nukes for the transfer will either lead to a very low TWR, or drive up the part count, or both. \n\nThe most lightweight way to carry a kerbal is the external seat; next comes the one-man lander can. Three lander cans weigh much less than a three-man pod, and accordingly, the lifter can be much smaller. Try it, the difference is huge.\n\nYou don\u0027t need many parachutes if you\u0027re willing to do a powered landing, which is not as difficult as it sounds. 150m/s worth of fuel is plenty. Carrying a few chutes ensures that you\u0027re pointed upwards and don\u0027t have to worry about steering, which helps a lot.\n\nThe best landing gear, ever, is the Liquid Fuel Booster.

You can slam down the vessel really hard, using only very few chutes and no thrust at all. It looks scary but is totally safe, *if* have enough ground clearance for your other engines. If you have the rest of the vessel stacked on top of the LFBs, it\u0027s advisable to slip in reaction wheels. Those seem to work as suspension, much like the cartilage discs in your spine.\n\nThe main benefit of LFBs as landing gear is part count.
