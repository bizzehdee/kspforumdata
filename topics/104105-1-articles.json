If your efficiency is 6 liters/100km (~40mpg) and you want to go 200km, you carry 12 liters of fuel. If you want to go 500km, you need 30 liters. If you want to go 10,000 km--well, that\u0027s when it starts to go non-linear, as carrying 600 liters around is going to hurt your fuel economy. Up to that point it really doesn\u0027t matter, because over the ranges involved in surface transport it does not take many grams of fuel to move around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut fighting gravity, ESPECIALLY Eve\u0027s gravity, costs loads of fuel. \u003Cem\u003EAnd it costs fuel to lift fuel.\u003C/em\u003E It\u0027s easy to build a ship that weighs about 10tons, has enough thrust to lift on Eve, and gets 1000dV. But then you have to add a stage to lift 10t of dead weight for the next 1000dV, and maybe that stage weighs 15 tons. Now you have 25t of dead weight to lift for the next 1000dV, and maybe that next stage weighs 30tons.

In simulations I determined it could achieve Eve orbit from an elevation as low as 500 m, though I launched it from about 900 m. From that elevation I got into a 120 km orbit with 200 m/s to spare. All I launched was a Kerbal in a command seat and my total liftoff mass was 83 tonnes (the landed mass was 91 tonnes). The total delivered to orbit was about 320 kg.

Someone who\u0027s more math-savy than I am could probably tell you why this is so; I only know from experience that adding a small number of large tanks will take you to orbit in one piece. Refueling them in orbit usually isn\u0027t much of a problem; the big big tanker may be 150 parts on the pad, but by the time the vessels meet in orbit the tanker will be like 7 large tanks plus perhaps 20 bits an pieces (rcs, probe core, etc). The real problem with oversized vessels is that refueling them requires you to do three or five runs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is relatively close. If you\u0027re constrained by part count, you may find that just slapping on a few more tanks (like, re-using those from the launch) and doing the transfer on the lifter engines is totally affordable, while adding Nukes for the transfer will either lead to a very low TWR, or drive up the part count, or both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most lightweight way to carry a kerbal is the external seat; next comes the one-man lander can.

You can slam down the vessel really hard, using only very few chutes and no thrust at all. It looks scary but is totally safe, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E have enough ground clearance for your other engines. If you have the rest of the vessel stacked on top of the LFBs, it\u0027s advisable to slip in reaction wheels. Those seem to work as suspension, much like the cartilage discs in your spine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main benefit of LFBs as landing gear is part count. If you optimize for weight, cubic struts will serve you better. LFBs also aren\u0027t bad for a first stage. Yes, their ISP is abysmal, but for a first stage that hardly matters. Most of the first stage fuel is burnt in later stages\u0027 engines, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rockbloodystar","CreatedById":59828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T15:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114250-Eve-misson-tips\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114250-Eve-misson-tips\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E paying it forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T19:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGeneric advice re: Eve landers:\u003Cp\u003EThe most lightweight way to carry a kerbal is the external seat; next comes the one-man lander can. Three lander cans weigh much less than a three-man pod, and accordingly, the lifter can be much smaller. Try it, the difference is huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to take 3 kerbals to Eve with a single container, then use the hitchhiker can (holds 4 kerbals), it only weighs 2.5t. That is what I used for my Eve Rocks submission a while back (see my signature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just ran another Eve mission with the three orange-suit guys using 3 of the small landing cans. This was not for the challenge, I just did it for fun with a sandbox game. I\u0027m thinking this design may be worse than my first one, but it also got the job done with 3 kerbals.
