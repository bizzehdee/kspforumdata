If the ISSs solar panel has a mass of 14000 kg. THe solar arrays are the most efficient power source in the inner solar system. If you imagine a ship that had two of these for a weight of 28000 kg, and you discount the weight ot the rest of the ship, the maximum amount of acceleration a 30,000 ISP ship can generate is 0.000012N or 12 micronewtons. This is an unviable setup except for traveling outside of planetary orbits because the amount of time required to break orbits disallows efficient use of both sun and periapsis. A ION thruster that has the same two solar panels, but instead only has 1500 ISP can produce and acceleration of 2.4 millinewtons of thrust.

They just won\u0027t let us build an interstellar civilization. It will be many disjoint civilizations of common origin that might share knowledge with each other. To really call it going to the stars, we need ability for people to reach other worlds within their life times. And short of FTL, that requires torch ships. And there are only two things that can power an interstellar torch ship. Antimatter or black hole. Because these are the only two things known to human kind that allow for sufficiently efficient matter-to-energy conversion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVirtual civilization live by sharing communications. What do you need, human x1ba23 has a new gene that is an improvement it can be found at chromosomal location 21p1.3_14531A\u0026gt;G. Civilization 2, great thanks will have it in the next embryo by tomorrow. Since we now can interpret that quantum entangled pairs can communicate (the issue is not making them stable), potentially you can communicate at near instantaneous speeds, and even if you can\u0027t you could send a communication probe every 10 years (without living being on board you prolly could get 0.01c. Since we can digitally transfer genetic information, the only limitation to virtual civilization is the speed of light. If we are using a FEP ship to seed new civilizations, by definition we are not traveling 100s of light years from a civilized starting point, so this means that you are no more than 100 ly for a transmission source, the solution to this problem is to improve communication with more powerful space receiving antennas and more powerful transmitters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there is nothing that states that a 100tonne fusion reactor will explode and blow up. Simply keep the reactor close to the surface, if their is a containment failure of the plasma simply open the ports into space. A second way, although not preferable is to have the reactors 10 to 100 meters off the side of the ship in a radial array, this allows better heat dissipation but does require more shielding. Problems that can be solved. Power supply - capacitors and batteries. Oscillators- redundancy and switching gears. HF generators - redundancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest single problem with generational ship is this, in order to reduce risk targets must be within\u00A0 a few light years. However there are no known potentially habitable targets within a few light years. But that was not a premise to the question, the basic assumption is that there are and we have not found them. I question the assumption to begin with. I think earth standard potentially habitable planets are few and far between, and more than likely to find one in the right stage of development you would need to travel 1000 ly. This is all fine and dandy but it may require a space phase of human evolution to reach them by hopping from survivable star with elemental resources, mining those resources, spawning new ships and repeating the process. And one has to beg the question if this is a requirement to reach habitable worlds, why make habitable worlds a target anyway. Simple set several ships out to the nearest stars, if there are no resources at close approach, change course and target the next closest star in the path until a habitable star is found, sure there will be mishaps were ships with 1000s of people perish, but OTOH you have now have occupancy of your neighboring stars, and stars like proxima Centauri will transport you to the stars in the interior of the galaxy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as we know there are no other sentients out there, so we do not need to speedy Gonzales across the galaxy to find those civilization and death star them, we can instead bide our time and create a network of travel stations and terraforming stops every here and there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is what an outmounted fusion electric/ion thruster pod might look like\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NEGpHX2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NEGpHX2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T18:55:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T18:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222410686\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002265930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455552038\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258968\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, AngelLestat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok, so you mean absorb all the heat and release it in a collimated way? \u00A0The problem with that approach that your radiator mass increase because you can only radiate using one size of the\u00A0surface. \u00A0But I guess it can be\u00A0manageable if we reach to the point that we can create such SBH, besides the mass of the black hole will be \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u00A0than the damper \u002B radiators I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, man, that totally slipped my mind.

Simple set several ships out to the nearest stars, if there are no resources at close approach, change course and target the next closest star in the path until a habitable star is found, sure there will be mishaps were ships with 1000s of people perish, but OTOH you have now have occupancy of your neighboring stars, and stars like proxima Centauri will transport you to the stars in the interior of the galaxy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all sounds a lot mor like sci-fantasy than the usual \u0022Magic-Propulsion\u0022 or \u0022Unlimited-Energie\u0022 devices.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0A LOT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can master technology and physics, but we cannot change human behaviour.

The argument is given the current limitations what is the most feasible, this is it, K2 as you note abdicated on his responsibility to tell us how he was going to produce a black hole at 10\u003Csup\u003E-19\u003C/sup\u003E meters in diameter. Everyone else has methods that are fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond on a ship that is .32 km in diameter there is ample enough room to grow food, to build factorys that can build fusion reactors, store dueterium and hydrogen (tritium cannot be store because it has a half life of only 12 years) or whatever the ship needs. One assumes that the ship is dominated by multitasking robots, that the supplies of raw materials are stocked on board, In addition in the center of the ship one could have a rotating habitation area capable of producing 1g for the inhabitants to work out or do other gravity requiring tasks (again at 0.32 km, this is not a particular problem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, given a fusion power reactor capable of producing 100 MW of power, you have a power supply that can potentially last generations, therefore all you need is a capacity to produce LEDs in the red and blue spectrum and you have food and oxygen. Fusion power gets its fuel from hydrogen, very little hydrogen is needed and potentially can be extracted from space using a collector at the front of the vessel, or could be carried on board. Product Helium would be used for impulse production. Again on a ship of 0.32 kilometers you can have several of these, so if one reactor goes down you have back ups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForth, since current energy requirement prevent speed of light, most you are going to see for a start/stop (which BTW even optimistically is impossibility) of 0.1C the collisions even a grain of sand or space dust in space, would be catastrophic. E = 1/2mv\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003Eour dust weighs .0000001 kg = 45000000 Joules. A 50 calibre car killing rifle bullet is 18,050 Joules, In other words you have 2500 times the amount of energy hitting 1/1000 th amount of space. The RML 8 inch howitzer (The type of artillary that can tear down a 12 inch concrete wall) produces a 26900100 is only half the amount of energy as that piece of space dust. So, yeah, fractional c has a big impact problem. At a million meters per second, that is 1/300th of C (1/30th of 0.1c) the relative kinetic energy of impacts is 0.1% so instead of that grain of dust hitting with a force of 2 howizter bullets it hits with about three times the energy as a a 50 calibre bullet, A covering of solid titanium about an inch thick can stop this. Somewhere around 5 million meters velocity relative to intergalactic medium is the practical safe limit of space travel, everything faster is risking almost certain catastrophe.
