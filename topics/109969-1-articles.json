Use a pilot for SAS and very gently nudge it toward the building you want. Don\u0027t tip more than a few degrees off vertical. Tiny throttle adjustments to maintain vertical speed while the mass of fuel is being shed. If you run out of fuel while over a building, pop the chute and you may fall on target anyway. It might take some practice to learn how to get from the launchpad or runway to the target building with minimal fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VySbTSf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VySbTSf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T22:45:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Torquimedes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T18:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use a simple basic jet to collect science from biomes all over Kerbin early-on. temperature, goo, science jr, crew reports, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The science builds up in a hurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steve_v\u0022 data-cite=\u0022steve_v\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can also get a decent amount of science with a low-tech VTOL around KSC - the roof of each building appears to have it\u0027s own biome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Yeah, I\u0027ve been playing for a *while* and I just figured that one out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteve V,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Isn\u0027t the rooftop the same biome as the grounds next to the building?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I built a simple jet cart to drive to each building and collect science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquimedes","CreatedById":137645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T18:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Isn\u0027t the rooftop the same biome as the grounds next to the building?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I built a simple jet cart to drive to each building and collect science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you get close enough to trigger the building biome from the ground?

I used to use those all the time. The easy way to land used to be to just pop the chute then repack it while you\u0027re on the ground, but now you need to use an engineer to repack chutes, so the flying is more difficult. Mods also help. Dazio\u0027s vertical velocity controller has some trouble with the spool up lag, but I was using it to tail land a full size jet, so maybe with the thrust limiter on the engine turned down it would manage better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be to find the throttle setting needed to hover and use RCS for rapid thrust changes since that\u0027s independant of throttle setting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing jets as a booster to get rockets up is also a great use for them.

Right click on an engine and wait till it gets to at least 90 to 95% of max thrust.

I used Kerbal Engineer to tweak the TWR to 2.0. For this particular craft that\u0027s 79% on the engine thrust limiter for those of you not running mods. I removed the oxidizer from the fuel tank but all the other tanks are full. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a 2.0 TWR you get hover thrust with 50% throttle. To take off you can use 50% throttle and just use the H key to fire the downward facing RCS jets or just throttle up to 55 to 60% then throttle back to 50 once you\u0027re in the air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo land start with 40 to 45% throttle then go back to 50% once you start to descend to maintain your descent rate. To slow your descent use short bursts of RCS and use X to cut your throttle when you touch down to keep from bouncing back up in the air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also use upward facing RCS to help manage your vertical speed but you\u0027ll use your monoprop quicker.
