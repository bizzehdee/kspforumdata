While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of 20 feet (6 m), which sliced off 3 feet (1 m) of the Panther\u0027s right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due to the loss of the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He intended to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, but his parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn March 22, 1956, he was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. As they climbed to 30,000 feet, the number-four engine stopped and the propeller began windmilling. The aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of 210 mph to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. At the instant of launch, the number four propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number three engine and hit the number two engine. [The pilot] and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number three engine, along with the number one engine, due to the torque it created. They made a slow, circling descent using only the number two engine, and landed safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis first flight in a rocket-powered aircraft was on August 15, 1957, in the Bell X-1B, to an altitude of 11.4 miles. On landing, the poorly designed nose landing gear failed...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nArmstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, he flew to a height of over 207,000 feet. He held up the aircraft nose for too long during its descent to demonstrate the MH-96\u0027s g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around 140,000 feet. He flew past the landing field at Mach 3 at over 100,000 feet, and ended up 40 miles south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he turned back toward the landing area, and landed, just missing Joshua trees at the south end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn April 24, 1962, Armstrong flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn May 21, 1962, Armstrong was involved in the \u0022Nellis Affair\u0022. He was sent in an F-104 to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude, and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base, past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tailhook to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33, but he almost landed long. The Nellis base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd at NASA:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGemini 8 launched on March 16, 1966, a rendezvous and docking with an unmanned Agena target vehicle. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with Gemini\u0027s attitude control. Armstrong engaged the Reentry Control System (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E) and turned off the OAMS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn May 6, 1968, while Armstrong was piloting the Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV) 100 feet above the ground, hi\u0027s controls started to degrade and the LLRV began rolling. He ejected safely. Later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time. His only injury was from biting his tongue. The LLRV was completely destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuly 20, 1969: Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the LM Eagle would probably touch down several miles beyond the planned landing zone. As the Eagle\u0027s landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. Even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what the 1202 and 1201 alarms meant. When Armstrong noticed they were heading toward a landing area which he believed was unsafe, he took over manual control of the LM, and attempted to find an area which seemed safer, taking longer than expected. Upon landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had 40 seconds left on their fuel, including the 20 seconds\u0027 worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort. While preparing for the liftoff from the lunar surface, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky spacesuits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed the circuit breaker in to activate the launch sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, let\u0027s be honest here.\u00A0 What are the chances of all this happening to one single pilot?
