As soon as you have access to docking ports you should almost never land with your actual ship (meant for travel back to kerbin) - as long as it isn\u0027t Eve, compact lander will do a lot better with smaller engines, better control and using a fraction of fuel you would burn otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile space stations may be fun, in stock game they aren\u0027t that useful. You could do just as good with one or two-use simple rocket consisting of tanks, engines and docking port. Scatter few on orbits you\u0027re gona visit, refuel main stuff, crash/terminate now useless tanker. I can\u0027t really say if that\u0027s feasible or not considering cost, money in ksp is kinda easy to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn actual space station that would be useful (I think) would be one consisting of fuel tanks (I mean excess fuel to spare), lab\u002Bkerbals and ofc docking port.

First you have to decide what you want to accomplish and design 1 or more payloads to do that/those job(s). This determines everything else in terms of how to get these payloads off the ground, out to wherever you plan to send them, and bring them back (optional). Without knowing what your payloads will be, it\u0027s impossible either to design their transportation system or give you any specific advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, however, there are a few pointers I\u0027ve found useful. First, if you\u0027re playing in career, payloads are usually relatively cheap compared to their required lift and transfer rockets. And the bigger the rocket parts you use, the more expensive the individual parts. So OT1H you want to minimize the number of launches because launches are more expensive than payloads. But OTOH, minimizing launches means launching bigger payloads, which need bigger, more expensive rockets. So there is a break-even point for cost between these 2 methods. I can\u0027t yet say exactly where it is but my experience so far indicates that if you can launch the payload with a fairly simple rocket (meaning a central stack with at most only a few SRBs and/or asparagus stacks), regardless of its diameter, this seems to be cheaper than herniating yourself with some colossal lifter or going nuts with small stages like you\u0027re trying to take off from Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T13:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as space stations go, I found it\u0027s best to build a highly modular central core and insert that into your desired orbit. Just have a probe core, some batteries and some control (reaction wheels / RCS) there, possibly a communications antenna. And then docking ports. Lots and lots of docking ports. That way your core itself doesn\u0027t get too heavy, and can be launched relatively painlessly. Everything else can then follow piece by piece, docked to one of the many available docking ports on the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example I built in low Kerbin orbit a few months ago: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot27.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot27.png\u003C/a\u003E (built in Better Than Starting Manned, which is why it has no reaction wheels at all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a 2.5m core built by sticking the flat rockomax adapters to the rockomax multihub. They fit perfectly that way, turning the 1.25m hub into a 2.5m hub. Then I just stacked them vertically, with RCS tanks in between as spacers so the ports are not too close together. You can stack as many as you want. The 4 free sides got plastered with 2.5m docking ports. Some batteries and a probe core and an antenna on top. Also a 2.5m docking port on the bottom. And because I felt like it, I also rotated the middle hub by 45 degrees so the available room will be utilized better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was kinda large, but surprisingly lightweight, especially with the RCS tanks empty. You can basically stick some expendable radial boosters to the RCS tanks instead of trying to place it on top of something (though with struts that might also work). That was the first launch. The second launch was the small 5-way docking assembly at the bottom. Third and fourth launches were the two solar arms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunches 5, 6, 7 and 8 were the four fuel tanks. Yes, those are maximum size kerbodyne tanks, and they were launched full. Each tank had a small 0.625m control unit attached to the rear of it - junior docking port, RCS tank, battery, probe core, a set of RCS thrusters and a rockomax 48-7S. After being put into orbit, the little engine was able to use fuel from the tank itself, because docking ports don\u0027t block fuel crossfeed (but can still be used just like a decoupler can). Thus the tank performed the station rendezvous on its own (cost only one or two percent of its contents), docked, and then decoupled that little control section. Which used the remaining RCS that it had to deorbit itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t continue building because I didn\u0027t really have a use for it then, but hey, maybe it serves as a useful example for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T13:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T13:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor stations, if you\u0027re not using something like KAS or Quantum Struts, wait until you have Sr docking ports, you\u0027ll benefit from the stability. And watch your part count on the station. You can design a tug to put your modules in place, or else arrange their RCS etc so it can be decoupled after the module is attached, so that you don\u0027t have loads of redundant hardware left around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor interplanetary ships, I would suggest a modular design with three parts, your orbiter, lander, and transfer stage, linked by docking ports. Whether you actually launch them separately or together is up to you. The lander can be left behind at the destination, though you might employ the trick of taking a probe core from it so the mission gets recorded as returning from the surface. The orbiter can land back on Kerbin. The key is the transfer stage - park that in Kerbin orbit, then you can refuel and reuse it for your next mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T14:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery generally speaking, launching one big ship (either station or interplanetary ship) is preferable to assembling in orbit from a structural standpoint.
