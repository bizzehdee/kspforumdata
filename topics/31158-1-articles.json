I disabled the fuel crossfeed when I re-launched the flight, and it didn\u0027t transfer, but when I attached it, all of the docking nodes had the crossfeed enabled, but the fuel wasn\u0027t passively transferring, so (assuming this wasn\u0027t some glitch), how do I get the docking nodes to passively transfer fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont know if it is possible. I have a vessel I use for inter-planetary deliveries that I dock fuel tanks to for the journey but I still have to manually transfer fuel even with fuel lines from docking port ot the main fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"csiler2","CreatedById":62800,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T21:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas your docking clamp attached to a decoupler or directly to the tank? I\u0027ve seen the same thing and I think that passive crossfeed happens when the docking clap attaches directly to a tank. Crossfeed won\u0027t happen when it\u0027s docked with another docking clamp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T02:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was incorrect about this, my vessel is properly feeding fuel even if tanks are docked after!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
