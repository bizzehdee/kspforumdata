It appears to have reverted my entire save including the git repository to a state 4 days ago. No clue how or why it happened, but from what I\u0027m seeing, Jebretary appears to be the only thing that could have caused this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, what I did was add a comment to my latest persistent file, then start up KSP. When I loaded my career save, I noticed the science amount listed was much lower than I remember from last night and sure enough, I was back to several days ago. Checking Jebretary showed the last quicksave and persistent save all around that time and nothing since (except for two persistent updates that have been created while i was clicking around to check on the state of things). My Ships directory has also been reverted to presumably around that same time. Since there\u0027s still KAC saves sitting in my career directory, I think it\u0027s safe to rule out any kind of filesystem issues (and also, thanks to KAC, I ended up losing only 4 or 5 hours of play)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a zip of my save directory, if there\u0027s any interest in attempting to do a post-mortem to see what may have caused this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smurphy34","CreatedById":73342,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T16:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this still being worked on/supported? \u00A0The D/L links in the OP are dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to use this tool ALL the time, loved what it could do and miss it in 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
