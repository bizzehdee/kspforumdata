If you know the minimal power requirements (which can also vary, depending on the instruments you run) to run Curiosity, the original output of the RTG, the half life value of the isotope plus the expected wear of the thermocouples (decreasing thermocouple efficiency actually is a larger loss than the radioactive decay) you can calculate the life span.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPete Theisinger, from MSL project manager at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory says \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com/16679-mars-rover-curiosity-nuclear-power-lifespan.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe RTG might have 10-15\u003C/a\u003E years based on the Plutonium, but that other components are far more likely to spoil the party. Which is a good point: mechanicals are much more likely to fail than the RTG itself. On reason he gives exact numbers are not knows is that parts are only tested to two to three times the mission time span.
