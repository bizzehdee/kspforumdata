If you know the minimal power requirements (which can also vary, depending on the instruments you run) to run Curiosity, the original output of the RTG, the half life value of the isotope plus the expected wear of the thermocouples (decreasing thermocouple efficiency actually is a larger loss than the radioactive decay) you can calculate the life span.\n\nPete Theisinger, from MSL project manager at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory says [the RTG might have 10-15](http://www.space.com/16679-mars-rover-curiosity-nuclear-power-lifespan.html) years based on the Plutonium, but that other components are far more likely to spoil the party. Which is a good point: mechanicals are much more likely to fail than the RTG itself. On reason he gives exact numbers are not knows is that parts are only tested to two to three times the mission time span. Anything beyond that is a guessing game, so part wear might level off, increase dramatically or anything in between.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T00:31:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:39:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The rate at which an RTG decays isn\u0027t controllable, increasing the power draw won\u0027t make it decay faster, since an RTG\u0027s heat comes from radioactive decay, not fission.\n\nWhat he is saying is that if solar adds X and RTG adds Y and the rover needs X \u002B 0.5Y to function, then when the power output drops by 50% the craft will cease to function. \n\nBut the reality is the curiosity has a bigger problem, its wheels are wearing out. And it probably will always have enough power to function, but to move and do new things it may have a difficult time of things. \n\nVoyager for instance has either cut functions, or others have simply died, As long as voyager still has enough power to dial home, its considered functional, but after its experiments fail it will probably be abandoned."},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:45:25Z","Content":"Even if it\u0027s not producing practical power, at the very least a dying RTG shuld nicely cover the energy costs of keeping the electronics warm enough to reboot, for a very long time."}]}
