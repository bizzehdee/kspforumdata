Where I used to record at about 25-35 fps, fraps now barely manages \u003Cem\u003E5\u003C/em\u003E. I am very annoyed, but I\u0027m frankly more confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done just about everything I know; adjusting KSP\u0027s settings, adjusting Fraps\u0027s settings, recording at different speeds and NOTHING works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really stupid bit? I used to run the game normally at about 80fps and record at ~30. Now, I\u0027m running the game at 150\u002Bfps and recording at \u003Cem\u003Eless than effing 7\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, raging complete. Can anyone offer some suggestions? Alternate \u003Cem\u003Efree\u003C/em\u003E recording software?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a million!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027m running the free fraps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I have a decent Alienware desktop, I can research the specs if needed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027m too poor to afford anything over $20 US at the moment\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
