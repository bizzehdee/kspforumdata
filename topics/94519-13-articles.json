We didn\u0027t even do interplanetary manned missions until now, last time humans left LEO was in the sixties, there was never a hydrogen driven interplanetary stage, let alone nuclear engines, etc, lots of new technologies.

Honestly though, as billkerbinsky mentioned, it isn\u0027t a very cost effective prospect to reuse the nuclear engines and until it becomes one, there won\u0027t be any reuse of them. Simple as that. Not only is it bad PR to use anything which even remotely sounds \u0022Nukulaar\u0022, but then going ahead and using an old engine again is sure to send people into a panic. The general public doesn\u0027t tend to enjoy using old things with explosive potential over long periods of time. It builds a sort of misconception that a nuclear engine is a ticking time bomb. On the other hand bringing one back to Earth would be all but impossible, as that leaves quite a more genuine fear to be had. The only two remaining practical solutions would be dumping them in orbit around the sun, or not using them at all. Considering how expensive these engines are, how experimental they are, and how horrifying they are to the public, I don\u0027t see them being used AT ALL in the foreseeable future. If they are of course, I would imagine they would go for the more publicly appealing option of dumping them somewhere and forgetting about them, and I belive that to be the most logical option.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T06:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ThatOneBritishGuy...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeriki","CreatedById":3039,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T04:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else getting a NaaN error when trying to launch the nuclear plane example.
