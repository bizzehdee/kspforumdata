I have accomplished a mission which I think is worth sharing. I set out to design an Apollo-style mission to the Mun, with two-stage lander, orbital rendezvous, etc. This is the rocket which was developed for the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/WilOQhS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WilOQhS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WilOQhS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt features serial staging, a launch escape tower, a landing module stowed beneath the command module, and all kinds of other goodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt differs from the Saturn V in that the second and third stage have been merged into one stage on this rocket.

I added a large RCS tank early on in the design, but when I realized I didn\u0027t need that much, I had already placed RCS ports and everything and I didn\u0027t want to redesign the whole thing so I just left it. The large RCS tank was scheduled to get swapped out for a smaller one because I was having trouble getting enough delta-v in the early stages to make orbit \u002B TMI. But it turned out I didn\u0027t have to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gWF4HNZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gWF4HNZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gWF4HNZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lZhAYPu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lZhAYPu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lZhAYPu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter successfully docking, the second stage was decoupled from the LM and, as on the later Apollo missions, left on a munar impact trajectory. The interstage was decoupled from the CM using a method mentioned in another thread which I can\u0027t find at the moment. The method is to place two stack seperators back to back, as can be seen in the below picture. To separate the CM from the LM, the first is decoupled. Then, the CM swings around to face the LM and the second is decoupled and the debris floats away. This procedure prevents it from getting in the way of docking and leaves the CM engine free for later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FbaDFqp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FbaDFqp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FbaDFqp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter entering the munar SOI, the CM engine was fired retrograde for orbital insertion. Jeb settled on a 25km orbit, a little high for the Mun perhaps, but chosen because his normal 10km orbit could make docking with the LM ascent stage unnecessarily difficult do to the pronounced drift that would occur at rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XFRtQ0c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XFRtQ0c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XFRtQ0c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo Kerbals EVAd to the LM to power it up and prepare for descent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Kxy3KeO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kxy3KeO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kxy3KeO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LM solar panels were extended and the gear was lowered while still attached to the CM in case of malfunction.

The 4 ascent engines were fired and had plenty of power to quickly get the ascent module to orbit. Unlike the Apollo LM which had one ascent engine, this ascent module used 4 engines mounted radially.

There is a lot of wobble if they are freed, but the gravity turn is difficult if they are locked. I preferred to keep them free. Mechjeb can sometimes shake a rocket apart, but this rocket was able to withstand the shaking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had action groups set up for launch escape, gimbal locking, escape tower jettison, solar panel extension, stage decoupling, etc, and I preferred to use the actions groups instead of the space bar because I wasn\u0027t always sure what the staging was (all the docking and decoupling tends to screw that up). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESerial staging is extremely inefficient relative to asparagus. I had a really hard time getting enough DV in the lower stages to reach the Mun. Using the same basic plan with asparagus staging would have been a breeze to get out there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CM/LM with two-stage lander method is satisfyingly fuel efficient not including getting them both into orbit. But, given the ease of the CM direct descent method in KSP, it\u0027s not really worth doing except for the novelty of doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method generates a lot of debris compared to the direct descent method. There is the second stage, the descent stage, and ascent stage to worry about, plus the escape tower and CM/LM interstage.

I have been wanting to tinker with the apollo style of docking etc, but wasn\u0027t sure how to work it into the stages and your way of doing it was really good I thought. I took it out for a flight without changing anything and noticed that you had merged the whole lifter stage into one pretty much, it works but I tried a rotary detachment (2 engines/tanks at a time) for a slightly more controlled (and I think, but am not sure) little more efficient take off. Either way, once in orbit, moving out to the moon was pretty friendly, I got into a moon orbit with plenty of leftover fuel (this could easily be a minimus rocket). I used a 20K orbit, I EVAd a kerbel down to the LM before hitting any of the stages to attach the two. I do have to ask how you got the two docking ports to dock in the design.
