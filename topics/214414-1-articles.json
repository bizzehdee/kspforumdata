That way, I can launch rockets that can refuel from my satellite and go off to distant planets. Fun stuff! \u00A0The fuel tank (medium size, longest one available) had mono propellant tanks and thrusters, two satellite dishes, and two solar panels powering a battery and a medium remotely operated control. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll was fine and dandy until shortly after separation of my rocket. \u00A0I got it up in orbit and separated, after separation I found myself in control of the station. I verified its orbital trajectory, apoapsis and periapsis (both over 100km), just because I\u2019m paranoid, all was good. After, I switched to control of the rocket to start the retrograde burn for recovery on Kerbin. After switching craft, when I went into the map to plan my burn, the trajectory changed on my satellite from stable around the planet to a crazy trajectory going far away from Kerbin, then a crash course directly back into the planet. Would require an intense amount of delta-v to even change to that course, and my satellite didn\u2019t even have a rocket motor at this point. \u00A0I summed it up to a glitch, as I watched my satellite all but depart Kerbin, like it was flicked by the hand of some god, then come crashing back down.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs it possible to have someone look at this? I highly appreciate your help and will try to report other things as they come.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-AKA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shinfen","CreatedById":228274,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-26T21:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am still seeing the same bug in my plays.
