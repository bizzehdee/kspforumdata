On a whim, I decided to try to build an aircraft somewhat like the English Electric Lightning. Unfortunately, I\u0027ve found it a rather frustrating experience. Bizarrely, my first attempt went well, I was able to tilt the cockpit down and the front lower fuselage up, then tilt the air intake so it was pointing straight ahead, add wings and undercart, etc. but after a poor test flight, I tried adjusting it and unintentionally wrecked it.when a part I hadn;t intended to pick up got picked up. Second attempt, somehow the top part of teh aircraft got skewed to the left somehow, and nothing I could do would re-align the top and bottom halves of the plane. Third attempt - why, I have no idea, but this time I just couldn\u0027t get any fuel tanks to stick under the top fuel tanks at all - at which point I gave up, realising that I probably needed to learn the use of the tools properly first :-} Also, even when just attempting to make something that\u0027ll fly I;ve never had much luck getting ailerons attached to wings properly,. so I;ve ended up using movable canards for control. Any tips or being piointed at a suitable tuitorial there would be much appreciated, too! Right - back to building something I\u0027m OK with (conventional rockets) :-} Thanks in anticipation, Esme"}]}
