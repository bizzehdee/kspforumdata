This is a jet challenge (you get more power as a jet when you hit the power band anyway).\n\n\\*\\*The current mod list is far from complete. If you have a mod not on the list you\u0027d like to see, then you may make your case in the thread.

Was able to get it up to ~450m/s once though. I have to ask how you did it, and if you could be so kind as to upload the craft file.\n\nI had to go through tons of attempts until I got to that speed, constantly changing the design, checking the CoM to see if it worked, however I do agree with the overheating. Every previous attempt I\u0027ve flown tends to overheat before reaching 1500 m/s. In this instance I believe it could be a bug or more likely a glitch in my game that stops some parts from overheating, which may explain the heat resistance. So here\u0027s how to fly it: \n\n1. SAS on and max throttle\n\n2. Pitch up 10 degrees and decouple landing gear at around 275m/s\n\n3. Pitch back down and carefully manouver it so it doesn\u0027t break\n\n4. Wait for canards to heat up and change your SAS to prograde hold\n\n5. Keep flying until the craft flips to retrograde then hold retrograde\n\n6. Throttle to zero once speed is around 100m/s\n\n7. Deploy parachutes at a safe speed \n\n8. Land! (Well technically splash)\n\nTake a look at these two extreme examples (Note that this **isn\u0027t** a re-submission):\n\nFirst attempt (Failed). This pretty much blew up as soon as the rocket began to heat up. (Please note: this was when i had no fairing)\n\n![0vQJ0cS.png](http://i.imgur.com/0vQJ0cS.png)\n\nAnd here\u0027s an example of a very successful run (Sadly later it failed by going over 500m and blew up soon after).\n\n![bCcGNA4.png](http://i.imgur.com/bCcGNA4.png)\n\nWhy are my results always varying so much?
