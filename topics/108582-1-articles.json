After all, the universe is 14.3 billion years old. It works a whole lot slower than humans, who have been around for less than 500,000. That is to say, geological clocks run much slower than biological clocks. If we don\u0027t destroy ourselves (nuclear war, virus, etc), I am optimistic.

As the US rain band shifts north to the defrosting Canadian tundra, you can\u0027t just shift the crops with it; the recently-thawed mud needs time to develop into proper agricultural soil. Shifting climate also trashes pollination mechanisms for wild flora and drives extinction of endangered species. Changing watercourses exacerbate already-dangerous shortages of potable water. Expanding tropical zones bring tropical diseases with them; you can already track the march of Dengue fever etc. southwards along the north Queensland coast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most obvious example: almost all of Bangladesh is within spitting distance of sea level. On current rates, the country is likely to be largely uninhabitable (without Dutch-style water management, which the Bangladeshis don\u0027t have the resources to implement) within a century. Bangladesh\u0027s neighbours (India, China, Pakistan etc.) are all nuclear armed and have a history of military conflict. How do you think they\u0027re going to react when 100 million Bangladeshi refugees land on their doorstep? What will India do if China attempt to divert all of the Bangladeshis to the south and vice-versa?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just one example, but similar scenarios recur again and again across the world. Throughout history, most military conflict has ultimately been caused by competition over resources. Climate change, in the near future, is going to substantially damage the global food supply and the already-running-short supply of potable water. Desperate people do desperate things, and there\u0027s nothing like hunger and thirst to drive desperation. Historically, starvation leads to revolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go talk to the academics who specialise in conflict studies, they\u0027ll tell you that we\u0027re already seeing the first climate-driven wars.

Yes, climates change over geological timescales; the slow pace has historically given the biosphere time to adapt (and, in the rare cases of sudden change like Chicxulub, the slow pace afterwards has provided time to recover). What we\u0027re doing to the place is unprecedented in both its suddenness and its momentum.

However, in our world, this has not been the case. This is because humans are not merely consumers, they are net contributors. More people means better economies of scale and division of labour. Better education and technology increase this effect further. When humans are net contributors to their economy, every birth is a blessing, not a curse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are those who harbour extreme political views who don\u0027t see it this way. In their worldview, humans are doomed to compete against each other over fixed or diminishing resources. When other human beings are seen as a curse and not a blessing, the worst forms of human behaviour are seen as a necessary evil. In their view, the rise of human technological civilisation is a threat to the natural order and will lead either to a natural catastrophe, war, or a combination of both. This fate can, they say, be avoided by enforcing Orwellian restrictions that place strict limits on energy usage (and therefore economic activity), as well as \u0022reducing\u0022 the global population to \u0022safe\u0022 levels by unspecified methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur civilisation has already begun expanding it\u0027s economic influence into space. Satellite imagery and remote sensing is used to identify new resources on the ground and make better use of available land. The effects of pollution can be monitored and mitigated. Weather satellites are vital to many industries, as are satellite navigation and positioning systems. The importance of global communications cannot be understated. Access to space allows us to make better use of and take better care of the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen new lands such as North America and Australia were first discovered, they were seen by many in Europe as worthless wilderness. They were too far away, undeveloped, and seemed to lack any resources that could readily be exploited. The West Indies and the Spice Islands did have resources that were of value, so the European powers readily fought over these, while vast tracts of \u0022worthless\u0022 land in North America were being bought and sold for a pittance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe importance of human expansion into space is not understood by all, but there is a growing body of people who do. Entrepreneurs and visionaries have been working since the beginning of this century to break the stagnation that has existed since the demise of the Apollo Program and the Cold War Space Race. There are those who see these new developments as a threat to the status quo. There are those who say that the new worlds that await humanity are a worthless wilderness. That such worlds are too far, underdeveloped, and have nothing to offer us. We often hear stories about how the challenges of exploring new worlds are supposedly insurmountable, and should be abandoned in favour of go nowhere programs that cost a lot of money but achieve little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce humanity has overcome the current inertia, the first step will be to develop the resources of the inner solar system. The resources of the main Asteroid Belt are effectively inexhaustible. While the main belt is hard to get to from Earth, it is within easy reach of Mars, which has the resources needed to support a major industrial and technological civilisation. Anything the asteroid miners can\u0027t produce for themselves at their relatively small outposts can be imported from Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, the outer solar system will be settled to bring it\u0027s effectively inexhaustible reserves of helium3 fusion fuel into play. There are many ways to get sustainable energy on Earth, but since the energy needs of an advanced civilisation will be vastly greater than the present day, fusion will quickly become the cheapest game in town. The outer solar system will not only give us unlimited energy, it gives us the energy needed to propel starships. For a mature civilisation that had developed the resources of the home solar system, starflight would be the next step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that point onward, humanity should be able to expand indefinitely, evolving onto a galactic civilisation. On the other hand, if we remain confined to the Earth, we will last as long as it takes for the next dinosaur killer asteroid to come along and wipe us out. Given this imperative, the claims that space exploration is a \u0022waste of money\u0022 that would be better spent elsewhere needs to be understood in it\u0027s proper context!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022windows_x_seven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022windows_x_seven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomeone mentioned unfriendly aliens, but what if \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E become the \u0022unfriendly aliens\u0022?\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as we fought many wars throughout history, that\u0027s bound to happen sometime in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn real danger, something like the cold war could go wrong, also has plenty of death cults or groups who wanted to end the world if they loose, spreading out will decrease the danger, interstellar war is very unpractical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Karriz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Karriz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe\u0027re a fairly persistent species, so unless Earth gets destroyed while we\u0027re still stuck here, I don\u0027t see how we could go extinct.
