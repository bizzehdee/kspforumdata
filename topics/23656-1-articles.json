I think that thread started after 0.18, but I could be wrong. At least that\u0027s when it started getting interesting and people were getting below 60 tons for the mountaintop ascents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Eve\u0027s sidereal period is almost 4 times longer than Kerbin\u0027s, the surface velocity at the equator is under 55 m/s. A few hundred meters higher starting altitude and that much less drag will easily get that back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-26T04:44:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2013 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T04:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 4 mountain ranges on or near Eve\u0027s equator all with peaks greater than 6km. They come in two closely coupled pairs with one pair on the \u0022ocean\u0022 side of Eve and another pair on the \u0022mountain\u0022 side of Eve. Those are prime landing spots. A 6.4km launch reduces delta-V requirement from 12,000m/s required from sea level to about 7500m/s. A saving of 5000m/s makes an enormous difference in the size of the rocket required to return. I think the smallest stock SERV could return two Kerbals (hanging onto ladders on the side) back to LEO in under 20 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore 0.18, Eve had one mountain top that was almost 11km high. Then 0.18 gave Eve\u0027s surface a complete do over so now the highest point is only 6.5km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-26T04:50:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2013 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goosexi","CreatedById":58426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T04:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must finish Delta V without Tears!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
