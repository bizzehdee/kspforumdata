Just wondering...\n\nTook me off guard. I honestly wasnt expecting it to end like that. Still confuses me a bit but I\u0027m curious to see if that holds any lasting effects on you two (well, you specifically). I, regrettably, have not played Fallout and have never actually seen anyone in any universe survive that. Usually in my RPs it works the other way where things you\u0027d usually expect to be survivable turn out to not be or almost not be. Since that did happen, what are we dealing with in-universe in terms of medical tech? Obviously its of a lower standard than what\u0027s in my lorebook. If you\u0027d been in my universe you\u0027d have been fine provided a medic got to you in 3 minutes (the 180 second rule, impartial, uncaring, yet undeniably cruel). Given that wasnt an option it did surprise me, but honestly though I should be used to taking people off guard.\n\nDuring the last session before our Christmas break in the RP my character\u0027s originally from, two of the other guys conspired to set up a nice happy ending between Kris and one of her squad\u0027s medics, Darek Scott (the two sort of had a thing for each other). Unfortunately I had other plans. That was the session that, after a year of taking stray bullets and getting picked back up by Scott, she doesnt make it. I had those two guys literally shedding tears over it."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:18:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Something only the death of his character could bring.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or I can start writing up a tragic suicide mission for him.\n\nNow everyone\u0027s trying to find a reason for me to die!\n\nTinfoil hats!\n\nName: Laythe\n\nGovernment: United Worlds of the Universe\n\nSpecies: Human (?)\n\nDefining Features: Annoying ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHome System: Kerbol/Jool/Laythe"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:23:51Z","Content":"Ouch!
