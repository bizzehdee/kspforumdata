So seeing as I cannot do tracks in this game, i chose a simple design, the SS-21. The original range of the real-life missile was around 70km for the first variant but nevertheless I think that 7km in-game for a single SRB missile is not that bad. I attempted to put internal guidance in it, i now realise that SRB\u0027s don\u0027t allow the electricity to pass through them to the canards, I also realise that i should have added more battery packs to the launcher to sustain it\u0027s range (in terms of duration.) Anyway here it is, please do enjoy it, and any feedback would be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AD4PZO0AD-I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamGaming\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
