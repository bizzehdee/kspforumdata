I would suggest something simple: After a certain amount of time, the science part \u0022maxes out\u0022 on its science potential, and its results must be transmitted or returned to Kerbin for recovery. You can choose to transmit sooner for a proportional amount of Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I imagine such a system working:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Go somewhere else, timewarp for a while, do some other missions, whatever\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The part throws up a message \u0022the science part on craft XYZ is ready to transmit results\u0022. If Kerbal Alarm Clock is ever integrated into the core game, it should use a window like that. You could optionally forego this message entirely, but still allow KAC to set an alarm for it in future versions. The player just has to come back to the satellite of his own volition in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Upon returning to the satellite, you will now see \u0022Review Results\u0022 just like if you\u0027d observed the part before. You can now transmit your science. Naturally, this bit of science is much larger and takes more time/power to transmit, but gets you MUCH more Science in return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBONUS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s imagine that this part requires a large, continuous supply of electricity, and Kerbals to be present. \u003Cstrong\u003ESuddenly there\u0027s a purpose for space stations!\u003C/strong\u003E Since these long-term experiments are much more trouble, it\u0027s only sensible to want to return them for recovery (as opposed to repeating them 5 more times to be able to broadcast the results), so you\u0027ll want to build a space station with habitation modules and tons of solar panels, and docking ports, and just dock the long-term science part to it for the duration of the experiment.

Open the persistent.sfs file and manually give myself more science points!!!! VOILA!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re basically talking about cheating. This is a single player game. We don\u0027t need to police anyone. If they want to cheat, they can cheat. But we don\u0027t need to limit the game because of them. No point punishing everyone else because of it either. Plus, some of the challenge involves seeing how quickly you can reach certain milestones in the game. If all you do is launch a single satellite for the first 300 years of your space program, well... then that\u0027s kind of a sad space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original suggestion would make satellites, probes, and space stations (and even bases) actually serve a purpose, rather than just be \u0022for pretties\u0022. If you\u0027re afraid that that would entice you into cheating, then perhaps a single player game isn\u0027t for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also thought StarManta\u0027s idea of having to manually transmit the data home every now and then would be a good fix as well. A launched satellite is only capable of holding so much data in its buffer. Then the player would occasionally have to \u0022fly\u0022 the satellite and manually execute a \u0022transmit home\u0022 function. I think that sounds like a good compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martinws","CreatedById":86765,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T11:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESatellites could serve a purpose forwarding transmissions if there is no line of sight between antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE.g.

It has to be balanced to be a good game mechanic. If you could unlock the entire tech tree by doing one thing over and over again, then it tunnels the players into doing that. A Good game mechanic gives you multiple paths of reaching the same goal, with benefits and risks associated with each path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does not do that. Although I agree with the theory that satellites should be useful, in the current game mechanic, it just won\u0027t work. As i\u0027ve mentioned on other threads, the science mechanic will have to be changed to incorporate something like that, by looking at having more disciplines of science, potential for specific conditions for unlocking (scenario or experiment based), as well as more interlinking and a restructure of the tree. Also I believe that probes become useful in the sense that they should relay transmission between ground probes out of LOS of Kerbin, but again this is something that can come in later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"winn75","CreatedById":52183,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T12:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime base rewards can seem a bit irrelevant to a game in wich time means nothing as you can time warp.
