The stock experiment results window does some exceedingly silly things to the data when there is no science left to collect, it sets the data\u0027s transmission value to zero.\n\nI can\u0027t see any purpose for this, and I think I can just use Science Relay to reset the transmission value to its original. This would only work for newly created data, it wouldn\u0027t be able to go back and figure what the transmission rate should be for something that is already set to zero.

It\u0027s equivalent to docking the vessel with that experiment to the lab, and manually transferring it to the lab for processing? But if the experiment can only transmit less than 100% then the data received is docked according to the transmission percent? I saw a post from DMagic from October (it\u0027s a huge post so I wont repost it to keep this short and sweet) that used the mystery goo on Laythe as an example. If the goo was sent to a lab, only 4.2 data would be sent. But if the data was resent, there would be 100% transmission to the lab. Does this compound with the initial test that was run? As far as I knew, labs can\u0027t process duplicate readings, so does that mean it needs to send to another lab? Or will it group it as one reading and process all of the data?"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T19:23:40Z","Content":"Anything with 100% transmission level will be sent without penalty.\n\nAnything below that will only send the data amount (the \u0022Data Size: x Mits section of the results window) \\* transmission level, that data will then be set to have a 100% transmission level. So further transmissions of that limited data set will not be reduced.\n\nThe science labs only care about the science id, so if you transmit a result at less than 100% and process it, the lab will consider that science result as finished, even if you manually bring in another copy of that result at the full data size at a later time. There isn\u0027t much that can be done about that, so you\u0027ll just have to consider whether you want to research the limited data set in the lab now, or whether you will be able to physically bring the result to the lab at some future time."},{"CreatedByName":"derekmw","CreatedById":142420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T19:44:45Z","Content":"Okay I understand now.

I don\u0027t want to clutter up the UI, but there is probably a simple way of doing it. Maybe add a button to the button-circle thing (I think it could probably hold 6 at most, though the existing buttons might need to be shrunk a bit) that would open a slider below the gizmo.
