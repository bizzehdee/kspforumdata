Object moves in pretty much circular path wrt parent star. This means there\u0027s some time when it pass in front (eclipsing the star), then pass behind (elipsed by the star). In transition, the object has to move forward or backward. If you define a period as the time elapsed between two star eclpses, then the time between the object eclipsing and being eclipsed is half the period - transition goes between that so half of half the period (a quarter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. During eclipsing / eclipsed, the star and the object moves only sideways. In transition, there\u0027ll be a point where they just move forward / backward without any sideways component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Sideways (tangential) velocity can be inferred as a movement on the sheet of sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Radial (towards / away movement) velocity can be inferred as changes (specifically, shift) in spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe caveat is that we\u0027re measuring the star\u0027s radial velocity in any case - so when the object moves backward, the star comes forward. When the object moves forward, the star goes backward. And the ratio of mass between two object is inversely related with their velocity - there\u0027s a good chance the radial velocity we\u0027re going to measure is even slower than walking speed ! Combined with the fact that we want their distribution too, the best option (but highly resource-consuming) would be constant monitoring, at least every few (2-5) days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-01T04:02:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2015 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T04:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022andrew123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022andrew123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI fixed it for you. ^ ^\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! xD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T15:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks YNM!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T20:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything that can block 20% of a sun-like stars light is not a planet, or comets, it\u0027s either a \u0022Alien Megastructure\u0022 and we\u0027re seeing Aliens in the middle of building a Dyson sphere or swarm, or it\u0027s something we\u0027ve never seen before, but it\u0027s sure not planet debris or a comet swarm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T21:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about a gas giant planet that mass is too low to become a star and doesn\u0027t produce any light, but has a giant ring system and is oriented like Uranus (about 90 degrees)?
