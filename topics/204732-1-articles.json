I recently finished the first of many stories and I wanted to share it here. Please enjoy Teclas Tales.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe Arcadian\u0027s four Crux engines were rapidly deteriorating with each and every second that passed. Calvin and Howard had barely escaped an infantry of automated defense drones, dead set on protecting a Rebel communications and intelligence outpost. The engines had sustained heavy damage to their temperature regulation systems and were threatening to either shutdown or explode in an impressive fireball. They had set a course back to the Union base located about two lightyears away but had to veer off course when another infantry of drones came after them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re sustaining heavy fire to the rear deflector fields! I\u0027m not sure how much more of this we can take!\u0022 Howard yelled over the noises of an overworked spacecraft.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuddenly, the spacecraft jolted forward as a missile had pierced through the field and hit the left side of the upper right engine. It exploded in a massive fireball spewing bits of metal and small components all around. Many of the pieces hit the other three engines, threatening to shut them down, but they thankfully endured. A few of the pursuing drones were hit with larger pieces of shrapnel and promptly exploded taking out all of the pursuing enemies. Calvin let out a whoop of joy before he saw the Big Brain Navigation Computer\u0027s calculations of their trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Good god! We\u0027re on a crash course with Teclas!\u0022 Calvin said with a horrified tone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re kidding right?\u0022 Howard said with disbelief, \u0022Telcas, the water world!? Do you know how hard it is to land there, some of the best pilots have tried and none have succeeded!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I think we have floatation devices that should help with the water landing.\u0022 Calvin said, trying to calm his friend.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u0022Well, what damn good are floatation devices going to do when we need another engine!?\u0022 Howard retorted while pulling up the spacecraft\u0027s engine status, \u0022I\u0027m not even sure if we have enough Thrust to Weight Ratio, fuel, and power to even get close to landing!\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalvin was immediately struck with an idea that could save their lives.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The SDC program was originally started by AtomicTech and was transferred to the Teflos R\u0026amp;D Unit. Early designs, prototypes, and models used two Crusader 20-06 \u0022Whiplash\u0022 engines and handled pretty well,\u0022 Calvin told Howard, \u0022I\u0027ll need to get out on an emergency EVA to go make external modifications to prepare for the landing.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u0022I\u0027ll trust your judgement, we have about 30 minutes before we first make contact with the atmosphere so you\u0027ll have about 20 to 25 minutes to make the modifications.\u0022 Howard said, calming down quickly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022So then that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do!\u0022 Cal said while dashing to the spacecraft\u0027s rear locker to grab his EVA suit, the Portable Fabricator Unit, and his box of random, but rather useful tools. \u0022He pulled the helmet over his head and pressed the small green button near the underside of his right ear. With a quick whirr, a few small snaps, and a quiet hmm, a silver, slim, form suit had covered his body. This was a basic pressure suit that needed an exoshell to function properly which was almost fully charged and sat obediently next to where he had grabbed the helmet. Calvin quickly put on the exoshell\u0027s backpack and pressed another small green button. Within an instant, his whole torso and legs were covered in a protective shell and he was ready to start the modifications. \u0022Ittekimas!\u0022 Calvin radioed in to Howard.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHoward glanced back annoyedly, mumbling to himself, \u0022I hate it when he speaks in Japanese, he knows how much it annoys me.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout 17 minutes later, Cal radioed in with some disconcerting news, \u0022I had expected that I would be able to use the other one of the upper engines for parts and be able to reconfigure the programming of the Byeol warp drive to get it to produce thrust. Reality had other plans, the Byeol was so excruciatingly hard to reprogram and the upper engine had sustained a lot more damage than the sensors had picked up.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yeah,\u0022 Howard responded from the Arcadian\u0027s command cabin, \u0022The Lightyear Corporation makes great warp drives, you\u0027d think they\u0027d make their warp drives easier to work with.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It took a lot more work than I had planned and I\u0027ll need to spend more time amending the stupid software.\u0022 Calvin continued, \u0022All things aside, I have great news!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Really? What is it?\u0022 Howard replied with a detectable hint of glee.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I was able to stop the engines from degrading any further and working at 70% capacity! It should be more than enough to safely pull off the landing.\u0022Calvin said, matching his friend\u0027s excitement, \u0022I\u0027m going to head and finish the programming.\u0022 Calvin carefully drifted over to the Arcadian\u0027s starboard hatch fully expecting it to fall apart or have a similar devastating failure. He gently pressed the key into the entry pad, wincing at each press. The mechanics of the hatch hummed to life as it slowly opened to allow Cal entry. He put his left foot in first and was thankful to once again have the welcome embrace of gravity. Howard was by the hatch\u0027s internal control panel diligently controlling each of the Arcadian\u0027s systems to allow Calvin in and not vent out all the oxygen into the void of space. Howard reached his hand out and firmly grabbed Calvin\u0027s gloved hand with his own.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Are you alright?\u0022 Howard asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Better than alright,\u0022 Cal grinned,\u0022we have a chance of pulling off the first successful landing on Teclas!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well maybe we should be concerned about surviving rather than pulling off one of the hardest landings in history.\u0022 Howard cautioned while walking with Calvin towards the command cabin. Calvin and Howard sat down ready to get to work. Neither of them bothered to remove their space suit. Howard quickly got to work on prepping the Arcadian\u0027s systems for landing while Calvin\u0027s fingers flew across the console\u0027s keyboard as he frantically tried to finish his program in the few remaining minutes they had before landing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The time had come to put their skills to the test as the atmospheric detector began to read the first wisps of Teclas\u0027 upper atmosphere. Hot plasma began to lap at the sides of the spacecraft, turning the hull of the spacecraft a magma-hot white. The spacecraft began to rattle and shake as it fought through the atmosphere, the Kaze\u0027s heat radiators assisting in its epic fight.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022A minute and 30 seconds until landing burn!\u0022 Howard called out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Reaction control wheels pushed to 85% capacity but holding attitude successfully.\u0022 Calvin called out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022One minute till landing burn!\u0022 Howard called out, \u0022Landing attitude held, automatic landing disabled.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Engines at 100% temporary capacity,\u0022 Calvin called out with a hint of glee, \u0022engines successfully pre-throttled!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Engine lighting in 3, 2, 1 and active!\u0022 Howard said, again matching his friend\u0027s tone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalvin and Howard were thrown back into their seats as they were pushed to the limits of survivable G-forces. The Arcadian groaned and whined, clearly not liking the G\u0027s. With a horrible wrench, the spacecraft\u0027s remaining upper engine tore off and took a wing strake with it. The Arcadian began to spiral out of control. Calvin sensed this and triggered the emergency strake removal protocol in hopes of regaining control. The aerodynamic strain was too great and the hull tore itself to pieces flinging the hunks in every direction. Calvin, still trapped in his seat, was flung away from Howard in his respective chunk. He tried to release himself from the chair but a piece of the control console tore off and slammed into Calvin\u0027s forehead, instantly knocking him out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-07T17:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2021 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by AtomicTech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMade a minor mistake\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-08T23:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalvin and Howard seems pretty close to Calvin and Hobbes, and your story does sound rather like\u00A0a Spaceman Spiff scene.
