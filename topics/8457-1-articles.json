My guide will teach you how to fix this pathetic orbit and establish an equatorial orbit that is more desirable in *most* situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKNOWING YOUR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s very important to actually know *which* way you\\\u0027re moving for this maneuver to work. If you\\\u0027re heading south, or Southeast, southwest, etc. you\\\u0027ll want to know exactly when you\\\u0027ll cross the equator or intersect your desired point of orbit. If you want to make equatorial orbit, the easiest way to describe this maneuver, you\\\u0027ll want to wait until you are traveling south or north towards the Equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBURNING AT THE CORRECT TIME\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of procedure requires a burn that is not usually used. Most times, we are accustomed to a prograde or retrograde burn. Plane change maneuvers require a burn that is focused at South or North. Both of these are directly in between your prograde and retrograde indicators. North is characterized by an orange line and the letter \u0027N\u0027 on your navball, while south is left blank. In an orbit, both of these will likely be along the white line that is your artificial horizon on your navball. If moving south, you want to wait until you cross your desired point of orbit and starting thrusting at full throttle *NORTH. If moving North, thrust full throttle at south. In your map, you will notice that your orbit has now swiftly tilted back from this topsy-turvy path onto a cleaner and more direct orbit around the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of visual learners, I have included a little diagram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=9089.0;attach=15779;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=9089.0;attach=15779;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purple100","CreatedById":10989,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-22T02:45:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you\\\u0027re on the green line headed south, is that a burn along your \u0027orbit normal\u0027 vector?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is, that means you can use MechJeb to keep yourself aligned properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Spacecraft_Orientation.svg\u0022 alt=\u0022Spacecraft_Orientation.svg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-22T02:48:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, MechJeb is great for plane changes.
