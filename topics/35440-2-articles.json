The one scene of the scout hovering up to the cliff side represents quite a few firsts for me in particular, and provided the first opportunity I\u0027d had in quite some time to put the warp tool to serious use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten acquainted with how some people are doing their time-lapse caps of their artwork creation process, so I\u0027m thinking of doing something similar while creating the images for chapter 5. It might not pan out too well though, so if I don\u0027t get to do it for this chapter, (based on the fact that a good chunk of the story happens where I can\u0027t easily create images for it), then I\u0027ll most certainly be able to for chapter 6. Whenever I can do it though, I\u0027ll be sure to include a link to it in the original post alongside the chapter links. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, I\u0027m also still trying to keep a lookout for a means of either creating or getting my hands on a Kerbal model that I can pose, which will pave the way for quite a few more images. Currently I can only really create scenes that can be sourced from the game, but if I could get a poseable Kerbal that I can modify for each of the crew members, I could go completely crazy with the artwork. I\u0027ve already been working on their \u0022all-home\u0022 and garage in Sketchup, so if the day comes when I can actually put kerbals into those scenes, I\u0027ll be ready to go. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T17:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny important status updates? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I really want to see the next chapter, but please don\u0027t rush yourself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T17:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T17:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022andrew123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022andrew123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny important status updates \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I really want to see the next chapter, but please don\u0027t rush yourself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a bit held back by the new update\u0027s bugs, which were killing my ability to toy around and generate the source images I wanted for the story (playing around idly in the game also gives me story ideas, which I\u0027m needing to help flesh out this chapter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve since found a plugin that fixes the constant hitching, so I\u0027m back in the game (literally!).
