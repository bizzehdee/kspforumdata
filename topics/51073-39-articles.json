Toolbar integration would be great, but isn\u0027t vital. The interface for the big map is confusing, as it\u0027s not clear what each button does or whether or not it conflicts with other active buttons, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, this is one of my favorite mods, and it doesn\u0027t crash the game, which is a big plus these days.
