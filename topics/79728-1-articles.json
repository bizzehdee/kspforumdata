There are a couple of situations where the resulting low thrust to weight is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is the fact that excessively long burn times means you are not burning at the ideal point, much of your burn is ahead of and/or behind the ideal point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there are situations where a low T/R ratio means you can\u0027t complete the burn in time at all. High speeds when trying to stop in a planets SOI are one. Trying to land on a surface when your T\\R is less than 1 is another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, mainly (for me anyway) it\u0027s a matter of I don\u0027t have the patience to spend long periods of time watching painfully slow burns. Most of my ships would work just fine with half the LVNs I use, I just don\u0027t like waiting for slow burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I like to mount the LVNs radially, otherwise they make the ship wobbly because they are long and narrow.

There is about a 20-25% difference in potential EV with different cluster arrangements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all depends on how long you want to burn. My computer is so far below minimum spec requirements that my FPS is low enough that 10 real world seconds pass for every 1 in game second. That makes a 30 minute ingame burn into a 5 hour snooze epic.

From a pure efficiency standpoint, the single LV-N with multiple burns at periapsis is best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tradeoff is lower TWR and thus acceleration in a single engine design. This means that burns are further away from the ideal of an instantaneous burn, though splitting up the burn into several smaller ones can mitigate that to a degree. It also makes burns a bit dull and more complex, as it is just minutes or hours of pointing at the maneuver node and you must split up the burn efficiently; whether this is important to you is more about what sort of player you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I dislike playing with ships with a TWR of less than 0.2 or so, lower than that and the lengthy dull burns start to be more of a factor to me than the increased efficiency. So my interplanetary ships usually employ more than one LV-N, often many more on bigger ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other consideration is ship design flexibility. A single engine basically has to be mounted centerline at the rear of the ship, no other option makes much sense. With two or more you can mount them radially anywhere along the ship\u0027s length which can sometimes be advantageous (I\u0027m partial to \u0022puller\u0022 designs for ships held together with docking ports).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this only applies to ships that remain in orbit.
