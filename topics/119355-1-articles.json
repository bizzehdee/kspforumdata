Apocalypses could include asteroid collisions, the decay of a moons orbit, an incoming comet, a gamma ray burst, a solar flare... I could go on and on. This would also add the ability to deliberately destroy planets on purpose. I think that this would be a really cool feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T22:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t have the ship abilities to do any of this except asteroids and we already have redirect missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T22:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept career is goofy, so if a planet killer was coming, the most effective solution would be to decline the contract, Kerbin saved!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudefinal","CreatedById":150168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T22:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EXD It doesn\u0027t have to be mission it would be kinda like a wake up call for people who are too scared to go past Minmus like myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T23:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, no.
