While I\u0027m tempted to take the rover and check out the local bars, it\u0027s strapped to my heavy lifter and hopefully on its way to the mun. But not without Dansby, who was my first Kerbal to stand on the mun. Thing is, the astronaut centre says he\u0027s in the ship\u0027s command pod, but I\u0027ve checked many times, and he\u0027s not. The last mission he ran has a flag on the moon that shows as a current mission, plus some debris from the launch. Does that have anything to do with it?
