But the joints are something fairly weak. I think it would open up a lot of design possibilities and be a fun gameplay mechanic to allow our engineers to become basic space welders and be able to apply struts to vehicles in the wild.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have lots of designs I would love to try out, but with the mechanic of only being able to connect two pieces with a single lever/servo/rotor I often just can\u0027t make joints that are strong enough. But if I could deploy then \u0027weld\u0027 the items into place after the robotics did their stuff with an engineer I think that would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-10T04:32:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2019 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Resilient\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loskene","CreatedById":141778,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T00:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, sounds good. We can make trebuchets held down by strut and released by hand then too. It\u0027s just like that mod I always think will be handy but I never bother installing.\u00A0It\u0027s a very niche thing that suddenly has a lot of applications with robotics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fulgur","CreatedById":195204,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T07:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. This would make it much easier to do LOTS OF THINGS. The way I think it would work is that, like an experiment, you can take a box of 10 struts and then weld them on. Then you would connect them on EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
