Most other game controls seem to work just fine like camera positioning and the various buttons in the menu sidebar, but I have absolutely no way to end the EVA or return to a previous save so the only way to get out of the situation is to Alt-F4 to close the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSearching hasn\u0027t resulted in any obvious fixes, or even other people experiencing similar problems, so I\u0027m hoping someone who has seen this before can give me some direction on how to fix the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nathangun","CreatedById":171770,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-20T21:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve just ran into the same problem, I think it might be a mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nathangun","CreatedById":171770,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-20T21:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFound a solution if still interested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouldn\u0027t quote the guy that posted this as I\u0027m on my phone but here is the solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nloss of control when u eva might be a control lock. u can try resettiing the lock in the\u00A0 alst shift f12 menu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strigon","CreatedById":123021,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-23T01:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having a very similar issue; when I go EVA, everything is fine unless I pull out a flag.
