In building aircraft, the stock game can be considered limited, and I am just curious as to what the community thinks about an aircraft story based challenge which REQUIRES a mod (It basically adds propellers and a larger fuselage/cockpit), compared to a completely stock challenge? Alternatively, how about a challenge in which there are two versions: stock or modded?

That is the main reason why I am using KAX rather than Firespitter or B9. Both are great mods that really add to aircraft, but I find it funner and more challenging to make a large airline-style wing from multiple stock parts compared to say just a one part wing. Firespitter and B9 add many many aircraft based parts which kind of make replica craft \u0022too easy\u0022 (IMO). That is why I am using KAX, which only adds 3 propellers, a large fuselage \u0026amp; landing gear, and a cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently thinking of doing 2 challenge styles now- stock and modded. Both will be different though (example: modded will have a wright flyer with 2 propellers whereas stock only has jets and can be difficult and ugly to simulate propellers). As for FAR, I would probably make it a category but make a note to use at your own discretion as I have not tested/modified the challenge whilst using FAR (though I might in the future).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to thank you all for your input so far!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
