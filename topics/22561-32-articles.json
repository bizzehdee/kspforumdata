I say sorta because I do need to leave the topbar visible. Went into settings, disabled fullscreen, and set the resolution to the monitor\u0027s full width, and height minus 23px. (The height of the top bar determined with a screenshot and Gimp. WHY doesn\u0027t Gimp have a ruler tool? Goodness. I\u0027m glad I subscribe for Adobe CC.

The reason all this finagling was necessary is that every time I used KSP in fullscreen and just switched between workspaces, it\u0027d flash the whole KSP screen a sort of purple (hmmm, maybe more fuchsia...yeah definitely fuchsia), and sometimes that glitch would stick. The mouse and menu buttons and all that would still work, but not being able to see any of it kinda hampered things. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like I\u0027m going to have to try swapping the GRUB 2 loader onto the boot flagged partition though to try to get the backlight working.
