Hitting Launch from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E works fine... loading a ship from the tracking station is fine as well... but returning to the Space Center from a ship... or switching ships causes incredible HHD usage and takes up to 10 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe funny thing is that when I open Task Manager to check it is not actually the KSP-process that is causing this... It is the \u0022System\u0022 process. Why am I still certain KSP has something to do with this? Because my computer does not have this problem otherwise. It only occurs when running KSP and leaving a vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Flight Manager was the only mod I had not used before I removed it but that didn\u0027t change anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have an idea what might be causing this?

I\u0027ve experienced it too, even now. My guess is, judging from my previous KSP playthrough, version 1.3 seems to be unstable compared to 1.2. Back then, even though my computer considered as potato-class, I could run a planet pack with graphic mods and parts pack with no problem at all in 1.2, but as soon as I installed 1.3, even a planet pack (without graphic or part mods) cause a heavy HDD usage that strains my computer (And always ends in error message crash). I don\u0027t know what causing this, but I suspect (judging from what I see in my tests) KSP 1.3 seems causing a heavy strain to the system if there\u0027s several mods installed. Not sure if this could help, but my solution to make me able to play KSP with mods that I wanted is by having several KSP folder in a single drive (Folder 1 for spaceplanes, folder 2 for rockets, folder 3 for weapons, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oiff","CreatedById":182027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T16:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is the system using it perhaps you have run out of memory and it is hammering the pagefile?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is the case ensuring you close anything else that is running in the background may help, as well as reducing mods especially ones with big texture packs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn my setup KSP only uses the HDD to load and save, it seems to keep everything else in memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T18:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have a ksp.log you can share with us?
