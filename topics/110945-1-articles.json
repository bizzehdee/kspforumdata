Taking a component verbatim from one mod and using it in your own, so long as it is \u0022significant source that constitutes a unique algorithm\u0022 falls under the protections of the license. Only if you generate the same output but use different algorithms to do so, are you not forced under the original license.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut copyright law also has clauses dealing with Dirty Reverse Engineering. Even if you generate a unique algorithm, by personally examining the source code yourself you become \u0022tainted\u0022 and hence force to adhere to the original license. The main case law I know of dealing with this would be AMD vs Intel, where AMD had a team using dirty reverse engineering to document how Intel\u0027s CPU worked and fed \u0022rough descriptions\u0022 to another team to construct an equivalent; only by creating this barrier between the two teams was AMD\u0027s actions ruled not a violation of copyright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to note that while the Open Source Community DOES occasionally practice dirty reverse engineering techniques, the lack of lawsuit against them is not indicative of their being in the right. Often this is a risk benefit analysis, knowing that the FSF will likely appoint someone to defend a wrongdoer and cost a company more in the end. Similarly cases do exist in the reverse, where companies are being sued for use of Open Source code or derivatives in commercial products without adhering to the licensing of said code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is, given how many mods use the source of other mods as \u0022influence\u0022, can we actually change the license without truthfully being in violation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis will depend upon the license.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEG WTFPL licensed mods (there are some) can be freely relicensed.
