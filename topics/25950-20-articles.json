The one time I got it to over 50km I found the TWR was too low to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060ll keep trying but this is my progress so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I find the wanting to tip over drops off at about 2.5km and it becomes much more controllable. Got it to 60km, I still cannot get to orbit though. Could you post a video of how to get it to orbit or at least tell us what sort of flight profile to follow? (when to turn, what height/speed we should be at when staging etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Got it to 73km and 1600m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: got it to orbit. 150kmx65km Having trouble getting enough Dv from the first stages to allow the third stage to get to orbital speeds without using too much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it does a good impression of the Leaning tower of Piza\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3yJTsBx.png\u0022 alt=\u00223yJTsBx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T13:29:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nephf","CreatedById":66354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T12:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mulbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mulbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe parachutes are just to make the LEM the right shape.... no idea how it would work on duna, you\u0027ll need more DV to get it there!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo you won\u0027t!
