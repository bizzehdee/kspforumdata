(The ESC menu) I wanted to turn down the music, but when I hit Apply, KSP glitched out massively and cropped into a weird sort of square window. The UI did not scale, and I managed to revert to VAB before exiting.\n\nWhen I relaunched, the problem persisted. I checked Settings on the main menu and the .cfg file as well... my old resolution is still set properly, but KSP ignores it completely.\n\nThis is what I get:\n\n![t6d2bRk.png](http://i.imgur.com/t6d2bRk.png)\n\nThis is my settings.cfg (with keyboard bindings removed)\n\n    SETTINGS_FILE_VERSION = 0.18.0TUTORIALS_EDITOR_ENABLE = FalseTUTORIALS_FLIGHT_ENABLE = FalseVAB_USE_CLICK_PLACE = TrueVAB_USE_ANGLE_SNAP = TrueVAB_ANGLE_SNAP_INCLUDE_VERTICAL = FalseVAB_CAMERA_ORBIT_SENS = 0.04VAB_CAMERA_ZOOM_SENS = 0.1FLT_CAMERA_ORBIT_SENS = 0.04FLT_CAMERA_ZOOM_SENS = 0.5FLT_CAMERA_WOBBLE = 0.1FLT_CAMERA_CHASE_SHARPNESS = 1.5FLT_CAMERA_CHASE_USEVELOCITYVECTOR = TrueFLT_VESSEL_LABELS = TrueSPACENAV_CAMERA_SENS_ROT = 30SPACENAV_CAMERA_SENS_LIN = 20SPACENAV_CAMERA_SHARPNESS_LIN = 8SPACENAV_CAMERA_SHARPNESS_ROT = 10CAMERA_FX_EXTERNAL = 1CAMERA_FX_INTERNAL = 2SIMULATE_IN_BACKGROUND = TruePHYSICS_FRAME_DT_LIMIT = 0.03MAX_VESSELS_BUDGET = 250CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 3CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT = 3SHOW_PWARP_WARNING = FalseEVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = TrueSPACENAV_FLIGHT_SENS_ROT = 5SPACENAV_FLIGHT_SENS_LIN = 1KERBIN_TIME = TrueCALL_HOME = FalseDONT_SEND_IP = FalseSEND_PROGRESS_DATA = TrueCHECK_FOR_UPDATES = TrueVERBOSE_DEBUG_LOG = FalseSHOW_CONSOLE_ON_ERROR = FalseAUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 300AUTOSAVE_SHORT_INTERVAL = 30SHOW_SPACE_CENTER_CREW = FalseUI_SIZE = 768UI_OPACITY = 0.5SHIP_VOLUME = 0.5AMBIENCE_VOLUME = 0.5MUSIC_VOLUME = 0UI_VOLUME = 0.5VOICE_VOLUME = 0.5SOUND_NORMALIZER_ENABLED = TrueSOUND_NORMALIZER_THRESHOLD = 1SOUND_NORMALIZER_RESPONSIVENESS = 16SOUND_NORMALIZER_SKIPSAMPLES = 0SCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH = 1300SCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT = 750FULLSCREEN = FalseQUALITY_PRESET = 1ANTI_ALIASING = 2TEXTURE_QUALITY = 1SYNC_VBL = 1LIGHT_QUALITY = 8SHADOWS_QUALITY = 4FRAMERATE_LIMIT = 120FALLBACK_PART_SHADERS = FalsePLANET_FORCE_SHADER_MODEL_2_0 = FalsePLANET_SCATTER = FalsePLANET_SCATTER_FACTOR = 0.5AERO_FX_QUALITY = 2SURFACE_FX = TrueEDGE_HIGHLIGHTING_PPFX = TrueSCREENSHOT_SUPERSIZE = 0INPUT_KEYBOARD_SENSIVITITY = 2dontShowLauncher = FalseTRACKIR_ENABLED = False\n\nAny ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Andiron","CreatedById":141782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T13:33:50Z","Content":"Did you try alt \u002B enter to go in fullscreen ?
