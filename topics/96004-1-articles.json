I think the change in orbit I was seeing was due to the oscillation of my craft attached to the asteroid.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a strange problem. I\u0027ve had a bad time trying to push a class E asteroid out of solar orbit - I was forced to leave the rocket at no more than 10% thrust (prograde) to prevent it spinning and I left it minimised like that for about eight hours. When I came back I found that the opposite side of the orbit is getting smaller not larger! Worse still, it carries on doing it after I switch off the thrust!
