(Yes, I am that busy.)\n\nThis time, it\u0027s a space shooter game. I\u0027m not very far into the development process yet, and I\u0027m also not quite sure where this will go, or how long it will take. So, I\u0027m taking a bit of a different approach this time around: Rather than make it all in a dark corner, I will try and do a blog about the progress I\u0027m making - with the occasional video and/or pictures along with the posts.\n\nThe game doesn\u0027t have a name yet - suggestions are very welcome! Also, if you have any ideas or comments about the direction this thing should go, please keep them coming! I\u0027d really like to add some more depth aside from the shooting game itself, but I haven\u0027t decided on anything yet.\n\n[**Read blog here**](http://spaceshooter.blizzy.de)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/51ckzne2p0g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/f09EtyXC788?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:57:39Z","Content":"No offence, but, What is this game different from those old arcade space shooters?\n\nOr are you making this as a remake?\n\nTextures look nice."},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:38:30Z","Content":"Yea, it\u0027s kind of a remake.
