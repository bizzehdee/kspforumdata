The mods I\u0027m using have different kinds of containers that come in different sizes cluttering up the parts catalog.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCCK helps a lot sorting them out by mod. But wouldn\u0027t it be simpler if the modders just create 1 part that we can customize the size via TweakScale; and markings via B9PartSwitch? For example, SSPXR lets me change the container type and the decals on the container changes to reflect the contents.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI understand that TweakScale is not a global solution. For example, using it on command pods doesn\u0027t make sense. I don\u0027t do it, but I\u0027m glad I can make a Tardis-like cockpit if I want to :) But for tanks, containers, decouplers, stack separators, etc., I think that it makes absolute sense. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully, less clutter on the parts list translates to less work for modders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thygrrr","CreatedById":170612,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-07T23:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think neither should be standard.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nB9 is a pretty janky set of game hacks; I find the variants management that KSP 1.4 brought much better.
