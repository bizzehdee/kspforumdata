I have a very nice i7 2600 in my PC. It\u0027s wicked fast and very power efficient for a gaming PC processor and I love it lots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is it has HyperThreading which in most modern games isn\u0027t an issue any more as they multi-thread just fine. However, as most people know, KSP (or at least the physics?) is only capable of using 1 \u0027CPU\u0027 or \u0027Core\u0027. With HyperThreading, Intel divide each physical core into 2 virtual CPUs so, for example, my i7 has 4 \u003Cstrong\u003Ephysical\u003C/strong\u003E cores and HT makes that look like 8 \u003Cstrong\u003Evirtual\u003C/strong\u003E cores. Each virtual core is only capable of using a maximum of 50% of the cycles available on the physical core it is on. So what? So that means KSP is confined to 50% of one CPU core\u0027s CPU power when it\u0027s running. As good as my i7 is, that makes it a bit slow. So what\u0027s the miracle cure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is for advanced users only who are 100% confident and comfortable changing their motherboard settings in their BIOS/UEFI setup screen, I also provide zero warranty and take zero responsibility for you messing up your PC doing this. It\u0027s purely experimental and done at your own risk.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you boot your PC up to play KSP, enter the BIOS/UEFI settings screen (this is usually a key press at the power-on self-test screen like Del or F2). If in doubt do some RTFM for your motherboard. Navigate to the CPU settings and look for the HyperThreading option. Set it to OFF if you can. You shouldn\u0027t need to change anything else. Save your new settings and reboot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reboot the PC after the change you will notice if you open Task Manager in Windows that there are half the number of CPU graphs (if you have it set to graph per CPU) and they match the number of physical cores on your CPU. Also, now, KSP can use 100% of one of the physical cores to run meaning you get 2x the available CPU power you had before. It runs WAAAY smoother on my rig now I\u0027ve done this and as far as I can see Windows 7 doesn\u0027t care and neither do any of my other games or programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling it might be a possible cure for some people\u0027s lag issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RazorWolf19","CreatedById":62293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T22:52:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...Mother of God...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for posting this, however this only makes me feel worse about my lag problems as I am not confident with my computer skills and would never attempt something like this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGAH!

I apologise for the mis-information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for if it makes a difference, I\u0027ve also used HT Atoms (D410 in my case - single core with HT) and got significant speed gains from single-threaded tasks by using them in Uni-core vs. HT mode (for those sad enough to care I was running DEC VAX emulations on it which peg the CPU at 100% when you are compiling code inside the emulator or bootstrapping the OS or really doing anything that would use a lot of CPU cycles on a VAX). With all the background crap running in Windows it effectively allows KSP to shove everything else off one core and get it to itself and make Windows cope using the other 3 cores, surely? Because of the screwed up way Windows prioritises processes it\u0027s entirely possible with HT that something with a higher CPU priority can barge in and take CPU cycles off the core that\u0027s trying to run KSP.

To the Operating system it appears that there are 8 cores on a 4 core 8 thread hyperthreaded processor. However, both the OS and the hardware are smarter than that for scheduling. Generally the physical cores will be scheduled before the hyperthreaded ones will be. On top of that, if a thread will utilize all of a physical core it WILL. It doesn\u0027t use \u0022only 50% of a core\u0022. Hyperthreaded cores are setup such that full utilization of a thread will use basically all of the same execution resources that a non-hyperthreaded core would, the difference is that hyperthreaded processors have a extra scheduling (and maybe load/unload? Can\u0027t recall) units that a non-hyperthreaded processor doesn\u0027t have. Then since most threads really can\u0027t use 100% of available execution units (maybe an integer or FPU is left idled by a thread) the processor/OS will run a second thread (if there is a spare one laying around) in the unused execution units, increasing total utilization of the core. Also since these are OoO processors, a lot of time parts of the pipeline can be skipped and/or predictive processing gets it right and you get a jump ahead thus leaving resources idled, which get snapped up by hyperthreading for that extra thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with the exception of a few poorly written massively threaded applications, disabling hyperthreading rarely increases performance and pretty much never in single threaded applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does mean that anything executed on the hyperthreaded cores are likely to have fewer execution resources that what would run on the physical threads, unless of course what is running on the physical threads is poorly utilizing the resources. You won\u0027t get a good indication of this by processor load. the % you see in task manager is NOT % of core resources used, it is simply % of processor cycles utilized. You could have 100% of processor cycles utilized, but only be using 25% of the execution resources on a thread because of how the program is designed, leaving lots of spare resources to run a hyperthreaded thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to see the kind of resources different highly threaded programs use is to enable/disable hyperthreading and see the performance difference. In general the difference between non-hyperthread and hyperthreaded is in the realm of 10-20% performance gain in highly threaded tasks (ones that will utilize more threades than available physical cores). In some cases though you can see 30-40% gains from thread that poorly utilize (or can\u0027t) execution units.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DresCroffgrin","CreatedById":57327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T16:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://semiaccurate.com/2012/04/25/does-disabling-hyper-threading-increase-performance/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is a site that benchmarked applications with Hyper Threading on and off using an Ivy Bridge i7.
