During my decent, I pull Bill Kerman out for some science. Since I had already crashed (the ship) a few times while doing this, I decided to quicksave while Bill is still outside the ship, to save time. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t save it this time around either. I press F9 to reload. Bill is outside the ship, everything is fine for about 2 seconds and then the ship just plain disappears. It doesn\u0027t crash, it just disappears. I reload the quicksave but the same thing happened every time. The ship is there at the beginning of the quicksave, but 2 seconds in it disappears. I can\u0027t even tab to it quick enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up using Bills rock hard head to bounce him off the ground and keep him alive. Poor guy was stranded in the snowy region of a lifeless planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing this anomaly, i went to hire more crew and it showed that Bob and Jeb were not missing or dead, but rather active on a mission. Anyway, I do another mission with new kerbals, and then finally Bob and Jeb magically reappear in my roster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, i took this bug as a story driving phenomenon. I ended up taking Bob and Jeb and using the same ship to land just a couple Km from Bill, and had Bob pick him up with my Duna Buggy. Starved and cold, Bill eventually did get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, so there\u0027s that bug : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
