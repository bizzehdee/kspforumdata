(Or on the screen itself, not a map.) I\u0027d like to land my Beluga XL cargo plane in some remote ore and Kethane fields, but SCAN\u0027s resolution is only good for approximation, not finding a good flat stretch for a 70 ton vehicle transport plane to land on. And it\u0027s the little bumps and small hills that sneak up on you that could make landing with a (up to) fifty tons of cargo a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, an instant runway would be nice.
