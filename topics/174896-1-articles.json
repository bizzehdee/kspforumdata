So my question is what do all the 6 symbols on the maneuver menu mean as I feel if I knew what they did I could understand it a bit better\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T20:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider the following illustration that I swiped from somebody on the internet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fZc9muw.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022fZc9muw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtend the prograde and you will add speed to the course you\u0027re already taking, making your projected path line straighter, and doing other stuff depending on the circumstances.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nExtend the retrograde and you will slow down, causing your course line to curve more in response to the gravity being exerted on your ship.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nExtend the normal and your course will curve toward the north of the world you are flying around.
