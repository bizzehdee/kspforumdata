I tried doing it through staging. It would have been the second action performed besides the initial ignition. it didn\u0027t work. i tried doing it through right clicking and clicking decouple on a second run. it didn\u0027t work. I reran these twice more performing the same actions to try and get the mission to pop, but nothing. I even attached girders to the decouplers to make sure they didn\u0027t need an object attached on a 5th run but again it\u0027s not popping. any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mark Kerbin","CreatedById":167193,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-27T13:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you give us pictures of the craft and mission/contract page?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin the mean time, I think you have to meet the requirements then stage it for the first time. That your you have to right click on the part and say \u201Crun test\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
