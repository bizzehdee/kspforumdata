A Altair, or it\u0027s equivalent, would be launched on a Ares V, or it\u0027s equivalent. The Altair would keep and use the transfer stage for the retro burn at the moon. The transfer stage is the base: it would then ditch the engine, and split in 2. Each have would have landing engines, and enough fuel to get them down. It would also have a interior for living. There would be beds and stuff in a compartment in one half, to be the crew compartment area. This is all in on of the sections of the fuel tank, either the liquid fuel tank or the oxidizer tank. The other would house greenhouse compartments for growing food and producing oxygen. The two compartments could be linked together, and could share oxygen. The Altair lander would land at the site, and the crew could set up the base. Once they were ready to leave, they would take the Altair up to the space station, get in the Orion spacecraft, and return to earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could offer sugestions, or critisism, that would be great. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you describing a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_workshop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewet workshop\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is altair or anything else in development for a manned lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no ares v although a counterpart the slsb2 could lift it but not earlier than 2025.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WH40krules","CreatedById":79752,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T19:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed Iron Crown: Yeah, I guess it would be a wet workshop, but a ground base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Exenomorph555: I know, but I just had a idea, and felt like sharing.
