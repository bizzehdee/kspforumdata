But don\u0027t worry, we\u0027re thinking about EVA container manipulation in space.\n\nAnd low gravity, too, I hope. How low? Depends on the mass of the container and its contents, of course.\n\n\u003E 30cm^3^ seems to be a m^3^ to cm^3^ conversion error. We still want to keep the value quite high for gameplay purpose even if its a bit less realistic.\n\nConversion errors happen all too easily.\n\nLess realistic is actually counter to gameplay (particularly in KSP), though a *little* bit is ok (maybe that bit of chubbiness kerbals have is not blubber but overly large pockets). However, even a human head is about 4L (0.004m^3^).\n\nAs to why going less realistic counter to gameplay in KSP: realism is the only way to achieve balance. Minor deviations (such as making the gravitational constant ten times higher) can be ok so long as they apply to *everything* (which, fortunately, that particular deviation does). However, I feel that stock aerodynamics actually hurts gameplay as it removes all challenge from dealing with atmospheres and adds a completely bogus requirement for huge rockets. Worse, it penalizes good aerodynamic design. I will celebrate its demise when 1.0 comes out.\n\nMy point being, do not use \u0022gameplay\u0022 as an excuse for being unrealistic in a game where so much hinges on realism.

For info compatibility with the old KAS container transitions, I recommend showing 2 decimal places.\n\nAdded to my todo list too\n\nAlso, don\u0027t hesite to use the issue tracker for that kind of things : [https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @KospY\n\u003E \n\u003E I am seeing a nullref on entering the VAB. Is [EditorPartsList.Instance](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/Plugins/Source/KISAddonPickup.cs#L91) created when Awake fires? With Filter Extensions [I have to wait for PartCategorizer.Instance to be created](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/FilterExtension/blob/master/FilterExtension/Editor.cs#L20) before doing anything\n\u003E \n\u003E The nullref:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  at KIS.KISAddonPickup.Awake () [0x00000] in :0 UnityEngine.GameObject:Internal_AddComponentWithType(Type)UnityEngine.GameObject:AddComponent(Type)AddonLoader:StartAddon(LoadedAssembly, Type, KSPAddon, Startup)AddonLoader:StartAddons(Startup)AddonLoader:OnLevelWasLoaded(Int32)\n\nYes it is the error (EditorPartsList.Instance is null). I just fixed it by checking if null before (see my [commit](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/commit/0d03a327993573dfbb5fe0d074fc4041b6b73bf5))\n\nAs awake seem to fire two time in vab (don\u0027t know why), it work. Not sure if that will fix the problem with FilterExtension however."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T22:00:23Z","Content":"Possibly one Awake() on scene change and another one when it decides whether you are in the VAB or SPH.
