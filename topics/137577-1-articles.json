Ideally, yes, you should be able to give them \u0022tasks\u0022 like maintenance checks or soil sample taking. You\u00A0would have to prepare them for their task, too. For example, if you send an Engineer on EVA at your space station and task them with maintenance, you\u0027d have to pack extra propellant, a drill, spare parts, et cetera. It could be made meaningful, too. Say there was a joint-weakening mechanic that loosened joints a tiny amount every time your craft experienced large amounts of torque. This would make it necessary to run maintenance checks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how programming pathfinding in a zero-G environment would work though.
