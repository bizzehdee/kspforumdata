If both those situations aren\u0027t met then StageRecovery can\u0027t do anything with it. You\u0027d ether have to make the lifter unload by moving out of range, set the parachutes on it to deploy at 0.4 or 0.5 pressure and stage them when you decouple it (with RealChutes I\u0027d set them to deploy at 1km altitude or so instead of by pressure, but they might be going too fast if you\u0027re just going straight up and straight down), or use FMRS to recover that stage manually. If you don\u0027t want to make it leave physics range (or make your capsule move away)\u00A0then I\u0027d try setting the parachutes to deploy automatically, since you\u0027d have to do that to recover them with FMRS anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wragie","CreatedById":155599,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-23T01:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been running a no part mod\u0027d 1.3 KSP and of course SR.

Not sure if it is a glitch or what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to get an annoying amount contracts for tourists so I design various Bus, some orbit and some are landers. With SR I can put a good chunk of expensive parts (27x vector engines etc) into the boost stages and recover the funds. On the stage that circularizes the orbit I generally will put a ring of smaller \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s that fire on separation to de-orbit that stage at the same time. So they are kinda obvious when those stages separate lol. Today I ran two bus landers to the moon one right after the other. The initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E was 85km. Thats my usual orbit for this setup as it is just about or is out of fuel right after the circulation burn. So today I did the mission came back and noticed the one stage was still in a circular orbit instead of showing up as recovered. After the second mission same result, yet both had definitely fired the sep/de-orbit burn. I have used this configuration for dozens of missions and this was the first time something amiss occurred\u00A0 and not once but twice! lol. Now the interesting bit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I thought might be good excuse to design a recovery vessel to get rid of desirable and not so desirable orbital debris (instead of pressing click in the tracking station). So equipped with the claw, a butt load of fuel, thrust and mono-propellant as well as parachutes I launched to rendezvous. On approach to the first booster stage as soon as I got within 350 meters the ring of retro \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003Esrb\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s fired. If was pointing straight down and the srbs fired and burned out and put it into\u00A0 a deorbit trajectory. It wasn\u0027t worth burning up so I switched target to the other booster and rendezvoused with it. Again at or around 350 meters the srbs fired. This time it was facing radial in so the srbs pushed it out into a higher orbit. It did get about 30km away before I started to close up again. this time when I got close it didn\u0027t fire the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003Esrb\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s. I did manage to connect and de-orbit the booster. I separated after the de-orbit burn and landed. The booster was then recovered by SR as it normally does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to be clear I was not using unlimited fuel or other cheats. The srbs fired TWICE. Once in the normal sequence and the second upon rendezvous approach at around 350m distance. Just curious if anyone has seen this behavior before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-23T01:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223128484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002278226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221500771610\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155599\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wragie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, Wragie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday I ran across a interesting thing.
