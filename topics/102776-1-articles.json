This is a Kopernicus bug from re-parenting Kerbin. When controlling a ship the correct light appears.\n- Ships at the space center aren\u0027t showing their correct position in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view. They are, however in their correct position in game so don\u0027t worry!\n- Ships sometimes blow up upon loading onto the launchpad. Please use revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E if this happens, as reverting to launch will just make it blow up again.\n- **RARE**: Sometimes ships have been known to go shooting off from stable orbits around Mun. This doesn\u0027t happen very often and is being looked at.\n\n**Kerbal Construction Time** exacerbates a known problem with Kopernicus when reparenting Kerbin as New Horizons does. The problem isn\u0027t the fault of KCT, so please don\u0027t post about it on it\u0027s forum thread. To negate this bug please ensure to switch scenes before launching craft (go to tracking station, back \u0026 THEN launch a ship). Not doing so will cause terrain issues on Kerbin and most of the time causes instant explosions on load. This error is being looked into.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n    v2.0.1\n    -Fixed SpaceCenter black screen\n    -Tweaked alot of settings\n    -Fixed alot of stuff\n    -Switched ring shader to new version for asthetics\n\n**Credits:**\n\n**Sarbian** for maintaining ModuleManager\n\n**Kcreator** for making KittopiaTech\n\n**Gravitasi** for updating the Kopernicus/Kittopia plugins\n\n**BryceSchroeder, Teknoman117, Thomas.P and NathanKell** for making \u0026 maintaining the Kopernicus plugin this mod relies on.\n\n**CaptRobau** as pulling apart his configs for OPM helped me learn how to use KittopiaTech before the tutorials were created.\n\n**Dunrana** for helping fix my ScienceDefs mistakes.\n\n**Felger** for helping me so much with the atmosphere settings\n\n**License:**\n\n![zi0CCOwpXvwJLEj3O5hPCI485yAI_z0fbVI6PUDX6AaHZEkz2Fgpy89onurZxbV_FA0Yd_QUJ89Zod9Psc0Ux_yhns1c5lt1jfFHTbJsmarBIIkS3dfQr5yywHojfH5ZpZCjX8o](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zi0CCOwpXvwJLEj3O5hPCI485yAI_z0fbVI6PUDX6AaHZEkz2Fgpy89onurZxbV_FA0Yd_QUJ89Zod9Psc0Ux_yhns1c5lt1jfFHTbJsmarBIIkS3dfQr5yywHojfH5ZpZCjX8o)\n\nNew Horizons by KillAshley is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-02T19:56:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2017 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KillAshley**\n  \nv2.0.1"},{"CreatedByName":"McPoisoned","CreatedById":138265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T13:30:43Z","Content":"Looks amazing!
