Press **Esc**\n\n2. Press **Editor**\n\n3. Press **Export Planet**\n\nNow you should have a window pop up like this:\n\n![330xrbk.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/330xrbk.jpg)\n\nNow once this window pops up, uncheck everything except \u0022Color Map\u0022 and \u0022Elevation Map\u0022.\n\nNow the resolution depends on the strength of your graphics card.If you have a medium strength one like mine, type in 2048 and it should automatically recognize the resoultion(it will say 2048x1024).Now click **Export**.BTW, if you have a stronger graphics card, type in 4096, and if you have a weaker graphics card, type in 1024.\n\nNow wait until it says \u0027Done\u0027 in the window.Now you can close SpaceEngine.\n\nNow go to C:\\Program Files\\SpaceEngine 0.97x\\export.You should see two textures, **surface\\_diff** and **surface\\_bump**.Now cut those textures, then go to KSP\\_win/GameData/Kopernicus/Textures and paste those textures there.Rename **surface\\_diff** to **Planet\\_color** and rename **surface\\_bump** to **Planet\\_height**.Now for the normal map.Go to the online normal map tool and make sure you have your folder with your textures opened.Now drag and drop your heightmap into the window the white arrow points at.Now wait a few seconds until it generates a normal map(window next to your height map).Now look down, and you should see a textbox.Type **Planet\\_normal** into it and then click the **Download** button below.Now you should have your normal map downloaded with the name you typed into the textbox.Now just move the normal map into the folder where your other maps are.Now go back to your Kopernicus folder, now go to the **Config** folder and create a new text file.Rename it to **Planet.cfg**.If it displays you a warning about changing the file format/type, click \u0027Yes\u0027 anyway.Now open it up with Notepad and paste this code in:\n\n    @Kopernicus \n    {\n        Body\n        {\n            name = Planet (The name of your planet)\n            flightGlobalsIndex =

Change the template to Laythe in the Kopernicus config.\n\n2. In the Kittopia config, under the PQS\\_VertexHeightMap section, change the heightMapOffstet to a negative number.Feel free to go over -1000 if you want.This will determine the depth of your ocean.Experiment with it, altough if you make it too big, like -5000, it will completely flood the land and leave nothing but tiny islets.If you want to make your oceans really deep, i suggest you increase the height map deformity and whiten the areas on your height map where your land is.\n\n3. Open up your height map for you planet and change or paint the sections where you want you lakes/oceans to be completely pitch black, so that the RGB reads 0,0,0 (RGBA 0,0,0,1).\n\n**Making Gas Giants**\n\nMaking gas giants is the second easiest thing to make, but not as easy as asteroids, which i will be covering later.\n\nYou won\u0027t even need the Kittopia config, just the Kopernicus config.\n\nCreate a new file with the name of your gas giant and change it\u0027s extension to .cfg.Ignore any warnings about changing file extensions if you recieve them\n\nJust copy this code into any text editor and follow the sidenotes:\n\n    @Kopernicus \n    {\n        Body\n        {\n            name = GasGiant\n            flightGlobalsIndex = 12345    //Delete this text and type in any number but not too big.\n            Template\n            {\n                name = Jool                  //Don\u0027t change this\n            }\n            Properties\n            {\n                radius = 6000000                                  //The radius of your gas giant in meters.This is Jool\u0027s.\n                geeASL = 0.8                                       //The gravity of your gas giant.This is Jool\u0027s.\n                mass = 4.2332635e\u002B24                         //The mass of your gas giant, this is Jool\u0027s mass.\n                description = Description of the Planet.    //Type anything here and it will appear in the Tracking Station planet info window.\n                ScienceValues                                      //Change these numbers if you would like.I prefer making them larger if your planet is really far away.\n                {\n                    landedDataValue = 100\n                    splashedDataValue = 0\n                    flyingLowDataValue = 0\n                    flyingHighDataValue = 0\n                    inSpaceLowDataValue = 40\n                    inSpaceHighDataValue = 30\n                    recoveryValue = 5\n                }\n            }\n            Orbit\n            {\n                referenceBody = Sun     //the body your gas giant orbits, DO NOT rename this to Kerbol, it\u0027s named the sun in-game\n                inclination = 0              //Self-explanatory\n                eccentricity = 0            //Self-explanatory\n                semiMajorAxis = (Here, you can type in the distance of your planet in metres from your parent body in numbers)\n                longitudeOfAscendingNode = 0\n                argumentOfPeriapsis = 0\n                meanAnomalyAtEpoch = 0\n                epoch = 0\n                color = 1,1,1,1    //The color of your gas giants\u0027 orbit (RGBA)\n            }\n            ScaledVersion\n            {\n                Material\n                {    \n                    texture = Kopernicus/Textures/GasGiant_color    //the path to your gas giant texture, including the texture name.Type the name of the texture EXACTLY.If you miss a letter, it\u0027s not gonna work.\n              }\n          }\n       }\n    }\n\nAfter you modified this code, just save it, not save as.\n\nNow run the game and be amazed!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T22:53:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Candlelight**\n  \ntweaks and updates"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T15:14:46Z","Content":"Nice tutorial."},{"CreatedByName":"Candlelight","CreatedById":203979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T15:19:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice tutorial.\n\nThanks for reading (if you read it) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).Do you personally think this tut will help new planet makers?"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T15:33:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for reading (if you read it) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).Do you personally think this tut will help new planet makers?\n\nUhh, you don\u0027t use the online normal map maker, you export the scaled space in Kittopia and use the normal map it makes.\n\nPlanet making is a bit harder than this."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T15:43:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Uhh, you don\u0027t use the online normal map maker, you export the scaled space in Kittopia and use the normal map it makes.\n\nLately I haven\u0027t even been exporting planets in KT.
