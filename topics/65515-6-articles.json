Mine didn\u0027t make the ascent from a 233m altitude. I\u0027m sure it would work a little higher though. I think adding fuel to my upper stage kind of ruined everything. However, the landing structure, and everything else worked great. My parachutes had me down to about 21-25 m/s I think, and I used the central engine to get it down to 17m/s, and it just bounced down nicely (to my surprise.) I had 32 drogues and only 8 radial parachutes, so maybe a few more of those would have helped (maybe in place of some of the drogues.) NOTE: when I restored a quicksave, the landing structure was suddenly underground. This was a problem when trying to ascend because things started exploding that shouldn\u0027t. I hacked the quicksave to add 4 meters height because, well, I was correcting a bug in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I was close, but got a little to overconfident with adding the 3-man pod and fuel without considering the lower stages. I didn\u0027t think that small percentage of extra weight would make a huge difference, but it did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, It seems that you put more thought into yours and it has a bit more delta-v so I think you are on the right track.

So, I haven\u0027t had hardly any time to play KSP since the 0.23.5 update came out but last night I was able to get in some time and I used it to work on Eve Two, with the goal of making it prepped for its journey to Eve. So, that meant adding ladders, chutes, lander legs and so forth, and last night I did all that and began testing to see how the equipment would hold up. Usual test battery - infinite fuel on, launch, burn to 25000 ASL, engines off, infinite fuel off, deploy chutes, land (checking characteristics of chute openings), pop off the chutes, take off, pop off the lander legs, try and make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander legs held the weight of rocket and I was able to land safely. The ladders reached all the way to the ground, though I noted Jeb clipping through struts at more than one point (he still made it up and down okay, but had problems going anywhere once he was on the ground, like there were problems with collision meshes or something). Chutes deployed without ripping off though they didn\u0027t slow me down sufficiently for a safe landing on Kerbin. All in all, a generally successful array of tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I encountered an issue was with ejecting the chutes. I built an improved version of my earlier chute pack for the new parts; each pack contains six large chutes, six drogues and eight radials on top of one of the new very large decouplers, with six seperatrons to push it up and away from the stack. Testing of the pack on a single stack went very well - they performed even better than the original packs in terms of getting clear of the rocket. On Eve Two, I set the decouplers for all six packs to fire in the same stage and for their seperatrons to all ignite at the same time, same as the planned ejection sequence for Eve One.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy impression was that everything in a stage activates when you hit the space bar to activate that stage. That\u0027s been the way things have been in KSP from the beginning. And yet last night when I got to the stage to eject my packs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) They didn\u0027t eject all at once\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The seperatrons didn\u0027t ignite all at once\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When they did finally go, they blew up the upper fuel tank on which they were resting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping this was just a fluke, something going on with my local instance of KSP last night.

I have also been noticing that the new decouplers don\u0027t like to fire simultaneously always... yet sometimes they do. It seems like more of them make it worse, but maybe not. I have Eve-8 sitting here with 6 that go off perfectly, yet Eve-7 had 5 (4\u002B1) and I had to mash the space bar repeatedly plus the engines didn\u0027t all fire at once. I\u0027m not sure if it has something to do with how you assemble them, like using symmetry versus individual, or even copying a whole assembly. I was just stopping by the forum to check for bug reports on that actually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T03:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed the chute problem by sticking rockomax decouplers underneath the big decouplers.
