Here\u0027s a shot because the few threads where I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this is the problem people are asking about, there is always a confusion on the interpretation of the question.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eFDVHg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022578\u0022 src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img923/6760/eFDVHg.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current mirrored rotation of these lights means they rotate with the small yellow arrows and \u0022meet\u0022 on the yellow axis/arrow.\u00A0I want the lights to meet and rotate outward from the blue arrow so that, if the blue arrow (by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E door) is 12 o\u0027 clock at this angle, the lights are sitting at like 2 \u0026amp; 10 (as opposed to 2 \u0026amp; 4, right now).

My trick is to build in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and rotate the whole craft, sometimes the symmetry axis or focal point will change. Altought I can never say wich way will work, I have to rotate the whole craft around and try. It does not always follow a strict logic I think, or at least none that is obvious. Sometimes even changing the root part can flip symmetry axes around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDont know if this helps your craft, but its definitely worth a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-24T16:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure that the mirror axis is tied to the coordinate system for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and there\u0027s no easy way to change it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way to work around it would be to take off your cargo bay, rotate it using q or e, and then place it.
