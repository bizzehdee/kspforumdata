Metallic Hydrogen has possibly been made (in science you tend to need a few more examples to prove no error has been made, so we need a couple more productions of it). It is possibly metastable in some compounds (mixing with lithium or something). So, given 100 years? We might be able to get a fuel tank (still under pressure!) with it in. This gives you good size vs weight vs thrust/reaction mass. It\u0027s still super expensive to make.

That speeds up play/tests/trials/missions as you can, once a colony is kitted out, save on the few years transit time. It leads to more emergent gameplay. IIRC they said you\u0027d have to bring parts across to build craft first, then later industry/kerbals can build the parts for you.

You might move fast, but you move \u003Cstrong\u003Epredictably\u003C/strong\u003E, and that\u0027s the same as not moving at all in military terms.

metallic hydrogen rockets are, in fact, a bit too sci-fi for KSP. So your work hasn\u0027t been completely in vain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, I still think they\u0027re close to that line and deciding on which side of the line they fall is a judgment call. As others have pointed out, KSP is sci-fi and if you think about it too hard it requires a quite a lot of suspension of disbelief; one more thing won\u0027t fundamentally change it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, I do not expect them to work like you expect them to work. That would be seriously unbalancing and obsolete pretty much any other rocket engine. The devs have made games before. They know about balance issues. At this point I trust them to give them limitations that stop them from obsoleting everything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, if they do make them that \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, it is the easiest kind of problem for us as players to live with --\u00A0simply don\u0027t design with them.
