The ion engine itself has gone from a painful .5kN of thrust to 2kN of thrust!!!!!! From what math I have done so far I do believe it may be possible to now make Ion craft that can land on Moho, the Mun, Ike (OK, I have seen someone land on Ike with the older version of the engine but it will be way easier now!!!), Vall, Eeloo, and even DUNA!!!! The only downside to this is that the Isp has been cut in half to a mere 2100... Still its higher than the NERVA!!! So pretty much the Ion engine is no longer really an ion engine and more so that of the VASMIR!!!!!! So my question is how will this effect you now that Ions have been so heavily altered? Are you super exited to make a massive Interplanetary ion powered vessel? Do you hate the devs for cutting its ISP down so much??
