Specifically, the MPL is greatly lacking in data storage. To remedy this, JDI has crammed a bunch of data storage devices into the standard MPL, along with some basic hardware to operate them. (We\u0027re sorry about that thumb drive you left on your desk, we promise it is being put to better use.)\n\nWhat this mod does\n\nI felt that the current stock MPL didn\u0027t really anywhere very well at the moment. It processes too slowly to be useful earlier in career mode, and has too little capacity later on. Additionally it has truly massive return if you were willing to timewarp babysit the thing. I aimed to fix these issues.\n\n- Moves the stock MPL earlier in the tech tree and reduces its weight. Nerfs the data-to-science conversion rate significantly, but dramatically increases peak processing speed to compensate.\n\n- Adds two extra MPLs to the tech tree with increased data storage capacity and processing speeds adjusted to that capacity.\n\nThe parts:\n\n**MPL-DSD-1**\n\nA Mobile Processing Labs sans some crew space. Not only does the DSD-1 boast storage for up to 3000 data, but also contains a co-processor which can greatly\\* speed processing of stored data. Notice: Data storage on this magnitude requires significant energy investment.\n\n![7jJS2m1.png](http://i.imgur.com/7jJS2m1.png)\n\n\\*Slightly. Maybe.\n\nThe DSD-1 is has a better data-to-science conversion ratio than the stock MPL, but converts at a slower rate.\\* It is heavier than the stock MPL as well, and costs quite a bit more electricity. In general it is probably an upgrade to the stock version except in situations where you aren\u0027t expecting much more than 500 data and/or have a serious weight restriction. \n\n\\*All labs, including the stock MPL, process at peak speed with completely full. However, a lab with a slower peak processing rate but higher data capacity may still produce more science even over a short term. This is because processing speed is directly proportional to how full the data storage is. \n\n**MPL-DSD-2**\n\nUtilizing advances in Shove-it-in-Harder\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AE technology, JDI has been able to more than triple the storage density of previous versions. The co-processor was even liberated from a real computer this time!\n\n![WPKyLL0.png](http://i.imgur.com/WPKyLL0.png)\n\nThe DSD-2 maintains its predecessors data to science conversion rate, while significantly enhancing available data storage, science storage, and peak processing rate. The downside is significant weight, and an even greater electrical footprint.\n\nFuture Plans\n\n- Custom models/textures\n- Heat management\n- Resource requirements\n- Mod compatibility\n\nMy goal is to create an alternative set of mobile labs which allow for greater data storage and processing efficiency, but will require coolant and/or radiators to function. Additionally, the stock lab, despite its shortcomings, **is deeply overpowered**. I\u0027m hoping to reign in the raw science production a bit, while improving other characteristics in such a way that the labs are still attractive. I.E., more fun, less cheese.\n\nStuff to Know\n\nMost of this information applies to vanilla KSP as well as my mod.\n\n- A scientist\u0027s experience level (number of stars) has a HUGE effect on their effective contribution. Never use zero star scientists if possible, as even one star scientist is **six times** more effective!\n- The processing speed of the lab is directly proportional to the amount of data stored in it. Try to keep you labs stocked with data.\n\nDependencies\n\n- [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)\n\nDownload: [Kerbal Stuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/989/DSD%20Mobile%20Processing%20Labs)\n\nSource: [Github](https://github.com/JDCollie/Data-Storage-Device/tree/1.0)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.0 \n\u003E \n\u003E - Balanced return rates with my vision for the mod\n\u003E \n\u003E - Added CTT compatibility\n\u003E \n\u003E 0.2 \n\u003E \n\u003E - Added custom models\n\u003E \n\u003E 0.1 \n\u003E \n\u003E - Initial testing release\n\nIn progress model for DSD-1:\n\n[table=width: 500]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]![pFogIcb.png](http://i.imgur.com/pFogIcb.png)[/td]\n\n [td]![L6302ft.png](http://i.imgur.com/L6302ft.png)[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **All of these are just ideas. I may implement all of them, or none.**\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m considering at least four labs total, five if you include the stock MPL.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Stock MPL changes**\n\u003E \n\u003E Balanced to be an alternative to more powerful options (but which have their own economic and logistic shortcomings). Probably unlock concurrently with the DSD-1.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Reduce weight by .5 tons\n\u003E - reduce data to science ratio (stock is 1:5)\n\u003E - improve processing speed - I\u0027d like to see the lab process about 35 data per Kerbin day when fully crewed, which would finish 500 data in about two kerbal weeks, rather than in a year or whatever.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Basic MPL**\n\u003E \n\u003E A preliminary MPL designed to be researched early on and give players science options prior to unlocking 2.5m capacity. Frankly, the stock tree is so small that this isn\u0027t all that relevant, but I\u0027m building this mod with heavily modded tech trees like CTT in mind. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - 1.25m (possibly 1.85m) part\n\u003E - 1 crew capacity\n\u003E - 2:1 data to science return, but no homeworld modifier - currently the game reduces data conversion by 90% if you are landed on your homeworld. This lab would not suffer from that shortcoming.\n\u003E - lightweight (1-1.5t)\n\u003E - Rover attachment points for surface deployment, as well door placement with rover builds in mind.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **DSD-1**\n\u003E \n\u003E First DSD MPL, designed for orbital deployment. I\u0027m hoping this one will be the core of early-to-midgame stations.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Enhanced data storage over stock. (currently 3000)\n\u003E - Electrical cost while active, enough to necessitate electrically minded design and placement.\n\u003E - if possible, code plugin to have electric charge usage scale with amount of data stored. - I dunno if I can do this, but it would be cool ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E - Heavier than stock\n\u003E - Reduced crew capacity, but increased return per science over stock - Net result is a lab with (hopefully) slower processing but better long term return, along with much greater storage capacity.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **DSD-2**\n\u003E \n\u003E Flagship DSD MPL\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Greatly enhanced data storage (currently 10,000)\n\u003E - Increased power drain.\n\u003E - Same science per data as DSD-1, but allow 2 crew - this means a direct performance upgrade due to second kerbal.\n\u003E - Heavier than DSD-1\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Drone MPL**\n\u003E \n\u003E A very rudimentary lab unlocked fairly late in the tree. Designed to be placed on rovers you don\u0027t intend to recover.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Processes data at the speed of a one star scientist , but operates unmanned.\n\u003E - Profile similar to Material Exposure Bay, but heavier.\n\u003E - lower data capacity\n\u003E - same return rate as Basic MPL. (2 data: 1 science)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Heating**\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m considering a heating mechanic. If I can figure out how to code it, I\u0027d like the DSD-1 \u0026 2 to produce heat while storing data, preferably scaling the heat production to the amount of storage currently being used. If I did implement this, the heating would be scaled to be manageable with stock radiators.\n\u003E \n\u003E **Cooling**\n\u003E \n\u003E Alternatively, I am considering making the DSD-1 \u0026 2 consume a \u0022coolant\u0022 resource of some variety while they are in operation. The resource would be CRP compliant, and if possible I would just add it as an option to existing tanks via Firespitter fuelswitch. I\u0027m not terribly sold on this idea though, since it adds some extra maintenance requirements, but no real gameplay improvements.\n\u003E \n\u003E COMPLETE Custom models\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T04:47:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JDCollie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Herman Kerbal","CreatedById":38815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T13:50:28Z","Content":"uhh, very nice!
