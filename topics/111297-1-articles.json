I have to reset the computer after that. A temporary fix is to turn off the downclocking of the card while in idle but that increases power consumption by 30W. Hope anyone knows a fix for that. My Specs are R9 290, FX 8350, Msi 970 Gaming AM3\u002B, 8GB Ram and a 750W bequiet power supply."},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:57:34Z","Content":"I can imagine its the voltage thats dropping to far on idle, but that would be very unusual since they test lots of GPUs to determine a voltage were none are unstable. If you are able to edit the idle clock of the card change it to a lower value and look if that is stable, then this will be the issue and you should return the card."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:27:30Z","Content":"Have you tried wiping and installing the latest drivers?
