I suppose I\u0027m just not a plane person. Still, occasionally I end up making an effort to poke at them, and yesterday was such a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile doing a few test flights, it occurred to me: how do I figure out how far my plane can fly? I have KER\u0027s dV readout, and that\u0027s fine for a rocket, but a plane doesn\u0027t really work that way, does it. For instance, I could fly at a higher altitude and lose 40% of my engine\u0027s Isp, but reach twice the airspeed - so even though the dV readout just crumbled, my total distance covered will actually be higher in this regime!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is obviously a complex problem that\u0027s highly dependant on the specific conditions, so I\u0027m not asking for mathematically precise solutions or anything. I\u0027m just curious how the \u0022plane pros\u0022 go about estimating the cruising range of their aircraft. For instance, if you have the Fine Print addon installed, you can get contracts to fly past a number of waypoints on Kerbin\u0027s surface at specific altitudes. These waypoints are not always close to KSC, or even to each other, so having a way to at least roughly eyeball the atmospheric cruise range of your aircraft could be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T10:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMarked as Answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T08:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027d describe myself as a \u0022plane pro\u0022, but I do have a few relevant thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn rocketry (in vacuum), the formula for calculating delta-V is fairly straightforward - you have a fixed amount of thrust per fuel (ISP), a fixed amount of dry mass and a variable amount of fuel mass. Calculating delta-V is just a matter of those 3 variables (only one of which really varies during a flight). Even delta-V for an atmospheric launch is fairly easy to calculate because only the slowest, lowest part of the ascent will be affected significantly by atmosphere, and assuming a terminal velocity ascent it\u0027s not too hard to work out how much drag you\u0027ll experience for how long. In other words, ascent delta-V doesn\u0027t vary very much, on the grand scale, from craft to craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an aircraft, though, you aren\u0027t flying straight up to space, and therefore quickly escaping the delta-V cost of ascent. Instead, you\u0027re flying through the atmosphere, always experiencing drag to greater or lesser extent. You also have an added variable - lift - which is dependent on speed, and therefore on the balance of thrust and drag. Lift works against mass, basically converting some of your thrust into negative mass (assuming you\u0027re flying straight and level). In vacuum, any delta-V you use is retained as orbital energy (unless you burn retrograde). In atmosphere, this is like having a retro-thruster with infinite fuel that burns harder against you the faster you go, so the more delta-V you spend, the more quickly it\u0027s dissipated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsequently, your atmospheric delta-V calculation becomes very much more complicated, and the answer changes rapidly depending on your situation - high and fast has far more delta-V than low and slow, but a climbing plane has less delta-V than a descending plane. Complicated, no? Therefore it doesn\u0027t really make any sense to use delta-V to calculate aircraft range, and you might as well just fall back on the old-fashioned measures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel-time: How long you can run your engines on full throttle before you run out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperational ceiling: How high can your plane fly without running out of lift or thrust (due to low air/intake pressure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum speed at ceiling: How fast can you fly at peak altitude. This will depend on your drag coefficient at the air pressure of your ceiling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: it is possible to design a plane that can overcome these limitations - this is the basic design principle of a jet-powered spaceplane.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaximum speed * maximum fueltime = maximum distance (usually called range).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will always be an overestimate as it doesn\u0027t include fuel used to climb and accelerate (or descend and land).
