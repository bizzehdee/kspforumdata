Personally, I\u0027ve always found those spaceplanes built up with a billion wings as some sort of artsy shell to be ugly. They fly now as they would in real life: horribly.

With just two normal jet engines and one air scoop, I can\u0027t break 300m/s at 7-8k, and I actually start losing thrust. I seem to be exactly as limited in airspeed at 400m as I am at 4000m.
