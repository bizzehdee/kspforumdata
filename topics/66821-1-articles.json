Pure Tungsten metal, having the highest melting/boiling temperatures of any PURE element, is ideal for use in spark plugs, spark gap electrodes, and many common welding electrodes {TIG welding = Tungsten Inert Gas welding})\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Tungsten forms an extremely hard and abrasive wear-resistant carbide. Tungsten carbide is likely the most common material used for the cutting face of metal-working tools, and is the foundation material for other cutting edge materials used to make cutting edges\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a heatshield, we\u0027re interested in #1. However, we have a slight problem. It doesn\u0027t take much heat energy to make Tungsten melt or boil, even tho it takes a high temperature to do so. Graphite (carbon) takes far more heat to melt or boil than Tungsten does, but at a lower temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I understand enthalpy of phase transitions, which is what makes that actually perfectly reasonable:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say we have a 1kg cube of Tungsten, at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C, and a 1kg cube of Graphite (carbon), also at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C. perfectly thermally insulated from each other and the outside world (closed system)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s say we heat both cubes with separate 1kw heat sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should ignore temperature limits of the heating system, black-body radiation of the cubes, and non-uniform heating effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth cubes started at the same temperature of 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C, and are gaining heat energy at the same rate. (1000 joules per second)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth cubes have the same mass, and started at the same temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes less energy to melt or boil 1kg of Tungsten than it does to melt and boil 1kg of Graphite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe numbers for \u0022how hard is it to heat up material X\u0022 are called \u0022heat of melting\u0022, \u0022heat of vaporization\u0022, and \u0022heat capacity\u0022, IIRC. (might not be technically correct, but should be word-synonym close)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means that the Tungsten cube will reach its melting and boiling points with less total heat energy input, even tho the graphite cube has the lower melting and boiling points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, Water has both Tungsten and Graphite beat hands-down on all three of those numbers I mentioned.

It\u0027s good if at least the leading edge of the heat shield conducts heat somewhat, which creates a heat-sink from the point of view of any hotspots. And letting the heat be conducted deeper into the heatshield creates a better sink (as long as you don\u0027t let the sensitive parts of the spacecraft get too hot, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat shields get rid of energy in three ways. Ablation, radiation and heat sinking. The latter doesn\u0027t directly get rid of the energy, of course, but gives radiation more time to do its work.
