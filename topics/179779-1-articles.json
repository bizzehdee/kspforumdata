would be nice if there was an AI that\u0027d just let them head over and repair them.\u00A0 \u00A0Well considering it\u0027s an entirely enclosed structure it may be possible; but probably out of my foreseeable skill range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m not anywhere near that point in my KSP modding experience levels yet;
