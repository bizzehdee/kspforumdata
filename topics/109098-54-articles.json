I watched a story of the unlikely test pilot, interesting story I suggest looking it up.

Most of my designs that use this setup have removed the tail elevators and use canards for most of the pitch authority.   I also use the fly-by-wire mod which makes the craft fly more like a modern fighter craft.  I also use leading edge slats, on most of my more agile aircraft and even on some of my more mundane designs.  But those engines are designed to gimbal and pitch the aircraft.  And with your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E ahead of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, it isnt helping your design much.   Move it back closer to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E, so it is abit more stable.  I know that isn\u0027t exactly what you are going for but in KSP making a modern aerodynamically unstable airframe is a challenge to fly in this game.   \n\nSo I like to have my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E either right on top or a hair behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.  I have no recent craft pictures but I have a fair number of forward swept wing airframes.  I found they are a bit trickier to design but when they work they work really well for high speed flight and lower speed flight.   But have NASTY stall departures."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-28T05:25:26Z","Content":"OK Schwarz have gotten some time to upload some of the picks of the aircraft I have been working on for you to give you an idea what I am talking about.
