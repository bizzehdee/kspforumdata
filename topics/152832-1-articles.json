I don\u0027t know if you can do it, but it would be great if you could. If you have bought Planet Coaster on it\u0027s website, you\u0027ll get the opportunity to copy a steam code and download it to steam. My suggestion is to do this on KSP too. It would be handy if you could download KSP to steam if you have purchased it on KSPs website. So if you could give us the opportunity to get it on steam too, I\u00A0would be very grateful:)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndrintoIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrintoIT","CreatedById":172100,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T17:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a very short suggestion.

The option to transfer KSP Store licenses to Steam is only available for those who bought KSP before it originally came out on Steam, March 20th 2013.\u00A0Note that if you do qualify for a transfer and choose to do it, the process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE. If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSP Store.\u00A0To move to Steam, log in to your KSP Store profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link. If you can\u2019t see the button in your profile it means you purchased the game after it was on Steam and you are not eligible, no exceptions, please don\u2019t insist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrintoIT","CreatedById":172100,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T17:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk:) I was a few months too late then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2013-09-09\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T17:08:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AndrintoIT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
