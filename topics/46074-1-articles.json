(seen in picture) The \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epod was to return one of the kerbals back to KSC. I approach the docking at 0.1 m/s; as slow \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas I can manage, but moments after docking, the station begins to spin wildly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried disabling reaction wheels/torque and turning off electrical at the Mk1 pod before \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edocking, but have the same bad results.
