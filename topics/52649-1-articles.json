This feels really phony and I need some sort of motivation to limit how much time the Kerbal can stay on the Mun. I\u0027ve tried some of the mods, but the ones I have tried don\u0027t support .22 and make exploration nearly impossible. So, any life support mods that have \u003Cstrong\u003Eproper\u003C/strong\u003E support for .22?
