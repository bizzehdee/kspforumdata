This attention is one of the main reasons aero and heat got so much rebalancing work! Pretty obvious, if you ask me, the devnotes constantly updated us on the current work. Honestly, I\u0027d assume that the aero/heat was released this way at least to some degree to balance it with the help of the community.

The situation was probably the worst in the 80s and the 90s, when OS crashes were commonplace and people just had to learn to live with the bugs in their software, because patches were generally not available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, software quality has generally been improving, despite the fact that software continues getting bigger and more complex. There are several causes behind this trend. Computers are much more powerful than they used to be, so developers don\u0027t have to think as much about efficiency as they used to. Instead of writing code for the computer, they\u0027re now writing it for the other developers, decreasing the frequency of bugs and making the code easier to modify. Another cause is the ease of distributing patches over the internet. If you pick a random computer user at a random time, it\u0027s quite unlikely that they\u0027re using the first released version of any piece of software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third major cause is a philosopical one. Instead of seeing software as a product that is developed, finished, and released, people see it as a system that\u0027s constantly changing. In the old terminology, we had alphas, betas, release candidates, and releases, which all referred to the software product. These days, it\u0027s more useful to talk about the state of the development process. For example, a piece of software can be under internal development, released and under development, or abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T11:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nigeth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nigeth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo it is not \u0022getting increasingly more hazy\u0022.

Intermittent bugs are the worst. I see bugs in the tracker asking and waiting for a consistent method to reproduce them. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027times new roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003EIs the developer\u0027s time better spent on bugs - or advancing the entire game, such that old bugs might become obsolete?

I can accept wafer-thin features, financially-driven decisions and slow development, providing the base game is stable enough for modders to provide the depth of content we crave.
