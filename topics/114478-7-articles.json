These bugs have had no sign of being fixed, they continue to tinker with major aspects of the game, and are making rookie mistakes in development and community management with almost every update. Pointing out that this spells trouble seems eminently logical.\n\nThese projections failed until now: The bugs were probable to get fixed alone by Squads history of looking at the forums and taking note of the more serious bugs and issues. This attention is one of the main reasons aero and heat got so much rebalancing work! Pretty obvious, if you ask me, the devnotes constantly updated us on the current work. Honestly, I\u0027d assume that the aero/heat was released this way at least to some degree to balance it with the help of the community. This idea was at least mentioned in some devnote.\n\nThis history and it\u0027s results (people seem to like the current atmo) generally make me believe that Squad, who made a very successfull game with a good community, do indeed understand how to develope a videogame. How many of the general critics can actually say that from themselve? \n\nEspecially using terms like \u0027rookie mistakes\u0027 is very incendiary language if more than half the forum is watching in wonder about the vigor in these criticisms in the first place. Or the community management part: It\u0027s kind of paradox, when the same fraction of people complaining about the CM leading to bad community reactions, when they\u0027re the main part that\u0027s reacting so negatively in the first place. Feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T10:59:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 10:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T11:34:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E TNo it is not \u0022getting increasingly more hazy\u0022.

Also because the game is \u0022technically still in beta\u0022.\n\nThe software crisis is an almost 50 years old term for the observation that the bigger and more complex a piece of software gets, the harder it becomes to keep the quality acceptable. The situation was probably the worst in the 80s and the 90s, when OS crashes were commonplace and people just had to learn to live with the bugs in their software, because patches were generally not available.\n\nSince then, software quality has generally been improving, despite the fact that software continues getting bigger and more complex. There are several causes behind this trend. Computers are much more powerful than they used to be, so developers don\u0027t have to think as much about efficiency as they used to. Instead of writing code for the computer, they\u0027re now writing it for the other developers, decreasing the frequency of bugs and making the code easier to modify. Another cause is the ease of distributing patches over the internet. If you pick a random computer user at a random time, it\u0027s quite unlikely that they\u0027re using the first released version of any piece of software.\n\nThe third major cause is a philosopical one. Instead of seeing software as a product that is developed, finished, and released, people see it as a system that\u0027s constantly changing. In the old terminology, we had alphas, betas, release candidates, and releases, which all referred to the software product. These days, it\u0027s more useful to talk about the state of the development process. For example, a piece of software can be under internal development, released and under development, or abandoned."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T11:53:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No it is not \u0022getting increasingly more hazy\u0022.

That one is a matter of personal preference. I think the mobile is cool and representative of what happens in KSP. Stuff just tends to float off in all directions, and hanging it up in a corner somewhere, is a way of professing the \u0022LoLsoKerbal\u0022 meme to your visitors ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) \n\n- The assertion (dig it out of the article archives) that there would be multiple beta releases, only to have that retrospectively reduced to one\n\nYup. No argument there. \n\n- The immediate and largely inexplicable (in development terms) jump to 1.0 release\n\nBut, [they **have** explained it](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/328076/misc_post_perspective_from_a_programmer_on/). Some simply don\u0027t accept the explanation. Whether this has resulted in problems **worse** than player irritation is a subject that could be analyzed, but mostly what I see in the forums is stuff like this thread of frustration and speculation about doom-and-gloom scenarios. Meanwhile KSP gets glowing commercial reviews, causing more irritation that reviewers \u0022just don\u0027t get it - game is bug-ridden and incomplete.\u0022 These things may be true to some extent, but both commercial and player reviews [ Positive (22,589) Negative (448) ] on Steam seem willing to \\*forgive\\* faults that other writers find unforgivable. The development of KSP continues, just as they promised it would in the Beyond Beta article at the beginning of the year.\n\n**Communications**\n\n- The irritating shotgun approach to PR, which basically amounts to an uncoordinated mess, lots of misunderstandings and mixed messages (correcting this is a low-cost no-brainer)\n\nThe key word is irritating. At times I agree with you, but I want to offer [this link about a related subject, where Kasper explains](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110171-Should-SQUAD-post-all-KSP-announcements-on-the-official-forum?p=1728131\u0026viewfull=1#post1728131) that they **choose** to do PR across a variety of platforms. They are a business that wants to reach the widest possible audience; they will go where the people are. Meanwhile, various employees will tweet stuff that might be news-worthy, but anything \u0022important\u0022 gets cross-posted by people who think it is important, just about everywhere. It can be a matter of preference; I like the small-company feel, compared to press portal corporate PR reviewed by lawyers. \n\n- The weird reluctance to share development tangents in fear of community backlash if they don\u0027t come to fruition, yet...\n\nI agree and wish for more sharing of development news. Unfortunately, [the fear has been explained](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/313-Beta-Than-Ever-The-Future-of-KSP), and is sadly \u0022why we can\u0027t have nice things.\u0022 \n\n\u003E \n\u003E any lists we publish can only result in leaving people disappointed. The problem here is that no amount of disclaimers and notices will keep everyone from taking every feature on a list as a commitment from us. We don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to commit to anything we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not sure about ourselves, so if we do have to leave something out, we should be the only ones to be disappointed. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not great, we know, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s for the best.\n\nI think many of us would like to see the mysterious \u0022road map,\u0022 no matter what changeable format it is in. I can imagine forum threads discussing the merits or total wrongness of each thought they have penciled and doodled. And then the scenario described in the quote above, when the next major update comes out.\n\n- The inappropriate hyping of largely inconsequential developments, leading to community over-estimation, frustration and, arguably, contributes to...\n\nHype can be unfortunate, but it\u0027s partially on us, as you write. We are the ones who get overly excited by various announcements, and ought to learn to view hype through special sunglasses. What is important to Squad can work out to be unimportant to many player groups.\n\n- The simultaneous increase in introversion of the Devs, where communication is limited to a weekly note and \u0027on spec\u0027 communication is almost none-existent (compare to other games with low staff numbers and you\u0027ll be shocked at how badly KSP does this relationship management)\n\nI think the Dev weekly communications strategy was worked out a long time ago. [They like it](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73660-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-Award-Winning-Community-Edition?p=1045505\u0026viewfull=1#post1045505). They point out that the very popular, and rare, feature development articles are very time consuming. Every company finds something that works for them, what is important to me is that they are consistent with it. The recent PS4 picture-devnote was an anomaly, quickly followed up by words explaining that they just didn\u0027t have much else to talk about that week.\n\n****\n\n**Development**\n\n- The constant community warnings against rushing to release, driven largely by concerns about QA capacity, only to be ignored and sadly proven correct\n\nEvery release is a release, and is subject to its own problems. What is important to me is that Squad does follow up on serious release problems, often kicking out patches within a week. Concerns about QA are largely a perception that [more is better](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51324-On-the-topic-of-0-22?p=671397\u0026viewfull=1#post671397). Squad has countered numerous times that more QA requires more filtering, e.g., [the noise ratio goes up](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0?p=1793953\u0026viewfull=1#post1793953). Some problems are on Unity, and out of Squad\u0027s control. I agree that some others **in** Squad\u0027s control, [to their regret](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/337-KSP-1-0-1-Is-Up), weren\u0027t addressable before release. (I\u0027m quoting a specific example, but it has happened before, and will happen again. (BSG reference) ) Circular discussion; move back to first sentence.\n\n- The knee-jerk and ill-considered adjustments to the game based on community trends (aero balance, 64-bit hack)\n\nPhrases like knee-jerk and ill-considered, are a matter of personal opinion. We don\u0027t know how much time and snacks were consumed thinking and creating both the original concepts and adjustments to them. Some facets of the Aero/heat balance efforts turned critics into converts; one can no longer decry the monolithic \u0022soup-o-sphere,\u0022 now we have so much more to talk about ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Squad\u0027s support of the Modding community is both acknowledgement of this, and a relief valve for players who don\u0027t agree with the balance that Squad chooses.\n\n- The loss and lack of replacement of competent staff, despite the huge financial success of the game and assurances that development is not nearing the end\n\nIt\u0027s sad, but also nice that Squad allowed departing staff a final word in their Devnotes. [They](https://twitter.com/Maxmaps/status/605854927504605184) are [working on it](https://twitter.com/Maxmaps/status/605854962061443072).\n\n**Content**\n\n- Long-standing bugs that are still unresolved (why is Claw\u0027s thread even necessary?)\n\nClaw is out in front, working without a test team, releasing his own personal view of how to solve various problems, as he sees them. Claw\u0027s workarounds and fixes are generally awesome and I use them, too. Squad may not choose to roll out his solution, because they could have a different idea or are working on a completely new system. That is especially relevant now that development is moving fully onto the Unity 5 platform. \n\nAsking Squad to stop and just fix (less catastrophic) bugs is a very popular idea, I see bugs that bother me all the time. Squad has to juggle development time to address the worst bugs: crashing and unplayable-no-workaround bugs should be addressed; while moving forward with new systems and features. Intermittent bugs are the worst. I see bugs in the tracker asking and waiting for a consistent method to reproduce them. \n\nIs the developer\u0027s time better spent on bugs - or advancing the entire game, such that old bugs might become obsolete? The forums will debate this juggling act to the end of time.\n\n- Added features are often wafer-thin and bug-prone\n- The direction and structure of career mode remains a patchwork of features that, with regret, don\u0027t particularly add up to a compelling experience (I think someone, quite accurately, referred to it as being \u0027rudderless\u0027 earlier). The denial of this is as frustrating as the amount of time spent developing it.\n\nA lot of the above is par for the course in some ways. I can accept wafer-thin features, financially-driven decisions and slow development, providing the base game is stable enough for modders to provide the depth of content we crave. To that end, I\u0027m sitting KSP development out until I see a stable Unity 5 x64 release, with several bug fixing patches following it.\n\nHowever, Squad, above all else, need to sort out their godawful communications strategy. I figure that they can head off a lot of critique they get by taking a slightly more honest and open approach to dealing with their customers."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:04:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I love it to death, but I just can\u0027t handle all of the stress.\n\nThanks for your honesty, I think that\u0027s the issue.

Truth be told I haven\u0027t touched the game since 0.90. When they announced that they were \u0022uncomfortable\u0022 with the early access label, and that was the primary reason given for moving to 1.0, I stopped playing. I\u0027m glad I have because if I had a post-release craft go from fine to unflyable I\u0027d be pretty pissed. I\u0027m going to continue sitting out KSP, possibly forever, unless I see some really focused improvement and understanding of what a released game is."}]}
