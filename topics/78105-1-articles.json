I shouldn\u0027t be able to improve my reputation by rolling a Kerbal out to the launchpad and then immediately recovering the craft. The game knows \u0022pre-launch\u0022 as a possible state; maybe require vehicles to not be in that state before they can be recovered for rep? It wouldn\u0027t stop people from setting throttle to zero and staging, or something like that, but it would prevent me using up the diminishing recovery rep on non-missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T05:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, actually, I figure that the game should scale rep returns for recovered Kerbals according to how far they\u0027ve been -- a kerbal to the Mun and back gives less than, say, a kerbal to Duna and back.
