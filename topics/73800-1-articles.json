For example, you would only start with a small VAB. From there you would have to buy a larger VAB to make bigger rockets, a dirt runway, upgraded to a paved runway, a launch pad, runway lights, a tracking station, etc. This would really help with the progression of the game since then not only are the ships evolving, but the space center as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T04:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m honestly surprised that this idea isn\u0027t on the WNTSL, it has been suggested so many times simply because it is such a good idea, I can\u0027t recall if the devs have made a comment on this or not.
