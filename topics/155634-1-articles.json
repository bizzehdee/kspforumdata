I haven\u0027t been hugely worried about contracts since I\u0027m far enough along that cash isn\u0027t much of a problem, but recently I started to notice something: I was only ever getting \u0022science from x\u0022 and \u0022plant flag on x\u0022 contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cycle goes something like this. I accept a contract for science from Mun surface. Easy, accept, send a mission there, complete the contract, go back to pick another one. Science from Dres. OK, I\u0027ve got an orbiter there, couple clicks later that one\u0027s done and I\u0027m picking another one. Science from Kerbin. OK, send a crew report down from my space station, done, pick another one. Science from Eve surface... wait, what the heck happened to other types of contracts? Why haven\u0027t I had a tourism contract in a while, or a satellite launch, or a survey...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then I remember the contract weighting system. Of which there is exactly ZERO mention in game, which is why I forgot it existed. \u0022Science from x\u0022 contracts are easy to the point of being practically free money--\u0026gt; I always accept them--\u0026gt; game is convinced I want to do nothing but \u0022science from x\u0022 contracts--\u0026gt; I stop getting any other kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember back when the weighting system was introduced, I think in 1.1.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130299-devnote-tuesday-everyone-pitches-in/#comment-2370394\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E I posted my qualms about it in the Devnotes thread\u003C/a\u003E. A lot of people agreed with me but obviously Squad ignored me, because I turned out to be completely and utterly right. Especially since the system appears to be incredibly sensitive--accepting or declining just a half-dozen or so contracts is enough to throw the weighting all out of whack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is, there\u0027s a lot of situations in which a user might \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E accept a certain type of contract--but that doesn\u0027t mean they \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E want to do other types. My science contract issue is one example. Another would be a user who, as a rule, always accepts rescue contracts--they would rapidly end up doing nothing else. And there are undoubtedly others that I haven\u0027t encountered yet because I personally don\u0027t happen to play those ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my own purposes in my own game, I\u0027m not that bothered about it. I\u0027ve already edited my contracts.cfg to disable rescues to avoid that problem, I\u0027ll probably just edit it again to disable weighting entirely. My concern is for relatively new users, users who are averse to modding for whatever reason, and users on consoles who don\u0027t have the option to edit config files. Such a user might \u003Cem\u003Enot even know the contract system is weighted\u003C/em\u003E, let alone how to edit configs or selectively accept and decline contracts to manipulate the weighting system, and a few missions into career mode be completely baffled by why they\u0027re getting nothing but constant, endless rescue missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here are my suggestions, in ascending order of probable annoyance to implement: remove the weighting system entirely, add a toggle for it in the difficulty options, or replace it with a system where the user can set their own priorities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-27T09:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhmmm... yea, I too find that I\u0027m not getting an inordinate amount of rescue contracts. It used to be that these contracts dried up after a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI accepted 2 station contracts (1 for mun, 1 for minmus) - now its giving me contracts to build new stations around those same bodies.... really I just wanted to get paid to make the orbiting fuel depot/lab I was going to make anyway while science and anomaly farming Minmus/Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe relay contracts are getting annoying too... I wanted to set up a relay network... but its up now... I had been accepting a contract, putting it in their orbit, then moving it to where I really wanted it. Now... I\u0027d like those contracts to go away, or at least move to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I will give them credit for Kerb net \u002B money for finding anomalies though. Before kerbnet, I only found 2 mun arches and the armstrong memorial on my own.

In game terms, we need the ability to make \u0022mission\u0022 plans, which have no rewards save rep and science, and \u0022contracts\u0022 in which 3d parties want something done. In both cases, the player should weight contracts/whatever explicitly, ideally by Body.
