You have my eternal gratitude. As with most mod authors, I expect your main reason for maintaining this mod that you both enjoy it at least as much as I do, but it\u0027s always good to express and receive appreciation. Beside reducing part count and letting people make much more aesthetically pleasing aircraft, this mod has been as important for me as FAR for modeling supermaneuverability; there are aircraft designs which are not only tedious but physically impossible to create using stock parts. When it comes to the balance between maneuverability and aerodynamic stability, tiny variations in wing and control surface size are the difference between safely buzzing the VAB at mach 2 and stalling out during takeoff.  \n\nNow, a quick question which actually hasn\u0027t been answered here: is the \u0022mass\u0022 parameter in the .cfg files for these crafts the unit mass for these parts? By that I mean; if I double this parameter in the config file, will the mass of a pWing of a given size be doubled, or is the parameter just a placeholder? I\u0027ve read the .CFG documentation wiki page and have some experience modding Civilization, but I don\u0027t have any actual coding experience, so I don\u0027t know where to look to find out how you define the final mass of a pWing.  \n\nThank you!  \n\n- an aerodynamics enthusiast"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T04:25:31Z","Content":"Placeholder. The actual wing mass under stock is is defined based on its lifting capabilities which is derived from lifting surface area (should probably add a little fudge in there for thickness, may not be accounted for atm). FAR does its own wing mass calculations and has a tweakable slider for wing strength which increases mass and the forces required for aerodynamic failures\n\nIf you want to tweak mass further, your best bet is the unpackaged github version which allows you to add resources to the wings. If you just want a mass teakable, add the ablator resource and you can change the carried quantity to increase mass.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T04:33:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reiver","CreatedById":148134,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T09:50:02Z","Content":"Lunatic suggestion: Is it possible to have these things foldable? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Warro","CreatedById":156349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T10:28:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, Reiver said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Lunatic suggestion: Is it possible to have these things foldable? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nTry Infernal Robotics."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T02:13:13Z","Content":"Minor-ish Bug report on the .11 Test release.\n\nas I shrink my wingtips they get significantly Thicker... to the point I have a WALL for the air to climb over.
