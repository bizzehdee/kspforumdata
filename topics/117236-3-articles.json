Beside reducing part count and letting people make much more aesthetically pleasing aircraft, this mod has been as important for me as FAR for modeling supermaneuverability; there are aircraft designs which are not only tedious but physically impossible to create using stock parts. When it comes to the balance between maneuverability and aerodynamic stability, tiny variations in wing and control surface size are the difference between safely buzzing the VAB at mach 2 and stalling out during takeoff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, a quick question which actually hasn\u0027t been answered here: is the \u0022mass\u0022 parameter in the .cfg files for these crafts the unit mass for these parts? By that I mean; if I double this parameter in the config file, will the mass of a pWing of a given size be doubled, or is the parameter just a placeholder? I\u0027ve read the .CFG documentation wiki page\u00A0and have some experience modding Civilization, but I don\u0027t have any actual coding experience, so I don\u0027t\u00A0know where to look to find out how you define the final mass of a pWing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- an aerodynamics enthusiast\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T04:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaceholder.
