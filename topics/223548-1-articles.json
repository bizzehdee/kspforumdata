It ought to be about 2300 delta-v to land; I am going through 5k\u002B and still crashing. It\u0027s clear to me that Dart engines were a poor choice, and I\u0027m pretty certain I\u0027ll be sending a second mission with a different lander (or 3x as many Darts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have suggestions or tips for what\u0027s required to land, or for how to make the landing happen? I think my main issue is that I don\u0027t have a good trajectory for burning, and I\u0027m not sure what my target orbit from which to burn ought to be. Also would love to hear lander design thoughts; I guess I should look into making it 7k delta-v ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the monument mission, does the lander have to be

on Tylo in KSP2, but I did a number of Tylo landings in KSP1.\u00A0 Since the Kerbolar system remains largely unchanged, the information I have to impart should still be relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, there are several quite different strategies for landing on a body which has no atmosphere.\u00A0 One of the common ones I have seen is what I will call \u0027stop and drop\u0027.\u00A0 Starting from a basically circular orbit around the target body one simply points retrograde and burns until the lander is basically motionless with regard to the surface (orbital velocity zero).\u00A0 With the lander now falling straight down, the engine is pointed at the ground and the craft is slowed as needed to result in a gentle landing.\u00A0 The lower the gravity of the target body, the easier this is.\u00A0 However, it is not efficient.\u00A0 The orbital velocity is completely removed while the lander is still far above the surface and all further burning is simply to remove the velocity accumulated while falling.\u00A0 Pretty much all of this is wasted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo land efficiently, the periapsis is lowered as close to the surface as possible and the retrograde burn to remove orbital velocity happens near the periapsis.\u00A0 Ultimately, you want to finish the burn and bring your lander to zero orbital velocity just as you finish falling and touch down.\u00A0 In practice this is quite easy on low gravity bodies.\u00A0 Of course, on low gravity bodies the inefficiency of \u0027stop and drop\u0027 is much lower and so less fuel is saved.\u00A0 On higher gravity bodies, this is not only difficult to achieve, but is a rather hair-raising experience.\u00A0 On Tylo it is downright terrifying.\u00A0 But the amount of fuel saved versus \u0027stop and drop\u0027 is dramatic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of things necessary to make this work is a sufficiently high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 It is necessary to remove all orbital velocity in as short a time as possible so that the periapsis can start as low as possible and gravity has as little time as possible to accelerate your lander into the ground.\u00A0 The less vertical component to your landing burn, the less fuel is wasted.\u00A0 I don\u0027t remember the exact figures I have used, but it seems to me that you want a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E comfortably over 2 as you complete the removal of orbital velocity and prevent Tylo\u0027s gravity from smashing your lander into the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith an efficient landing trajectory and sufficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, it should be possible to design a lander with something like 5300 to 5500 m/s \u003Cabbr

of the lander and probably quite a bit of trial and error to get the periapsis and the landing zone just right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been said in KSP1 that there are three big boss

Its difficult to get right and the consequence of slight miscalculation means crashing into the planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe longer you spend \u0022falling\u0022 the more delta V you burn, thats gravity. So if you slow down the whole way, you spend more time falling, gravity has more time to pull on you, you spend more delta V getting to the surface.\u00A0 Similarly, if you can stop quickly, then you can wait until the last second to start your burn. If it takes you 5 mintues to stop, its gonna be a problem no matter what. So a higher Thrust to weight ratio will help you out immensely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats only for vertical velocity. You also have to think about horizontal velocity. On low gravity planets its easy enough to just stop your horizontal velocity all together because its not that high, and then all you have to do is manage your vertical velocity. But on a big planet like tylo this is much more difficult because your horizontal velocity is quite high and it takes a while to stop. So you need to do a bit of a combination\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to kill as much horizontal velocity as possible on your initial burn so that you are going to cross over the path of your target and then crash into the plant. then as you approach your target you can kill the rest of your horizontal velocity so that you will fall directly onto your target. meanwhile you want to fall fast enough that you dont eat up all your delta V on a slow decent, but slow enough that you can still stop in time to not crash into the planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know thats not super helpful but hopefully you will figure it out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-08T21:05:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2024 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 8\u0022\u003EFebruary 8\u003C/time\u003E by twich22\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded details\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kirian","CreatedById":232581,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-19T23:05:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the tips \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/131400-starhawk/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022131400\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/131400-starhawk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Starhawk\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/110030-twich22/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022110030\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/110030-twich22/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@twich22\u003C/a\u003E!
