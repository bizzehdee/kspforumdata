The are 4 Russian liquid fuel engines - RD-170, RD-180, NK-33 and RD-0120.\n\n**RD-170**\n\nMost powerful engine in the real world. It used on the first stage of \u0027Energia\u0027. It has gimbaling around the 2 axes - pitch and yaw.\n\n\u003E ![3f680262bfd3ee77d78ff7a8cd731a42.jpeg](http://i37.fastpic.ru/thumb/2012/0430/42/3f680262bfd3ee77d78ff7a8cd731a42.jpeg)![d176a94d43f853ed6a643605765f976c.jpeg](http://i37.fastpic.ru/thumb/2012/0430/6c/d176a94d43f853ed6a643605765f976c.jpeg)![03332cd83563d9ab39fed825980e52a2.jpeg](http://i33.fastpic.ru/big/2012/0502/a2/03332cd83563d9ab39fed825980e52a2.jpeg)\n\n**RD-180**\n\nCutted version of RD-170. Less power, and in 11% less efficiency. It has 2 nozzles instead 4 on RD-170. RD-180 is one of the most safe engines in the world.\n\n\u003E ![86313dbce3b57c274a6df56144355294.jpeg](http://i37.fastpic.ru/thumb/2012/0430/94/86313dbce3b57c274a6df56144355294.jpeg)![7cfb4e8413b1dd6a1e61f91530e72a51.jpeg](http://i37.fastpic.ru/thumb/2012/0430/51/7cfb4e8413b1dd6a1e61f91530e72a51.jpeg)![c92fb5c8b1aa11527b63add4180f68a2.jpeg](http://i33.fastpic.ru/big/2012/0502/a2/c92fb5c8b1aa11527b63add4180f68a2.jpeg)\n\n**RD-0120**\n\nSafe, powerful and efficient. RD-0120 used on the second stage of \u0027Energia\u0027.\n\n\u003E ![9e5c44e637a2460d2cd991b89b6b0afe.jpeg](http://i36.fastpic.ru/thumb/2012/0430/fe/9e5c44e637a2460d2cd991b89b6b0afe.jpeg)\n\n**NK-33**\n\nThis engine used in Sovet lunar program. 30(!) NK-33 used on the first stage on N1F. N1 project were closed, but this engine received a second birth, when americans bought it for using on Antares-2. It has not gimbaling, N1 controlled by dismatching thrust on opposite engines.\n\n\u003E ![77d467158e4d96c00d3ad03052e7d98c.jpeg](http://i34.fastpic.ru/thumb/2012/0430/8c/77d467158e4d96c00d3ad03052e7d98c.jpeg)![a5f567fda6acfa7c0ec1b852f99fbf05.jpeg](http://i34.fastpic.ru/big/2012/0502/05/a5f567fda6acfa7c0ec1b852f99fbf05.jpeg)\n\n**Planned features:**\n\nAdapters\n\nPlugin for nozzle rotating.\n\n**Download 1.1:**\n\n[http://www./?xu1r6g9i5srd51w](http://www./?xu1r6g9i5srd51w)\n\n[http://xenolith.ws/?page=mod\u0026id=75](http://xenolith.ws/?page=mod\u0026id=75)\n\nEDIT: Links to image host removed due to pornography.
