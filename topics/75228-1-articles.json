I have rebuilt the booster for the 2nd ship that has demonstrated the problem. I have no clue as to where the problem is originating from at this point.

Once in orbit, I ditched the final stage with an engine on it, and the station piece proceeded to start tumbling. I first turned off the torque in the Cupola, and the rate of acceleration in the tumble slowed for a bit, but did not stop. I then turned off SAS completely.

I removed all the parts from a specific mod off that station piece, and launched it. The launch went smoothly, it didn\u0027t pull to the south like the previous launches. Once in orbit, it maintained attitude with the only rotation being that of a normal orbit. I.e If I pointed the cupola at the sun, the cupola stayed pointed at the sun, regardless of the station\u0027s position in it\u0027s orbit. The problem seems to be with AIES, but, not with all of the parts as I have launched other rockets using that part pack without problems previously. So I suspect that I have more testing to be sure of it, or even if it\u0027s just in certain positions that those parts have issues with. (I noticed that the RCS thrusters and RTGs were mostly inside the side of the cupola. I also noticed that the antenna\u0027s base above the crew hatch had clipped inside the roof of the cupola.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at this point, I believe the question is tentatively answered.

There are only two ways how clipped parts can make things worse:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ when there is a lot of parts clipped into the same place, they make that point of the ship very heavy which might lead to increased strain on connections nearby when some force is affecting the ship (usually gravity, thrust, or torque).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ when such clipped part gets detached from the ship (usually because its connection to the ship fails) it suddenly starts checking for collisions with parts of its former ship and since it overlaps with them by large part of its volume it usually explodes violently and starts a chain reaction where more and more clipped parts get detached and also explode because of overlaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have one part that partially overlaps with another part or two, there\u0027s usually no problem at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T21:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany people think that part clipping negatively affects ship\u0027s physical characteristics but so far I have not found any evidence for it.\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have one part that partially overlaps with another part or two, there\u0027s usually no problem at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo piggyback on this...
