According to one of the devnotes, \u0022docking mode\u0022 is now simply an alternate set of key bindings. I haven\u0027t looked at the controls config, but you should be able to map keys to do one thing in normal mode, and a whole \u0027nother thing in docking mode, but you\u0027ll have to go to the trouble of setting the docking mode controls up."},{"CreatedByName":"MacroNova","CreatedById":126611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:57:43Z","Content":"Well, docking mode does give you the slightly different UI."},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralHavan","CreatedById":58406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:43:03Z","Content":"How do you change these then?

Pretty easy to use if you do both hands are the keyboard as the controls are in the same configuration so muscle memory helps and you can get more control with being able to do both controls at once. Hope this helps. I tried the old controls and tried to go forward but just ignited the engine and was like \u0022crap, crap ,crap\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:03:14Z","Content":"It was mentioned in the Dev Notes from 11 Feb:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Since version 0.18 and the addition of docking, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had this docking control mode which very few players ever got around to using. I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t remove that, but I did come up with a more elegant way to implement the control binding switching, so we could do away with all those duplicate input mappings on the settings screen. Now, there is only one input mapping for pitch, yaw, roll and linear translations, and the docking mode mapping is done using the secondary key bindings and a new state toggling system which is simpler and more flexible than the old way. So much more flexible, in fact, that you can now use docking mode as an alternate control scheme in any way you want. Rather use it to swap about yaw and roll inputs for controlling rockets and spaceplanes with a joystick? Now you can. Also, Axis bindings now also have secondary mappings of their own, so you can have a second axis bound to each action, either as a redundancy or with a different set of UI mode toggles.\n\nPersonally I never used docking mode, so I haven\u0027t noticed (to be honest, I\u0027m playing a new career mode and haven\u0027t yet unlocked RCS, so I\u0027ve not used them yet)."},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T02:30:51Z","Content":"Haven\u0027t had it happen in 1.0 yet, but I always found docking mode a pain in the past. I only ever got into it accidentally, and I have never figured out the keyboard control to return to staging mode. Also, the settings don\u0027t allow you to re/unmap the docking mode toggle key."}]}
