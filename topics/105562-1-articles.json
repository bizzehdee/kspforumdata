I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t remove that, but I did come up with a more elegant way to implement the control binding switching, so we could do away with all those duplicate input mappings on the settings screen. Now, there is only one input mapping for pitch, yaw, roll and linear translations, and the docking mode mapping is done using the secondary key bindings and a new state toggling system which is simpler and more flexible than the old way. So much more flexible, in fact, that you can now use docking mode as an alternate control scheme in any way you want. Rather use it to swap about yaw and roll inputs for controlling rockets and spaceplanes with a joystick? Now you can. Also, Axis bindings now also have secondary mappings of their own, so you can have a second axis bound to each action, either as a redundancy or with a different set of UI mode toggles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I never used docking mode, so I haven\u0027t noticed (to be honest, I\u0027m playing a new career mode and haven\u0027t yet unlocked RCS, so I\u0027ve not used them yet).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T02:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t had it happen in 1.0 yet, but I always found docking mode a pain in the past.
