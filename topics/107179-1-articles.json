I don\u0027t even think the KSPParticleEmitter properties are controllable by scripts at all, and I\u0027m not sure how KSPField communicates with parts. None of the scripts I tried to write didn\u0027t end up in all undefined errors.\n\nTrying to set up the particle in parts.cfg is a pain of the neck to work with, and seems to only operate in *world* space, which is something I don\u0027t want.\n\nIs there any simple way to make a *local* space particle emitter that can be controlled by engine throttle, or activated/deactivated status?"}]}
