They look at the width of the high pulse rather than the duty cycle. Any stream of pulses between about 40hz and 200hz will trigger them, and mains voltage is 50 or 60 hz depending on where you are, so its not surprising that theres some random noise about thats suited to triggering a servo randomly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T11:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow are you tuning your antennae?
