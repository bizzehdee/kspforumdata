The Tirek mission, which had carried Bill and Bob Kerman, along with a rover and a lander, to the surface of the big red planet Duna and back, had been set on a return trajectory back to Kerbin, which meant that the time would soon be ripe for new mission. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RKtlyqll.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RKtlyqll.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y7pPeKOl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y7pPeKOl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tirek leaving Duna (left) and Cloudbase Kerbin (right)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately as it transpires, the same thoughts must have crossed the minds of guys at KSC, and Establishment Inc soon were shortly contracted for a new mission.

A while back, after many shouting matches between the main engineers, it was decided that the single-engined fuel-tank-pushing cargo dragging design of the Tirek would not adequately suffice. Instead, a design with two nuclear engines set out on pods, both its fuel tank and most of its cargo was decided upon. This design also takes advantage of the availability of the Kylon-2, which had not been developed back when Tirek was put together, and uses an orange jumbo as its main fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Tug design requires a total of three launches and three dockings to complete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst, the Tug core is launched, containing the power core, monopropellant tanks, and the ports for the engines.

Somebody with a bit of Jeb in his veins decided that the best way to rectify this situation was to send instructions to the remote guidance unit in the Kylon, telling it to flip over and pull up as it came over the runway. To be fair, this could have worked had it been done a little later, but as it had to come almost straight down and pull up at the last minute. Too bad then that whilst the control authority that the Kylon-2 has is substantial it was not great enough, and the aircraft hit the ground at far too great speed to hold together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8z651bNl.png\u0022 alt=\u00228z651bNl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELacking a control unit, the remainder of the craft rolled across the length of the runway, a strange combination of perfect balance and wing surfaces keeping it going, with only the wheels touching the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ac3AsZUl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ac3AsZUl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In the end I realized that it would keep going until it reached the hills, so I switched physics warp on and off, causing it to bounce and the front hitting the ground, stopping it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/APOAcvFl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022APOAcvFl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EIn the next part: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ECargo!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T20:32:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 08:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SofusRud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T18:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProject Green Dunes: Reusable Long Term Duna Base Part 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELots of Docking\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EBack again, this installment is all about the docking, assembling the cargo that will be going off to Duna come next alignment. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EDiscord\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up we have the tug Discord.

Therefore, it was decided that some sort of contingency was needed, and that contigency is the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDetritus Mk-2 Rover\u003C/span\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Detritus Mk-2 is a basically a crane rover, using a CLAW to grab onto objects and some bendy parts being pushed by landing legs to lift them.

It has chutes but they are placed on the central control section, and with the fuel tank on the top, the COM moves above the parachutes in all cases save for the heaviest of cargoes. This could be remedied by sending out a new fuel tank with chutes on it, but the next transfer window is a long way off, and Establishment Inc\u0027s heavy cargo SSTO fleet is grounded until they can redesigned with new parts following bankruptcy of old plane parts provider. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually the mission controllers decide that the skycrane should probably still be capable of landing most of the components on engines alone, and that the decreased fuel efficiency is worth it. So first up are a pair of segments with assembly rovers, and as we\u0027ll see in a little while, this mission still has more woes to come. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing part is pretty straightforward. Skycrane detaches, scoots over, cargo detaches, and the two dock.

To save fuel I do my deorbit burn almost on the opposite side of the planet. I deobit at dawn, when the target landing area is at about late afternoon/early evening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VI8xxVNl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VI8xxVNl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gisEUpul.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gisEUpul.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing zone had to be in a dark patch, as in as close to \u0022sea-level\u0022 as possible in order to maximize amount of atmosphere that I\u0027d go through and slow myself down in. Most options would put me in a big level plane type area, which would be easy to land in, but I decided that the scenery would be too boring. Had I gone into a more inclined orbit I\u0027d have greater freedom to choose landing zone, but that\u0027s just another mistake we can add to the list. In the end I picked a canyon. It would require me to refine my precision landing technique, but I\u0027d have plenty of time to fine-tune that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing zone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cVkB67Ql.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cVkB67Ql.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the landing, the Skycrane, also named the Kevin Mk-1, takes off again redocks with the station and refuels before repeating the landing with the second segement and rover combo. I realized that it is incredibly important to remember the solar panels on the Skycrane. They need to be reopened the moment landing is complete, and closed before takeoff. The Kevin Mk-1 lacks any other form of power generation you see, but that can be another thing we stick onto a replacement fuel tank if we ever get round to shipping one in future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Np7eWfyl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Np7eWfyl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l7YKoXBl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l7YKoXBl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q6ioe2Ul.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q6ioe2Ul.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERover Troubles\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the bigger issues. The more observant among you might have noticed one of the big issues already. Thing is, if you look closely at the rover/segment assembly, the rovers are actually rotated 90 degrees from where they are supposed to be. As it stands, deploying the segment landing legs traps the rover between them, making it impossible for it to move out. The rover is basically stuck there until it can dock its segment to another, which would allow the segments to fold up one set of legs so the rover can escape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately this is where I derped up the most. Between the first and second landing, I tried a combination of fiddling with the landing legs and the rover, using frequent quickloads I might add, and finally managed to get the rover out. However, I then went and did the second landing before redocking the rover the rover the correct way round, which meant a great deal of time warp. Thing is, those segments don\u0027t have their own power generation, as I hadn\u0027t anticipated this problem and wanted to save on parts, so by the time I returned to it, the batteries were dead and the segment couldn\u0027t fold up its legs in order to dock to the rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might have been fine, first solution that presented itself was to try to dock the other rover/segenmet combo onto the segment and use the other rovers\u0027 RTGs to refill the batteries. This is where the second problem presented itself. I don\u0027t know if its a bug or if Duna just has a tendency to make rover behave oddly, but I\u0027ll assume the former because I\u0027ve never had this problem before, and not with these rovers which have an otherwise great track record. Basically the rover now handle like crap. I try to accelerate forwards and they start to slide backwards, regardless of the inclination of the terrain. At best the \u0022go forward\u0022 rover command will decelerate the rover and only some of the time. Also the rover controls have gotten really unresponsive in general. I\u0027ve tried switching where I control from, fiddling with the wheels, and nothing has worked. I can move around but the precision that surface docking requires is simply gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows whats going on with this please let me know. A solution to this problem would be much appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, with that option gone I decide to turn to plan B: landing the crane and using it to restore power to the segment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane is a unique craft on this endeavor. It\u0027s the only craft designed to land on parachutes and not skycrane, and it is designed to do some otherwise difficult tasks, like righting a flipped module and suchlike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took several attempts to get the landing right. It has the issue that unless properly adjusted, the force of the chutes opeing would rip the arm off, rendering the whole thing useless. also chutes were less than ideally placed, necessitating use of torque to keep it facing the right way up for landing. It was a tough nut to crack, I had to do a lot of fine adjustments to each individual chute so that they didn\u0027t open at the same time and I had to cut some before landing in order to keep it upright. I hope nobody holds that against me, but to be fair, it was basically impossible to get right the first time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to deorbit I had to do the maneuver with the tug and everything attached, detach the crane, flip the tug and regain a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MtnNpDCl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MtnNpDCl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cBgWkLfl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cBgWkLfl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sVzRycDl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sVzRycDl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zJbAVVcl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zJbAVVcl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, despite my very best efforts, I ended up blowing a tire on the final landing.
