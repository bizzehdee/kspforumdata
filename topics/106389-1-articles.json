I have never been big on spaceplanes, but with my disastrous problems with rockets the last few days i decided i should see about making one if i ever hope to start getting components for a station in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewas going to try to build a shuttle, and ran into trouble right off the bat with the very first part. my Mk3 cockpit does not want to work, i cannot find a mod that is creating any sort of problem related to this, and even looked over the parts .cfg to see nothing stand out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif i choose the cockpit to begin building, then the vab/sph kinda \u0027lock up\u0027 game is not frozen, but i cannot click anything other than \u0022load craft\u0022 button, also mousebuttons do not allow for camera movement: as if i still have not placed a root part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot change the parts list away from command tab, and am unable to select any parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i pick another root part to begin building, then try to select the Mk3 cockpit, when i try to place the part; then it is a sort of \u0027click through\u0027 moment. the node i was trying to attach the Mk3 with dissapears and i am still holding the Mk3. if i then click again to \u0027drop\u0027 the part, it attaches to the root in a clipped way and is see-through like it is not attached, and picking up the root part drags the opaque Mk3 with it. the opaque Mk3 is also un-clickable to be removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis only happens with the Mk3, i went through clicking all other pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyone have this problem, or any idea where it might be coming from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is a couple screenshots with it placed/clipped, and unplaced with the node dissapeared\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/NA4yk#1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/NA4yk#1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: when i first came looking to see if this was happening to anyone else, i came across the \u0027buttons missing\u0027 thing that is somehow connected to the Community Resource mod. removed it and associated mods, to no avail. its something else\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd edit: nailed it! will mark as solved instead delete just in case this shows up elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E the problem was the interim-version of tweakscale, just installed todays version and the problem is gone!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T21:58:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BobsYerUncle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
