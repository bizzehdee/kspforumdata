My question is somewhat straightforward: In general, how long does it take (on average of course) for a mod to be updated to work with 1.1 (or any other major release that breaks mods and requires them to all be updated for compatibility)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this is going to differ greatly from mod to mod, from modmaker to modmaker, and obviously it will differ from very simple mods to very complex, big ones. Which major update we\u0027re talking about probably makes a difference too. I understand all that, and realize that I\u0027m grossly oversimplifying things and generalizing them. I ask only out of curiosity, not impatience; I am still pretty new to KSP and have no experience with a major update until now. I discovered this amazing game shortly after 1.0.5 was released, so it definitely hasn\u0027t been that long for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodbunny","CreatedById":67274,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T20:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo weeks has been my experience, in general.
