Hats off for the exhaustive work you\u0027ve put into the mod so far, it\u0027s really impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if it would be possible to borrow the intercept logic from the missiles and expose it as an option in the red subsystem? To elaborate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a lot of fun trying to improvise a hit to kill anti missile system from the flight control subsystem but with either very limited success or very limited automation, relying mostly on settling in behind the target and catching up to it without overshooting which is a time (fuel) consuming intercept path with very high required specs wrt the target or alternatively loitering somewhere in the target\u0027s trajectory heading toward it as best as I can then using a very powerful RCS \u0022kill relative velocity\u0022 maneuver at the last moment and crossing my fingers which requires a lot of hand holding and doesn\u0027t often work, although there is some real world precedent for the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping that an intercept heading rather than a combination of \u0022face\u0022 \u0022parallel\u0022 and \u0022relative velocity\u0022 headings will open a fe new doors for that kind of project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see that with an unknown vessel rather than the pre-baked stats of the missiles, that maybe this isn\u0027t possible, depending on how you\u0027ve implemented it. The vanilla game has a current heading and a target heading already, so an autopilot keeping those aligned rather than the craft\u0027s own axis might be another option. Though, again, not knowing how a given craft will react might make it impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dream of a future with small VAB designed vessels being launched as missiles with no user control at other uncontrolled ships, incoming missiles and asteroids \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E For now though, thanks again for all the fine works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funny_dude60","CreatedById":68879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T19:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei need help! where do i put the texture folder/mac, i cant close the windows ore press eny of the butons/ pls help !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brians200","CreatedById":26572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T19:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022funny_dude60\u0022 data-cite=\u0022funny_dude60\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei need help! where do i put the texture folder/mac, i cant close the windows ore press eny of the butons/ pls help !\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything should be under \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E |---Romfarer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ----|---Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ----|---PluginData\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ----|---sound\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ----|---textures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ----|---Romfarer.dll\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ----|---RomfarerHSTWlaser.dll (if you are using the sunbeam)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funny_dude60","CreatedById":68879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T19:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebut they arnt !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funny_dude60","CreatedById":68879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T19:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei got this flag\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E probs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E resourses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E sounds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E spaces\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funny_dude60","CreatedById":68879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T19:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-mod edit: upload the pictures to a website such as www.imgur.com, noone can use links to your computer-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethats a pic of my ksp_folder\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiceX","CreatedById":65938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T16:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Romfarer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Romfarer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks like you are missing the textures, make sure you only have one Romfarer.dll in your GameData.
