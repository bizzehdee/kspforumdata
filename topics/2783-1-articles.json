It was originally built way back in version 0.8.2(!!!!) - it had to be totally rebuilt once symmetry became available (or perhaps because I finally figured out how come there was a wagon wheel at the top left of the VAB!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier models used structural SRBs - I know, it\\\u0027s not very Kerbal; but I always liked liquid-fueled stages rather than solids, so the SRBs were simply there to allow parallel staging. The extra mass of the boosters necessitated the core stage burning from the start. In later models, I have used Sunday Punch\\\u0027s SL-55 Aerodynamic Decoupler, so there is no need for solid boosters at all!

RCS is a game changer. The Dragon R has lots of RCS engines, making the core stage maneuverable and the Command/Service Module extremely so. Earlier versions had two LFTs in the Command/Service Module, but since the introduction of RCS this is simply overkill; one tank is plenty for all but the most extreme maneuvering!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final stage of the Dragon R is a re-entry module capable of [almost] powered descent (RCS can be ejected and parachute deployed if you don\\\u0027t feel brave enough for the attempt!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Evolved Dragon R has been tested extensively in LKO. It can be injected into a 100km circular orbit with plenty of fuel to spare, and although I have yet to do so I am confident it may be placed into an escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPics and craft file:\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
