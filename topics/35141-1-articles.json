I use the RemoteTech mod so it\u0027s pretty important to set up a proper communications relay around each planetary body I plan to explore. So I created this ship to easily establish my communication relays. These pics are from setting up a geostationary relay over Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/M7OdM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

That\u0027s why I took the time to build a one launch craft. Love the mod but hate the time involved in setting up a proper network. Really adds to the realism of having to setup your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit that I got a lot of help from watching various youtube vids. I also remembered reading a thread (sorry tried to find the thread but couldn\u0027t find it) where someone said it was easy to do by setting up your launch craft\u0027s orbit at 100k. From there, release the first satellite and burn to a 2,868km apoapsis and circularize at that altitude. Switch back to your launch craft and release the next satellite at a point either 90 degrees before or 90 degrees after the point where you launched the first satellite. Burn and circularize. Repeat until all sats launched and you should have a pretty sweet relay system. I hope that helps... I\u0027m a horrible teacher so explaining things is not my forte!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T00:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.catalystservers.com/hoy/ksp/Firebat%200.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Firebat%200.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not for remote tech, the 8 satellites are all the same. ISA and Kethane scanners. It\u0027s single stage from the launch pad all the way to Laythe, from there it refuels in orbit and takes the satellites to each of the moons one at a time refueling on each return. Satellites have almost 800m/s of RCS each so I only have to get them in an orbit around 45 degrees with the ship and they can correct the inclination and make any altitude changes they need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe picture is from the original version, and uses stacked intakes. I updated it with modded intakes to drop the part count but keep the same mass and drag, as these things are quite part heavy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
