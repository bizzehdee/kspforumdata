The more massive object will not reach terminal velocity before the less massive object and so will continue to accelerate towards the Earth \u0027s centre of gravity until it too reaches terminal velocity; therefore, the more massive object will hit the ground first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis I could accept; it made sense. A vacuum used to be more confusing but it\u0027s actually easy to understand if you think about it. Let\u0027s take those two different masses from the atmosphere and stick them a hundred metres above the Moon. Both will fall at exactly the same rate due to the negligible atmosphere at the Lunar surface and the equal gravitational pull on each object. The way I visualise this is a bit unusual but helpful. Consider the effect of gravity on all of the individual atoms of each mass; each atom is identical and merely clustered together with others of their kind, all of them being equally affected by the gravitational field, so a larger cluster of these atoms won\u0027t fall at a greater rate than a smaller cluster. This is a bit of an odd explanation and I\u0027m sure someone else has something better, but it\u0027s the way I can understand it; even two masses composed of different elements (say... lithium and osmium) would fall at the same rate despite their differing densities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can test the vacuum portion in KSP (aerodynamic model of the game is questionable); probably the best contrast would be a small fuel tank compared to a jumbo tank (I\u0027ll leave the logistics to you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E) descending to the surface of Mun.
