That said, for a while with v3 (not 3.1 of LOD) and having converted those textures to TGA, everything was working fine. Then with the 3.1 update and the changes to TGA loading, it went back to being black. Basically my only recommendation is try rolling back to v3 and converting the offending textures to TGA and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the issues with RF versus MFT, the way the configs are written, the original parts default to the ones which include MFT and then only switch to the ones with RF if RF is present instead of MFT.
