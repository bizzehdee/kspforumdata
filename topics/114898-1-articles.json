I was docking, I docked but when jeb and mitfred were having lunch together in the cafeteria the space station started bending back and forth and the ap rose by 5km (the thing was at its pe). Almost tore itself. Sas was off and I was not touching any keys. Jeb, mitfred and kimdrien had to run off in my Minmus rocket back to kerbin asap. What the hack is this?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T00:38:45Z","Content":"Probably phantom forces from part colliders interacting."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T00:52:22Z","Content":"Krakensbane was a solution to a specific thing that caused the original Deep Space Kraken.

This happened 5-6 times. Thank goodness for quick saves.\n\nOf course my next mun mission was even worse - SAS didnt work at all, without touching the controls the ship would go full pitch up and go into spins, things exploded at 50k feet in reentry when they were only 300 degrees....\n\nTL;DR The kraken is alive and well."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T02:53:29Z","Content":"The Kraken is always and ever will be.\n\nPraise the Kraken.

Those have some nasty colliders that only act up sometimes... you can keep the effects in check by deploying/stowing them if the craft loaded sane in the first place, but I recommend a redesign so those parts are as far from clipping anything as possible.\n\nRune. The power of Kraken propels you!"}]}
