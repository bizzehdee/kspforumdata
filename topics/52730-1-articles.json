Okay, well maybe not through the bugged releases that required a quick .01 patch, but the new additions and adjustments have always been exciting to me, even if they weren\u0027t immediately (reliably) playable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking back through the years (wow, hard to believe I can actually use that word with a GAME), I realize I have kind of grown to enjoy the game from different angles over time. Initially it was the coolness of the aspect of building rockets Lego-style and seeing what they did (and how spectacularly they could go oh so very wrong), but progressed into an exploration phase, where I ventured forth to investigate some of these new planets and moons that had been added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince those days, I have only been to a few of the possible destinations, but my play style has evolved into one more based on imagination, and one that makes more of an event out of reaching a given destination, almost savoring the achievement by taking the trip into exasperating detail. Sure, I could probably drop a micro probe to every planet and moon and that\u0027s that. But, something in me wanted to make these explorations every bit as grand and broad in the game as they would be in real life, so going to Duna became this intricate, multi-part mega mission, filled with planning and designing for a deployable base, rovers, interactive means to deliver them to the ground (beyond just popping chutes and calling it a day), and building the means to get it all there. So far, I\u0027ve been getting a lot of enjoyment out of going just getting to a place that others have been to many times. As the saying goes: \u0022It\u0027s not the destination that matters; it\u0027s the journey.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question to everyone is: what flips your switch for you in this game? Is it the rampant \u0022build it and see what it does\u0022 construction? Is it the challenge of getting to new places just to say you can do it? Is it some kind of running internal stream of consciousness thing where you\u0027re imagining what it might be like to be doing that very thing in real life as you do it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is it something else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T18:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat always gives me a chuckle is building a massive orange asparagus monstrosity with a MkI spam can on top, and watching it fall apart in multiple balls of fire as soon as I put it on the launch pad.
