This can be easily tested by changing the types and number of enabled charge storages on the vessel, e.g. if you wait until the one Z-100 is full and then turn on another one it will charge at approx. half the speed (0.75*100/210 should go to charging it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Actually, it is considerably more complex than this.
