Early probes were planned around planet/moon radio-shadows. They were able to do their jobs, usually by executing via simple pre-programmed steps (in the era before computers!) and by storing all telemetry data for later play back when the satellite/probe was within LoS of Earth again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in a modern space age, I would expect at least a few relay satellites just for safety sake and allowing the crew to keep in touch with their comrades.
