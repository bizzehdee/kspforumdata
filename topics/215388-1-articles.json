I still managed to get into orbit somehow. Then on 1000 KM orbit gflogen all satellites gedropt and then the mission was over because the game is completely durchgedreht.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you can not build a network of satellites when the whole game turns hollow at once. The satellites were then in some orbit just not where they should be, some wanted to leave the solar system and the remote-controlled rocket was no longer controllable and has then simply disassembled itself so 200 KM before re-entry ... without my doing... yes great mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E spins, physics spins, everything bugs around.
