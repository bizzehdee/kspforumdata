My game time brutally morphed into crushing numbers into Excel, to undertand how much delta V I need to go in Orbit around other planets, and go back ; then calculate it (circumventing the usual design problems, but without the KSP Jazzy tune, nor the nice graphics and it was quite a bother, because I actually wanted to fling spaceships to Duna and stuff...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning about delta V, I also learnt that it was useless, unless I learnt about transfer windows, which I had to calculate, and calculus isn\u0027t my strong suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not complaining because I had to learn stuff.

Time and effort are worth just as much as money, hence why employees are paid. If I fail my heavily thought out mission because I unwittingly messed up a calculation, I\u0027ve wasted my already limited time and effort. Now, if I have a built in Calculator that does this for me, the chances of my mission failing do to inefficient design drops to near zero: if the mission fails, it\u0027s on me. Knowing that in itself can save countless time wasted on fixing a design that isn\u0027t broken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Look at Scott Manley for example: he does all of these amazing things, yet he still crunches numbers/ gets assistance. In fact most of the stuff he does REQUIRES intense calculating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto 1.: No they wouldn\u0027t ask all. But if they want a\u003Cstrong\u003E representative \u003C/strong\u003Epoll, the would choose ppl to vote that based on the statistic distribution of the Population and ask them dircetly. They would Count the \u0022Not voters\u0022 and based on that number they can estimate if their vote is representative.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Under a certain percentage of Returns they wouldn\u0027t claim it is represenative\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. AND they would not start a biased poll. The poll question of this thread is biased (in my opinion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS poll on this Forum will lack those points, since only ppl who actually visit this forum are asked. Second the poll question attracts voters subconsciously and consciously WANT a dV readout. The question isn\u0027t neutral on the subject. Any scientifically poll would not only ask a black/White question. they would include something like \u0022other opinion\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis poll and poll question is like asking children in a candy store if they would like to have some candy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst: dV is needed for real live rocket engeniering. BUT not for a game. Real live rocket engeniering doen\u0027t have a quicksave / quickload function. Real live rocket doesn\u0027t have time warp Forward. Real live rocket doesn\u0027t have unlimited resources. Real live rocket doesn\u0027t have kerbals that would jump in any absurd craft you design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND MAINLY : If it were really needed in KSP than only those ppl that do the calculations themself or use a mod that acomplish this would ever gotten to the other planets. That is obvoiusly wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: The game doesn\u0027t force you to plan missions like you do. YOU decided that, not the game. YOU has choosen to spend the amount of time and effort that was put into it. YOU have the Option to add lots of safety fuel and you decided to not do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOU have decided that putting all that limited time and effort would be worth a successful Mission. And if YOU mess up it is suddenly not anymore?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird: As you stated \u0022because I unwittingly messed up a calculation\u0022. YOU did mess up. If you really heavily thought like you claimed, you would have double or triple checked you calcuations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth: Yes Scott Manley does interresting things. He decided that doing that would be fun for HIM and worth all the time and effort. If he uses help/assistance from other ppl or Tools then HE has decided that doing it by himself would be not worth the time and effort. But how something any other Player do something he doesn\u0027t decide. He just Shows what he did. And even that he Shows something he chooses for himself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T21:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one is asking if KSP \u003Cem\u003Eneeds\u003C/em\u003E a dV calculator, the question is \u0022Should KSP have a dV Calculator\u0022.
