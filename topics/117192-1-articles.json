Despite the advantages when it comes to rocket reusability (allowing for better throttling with only part of the engines used for landing). It may also be cheaper, and easier (engineering-wise, one of the reasons the S-IV on Saturn IB became S-IVB), overall, to use a single large engine, rather than many small ones.\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, despite the fact that F-1 has lower ISP than Merlin, a modernized version could probably be made that would provide the extra ~20s of ISP needed to roughly match the Merlin\u0027s ISP.
