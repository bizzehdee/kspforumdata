I had two rovers in the area. I focused and took over one of the rovers. It was night so I wanted to get into daylight to get the photocells working. I did the warp thing. When the sun came up I stopped the time warp and both of my rovers promptly exploded.\u00A0I did not have a save - quick or otherwise. This was the first action I took after starting the game.
