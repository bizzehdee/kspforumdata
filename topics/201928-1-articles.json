I downloaded a new version, installed mods, and started a new career. And immediately noticed that Jeb can keep the ship in flight as an experienced pilot. I delete the mods that were suspected, go into the game, try it. Jeb can still hold radials, maneuver direction, and so on with 1 star. I remove all the mods in general, I clean the tails from them, I go in - everything is the same. I create a new game, a career, immediately go to the hangar, appear on the launch pad... And Jeb with no experience stars can enjoy all the hold functions.\u00A0How do I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T23:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s a bug in the latest game.
