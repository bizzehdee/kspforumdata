to present the most science-gathering opportunities for the technology you have.\u00A0 So every vehicle should have every instrument you already own, and the ability to use them as often as possible during the mission.\u00A0 Most experiments are worth more returned than transmitted so always try to get back safely on the ground somewhere to recover the ship and data (don\u0027t worry about how close you land to KSC, just don\u0027t land in mountains).\u00A0 But some experiments (crew reports) need to be transmitted before you can do them again,\u00A0so be sure all ships have an antenna and enough batteries (plus solar panels later on) to transmit several times during the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the tech tree, don\u0027t worry about airplanes to start with.\u00A0 Focus instead on unlocking\u00A0bigger rockets,\u00A0more science instruments, the OKTO probe core, and the OX-STAT fixed solar panel.\u00A0 More instruments means more data per mission, and rocket parts will take those instruments further afield where the experiments are worth more science parts than closer to home.\u00A0 The OX-STAT solar panel is pretty much required for a round-trip to Mun (you can run out of power without it) and also lets you transmit more times during the mission.\u00A0 And the OKTO probe core is the 1st one that has SAS.\u00A0 This allows doing 1-seat capsules with a

the OX-STAT first, then the OKTO.\u00A0 You only need bigger rockets when your existing instruments have exhausted all the science points they can gather for the \u0022situations\u0022 (see below) that your current rocket parts can reach economically.\u00A0 So basically, get some instruments to get science to unlock rockets to take the instruments to new places, to unlock more science to unlock more instruments, repeat.\u00A0 Airplanes and rovers are hardly worth getting at all, at least not beyond the very baseline starter parts, until you get near the end and just need to spend excess

the capsule or transmit it (and re-arm Goo and Materials), so you can use them again in the next \u0022situation\u0022.\u00A0 Within each \u0022situation\u0022, a given experiment can only gather a limited number of science points, after which you have to take it to another \u0022situation\u0022 before it will give you any more points.\u00A0 Most experiments get the full amount of points with 1 use in a \u0022situation\u0022, but some take 2 uses to get the full amount, although the 1st use gets like 90% of the total so often it\u0027s not worth bothering with the

In Flight over Kerbin\u0027s Shores (immediately after liftoff), In Flight Over Kerbin\u0027s Water (shortly later in the flight),\u00A0Upper Atmosphere, Low Orbit, Upper Atmosphere again, In Flight

That should enable you to build a basic orbit-capable rocket, which will bring in more cash and science. By that stage, you should have a roll on; just keep doing contracts, preferably more than one per mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour first financial target is to upgrade the Tracking Station, Mission Control and the Astronaut Complex so you can get your patched conics and EVA abilities. Once you have EVA, unlocking the early tech tree is a cinch; just launch into a polar orbit and get \u0022EVA over...\u0022 science from every biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you find yourself short of a little science, just load a probe core, parachute\u00A0and all of your science gear onto a finned\u00A0SRB. Fire it off in any direction from KSC and you\u0027ll hit a biome to grab science from. The only expense is the SRB fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s a part you need that you haven\u0027t unlocked yet, see if there\u0027s a part testing contract for that part. This is actually the main purpose of the part test contracts; emergency access to higher tech parts. You keep access to it until you fulfil the contract, so if you want to keep playing with that hot new experimental part all you have to do is not run the test. Watch out, though; some tests require you to activate the part, some only require that the part be taken to a certain speed/location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t pay to recruit crew; do \u0022rescue from orbit\u0022 contracts instead. Similarly, wait for space station contracts to appear before throwing up your orbital fuel stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlocking most\u00A0of the rest of the tech tree can be done with a few Mun/Minmus missions. The trick there is to carry a scientist (to reset goo pods etc) and hit as many biomes as possible in a single trip. It\u0027s also a good idea to stack contracts; don\u0027t just go to the Mun, get science from orbit/flag planting/satellite delivery/part testing contracts to do on the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last few tech nodes are usually covered by my first interplanetary missions. Send\u00A0probes to the difficult ones, crewed ships to the easy ones, hit the transfer windows whenever they appear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve only been playing sandbox, you\u0027re probably accustomed to monstrously overengineered ships. Less is more; a basic orbital ship should be less than \u221A10,000, a basic Munlander return around \u221A30,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T07:25:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T10:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);margin-top:0px;\u0022\u003E\nOne slight difference of opinion with Geschosskopf\u0027s excellent advice: the early aircraft nodes are very useful for low-altitude survey and part testing contracts.
