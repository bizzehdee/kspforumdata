Previously my free time was occupied by WoW, but that\u0027s just not fun anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve got a pretty decent grasp on the basics and have started using some mods to enhance immersion into the game. Kethane, KAS, Kerbal Alarm Clock, ScanSat, one of the life support ones and another that modifies science a bit. I do have a few others I\u0027m trying out on a sandbox game though... can\u0027t quite get the hang of Infernal Robotics. I do use mechjeb as an informational mod and have yet to even see autopilot in career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things I\u0027ve been doing lately in game is running science missions on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus and getting a space station in orbit. I messed up a bit and put it at 90 km, but it shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue to attach an engine and boost the orbit to 200 or so. Earlier today I modified the tutorial build of Apollo 11. Just shaved some weight I think and asparagus\u0027d the higher stages from about 8km to 40km. It coasts to 75 from there and even after the circularization burn I still have half the final booster tank left that needs to be jettisoned for the docking procedure. I\u0027ll upload some quick pictures to imgur and share the album for those interested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to keep my imgur updated with fun stuff I\u0027m doing in game. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://dasshaker.imgur.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is the link to the album if you\u0027re interested. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThinkOutsideTheHangar","CreatedById":100722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T04:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP forums!
