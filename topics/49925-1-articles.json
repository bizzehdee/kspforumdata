That said, if all you\u0027re trying to do is get into Kerbin\u0027s orbit, I can tell from the Science Jr that you\u0027ve got the tech. Shoot for 4650 m/s of delta-V; 4550 for the ascent and a mere 100 to deorbit (yes, it doesn\u0027t take all that much to land). Here\u0027s what I\u0027d do: switch pack to the Mk1 Command Pod - it\u0027s less massive. Two radial chutes and an antenna on the pod, your sci junior underneath and lets go with three goo pods. That\u0027s your payload; 1.755 tonnes. Three fuel stacks - an LV-T45 in the center and two LV-T30s outboard (or all three LV-T30s if you don\u0027t have the -45 for some reason). Stick a decoupler under your payload and then add the center stack - three FL-T800 tanks to make things easy, or two FL-T800s, one FL-T400, one FL-T200 and one FL-T100; whatever tank combo you select, you want the same combo outboard.

Watch your gee meter as you go; if it climbs out of the green zone, throttle back to avoid telescoping your stack. Cut your thrust when the ap is where you want it, coast above 70k, then set your orbital insertion maneuver node. Burn when you\u0027re ready (generally I burn at one-third thrust for three times the amount of time indicated by the node; that helps with precision). When your periapsis is above 70k, you\u0027re in orbit. Cut your thrust, do your science, turn retro and burn. When the periapsis goes below 30,000, you\u0027ll come in for landing. Wait until you\u0027re flying, then cut loose the booster - that will help with cleanup. Chutes out when you\u0027re ready (I usually go at 5k or so).
