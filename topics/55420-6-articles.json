I follow the threads of the mods I use and will update when and as I need and want to. If there had been an easy way in game to disable the blank update button, I would have been ok with it. Or have it appear once on the initial menu screen then not appear when actually playing a save. I would end up loading KSP, seeing Toolbar needed to be updated, quit KSP, update Toolbar, then reload KSP just so I couldn\u0027t accidentally hit the blank update button and have my browser open when trying to play KSP. Updating was not required by any means by the plugin, but I felt like it would annoy me to the point where I had to update to remove the annoyance. I usually look forward to mod updates and have fun downloading and installing new versions. With Toolbar it\u0027s been an annoyance and a source of small frustration when loading up KSP to see Toolbar had an update available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a neat feature, and I\u0027m sure it\u0027s helped people keep their Toolbar plugin updated more or faster than they might normally update, but it\u0027s just not a feature for me. I greatly appreciate the newly added option via config to turn update button off.

I like having all my mod buttons all nice and tidy and neat and movable all at once. For someone without a lot of spare UI space, Toolbar is a nice addition.
