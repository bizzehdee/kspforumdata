Building my first rockets, i found it hard to get into orbit, since i didn\u0027t bother checking the reduced ISP\u0027s and was using old designs which worked. You just need to recalibrate to the new part stats, and then your internal intuitive deltaV calculator will work once again (or just download KER)."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:08:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E With the Great Part Rebalancing in 1.0, many ISP\u0027s have been nerfed.
