A rundown of nearly all the elements in KSP wouldn\u0027t go amiss here, so feel free to make walls of text as far as the eye can see! This is meant for everybody to answer, as well. If you see someone with the same answer as you, but the two answers are worded differently, feel free to go ahead. The more text, the better. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T02:30:21Z","Content":"\u0022Delta\u0022 means \u0022change\u0022 and \u0022V\u0022 is Velocity. \u0022Delta-V\u0022 literally means change in velocity. So on a maneuver node, it\u0027s showing you how much you need to change your velocity to achieve that turn. In Kerbal Engineer Redux, the dV readout is how much your rocket can change its velocity before it runs out of fuel.\n\nEve is hard because it\u0027s large and has a thick atmosphere. You need a LOT more dV (about 3x as much) to get off of Eve as you do Kerbin, and that doesn\u0027t just mean 3x the fuel. Usually it means about 10-20x the fuel. Plus more rockets and whatnot.\n\nKerbals are not stupid. They built an entire aerospace industry on a planet with no other signs of civilization.\n\nKSP is awesome because it is the only game that allows lego-style building of ships that can then fly to any of a vast number of destinations.\n\nTo dock, I suggest my tutorial ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s in 3 parts that include rendezvous and approach, but\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLcGBw4cgSQQQnwS_lKqYBz_4DJG-oRGJt\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n.\nJeb is not awesome. Awesome is in fact Jeb.\n\nWe make huge impressive ships by making small ships and adding to them.

It seems very easy. But when on a Tennis court, it\u0027s much harder than it seems. KSP\u0027s leaning curve ist VERY steep.\n\nMy suggestion : start playing science game mode (or sandbox). Carreer adds complexity. Read Wiki, as it\u0027s been said. Watch few basic videos and try to redo them. \n\nSome mods are nice for beginners as it\u0027s been said. Don\u0027t hesitate to use MJ autopilot to see how it\u0027s doing it. Then try to do it yourself.\n\nSome advice : TEST your stages launchers before real launch. Test landers on ground (check ladders, batteries, solar panels...). \n\nAnd remember \u0022F5\u0022 (but use it wisely)."}]}
