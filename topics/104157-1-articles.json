So on a maneuver node, it\u0027s showing you how much you need to change your velocity to achieve that turn. In Kerbal Engineer Redux, the dV readout is how much your rocket can change its velocity before it runs out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is hard because it\u0027s large and has a thick atmosphere. You need a LOT more dV (about 3x as much) to get off of Eve as you do Kerbin, and that doesn\u0027t just mean 3x the fuel. Usually it means about 10-20x the fuel.
