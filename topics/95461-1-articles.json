Anyways I also got back into playing with lots of different mods and it has been so frustrating. I remember back then my computer was powerful enough to handle all the big mods like B9 and KWrocketry, Oh how I miss those times...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter about 4 days experimenting with different mods and finally getting ksp to run, this is the aftermath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X3OkaGt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X3OkaGt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T02:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell...

I have been running some testes on my end, and even with a few mods I max out the memory, the biggest detail mod I had was EVE and astronomers visual pack. I have my scatter turned down to 80% have not had near as many crashes, although I still get one or two from time to time. My theory is that there is a memory leak somewhere in KSP since the recent update, and I believe it has to do with the new building structures. I could be completely wrong on this but it just seems like too many things going on at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T09:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Liowen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Liowen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESemi serious question is your ground scatter at 100%?

I don\u0027t crash to desktop however I cannot do anything at all after I hit the launch button, I have to alt tab and close the program. It does not give me a log about what happened or anything. I still need make a save without mods to see if the results are the same as the modded one, but then again I only have a few mods installed. I do need to record this happening and post it in the support forum and see what it could be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
