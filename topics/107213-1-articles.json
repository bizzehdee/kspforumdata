And ofc the game refuses to let me do it....what the heck do i need to do to launch 2 planes one after another both into the air?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get switching distances of over 5 km in my game...

I could understand it being needed if there was an actual programming limitation, but this is more of a \u0022safety feature\u0022 (and I don\u0027t like safety features in KSP!). It\u0027s also inconsistent, sometimes you can switch between things in the atmo other times not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the \u0022cannot switch vessels while....\u0022 limitations annoy me. I understand I can\u0027t switch between a vessel that is out of the physics range, that\u0027s a programming limitation and that\u0027s fine, but I should be able to switch between anything within the physics range, be it in the atmo, moving along the ground or with engines running. Sure the result maybe one of them crashes, but that\u0027s a risk I\u0027m willing to take for the possibility of being able to fly/drive two craft at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the problem only occurs when the target craft is landed and more than 2.5km away? So it is not loaded when you try to switch, and this might be what the game checks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: there is not one \u0027physics range\u0027 anymore, there are only loaded and unloaded vessels. So, in more detail, my guess is that the game asks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* is the target vessel (landed) loaded? (false, because landed and more then 2.5km away)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einstead of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* will the current vessel (flying) stay loaded after the switch?
