It can be stand alone or linked to the PC version either way I want this game everywhere I go. It must not be like the current games where it takes 3days to build something but if you pay you can speed the process up. This would be a death sentence for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jsaur","CreatedById":87223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T02:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECopied from the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use of other hardware platforms or operating system types\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mobile version of the game would eat up too much of the developers\u0027 time and would delay updates that make the game better.
