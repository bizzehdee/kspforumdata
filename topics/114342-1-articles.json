Simply being able to disable the GUI would be enough to keep me happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask because I made a nice set of pontoons by rescaling the large landing gear, but it\u0027s only pontoon-like when the gear is retracted, obviously. Removing the gear module reference is the easiest way to disable player control, but that locks the gear in the default (deployed) configuration. On the other hand I can set the default state to retracted using the gear module, however that enables player control of gear state/GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hopeful because I see that other part modules allow something akin to: allowManualControl = False\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, who\u0027s going to ruin this rare bout of optimism? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*facepalm*\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
