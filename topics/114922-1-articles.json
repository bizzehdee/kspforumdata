Not that it couldn\u0027t return on its own, but hey, an excuse to use the speeder!\n\n![6GWvcBo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6GWvcBo.jpg)\n\nAnd here\u0027s Gregar\u0027s personal speeder, accessorized with an external fuel tank.\n\n![sKYRQtX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sKYRQtX.jpg)\n\nGregar takes a leap of faith...\n\n![XrJyLgq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XrJyLgq.jpg)\n\nBoarding the speeder...\n\n![3UOsK2f.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3UOsK2f.jpg)\n\nAnd off we go!\n\n![AWBvHq9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AWBvHq9.jpg)\n\n![OHrbuRd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OHrbuRd.jpg)\n\n![pUjDZR4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pUjDZR4.jpg)\n\n![Ph7qR6K.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ph7qR6K.jpg)![emBNyOH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/emBNyOH.jpg)\n\nFirst refuelling from the external tank, not really necessary but you know how it goes...\n\n![2Z5P68M.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2Z5P68M.jpg)\n\nAbout to cross the crest...\n\n![QbFgt6x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QbFgt6x.jpg)![rTL2mYX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rTL2mYX.jpg)\n\nAaaand the target is in sight.\n\n![XSdUYiZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XSdUYiZ.jpg)\n\nBraking.\n\n![JXvcn4B.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JXvcn4B.jpg)\n\n![UcFWzcL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UcFWzcL.jpg)\n\n![gYkXI7i.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gYkXI7i.jpg)\n\nUsing up last of my monopropellant on soft landing. I had barely any when starting.\n\n![QDlIp9V.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QDlIp9V.jpg)\n\n![V6ILKk5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/V6ILKk5.jpg)\n\n![KB1wJpW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KB1wJpW.jpg)![vmxk6Ut.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vmxk6Ut.jpg)\n\n![uES1VPa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uES1VPa.jpg)\n\nWe\u0027re running short on fuel. We should drop into the garage on our way back to refuel...\n\n![aaj5wed.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aaj5wed.jpg)\n\n![zgCExcQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zgCExcQ.jpg)\n\n![vIX09D8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vIX09D8.jpg)\n\nThe garage is located about 3km from the mining operations, for the simple reasons of keeping the framerate of these two high.\n\n![F7mGKJ6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/F7mGKJ6.jpg)\n\nWith monoprop, I\u0027d land right in front of the garage, but running just on the main engine, I really don\u0027t feel like struggling with that.\n\n![uBN02Fj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uBN02Fj.jpg)\n\nThe landing was pretty hard, but nothing the skids wouldn\u0027t withstand...\n\n![LEw4d0O.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LEw4d0O.jpg)![DDcJIDy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DDcJIDy.jpg)\n\nToo bad the solar panels aren\u0027t skids. Seems I busted one. And in the background - 8 more speeders, awaiting assignment.\n\nRCS is gone but the reaction wheel still works.\n\n![gutOzjw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gutOzjw.jpg)\n\n![ELSZ1ee.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ELSZ1ee.jpg)\n\n![P6GXZkS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/P6GXZkS.jpg)\n\n![n0nxy1E.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/n0nxy1E.jpg)\n\n![NzKrVWa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NzKrVWa.jpg)![U1hpObJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/U1hpObJ.jpg)\n\nBacking off with RCS at last!\n\n![sbQvEt6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sbQvEt6.jpg)\n\n![iJCd78h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iJCd78h.jpg)\n\nAnd uneventful return home.\n\n![jilP2Lu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jilP2Lu.jpg)\n\n![NpsjXmE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NpsjXmE.jpg)\n\n![WWz9SRu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WWz9SRu.jpg)"}]}
