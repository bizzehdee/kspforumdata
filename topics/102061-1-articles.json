The amount of RAM a program can use is fixed by the type of architecture it uses. 32 bit programs can only ever use 4GB of RAM this is because 32bit programs can only assign values up to 4.2billion and it just so happens 4.2 billion bytes is 4GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP on Windows is 32 bit, there is a 64 bit client however it has a lot of bugs, is incredibly unstable for most people and most mod developers set their mods not to activate on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP on linux has a stable 64 bit client.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64 bit programs can use up to 18.4 quintillion bytes or around 18 billion GB of RAM\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T15:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there\u0027s ActiveTextureManagement for reducing RAM usage or you can force OpenGL for graphics rendering.

Because of this, you can keep an eye on it (via task manager) and anticipate the crash, giving the game a graceful restart.
