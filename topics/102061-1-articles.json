The amount of RAM a program can use is fixed by the type of architecture it uses. 32 bit programs can only ever use 4GB of RAM this is because 32bit programs can only assign values up to 4.2billion and it just so happens 4.2 billion bytes is 4GB.\n\nKSP on Windows is 32 bit, there is a 64 bit client however it has a lot of bugs, is incredibly unstable for most people and most mod developers set their mods not to activate on it.\n\nKSP on linux has a stable 64 bit client.\n\n64 bit programs can use up to 18.4 quintillion bytes or around 18 billion GB of RAM"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T15:38:14Z","Content":"Also, there\u0027s ActiveTextureManagement for reducing RAM usage or you can force OpenGL for graphics rendering. Both reduce RAM requirements because, as nekogod said, literally nothing can change the fact that a 32-bit program can only access 4Gb of RAM. Your only options are decreasing RAM usage or Linux64."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T16:14:26Z","Content":"[Active Texture Management](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-90-Release-4-3-Dec-16-2014-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM!) is indeed a very helpful starting point ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBeyond that, you\u0027ll have to sacrifice some mods. It bites, I know, but it\u0027s basically a hardware limitation until Unity sorts out 64 bit support :/\n\nMemory crashes are very predictable however; up to 3.4gb in use is always stable (on my machine). 3.4-3.6 could crash on the next scene switch, and 3.6\u002B is pretty much going to crash at any moment whether or not there\u0027s a scene change. Because of this, you can keep an eye on it (via task manager) and anticipate the crash, giving the game a graceful restart.
