Maybe it is with winglets, maybe not. Feel free to correct me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo most of us know that to get to orbit efficiently, you need to do a gravity turn and have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E of roughly 45 degrees at 10km on Kerbin. This is done by tipping over gradually while you are ascending. Getting to orbit this way is the most efficient and will get you into orbit using the least amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. However on Eve, such a maneuver is very difficult and most people just go straight up and turn after they have gotten up high enough not to flip over when they turn it the slightest. Doing a gravity turn on Eve like Kerbin is hard and makes getting to orbit not as efficient as on Kerbin. In fact some might say it is impossible to do. Until... now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore 1.2, using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to point in a certain direction, such as prograde, retrograde, radial and so on could cause an engine to gimbal uncontrollably and force you to keep the ship focused on a certain direction manually. This bug was fixed in 1.2 and now, if you get it right, you can have that... do the gravity turn for you. All you have to do is move slightly to one side while you are firing the engines and the prograde vector will move forward in that direction. Then just hold prograde and you will follow it and keep it moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow yesterday, I built an Eve lander, dropped it through Eve\u0027s atmosphere and landed it. This was a test run to land and fly to orbit so I used the debug menu to edit it into low Eve orbit. It took me a few tries to get the optimal launch, (i.e make it go straight up and not flip over. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E) but I did it and on this one attempt, I was tilted slightly down the navball on the 90 line. My prograde vector was slowly moving down at the same time so I clicked on hold prograde. I then watched it slowly tip over until at 10 km, it was at 45 degrees \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E. Now I know since Eve\u0027s atmosphere ends at 90 km and Kerbin\u0027s ends at 70 km that this is a less optimal gravity turn maneuver since you are going to want to be going up more and not going sideways as much But I got into orbit with tons of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare and also did what I call an optimal flight to orbit. Sure the nose got hot at one point and almost blew up and as I said previously, this wasn\u0027t an optimal gravity turn but it worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... what I am wondering is, if you use this trajectory to orbit, how small can you make your landers? Also what are your thoughts on this discovery? And have any of you encountered this yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daripuff","CreatedById":139113,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-08T19:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA gravity turn is still the most efficient way to get to orbit of Eve, \u00A0but 45\u00B0at 10km is WAY too shallow a turn.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do the gravity turn to balance out the losses of fighting gravity with the losses of air resistance. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a planet with no atmosphere, and therefore no air resistance to fight, \u00A0 you go full horizontal the moment your altitude is higher than the hills you might hit, \u00A0no gravity turn there.
