Sometimes, two crafts are controlled simultaneously, other times my crafts completely change their orbits by spinning, occasionally my camera drifts off by a few kilometers, and once in a while my crafts receive random acceleration from no identifiable source. As a result of the frustrations thanks to these Kraken attacks, I try to avoid Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD\u0027ohh!! No sooner did you invoke the Kraken than it appeared to devour my mission in Moho\u0027s hood. It was a strange one too, that made my ship disappear in the orbital view instead of the staging view. When I went back to the tracking station, everything \u00A0was gone. Unfortunately my quicksave was corrupted as well, and my last named save was ages\u00A0before between Kerbin ejection burns. Sigh. Anyway, I mention it not because I\u0027m\u00A0\u00A0aggrieved but because it happened just as I think I figured out how to cheaply zero in on Moho from an Apoapsis encounter, and I want to communicate that before this thread dies. So:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Your Moho relative speed is much worse if you initially hit Moho\u0027s orbit at its high point, but there are also factors that work in your favor if you do it that way. One is that you can hit Moho\u0027s orbit\u00A0there with very low inclination using just one Eve gravity assist, while it takes either lots of\u00A0burn or two (very tedious) Eve assists to get you all the way down to Moho\u0027s Pe for your initial encounter. IIRC, Metaphor spent 1300\u002B dV to get to that first Moho encounter, while I\u0027m doing it for about 1150. From there, you need to bleed off a lot less total dV to get captured from a Pe encounter than from an Ap one, but as I think I\u0027ve figured out, the penalty for using gravity assists to do that is quite significantly less starting from an Ap-tangent orbit than from a Pe-tangent one. The key issue is that every time you use a Moho gravity assist to lower your Ap, you will lower your Pe some amount as well. If the planets are moving counterclockwise, swinging around Moho to lower your Ap moves your Pe a little bit \u00A0in and\u00A0a little bit clockwise each time. If you start from an orbit that is tangent to Moho\u0027s lowest point, this Pe lowering is a pure penalty, because both the inward and clockwise movement of your Pe put it further inside Moho\u0027s orbit. If OTOH you start from an orbit that\u0027s tangent to Moho\u0027s Ap, this lowering and pivoting of your new Pe follows the lowering of Moho\u0027s orbit as it goes toward its Pe, significantly reducing how far below Moho\u0027s orbit each successive grav assist pushes you.\u00A0 Moreover, if you do just a small prograde burn at around 15 degrees before your solar Ap, you can push your Pe back out and clockwise even more\u00A0for just a few m/s, also making your next encounter point earlier and closer to Moho\u0027s Pe. In this way, I believe that if you can both find a really good path between the resonant energy levels and optimally correct your Pe on each successive orbit, you can shimmy on down and around to a really cheap Moho capture. Anyway, that\u0027s my plan and I\u0027m sticking to it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-03T04:22:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2015 04:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T06:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh right, I knew I had forgotten something....\u00A0\u00A0 I wanted to try going there again (for the second time only since 0.22) and forgot.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI need to start putting an expedition and send something there,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember having a hard time with an Ion\u00A0probe in 0.25, but then again I never landed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t even know if Moho is Tidally locked.\u00A0 Does it have a rotation like Mercury in RL ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T09:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think if it\u0027s tidally lock, but rotation is very slow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T14:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHerbal space program, that is brilliant. I had looked at the first encounter speeds for a Moho periapsis arrival versus an apoapsis arrival, found periapsis looked lower, and left it at that. Your realization that the periapsis decrease resulting from a flyby follows Moho\u0027s decreasing distance from the sun... that is freaking brilliant. That does make it sound like the apoapsis arrival is better. You might have to do more flybys of Moho to slow down enough, but if you are saving 20m/s or so per correction it could add up to the superior solution, especially when the lower departure-from-Kerbin speed is added in.
