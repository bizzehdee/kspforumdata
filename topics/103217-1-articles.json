No way they can be lying, right?\n\n[http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/04/cern-researchers-confirm-existence-force](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/04/cern-researchers-confirm-existence-force)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Researchers at the [Large Hadron Collider](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) just recently started testing the accelerator for running at the higher energy of [13 TeV](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/engineering/restarting-lhc-why-13-tev), and already they have found new insights into the fundamental structure of the universe. Though four fundamental forces \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic force and gravity \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 have been well documented and confirmed in experiments over the years, CERN announced today the first unequivocal evidence for *the* Force. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVery impressive, this result is,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said a diminutive green spokesperson for the laboratory.\n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Force is what gives a particle physicist his powers,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said CERN theorist Ben Kenobi of the University of Mos Eisley, Tatooine. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us; and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\u003E \n\u003E Though researchers are as yet unsure what exactly causes the Force, students and professors at the laboratory have already started to harness its power. Practical applications so far include long-distance communication, influencing minds, and lifting heavy things out of swamps.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In case you didn\u0027t catch the obvious silly tone, or clicking the link and see the april 2 edit, and notice that I am posting this in the space lounge instead of science lab where it should be...yeah, it is an april\u0027s fool joke."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T09:07:50Z","Content":"That made me smile nonetheless.
