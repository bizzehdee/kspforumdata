I could use some advice on the best/easiest way to go about it. KAS is already a requirement, so it doesn\u0027t really matter where the hexcan appears, so long as an EVA kerbal can grab it reasonably easily. I can see a few options, but they all seem a bit messy for simply creating a single part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreate the hexcan as a new vessel, similar to Extraplanetary Launchpads. This might involve some work to ensure the hexcan ends up nearby, but not within another vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUnload the current vessel, edit the protovessel so that a hexcan is sticking off the side, then reload the vessel. It would be hard to take into account every possible vessel configuration. Also, is doing this to an active vessel likely to cause any problems?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd the hexcan directly to a KAS container. I\u0027ve looked at the KAS sourcecode and I \u003Cem\u003Ethink \u003C/em\u003EI wouldn\u0027t have access to the internal functions KAS uses for this. I could do the same thing as idea #2, but edit the protopart container to add the hexcan.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T21:42:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by XanderTek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
