The game only cares about it being attachable somehow.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick test to prove the above: place an octo probe core, attach any other part(s) to it - but leave either the top or bottom node of the core open. Now grab the probe core and you\u0027ll see that the entire craft can be dropped as a subassembly. However, if you use both the top and bottom stack nodes for other parts, and grab the probe core now... no dice, no subassembly allowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a set of parts that you wish to save as subassembly, and somehow it won\u0027t save, it can usually be solved by using the re-root gizmo, and picking as root any other part of the set that still has either an open stack node or is surface attachable. Of course this may not attach as logical/pretty as one would wish, which is why you should always build a subassembly with the main rule in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-13T16:13:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2017 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esimple is better\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-13T15:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake good use of root tool (which works for inactive part tree as well), and shift click (which can tear apart inactive part tree).

Subassembly itself is stored per-save, but the categorization is stored globally (for each game).

I made that little probe to piggyback on top of a mun lander, so I already had a pad in place, and built the probe from the engine up, so the game must have made the engine the root part. Anyway I had solved my issue by taking some of the biome probe off and adding what I needed to have it be like my science probe and then resaving it under a new name.
