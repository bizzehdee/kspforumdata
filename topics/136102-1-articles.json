At the same time the actual scale of the sites is so incredibly small compared to the world they exist in that many players might play for years and not find one beyond the island airfield. In this way unless you\u0027ve gone online and seen\u00A0pictures and looked them up on the wiki and found a way to guide yourself to some\u00A0coordinates, all of which kind of removes you from the direct\u00A0immersion in\u00A0the game, the anomalies are basically statistically irrelevant.

The great thing about them having a real in-game value is that they become part of actual gameplay, and not just \u0022oh neat\u0022 scenery. There becomes a specific reason and incentive to carefully pick a landing site and do precision landings rather than just plop down anywhere. To me the current easter eggs are neat and fun\u00A0but I\u0027d love to see that system expanded and given\u00A0a new layer in which some become more common and serious, like active geological formations or signs of life.\u00A0Being able to map them, even if it was just a little red speck on an overlay, would stir players to say \u0022Oh whats that?\u0022 and create new opportunities for exploration without having to close or minimize the game and open up a browser. To me it does nothing to spoil the surprise of what they find when they get there, it only gives them a vehicle to explore and increases the odds that it happens on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s just a goofy real life example, check out this map:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022North_america_terrain_2003_map.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/North_america_terrain_2003_map.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022842\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look closely up at northern Quebec you\u0027ll see a small, round, green circle in a lake.
