Lowering their mass will severely compromise the strength of their connection to other parts, don\u0027t do that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fuselage can hold a certain amount of fuel depending on it\u0027s cross-section and length of the fuel tank. We are calculating fuel tank capacity from true volume of our fuselage sections, nothing to tune here. The resulting total mass of fuel tanks is not determined by us, we are only determining empty tank mass and KSP adds the rest depending on amount of fuel. Naturally, large tanks would be heavy, and our fuselages are very large. S2 is almost 2.5m in diameter, same as orange tanks. HL fuselage system is 3.75m sans side cuts. You can\u0027t realistically expect these parts to weigh as little as puny stock spaceplane parts do. To be able to support the fuel tanks from those fuselage systems, structural parts have to be of proper weight, otherwise connections will be very, very prone to breaking. You saw how low mass worked out in the 2.0 release, it\u0027s not the proper way to do things and it\u0027s not fun to have your planes falling apart from the slightest stress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, look at example crafts, they are never using any sort of wing spam or intake spam and take off perfectly fine utilizing up to half of the runway. I honestly don\u0027t understand why the hell would you want to lower the mass of the parts if there isn\u0027t a problem with taking off in the first place. No one seems to complain about structural parts from KW Rocketry weighting up to six tons for precisely the same reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the mass of wings and intakes should NEVER be used as reference, because KSP is using faulty mass-dependent drag model and these part types always have their mass set depending on the required drag levels, completely irregardless of their size or volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had to scrap it when I realized the one tank went from 500 to 4700 fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a placeholder value that had nothing to do with true volume of the fuel tank and it was rightly changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T01:33:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by bac9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T03:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook, I really sorry if am talking trash, I will put something in clear, I dont understand how this game works, and for sure you know a lot more than me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am just comparing numbers with the ksp structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it was hard to take off in my 4 or 5 test, I take a look at the numbers and I thought that maybe was something bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELowering their mass will severely compromise the strength of their connection to other parts, don\u0027t do that. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already did XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont worry, no kerbals will be damage in these tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reduce the mass in a 70% of all structures like adapters, fuselages, etc (only structures without fuel) and then I reduce also the breakingForce / breakingTorque in a 20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I dont know what I am doing, if is wrong, I will install B9 again and thats it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil now, I just noted that is a little more light, the planes take a little more speed, but i dont see any big change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat do you said about the strength i dont get it..

Not sure if I\u0027m doing something wrong or if it\u0027s bugged or what the deal is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) During the ascent into orbit, the focus of my camera begins slowly drifting off the rear of the craft. By the time I reach orbit, it\u0027s centered at least 2km behind it, which makes it impossible to properly operate the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei have the second problem too, and made a thread about it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27763-center-of-mass-moves-outside-of-ship\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27763-center-of-mass-moves-outside-of-ship\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Runeforged","CreatedById":61737,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T12:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is, without a doubt, the best parts expansion that I have downloaded for KSP.

For example the 6m crew structure only carry 6 kerbals, a normal airplane in the same structure size may carry like 20 people, and people is a lot more big than kerbals. Also, it will be great if you can give another utility to the S2 intake air structure, maybe some windows to carry crew?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netris","CreatedById":28791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe firespitter plugin is there for the fancy computer in the EVA.
