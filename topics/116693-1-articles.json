This is because KSP is set in a toy-sized solar system where ship speeds are an order of magnitude less than in real life. If we assume that you\u0027re trying to fly realistic, sensible mission profiles and (a huge and obviously false assumption) that the heat and aero models are not borked and/or bugged, then you should never find yourself in a position to fry, at least if you take reasonable precautions. Now, if you try to land center mass on Kerbin when returning from Jool, or something similarly mad, then you should have a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider that in real life, Apollo landed directly on Earth when coming back from the Moon (although it came in rather tangentially instead of going center mass). This should, therefore, be quite possible in KSP. And because of the tiny size of KSP, the velocities involved when returning from Minmus, Duna, and Eve aren\u0027t significantly higher, so direct, Apollo-style landings from those places should also be quite possible, even normal. Furthermore, the other planets with significant atmospheres (Eve, Jool, and Laythe) should have wide upper regions where the air is thin enough to aerobrake/capture in without much concern, again because speeds in KSP are really not that high, although I wouldn\u0027t want to land directly on any of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, at present the aero model is rather borked. Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is the only one that realistically fades out over a long distance, thereby providing a nice aerobraking zone. All other atmospheric densities drop off very steeply so they are in effect more like oceans than atmospheres. This is what makes just barely touching the top layer of air at Eve, Jool, and Laythe pretty much instantly fatal from heat without slowing you down at all. And there are also related problems with the heat model, although those are harder to pin down because of all the complex interactions in the heat system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EReentry Heat Setting\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis IMHO is a matter of personal taste because regardless of what you do with it, you\u0027ll make something either impossible or super easy. Using a relatively high setting only produces realistc results at Kerbin, while turning it down to allow realistic interplanetary aerocaptures makes things at Kerbin a doddle. But realize that this inconsistent result is a product of the inconsistencies in the underlying aero model (and some issues with the heat model), so things will never be to your liking everywhere no matter what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome recommendations for different play styles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* High Settings (100% or more): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo this if you never venture out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, or if you believe interplanetary aerocaptures should be impossible (or require extreme engineering) based on the speeds of the real solar system, ignoring the fact that nothing goes anywhere near that fast in toy-sized KSP. And also ignoring the undeniably borked aero model at other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Low Settings (20% or less):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo this if you\u0027re big into interplanetary bases and colonies. 20% is about the highest you can go and still have useful interplanetary aerocaptures. In effect, this changes the non-solid surroundings of Eve, Jool, and Laythe from being oceans to proper atmospheres. It does, however, make futzing around within Kerbin\u0027s SOI rather harmless. But given that your attention is focused on other planets, you\u0027re not going to be doing much of that anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Medium Settings (20-100%):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t do this as it produces bad results everywhere.
