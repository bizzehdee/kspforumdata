I\u0027ve been using the Lithium Magnetoplasmadynamic engines from NFP on some of my cismunar transport craft, and they\u0027re really useful, but my space program is fueled primarily by Karbonite mined from the Mun\u0027s surface, and there\u0027s no way to turn karbonite into lithium (fair enough). What i want to know is if there\u0027s any mod out there with some sort of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E module that would let me produce lithium in space, so I wouldn\u0027t have to keep launching rockets from Kerbin to refill the tanks in my space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fury1SOG","CreatedById":153500,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T13:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear Future Propulsion contains a patch to add Ore-\u0026gt;Lithium converters to the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and Mini \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
