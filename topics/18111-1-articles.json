The fuel in the suit will probably only be sufficient for a succesful landing when the craft already has lost a lot of altitude and speed. I can\u0027t tell you what speed and what altitude, but there is a simple way to determine those values. Land an astronaut on the Mun and get him out of the ship. Then thrust up contineously with his personal thrusters until his fuel runs out completely. If you keep track what speed is achieved at which altitude you know what the maximum speed is at a given altitude which can be neutralised by the thrusters. The speed and altitude achieved when the fuel runs out is the maximum speed at which a safe landing by the astronaut is still possible. You\u0027ll probably be able to extrapolate the determined values into a graph. Bear in mind that those values are only approximations. Even a landing when not all the speed is neutralized can be survivable when the speed is not too high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T12:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know what you mean...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean that Make a ship that orbits around the mun and then jump out and try to land?
