The Toolbar Plugin just does what it is told to do.\u003Cp\u003ENice. In your code, I noticed you make extensive use of GameScenesVisibility. You should perhaps consider creating a new visibility class that implements IVisibility that might fit your needs better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I see that you used GameScenes.EDITOR in some parts of your code. In some instances, you seem to already have added GameScenes.SPH where you only had used EDITOR. I thought I\u0027d just bring this up again so that you are aware of the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that Using GameScenes.Editor does not show in SPH so I added SPH. The way the icons are set up is that everyscene is controllable and savable, both with your icons and my icons. I will check out ivisibility, everything seems to work at this point though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess I should of checked the other mods before I did this. But I pretty much implemented this mod as the number one way to navigate through the windows of MCE.. IE call the MCE windows that I made. See most mod authors are using it just to call the main code. But the ToolBar Mod helped with one aspect that annoyed me about MCE. Its footprint on screen, It allowed me to redesign all the windows for MCE smaller, and to use the Icons to call them up. So hopefully its alright that I used it this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-31T14:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2013 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T16:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo hopefully its alright that I used it this way.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, it\u0027s up to you how you want to use it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I noticed: Please do not include a toolbar-settings.dat file in your download.

My suspicion is that these issues are \u0027yours\u0027 since its the bar thats behaving oddly, could always be a mod thats using it that has the issue however. Never used your plugin before today, so apologies if this is known/common, skimmed the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday i put the 0.23 KAC and 0.23 FAR mods into my install. Firstly, I dont see KAC anywhere at all, im used to using this mod pre 0.23, so i know what it normally looks like (looked like in .22). From your OP i assumed the kac alarm clock icon would be one of my toolbar icons, perhaps erroneous assumption? I do get your toolbar with a FAR button embedded in it appearing when I launch the game. (i got your mod packaged with far i think, certainly didnt manualy apply it, it came with something) In space centre view it flickers rapidly in the middle of the screen real-estate and the arrow (drop-down menu) is unresponsive. Once in VAB im abale to interact properly with the toolbar and leash it to a specific area of the screen through the menus. It also ghosts in and out rapidly in tracking centre view. Works correctly once in flight, though i noted that moving from vab to pad with it unlocked for reposition/resize left me unable to relock and therefore access it once i hit launch, had to revert to vab, lock and relaunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to try removing FAR and the toolbar and see if KAC reappears.
