To fix, click on the \u002B marker when you mouse over to the staging bar and drag the engine to the new place below the capsule and parachute. Stay with sub orbital for your first launches and steer subsequent launches to land on different areas of Kerbal to get soil samples for science points. Then, with the next tier unlocked, build your orbiter and go for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my orbiter built from the unlocked first tier.

First, you can recover without going to the tracking station by just hovering over the altimeter at the top of the screen and clicking the pop-up Recover button. Second, do all the science you can on each trip. Collect science on the launch pad (EVA and get a soil sample and an EVA report), recover. When you land, do an EVA and get a soil sample (even from the water). Keep doing these over and over until you\u0027re getting almost nothing from the samples.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"knotbeer","CreatedById":73226,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T03:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK thanks for the info.\u003Cp\u003EI found out that I could rescue my Kerbal from the Tracking Station.

After I got science rolling and unlocked a few levels, I noticed that I could not simply get more science and level up, so I had to figure out where there were more vast amounts of science waiting for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin, you can land in Highlands, Lowlands, Mountains, etc. and gather soil samples during EVA then enter your ship and recover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn other bodies, you must return to Kerbin to deliver a full amount of science. I do not recommend transmitting your soil samples... Unless however you realize you need more science to develop a rescue mission or you are going to terminate that mission in question. If you terminate a mission, try to transmit your science back and if you only have limited battery, then make sure you only focus on the most valuable science. The biggest reason I stress this is because you cannot ever get that value back. Not with another mission on the same career anyway. And if you transmit soil samples, you will in fact lose a % of data and/or value (I think just data) that you can also never regain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, in KSP I think you can earn way more science than the tree requires for completion, which means you can just do other things, but I\u0027m finding it hard to either accomplish those \u0022other things\u0022 or I\u0027m just not being imaginative enough to gather more so once I\u0027ve found myself in a situation that i did not want to redo a 1 1/2 hour mission and can\u0027t return home, I just send as much or the most valuable as I can and just go start a new mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting a new career can also be a bit of fun once you\u0027ve got the basics down.
