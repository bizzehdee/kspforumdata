I went into it expecting a Minecraft clone, and got a notably different experience. Much more to do there than first meets the eye. It lies somewhere between sandbox builder and side-scrolling adventure. Given these two, though their very different games, I would probably recommend Terraria, especially if you have a friend or two to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-07T23:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest Terraria, especially because it is getting a new, big update Soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T02:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like Terraria best.
