If the fuel was infinitely divisible and you scaled your thrust correctly you could keep burning forever. But in real life fuel is made out of atoms, and you can\u0027t burn half an atom. So you\u0027ll flame out at some point. In either case your dV stays the exact same, so you can\u0027t use this to get anywhere that you otherwise couldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your capsule, fuel tank and engine where weightless you would indeed have infinite delta V.
