When the vessel gets unloaded from reaching about 22km (0.01 atm) SR does some checks to determine what the landing speed would be, and if it falls below a certain value then it recovers it. The Variable Rate model (which is the default one) recovers it at a rate dependent on the landing speed (7 m/s may be 90% or something like that, but 10 m/s might only be 10%. Note, not actual values, but I believe the defaults are around that). SR also checks if Deadly Reentry is installed, and if so does some very very basic checks to make sure you can\u0027t throw things into the atmosphere at 6 km/s. It also can do checks based on if the unloaded craft is controlled (I still need to check if having kerbals works properly, but I know probes do) and it will try to burn fuel to land, if parachutes aren\u0027t installed or aren\u0027t enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, yes SR handles that, since that\u0027s exactly how SR works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s just not 100% accurate because I have to make assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S1gmoid","CreatedById":124382,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T16:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens if the vehicle on rails enters an extra-kerbinal atmosphere? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T16:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022S1gmoid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022S1gmoid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat happens if the vehicle on rails enters an extra-kerbinal atmosphere? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see what you\u0027re getting at!

It seems KSP isn\u0027t correctly reporting the latitude and longitude values for some vessels. Nonphysical timewarp has been known to cause strange issues and I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it were related some how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m having the opposite issue. I drop a stage (fuel tank, engine, and 4 radial parachutes) right on top of KSC (detached stage at 1500m) and it shows Distance from KSC as 781.52km with only 61.51% recovered.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen similar behavior once or twice. It\u0027s likely the same problem as above. I\u0027ll look into finding a different way of determining the latitude and longitude of the craft at destruction. I know it isn\u0027t the Great Circle Distance calculation, since that is a stock function that would affect all recoveries and no one has reported similar issues with stock games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowered recovery shouldn\u0027t affect this, but thank you for double checking \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThirdHorseman","CreatedById":77825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T02:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll look into finding a different way of determining the latitude and longitude of the craft at destruction. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if you could do something similar to the Atmospheric Trajectories mod...it can determine the exact spot on the surface where the craft will impact.
