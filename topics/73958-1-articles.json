But how can that be, it\u0027s going to be their new space station launching next year, well... I can\u0027t actually answer that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe basically know very little on the station, from structure, to capabilities, etc and most data is scattered across the web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is some data I have scavenged over the months (because I obsess over odd things :S).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly tiangong 2 was originally going to be the backup for t-1, however it was decided to move on to something more advanced so they started building a new one. From speculation we can guess it will be larger, personally I think in length then in diameter, but the same structure as t-1. The backup will likely be used as an experimental module like tks for salyut-7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly we know that there will be a resupply ship to do refuelling experiments, so there is most likely going to be a second docking post on the service section. BUT will the crew members be able to access it, most likely yes but there is always the possibility it won\u0027t be accessible, it depends on the size which we do not know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there is going to be resupply ships it can be speculated that the life support and therefore missions will be increased probably to 30 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has been stated there will be 3 manned missions, the chinese usually deliver but to the precise point. So expect no more then 3 manned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has been scheduled for a 2015 launch, but was recently revealed it could be pushed back to 2016, giving it a 4 year lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECant think of anything else just yet, if you know something else or have a speculation based on data please post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T01:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey seem to have reverted to the original plan of flying the T-1 backup as T-2, albeit with pretty extensive modifications. There\u0027s only one docking port, the cargo freighter will transfer fuel only between shenzhou visits. Given it\u0027s still very much an experimental station, I doubt they\u0027ll drag it out to anything like 2020 and instead switch to T-3 as soon as CZ-7/5 (depending on how big it ultimately is) is ready for the launch. BtW, this isn\u0027t secret at all, it\u0027s just not terribly well covered in english.
