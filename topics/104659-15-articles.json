I think you and I are talking apples an oranges. I mean proper testing against a wide variety of platforms, the sort of thing that is done only on new products in preparation for public release. Not every patch would go through the process, only that attached to a major media rollout. The houses I\u0027ve worked with would often outsource this testing for lack of manpower and equipment. With millions, tens of millions, of dollars riding on a smooth roll out, the risk of even tiny bugs must be mitigated.
