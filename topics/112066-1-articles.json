(They radiate heat but can also take more heat in)\n\nUse solar panels. (They radiate heat but also take heat from other side.)\n\nHave a heatsink (like an unusable tank of RCS).\n\nAnd if your shield ablates during atmospheric entry, its normal. If its a lot, its time to slow down (if its an aerobrake, make your entry a little shallower)"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:50:35Z","Content":"oh so thats how. the craft exploded anyway. one went on EVA."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:53:49Z","Content":"Sorry for your loss, the Nerv engine mysteriously overheats while its heating very cool propellant, so when youre going to use the nerv engine with a small craft without any advanced cooling mechanism, do short burns and keep an eye on the thermal info screen"}]}
