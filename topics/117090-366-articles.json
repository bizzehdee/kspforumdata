I need something smaller than Saturn I(any) but bigger than Titan IVa and Delta IV would fall into that range if it wasn\u0027t 3.75m  At 3.75m scale It is almost cheaper to launch it on a Saturn IF with extra SRMs."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-24T21:58:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 58 minutes ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Closest Diameter commonly used in game is 3.125\n\u003E \n\nNot for anything I\u0027ve created or used.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E default is 3.75 is this an error or correct?\n\u003E \n\nNo, that is the intended scale.  3.75m is the closest *stock* diameter that would allow for the engine to fit; its way too big for 2.5m.  The RS-68 is one of the only oddly scaled engines, being closer to ~72% real-world scale compared to the ~64% used on everything else.\n\nIn theory should be easy enough for you to rescale to 3.125 (as the engine cluster module supports rescaling functions), though I can\u0027t offhand remember exactly what would be needed.

The panels have their normal output, which is ok. It\u0027s not like the higher Power output is essential. \n\nI just saw that the stock panels and those of near future and probes plus all seem to get their higher output. But this is something not many people will encounter since it\u0027s just one of the many planet packs.\n\nI did check the SSTU in my 2.5x scaled stock system and the generated power seems to work fine with the scaling so it\u0027s probably an issue specific to After Kerbin."}]}
