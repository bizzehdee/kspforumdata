Note: I use Mechjeb, as I am dyspraxic, and lack the coordination to perform large burns with large, badly balanced ships. I try do do as much as possible myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further ado, let\u0027s get on with the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Base was launched in a stack with it\u0027s transfer stage, Minmus station, twin crewed landers, and two ion scoutcraft. the stack weighed a total of 550-something tons, and was therefore launched with the Einstein-Hawking II heavy lifter, (accessible through my signature). It was a night launch, and all went well, other than a couple of soiled spacepants (One of my scientists was screaming the whole time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q02x6C4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Q02x6C4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the stack in orbit, with the sustainer of the launcher, which helped start the transfer burn.

At this point, Sido Kerman took the controls, and laid the base down with fuel to spare. He also landed with a good view out of the main viewport.
