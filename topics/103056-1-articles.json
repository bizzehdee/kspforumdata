Just spin it up to create an instant reality dysfunction that might, just might transport you instantly to another point in space.\n\nTo actually end up where you want to go, instead of experiencing a permanent fatal reality dis-coherence (i.e. your ship goes puff, aka. explodes) there are a few recommendations to observe:\n\n- Place a FTL beacon where you want to go, otherwise, the FTL drive cannot get a lock on your target destination and will refuse to even spin up.\n- Never, never, ever spin up the drive in a strong gravity field, keep far away from planets, suns, and other heavy objects.\n\nOther than that the FTL drive holds the promise to revolutionize interplanetary transfers and to take the grind out of flying vessels from one point in the Kerbol system to another.\n\nLicense: CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-09T20:59:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2021 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**\n  \nLink to defunct website removed by moderator"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:32:24Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nQuick note though: can you add mention in the readme what license you\u0027re using, and add it to the OP?

This puts a limit on how big a ship you can jump and it requires you to go some distance out from the planet.

If the required force is larger than the maximal for available, then the chance of a successful jump is proportional to their ratios (i.e. if required force is 5000N then your jump has a 50% chance of succeeding).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T17:59:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by krh42**\n  \nto make it more clear what it refers to"},{"CreatedByName":"krh42","CreatedById":134348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T17:35:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, I am currently diving through the source code and think i know where to start modifying it.

It is also a great convenience, and it turns the jump into game mechanics (seeding of beacons throughout the Kerbol system. If you can enter (sMa, ecc, inc, lan, aop \u002Breference body), then I think it would be too much just like hyperedit. The reason you can turn beacons on/off is so they don\u0027t show up while in transit. \n\nHowever, one thing that is really missing is that beacons require power, and they should stop working if there is insufficient power.\n\nI would be sad to see the force req. dependence on the gravity field go, as it forces one to go far out and hence that you still need to put a lot of thoughts into your vessels. \n\nHowever, I think the idea that the ship keeps it momentum is an interesting idea. Currently, it is very illogical that it just instantaneously changes it momentum. But it would make the mod really hard to use, but as you say force you still to design good vessels even if there is no force dependency on the gravity field.\n\nAnother solution could be to keep changing the momentum to match the beacon as it is now, but include the difference in momentum in the force required, and then indirectly you would have a force dependence on the distance of the jump, as there is the different orbital speeds, but also for example a high difference in the speed that for example Kerbin and Jool travels around Kerbol. However, this would also introduce a kind of launch window as the required force would go up if the planets are on opposite sites of Kerbol and hence travelling in opposing directions.\n\nSo open questions.\n\n1. Keep dependence on gravity as it is now, or\n\n2. Make force required relative to change in momentum, or\n\n3. Distance to jump\n\n4. Some combination or other.\n\nRight now it is harder to jump to planets close to Kerbol, and quite difficult to jump to Eve (close to Kerbol and relatively large).\n\nDamage to surrounding area is a great idea and should be implemented."},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T18:23:18Z","Content":"Kottabos just uploaded a mod showcase of this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yxeYFMKMoy8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Q-T","CreatedById":140398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T19:06:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for all the great ideas. \n\u003E The reason I included beacons and that you can only jump to beacons, are to force people first to go to the place first in a conventional way, so they are required to set up a transport network, and send out \u0022seed\u0022 ships.

What I\u0027d like to be able to do is make multiple jumps, starting in Low kerbal orbit and stretching out to the farthest reaches of the kerbal system. The balancing of it needs to come somewhere between too easy to setup, making it boring, and too complex and grinding to be fun and worth while. In the end I hope you make something you enjoy because you\u0027ll work harder on it."},{"CreatedByName":"Q-T","CreatedById":140398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T18:54:37Z","Content":"![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Some statistics that might come in handy, even though they are rough calculations and do not take the inclinations of the planets into account.\n\n![11140218_1110970928928870_5697869447206704846_o.jpg](https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/t31.0-8/11140218_1110970928928870_5697869447206704846_o.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"mcbmaestro","CreatedById":59577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T02:49:45Z","Content":"This mod is not working for me.

You need to activate a first stage in order for the physics loop to start OnFixedUpdate()."}]}
