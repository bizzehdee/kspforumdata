You can have your apopasis higher than the orbit you want, and upon reach your orbit altitude pitch down towards the ground to change you vector to bring the apoapsis to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T03:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs in 1 strait burn to circular orbit? That would take some doing. It would be easier to do higher out of the atmosphere (200\u002B). The real trick would be accounting for the transition to sideways (I guess go to min thrust, or allow a brief stop). You\\\u0027d need to know the exact horizontal speed target for your altitude, and make sure you reach that at exactly the same time you reach Ap. You\\\u0027ll need a table of velocities for circular orbits handy. Once your on your side, you can nose up a bit as needed (5-10 degrees) to get your Ap exactly right. After that its all about timing the horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I have a nice design on hand that could do that, but not that low. It was designed to reach a 200km orbit (and the staging and fuel tanks line up perfectly with the altitude at which it performs is maneuvers), but if I bring the engines back during the horizontal phase, it could probably be made to get a pretty nice orbit in one burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T12:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would not recommend doing such a thing, it would require you to spend a prolonged time in the denser atmosphere. Instead I would suggest getting to a sensible height, pushing the apogee to where you want it to be, shut off engines and reignite them when you\\\u0027re at apogee to push perigee up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cepheus","CreatedById":10683,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T15:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s what you do.
