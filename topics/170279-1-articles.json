And the question that comes to mind sometimes is why would someone with a molecular anthrpology background have such a difference in interpretation versus someone with a cultural anthropology or archaeology background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general they are trying to solve to very different problems which overlap in some area of physical anthropology. In molecular anthropology its generally not by choice, the discipline needs anchors and it needs aDNA and both require some sort of fossils or well preserve ancient bone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do we care, why should we care. To know when a gene evolved you tend to follow the development of internal markers in that gene, SNPs (called snips) over time. The question is the time, to do that you have to have some guess about the rate, and the rates per nucleotide are in the 10\u003Csup\u003E-19\u003C/sup\u003E/sec range. You are not going to be able to estimate the long term rate of evolution looking at cells in a laboratory, you could try but you will find most mutations that are produced in real time rapidly disappear from the population (there are disease studies that look at that, but these are generally not common diseases). So alternatively we need to have surrogate. And the surrogates are the rate of evolution between two species, say a chimp and a human. So that period covers k*3.15x 10\u003Csup\u003E13 \u003C/sup\u003Eseconds were k is a measure in millions years. So that we have got a horrendously low mutation rate to a point where we can expect a mutation across 10,000 base pairs. Some areas evolve faster or slower. So basically now if you know when say species 1 and 2 branched then you can expect mutations in the vicinity of your gene which you can clock (or not depending on the rate of recombination).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the interest here, is it academic or is there some more nefarious reason for making archaeologists life difficult by throwing in facts that are difficult for them to understand. For example a forensic anthropologist might be looking for a specific allele that maps potential suspects to a given area of origin, a medical geneticist may want to link all members of a large family backward in time to the origin of that disease for example to find an notify all potential carriers. There could be a variety of reasons medically for have useful sets of markers based on ancestral origins that allow us to link people together by genes. But there are even deeper and more abstract reasons for wanting to know the evolutionary history of a population in a medical context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let me state what complex Evolution is, to do that we need a simple evolution model. In this simple model a proto-species moves into an area, it adapts through both evolution and adaptive behaviors (some of which are learned) over time the rate at which many genes, for example non-synonymous sites in mtDNA, slow down and this allows the population to expand, over time if the species remains in that habitat it can undergo formal speciation and will lose the ability to intermix with descendants along other branches, this could take 100ky or 100my, we don\u0027t care.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a more complex model of evolution is actually the reality for most species. Kimura identified this in the 1950s or so replacing our idea of genetic drift with variable selection. Variable selection applies not only to static circumstances but a wide variety of circumstances where the selection coefficient on genes is difficult to determine. This can also break into heterozygous selection, cyclical selection,\u00A0 .It is because of Kimura that we care about effective individuals (N\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E) and population constrictions and all that technobabble. . . . . . In the more complex model of evolution then selection changes as time progresses and in reference to the coordinate system (as individuals or groups move around). Secondarily we do not assume that an isolate speciates, it can with regard to another subspecies, but the assumption is that under various condition that under some condition distal isolates can mix. Then they are free to go about the evolution of crossed genes (either positive or negative). It is only after the fact, for example, we want to ask the question why two genetically defined groups did not mate and one went extinct (usually the case in hominids), what was their limiting incompatibility. From about 1980 (really 1995) to 2008 this appeared not to be the case in humans, even though there were some slight indicators to the alternative. Some of these indicators were immune function genes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a whole class of diseases in our society that are low penetrance. And many of you would think that the penetrance is due to other genes and that is true, but there are examples of disease where penetrance can be linked to environment. For example type II diabetes is linked to environment and maybe some genes. But type II diabetes is not the only form of diabetes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRheumatoid arthritis is common to just about every population on earth, and there are known environmental causes (smoking, dental problems). But for many of you it might come as a surprise that it has a genetic risk (other than being female), in fact relatively high so that an individual who carries a particular gene alternatives has 5 fold more risk than someone who does not.\u00A0 But even more surprising is there is a city in Africa in which people sometimes carry the genes, but there is no rheumatoid arthritis, not a single case has been recorded in the indigenous population. Another example, the end of WWII and the cold war split a community in half the genetic makeup is insignificantly different, on one side of the border the people are at risk X for juvenile onset diabetes, on the other side the risk is 0.1X. In general, RA being the exception, inflammatory disease risk is increasing, and increasing quite rapidly for some diseases. The disease risk is evolving over time. There is a big expensive study going on in Europe right now called DAISY that is trying to parse out what those obviously environmental risk are, and to largely no avail. The epidemiology is not easy, it gets easier if you can factor groups into genetically defined risk categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are extreme examples, but scattered about our genome are genes that give benefit under environment X and are negatively selective under environment Y.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore I move on we need to first ask the question why should we care about this. . . .We know smoking is bad, and we should brush teeth,\u00A0 too much sugar is bad.\u00A0 What I seek to inform here is that moving, just the act of moving from one place to another is sufficient enough to vary selection in unpredictable ways. That is to say making a change of living circumstances from one location or a dramtaic change of culture in the same location in which there is no obvious risks differences still creates risk. Our genes are in a dynamic equilibrium of risk and benefit creation, if they even move a little bit in any direction from the lowest risk/highest benefit state then diseases can appear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what is space travel, if it not anything its traveling and it is exposing humans to risk and we tend to look at short term risk, but what about long term risk. . . .for example if you knew a given population of humans was particularly resistant to ionizing radiation, you might want to encourage them to travel in space. What about genes that lower risk for certain issues that arise in space (bone reduction, muscle reduction, blood pressure, eye problems, etc). But then we have to talk about settling, what about the risk of breathing \u0027Moon\u0027 dusts, or the infection/inflammation risk increased by exposure to atopic irritants. The you have situations like psoriasis, another genetically linked disease, also inflammatory, whereby the most cost effective treatment is exposure to sunlight at dawn or dusk in a humid environment. Natural synthesis of vitamin D close to the skin appears to lower risk in psoriasis and diabetes, and so in space its difficult to completely remove risk in a completely sheltered environment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most extreme example of bizarre regional evolution is hiding in plain site. A particular haplotype I will call 1-7-8-3-2-5 (each number is a component the variant at a given locus) it appears in part to have originated in W. Africa and N.W. Africa and somewhere, maybe 20 kya its components merged and became just one of many haplotypes in Iberia. The path into Africa is somewhat muddled but all the components are present in NW africa and along the N. West African coast so that sufficient enough to call its path of origin. There are other haplotypes that reached Europe in ancient times by the same path, so that is a plausible origin scenario. And 20 kya this haplotype would not look impressive to anyone, it would just be a stretch of DNA. Today it one of the longest runs of homozygosity identified in the human genome at its greatest length is ~9 million nucleotides in length. Of course, typically it is not that long, people who bear 1 component of the haplotype bear 85% of the core of 6 genes and 5 percent bear the entire 9.3 mNT segment, and given random recombination rates this is a statistical impossibility. A novelty or so we might think. As humans expanded into Europe from the Iberian refuge after the LGM this haplotype appears to have some very strange advantage, its not clear what the advantage was, some speculate that it was advantageous in the handling of shellfish, as in the bones of ancient western Europeans there is a high content of marine-derived carbon. And there are numerous shellfish caches to suggest to support this. Unlike haplotype frequency in most human populations, at time the haplotype frequency (or major portions thereof) may have approached 50%. But today 1-7-8-3-2-5 is regarded as a health risk, it is the principle risk factor for autoimmune gluten sensitivity, a secondary cause of juvenile diabetes, and a very long list of immune dysfunction diseases. The primary risk created by the haplotype is environment mediate as must have been the primary benefits at one time. This is an example of complex evolution. It is complex on many levels. First in the context of selection coefficients for chromosome 6p21 the apparent gene frequency is much higher than it should be. Second that rate of recombination does not fit well with rates of recombination at 6p21 or anywhere else in the human genome. Finally,\u00A0 evolution of humans based on geographic changes of culture and genes has shifted the selection of the gene. We can see here that when preparing space food, you probably want to ovoid items that can create risk in your Astronauts, and when it comes to food, one size does not fit all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above is an example of how bad the analysis of evolution can be. In fact when we consider the evolution of the 6p21 region many evolution researchers just walk away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it does tell us one thing, we need to get the phylogenetic analysis correct, or some of these evolution studies wont make sense, or give us the wrong sense. The parameters that govern evolution of traits is subject to change arbitrarily and not in a particularly obvious ways. In the above example, no-one knows why recombination slowed down and why it specifically slowed down in one part of the chromosome in one part of Europe, There is another haplotype 3-7-7-15-1.2-6.2 that is similarly long, this particular long haplotype has a variant that carries among other things, the hereditary hemochromotosis gene. If you have never heard of the disease, its pretty much Western European in origin. Oddly these two genes appear to be the principle 6p21 representative\u00A0 in a long history of coevolution (pre-Neolithic) in Western, NW and N Europe. There is some belief that 7-7-15 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Emight\u003C/span\u003E be derived from Neanderthals, its not clear, but the 15 component is the major genetic risk factor in MS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs we can imagine humans coming into to contact and mixing cultures and genes, now we have to imagine different archaic populations intermixing and sometimes exchanging culture and evolving new habits.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes those admixtures had beneficial traits and sometimes they were negatively selective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo one might think that as humans moved around and entered new environments that the cognitive traits were most important, immune genes will not knap out a stone tool or half the end of a stick. But as a matter of fact, the most important genes that allow humans to be successful as they travel and that adapt as people move are the immune genes and the population size in Africa allowed humans to carry out of Africa more of those advantageous genes. This creates a different perspective on what we should be looking at and looking for. Its not as romantic as the archaeology, but it gives a better sense as to the risk that humans are exposing themselves to. And since archaics carried regionally adaptive genes we can ask questions about what human drew from these hominids during there evolution, potentially enhancing there ability to travel further, higher, colder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that here are some papers that deal with Neanderthal and Denisovan genes more common in humans and what traits they effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I have to repeat I have no connection with these studies other than I used to publish on related materials in the field. And I have published on a collection of about 50 genes, 3 of the genes that I have published on fortuitously appear in the list (Obviously immune function genes).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751057/pdf/evx216.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751057/pdf/evx216.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://omim.org/entry/601268?search=CCR3\u0026amp;highlight=ccr3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECCR3\u003C/a\u003E is an immune gene and is involved in T-helper cell Immune cell interaction.

There\u0027s nothing here really that makes you look more like a Neanderthal (despite half century belief amount anthropologist that it did). If we look at the list above, about half of the genes that were selective in some population after admixture are immune function genes, 3 of the loci are commonly associated with inflammatory diseases in humans. However in addition to the positive benefits of admixture I also have to point out that there were negative benefits. One of the papers I reviewed during the last week essentially shows that the more likely a Neanderthal marker was close to a gene, the more rapidly that the marker is eliminated from the population. I will try to find the reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that there are some remaining questions, there are a handful of immune genes in Asia that appear not to be of OoA origin, but are not defined by the current Neanderthal sequences or Denisovan. The are tightly pocketed enough is Asian that a scenario of local introgression might have occurred. In addition it is unlikely that a Denisovan in Siberia would carry the same immune genes as an individual living in Indonesia or points in between. So more aDNA sampling is desired in both the Neanderthal and Denisovan gene clusters. While most of the late introgression of \u0027archaics\u0027 into Africa are localized, these are still very important, particularly when introgressed genes are positively selective within holoAfrican context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will add to this some of my experiences with PA over the years and some of the critiques in the way the science was done that slowed things down, some of the things that made advances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-30T20:21:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat care must be taken when working with ancient DNA.

That\u0027s not actually the chronology. In 1997 krings et al published the HVR1 regions (partially truncated). I was there then, I had analyzed the sequence practically before the paper copy was published ( I was at the time doing mtDNA analysis on human HVR1 and actually I have a completely alligned list now of 50 or so mammalian mtDNA, it clocks the mdts between two sequences). It was a spectacular accomplishment, but as with any spectacular accomplishment there were flaws.

You take it for granted now that we are talking about exit times from Africa in the 60 to 80 ky period, the first mitochondrial genome was radical proposing exit times of 52.5 kya \u002B/- 29 ky. While eventually the MREH crowd would lose the arguments magnitude, as with the argument surrounding Homo floresiensis (Flores hobbit; another battle that played out in the Journals) that effort regarding LM3 really pushed at the door of these incredibly late dates for human occupation in Asia and Oceania.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou like to look at things like someone forced Paabo to accept regional contribution, that was not problem. The MPI crowd had their problem; MCRE receptor debacle is one example where they made liberal assumptions about the dating, later proven to be wrong. People representing molecular studies were complaining about the blind usage of outdated calibration. But the bigger story was the demise of MREH its extreme form, along with some of the crazy bigoted ideas that went along with it.\u00A0 I think from the point of view of what happened was the MREH crowd was, based on the anthropology that they had, were way to overzealous in their interpretation of regional variation, as a consequence a fair amount of backlash was created. Any objective outside viewer, could, applying just scientific principles would have realized they were way out on a limb. The writing was on the wall, and those with proper foresight would have been backing of into the \u0027maybe 10%\u0027 contribution range. Stringer took them on in his way. They needed absolute and convincing proof, because so much see-rap was being flung around.

Statistically the results of the Felhofer dating has a problem which I can state as this. Great\u00A0 statististics confidence is the inverse crossproduct of all independent sources of variation. But what the paper publish is the intrinsic source of variation. It makes no effort to describe extrinsic source of variation. For the physics folks here dP*dx= h/2pi is variation in that is intrinsic to nature, but poor experimental set up, faulty devices are extrinsic to the nature. The assumption you make in producing a \u002B/- range as the published in the paper is that you have eliminated all extrinsic sources . . .but this is not true. Neither did they set up an experiment to test the possibility of extrensic variation or provided a result. For example, falling down the face of a rise and being crushed by various forces is a source of extrinsic variation. This is a huge problem in archeaology, although they have sought to improve the techniques over the last few decades, anyone who understands both the chemistry and the statistics can see the problem rapidly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a dating before 40 kya requires you to get alot of things (as in everything) right, not just the instrument needs to be modern, but the samples need to be treated to remove the potential of all extraneous sources of \u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003EC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223283909\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517579532\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Baron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Green Baron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nou may do so, but do not put words in peoples mouth that they have not said.

But when the Vidijna cave sequences came in and we could see how close these were together, one has to accept it as a point. I doubt everything that MPI produces, because they have a track record of small errors, but in general those errors are corrected in a couple of years. In archaeology errors might not be corrected in decades. Thats not intended to be an insult its just a recognition that it lacks an objective basis for critique. Within weeks of the original Neandertal genome you had people including myself scouring the sequence looking for flaws, and within months the flaws were found and reported and MPI had to respond and modify their work in response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T21:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223284235\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517607295\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo it cannot, with modern technology like AMS it can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, what ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course Felhofer I is of a higher class than Piltdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a defamation ?
