First, as expected, you select the option to make a new anchor point and click a part to make that the anchor point. Simple. But then to get back to adding parts, you need to unselect the anchor option, then click on the color pallet button, and the select a new part to place. All that just to get out of the \u0022select a new anchor point\u0022 function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
