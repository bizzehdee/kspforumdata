I\u0027m kind of murky on how relays affect signal strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of now, I\u0027ve only unlocked the RA-2, which will sometimes reach Duna but sometimes won\u0027t. I figured I could get around this by attaching 5 RA-2\u0027s to my satellite, thereby giving me the signal strength to connect to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E always (~40 Gm). But what if my line of sight to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is blocked - say it\u0027s on the opposite side of the planet from me. I have comsats around kerbin to avoid this issue, but does my probe have enough juice to connect to another RA-2 at Kerbin? If the range between the two satellites is calculated the same as that between a satellite and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, then it seems I\u0027d actually need something like 50 RA-2s on EACH satellite to guarantee the signal can travel the maximum distance between Kerbin and Duna, which isn\u0027t particularly feasible. I could, of course, wait to unlock the next tier antenna, but if I\u0027m doing the calculations right then I\u0027ll still need 4 of those on each satellite if I want to cover the extreme case. This is doable, but it requires my satellites to be much beefier than I\u0027ve been making them. On the wiki, it says the RA-15 will always reach Duna, but after accounting for the fact that you may not have LOS to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, do you need more power to meet this requirement?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: Does every hop in the communications network have to be close enough such that the two antennas in the hop can communicate with each other independently of what\u0027s going on in every other hop, or does a relay\u0027s proximity to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E somehow boost its power? If going through a relay to reach \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E does that relay also have to have the power to perform the next hop on its own?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-09T13:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn default commnet mode, Kerbin has ground transmission stations all around the planet.

That\u0027s how it works IRL, and in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you turn off the groundstations, then you need to provide a string of relays between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and Duna where every relay has the range to communicate with the next relay. And with 2 RA-2\u0027s on each sat, that basically means that they can\u0027t be more than 3.5 Gm apart. (Or a bit further if you use five.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you just include a pilot in your craft, then you do not need continuous signal back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to do anything. Or even if you want to do this as a robotic probe, you can control enough robotic functions to complete\u00A0(for example) a satellite contract -- unless you decided to be a masochist and you also clicked the \u0022no control without signal\u0022 button in the game settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wovejulio","CreatedById":158777,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-09T20:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
