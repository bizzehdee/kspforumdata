The main body of the ship carries the lander capsule down near the surface, and then just before it crashes, it pops off a small capsule that plops onto the ground. In the case of the Ranger capsule, it was surrounded by a shell of balsa wood to help absorb the impact force. None of these early Rangers were ever successful, and the Ranger probe was shifted to being a simple impact probe, taking pictures all the way down, because it was felt that it wasn\u0027t worth the effort to make a hard landing when the \u0022soft landing\u0022 Surveyor was coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Ranger 4. The round object on top is the hard-landing package inside the balsa shell that lands after a retro rocket fires to suicide burn...hopefully slow enough for the capsule part to survive.
