The ship would leave kerbin unmanned and controlled by a probe (nice mission you need to plan if you are using RemoteTech). Kerbals would be born on the vessel and grow up under a computer nurse. Consumption of oxygen, food, ... would only start after a year or so and would very slowly increase as Kerbals grow to full size. Being taught only what they need to know, they would be ready to control the ship before reaching adulthood. This wouldn\u0027t avoid the need for 99% recycling, or sleep chambers, but it could be implemented before them (since I believe this is easier to mod). Colonies would be very easy to start with this idea, since you can bring an army of kerbals with only one trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would take very little modding to get this done, since you only need to make the kerbals appear on the vessel after a given time (when they are able to command the vessel themselves). Consumption of resources would start beforehand but in tiny proportions and would increase past the time they assume control of the vessel, to the standard consumption amount of an adult kerbal a few years later. Taking into consideration the scaled down kerbin system (days are also 4x shorter) and relative intelligence and comprehension of spacecrafts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E they could grow and learn the basics to assume control of ship in very short time (little more than 4 years maybe?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not that interested in the idea, but I think it might interest a few here for their solar-system grand tour, or deep space exploration, or simply far off planet colonization.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T09:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aknar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aknar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA gruesome thought to be honest ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catullus","CreatedById":51486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T10:23:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to convert waste using one of these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aknar","CreatedById":68073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T11:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA gruesome thought to be honest ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes of course... We are talking about sending individuals to other planets that are inaccessible because of the time it takes to sent a craft all the way over there. Freezing someone has not proven to be more than science fiction although we now have the technology to make ex-virto babies and nurse robots (even if it needs quiet a few years to make them truly functional...). \u0022There are no \u003Cem\u003Eage\u003C/em\u003E restrictions for the NASA \u003Cem\u003EAstronaut\u003C/em\u003E Corps. \u003Cem\u003EAstronaut\u003C/em\u003E candidates have ranged between the \u003Cem\u003Eages\u003C/em\u003E of 26 and 46, with the average \u003Cem\u003Eage\u003C/em\u003E being 34\u0022. The lifespan of a human is too short for these missions and he can\u0027t freeze his aging by any means. It\u0027s safe to assume that a kerbals have a short life span (with all the explosions and all ^^), and the whole thing is a sized down version of our world, (with a certain number of alterations i must admit) Going further than mars or duna, would probably mean the astronaut in question would be retired by the time he gets to that planet and wouldn\u0027t have enough time to go back. Living his whole life in a vessel is not very human either... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just looking at this from a scientific standing point but I won\u0027t argue with the inhumanity of this idea.

Man going any further than their moon is a huge waste of resources for very little scientific advance, and will lead to considering such ideas and aberrations like trying to colonize mars (with no way back, not that the colony would actually last that long).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to sum up: Yes you are absolutely right, I\u0027d just extend that statement to other ideas floating around this thread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-06T11:32:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2013 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Aknar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T13:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aknar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aknar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a sentient being makes the voluntary decision to go on a oneway trip, living the largest part of his lifetime in a spacecraft and enduring the (due to technological constraints most likely inevitable) effects of living in a zero-to-low-g environment, facing unpredictable dangers without any prospect of outside help ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to designate individuals that are not even born yet for such an endeavour, ignoring their right to a self determined life and free will, letting them be raised by robots and sentencing them to life on another planet ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot even close to being the same thing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the argument were that the robots are really intelligent and empathic, then response would be, why not send them without biological crew members?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only exemption would be a voyage to an inhabitable planet to safe the species from extinction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo hard feelings though, the idea just broke my heart. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T14:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aknar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aknar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFreezing someone has not proven to be more than science fiction\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue... well, freezing is easy, it\u0027s just unfreezing and keeping them alive that\u0027s tricky. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E However cryonics is not the only way to preserve life during such a long trip. There is the old favorite of generation starships. Make \u0027em REAL big and live on them. Then you do have kids. True, radiation needs to be dealt with much more than conventional vessels if you live your whole life on a ship, but it\u0027s doable. Another method is hibernation. Don\u0027t freeze someone, but instead put them in a forced coma and slow down the metabolism to a crawl. Still science fiction but so far slightly more believable than cryonics where we still don\u0027t have a method to avoid the tiny blood vessels in the brain from being damaged by water\u0027s phase transition expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-06T14:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2013 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
