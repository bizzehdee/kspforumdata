Sure, they\u0027re functional enough, they avoid pancake designs, they\u0027re somewhat believable, and they fly well with both FAR and Deadly reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, they all look more or less like a stack of orange tanks, with Kerodyne tanks as boosters. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve made this design at least once, and is therefore aware of what i\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, meh.... time to change it up a bit, and the Donut tank certainly looks good, and can be used to make at least my landers more appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, apart from the visual pleasure it provides, why would i use them?

If you\u0027re missing a delta-v target by a small amount, adding a round8 can help you hit that target while not committing to a full extra T100 (or similar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust be aware that it has a rather high dry mass for the fuel it does carry (2.5 round8s have the same dry mass as a T100; the round8s have poor fuel fractions)...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
