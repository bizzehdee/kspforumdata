When my goal is to get to a moon immediately upon entry into the system (as opposed to starting from orbit around the main planet), what I do is aerobrake at the main planet in such a way that I get captured into an elliptical orbit whose apoapsis is out in the general vicinity of the target moon (and as close to the same orbital plane as possible). I set this up shortly after entering the main planet\u0027s SOI by tweaking my periapsis at it, when this hardly takes any fuel. Anyway, after the aerobraking, I coast out to my new apoapsis and burn to circularize out there, which again is pretty cheap on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now my ship is orbiting the main planet as if it was one of its moons. Then it\u0027s just a matter of a short wait for the proper phasing angle to make a transfer burn from my ship\u0027s orbit to the moon\u0027s orbit. You\u0027re looking for about the same angles you\u0027d use if on Kerbin to launch for Duna or Eve, or setting up a rendezvous for docking, depending on whether your ship\u0027s inside or outside the target moon\u0027s orbit and by how much. This usually doesn\u0027t take much fuel, either. Anyway, now you\u0027re on an intercept course with the target moon and after that it\u0027s just a matter of getting captured there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main complication of getting to Pol is that if you want to use Jool itself to your advantage, you have to cross the orbits of all the other moons twice, once going in and then again on the way back out. Thus, depending on the luck of the draw, you could get encounters with 1 or more of the other moons on either side of the aerobraking, which might help or hurt. So, that might entail some more fiddling with your trajectory. Just note that your predicted path only takes gravity into account, not aerobraking and the velocity change that entails. So, before you actually do the aerobraking, understand that none of the encounters shown afterwards will really happen because you\u0027ll be going slower when you get there. But OTOH, what looks at first like a clear path out from Jool could also end up with extraneous encounters after aerobraking, so you have to be on your toes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll good fun. But if you\u0027ve got the fuel, you might instead want to incline your approach to Jool so you go over/under all the other moons by enough to avoid all encounters. But then you have to make another plane change after Jool to get back on Pol\u0027s plain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
