For my example \u0027water ice in regolith on Duna/Mars\u0027 it looks like stock but with a \u0027modulation\u0027 by latitude. Ideally one would want to \u0027hook in\u0027/\u0027wrap with\u0027 a \u0027modulator\u0027 over whatever code object delivers \u0027resource abundance at lat/lon\u0027 - so the rest of the system would think it\u0027s using stock but it\u0027s using \u0027modulated stock\u0027. The alternatives look like either build a parallel infrastructure ( regolith redux \u002B scanning etc ) or hack a \u0027carbuncle\u0027 on the side (a \u0027magic\u0027 resource gatherer).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELocked by OP\u0027s request.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
