On Laythe, with its 20% lower gravity, they have plenty of thrust. If you wish to test the craft on Kerbin, try dumping ~1/3rd of one of the fuel tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen descending vertically on chutes, the plane is sensitive to the location of the COG to keep it level. If it lands too far off level, particularly in water, parts may break when the craft flattens out. Before doing a vertical landing, try to balance fuel between the tanks; the COG should be directly below the girder the chutes are mounted to. (You can find the COG in-flight by zooming in; the camera always centers on the COG.) In a pinch, cut away one of the bottom chutes - you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E still be able to land safely on 7 chutes, especially if you have less than a full load of fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVertical ascent is also sensitive to COG changes, though not as much, since it can correct with vectored thrust. Also, a moderate tendency to pitch up is not a problem, as the rockets are only on for a short period. Pitch down, however, should be strenuously avoided; the jet has more than enough thrust overcome the rockets\u0027 lift and force the craft into the ground given even a slight downward pitch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]If you run out of oxidizer, be sure to shut off the vertical jets. They will happily waste jet fuel at full speed while producing no flame or thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]As an alternative method of deploying the chutes, you can pop one or more of them above 500m, allowing you to use their semi-deployed drag to reduce airspeed even more before they deploy fully. However, this is far more complicated, since you have to synchronize things so you pass through 500m just as your speed hits minimum, as opposed to the method described above, where you can just watch your airspeed and pop the chute whenever you feel it is optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EActually, the \u003Cem\u003Ebest\u003C/em\u003E method would be to get as low and slow as possible, pitch up hard into a strait vertical climb, then pop all the chutes just after you hit peak and start falling backward. But you\u0027d have to pull a perfect vertical climb while gliding, make sure that you hit peak under 500m, and that you pop the chutes just \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E peak so they don\u0027t cut away when your speed zeroes.

However, it is at the same height, so it should still work with the standard Gas Station.
