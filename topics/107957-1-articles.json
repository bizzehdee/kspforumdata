[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v).\n\ndelta-v is a measurement. Most people don\u0027t use it to plan out their rockets, and instead just use it to tell if they need a bigger rocket (or more boosters). For example, if your rocket has 1000 m/s of delta-v, and you need about 5000 m/s of delta v to go where you want to go, you need a bigger rocket.\n\nDelta-v is also rather imprecise for a few specific things, such as docking, landing, very long burns, or moving through an atmosphere, as it is very hard to calculate out all the little errors and adjustments.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T20:44:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:33:16Z","Content":"I just got those after upgrading my facilities but I haven\u0027t used them yet.

You don\u0027t need any knowledge of what ln is, you just press the button on your calculator (but a very very general idea is that ln tells you how many digits a number has, except it\u0027s smoothed out so that it doesn\u0027t jump, and it\u0027s multiplied by a useful constant that makes it work in things like this). It adds up between stages, and it\u0027s not so much a miles per gallon (that\u0027s closer to Isp) as it is a miles before empty (though not a perfect analogy)\n\nHaving a mod is definitely helpful, I recommend KER, but it\u0027s not at all hard to do it with a pocket calculator, just not as instant. It can get a bit complicated when you have different types of engines firing at the same time, but still doesn\u0027t need any calculus. \n\nGoogling KSP Delta V map gives a lot of good pictures showing how much DV is needed for various trips. Most will have too high values for achieving orbit from atmospheric bodies (eg Kerbin) but will be accurate enough for anything without atmosphere, but you\u0027ll get some variance based on piloting (just like if you plan a 100mi trip, you might not make it on 100mi of gas if you take detours)"},{"CreatedByName":"cerberusti","CreatedById":89638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:26:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This may be totally incorrect, but I usually think of Delta V as something similar to miles per gallon.

If you have a big craft built from connecting multiple component together using docking ports (like an interplanetary craft), and you are in a pinch for more delta V, you can try ditching some non-essential component to increase it (like the science lab), as your mass is now smaller, the amount of dead mass that your fuel have to haul is lessen, and so you can get more change in velocity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T09:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:51:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Close, but remember, delta-V can change over time due to several factors, such as change in mass.

The more delta-V, the more distant destinations can be reached because greater changes in its trajectory are possible. It\u0027s important to understand that delta-V ignores the size of the vessel; a 2-ton probe and a 2,000-ton mothership with the same amount of delta-V can reach the exact same destinations. \n\nTo use a car analogy (which has some flaws but gives the general idea): Delta-V is like the \u0022distance until empty\u0022 readout that some cars have. It doesn\u0027t matter if the vehicle is a fuel sipping compact car or a huge fuel-guzzling semi truck, if they both show the same distance to empty they can reach the same destinations.\n\nSomeone already mentioned the [Rocket Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) used for calculating delta-V, so I\u0027ll just note the consequences of it:\n\nThere are four strategies to increase delta-V:\n\n1.
