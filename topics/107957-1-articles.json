I remember my amateur mistake of hauling a light rocket to intercept a class E asteroid, then realized that my 1000 delta V left on that light rocket only amount to single digit delta V when that asteroid mass is added. So plan accordingly!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the opposite: If you are (for example) carrying a lander docked to your main craft, once that lander is separated, the main craft will suddenly have a lot more delta-V for the return trip.

The more delta-V, the more distant destinations can be reached because greater changes in its trajectory are possible. It\u0027s important to understand that delta-V ignores the size of the vessel; a 2-ton probe and a 2,000-ton mothership with the same amount of delta-V can reach the exact same destinations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use a car analogy (which has some flaws but gives the general idea): Delta-V is like the \u0022distance until empty\u0022 readout that some cars have.
