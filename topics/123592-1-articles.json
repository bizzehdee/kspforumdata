Knowing that the planets of Kerbol are \u0022on rails\u0022, I understand that this means that they are immovable- 100,000 Mammoth engines with infinte fuel will not budge the tiniest moon from its track. Seeing that spent stages with sub-orbital trajectories persist until you \u0022ride\u0022 them through enough atmospheric drag to cause them to terminate, I also concluded this applies to probes/ships that you were not \u0022actively\u0022 piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after 4 1/2 years of my (1.02) game, I noticed that my two earliest satellites which had been on highly elliptical, beginners-error trajectories, had been ejected just recently from the Kerbin SOI by Mun. So, my question is, what physics *are* applied to \u0022stagnant\u0022 probes/vessels? Did these two satellites eject because I had just happened to be near them with something else, and so the game \u0022noticed\u0022 them, or does gravity always apply to all vessels? Which, if so, begs the question of why atmospheric drag would be excluded from this application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T04:04:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GarrisonChisholm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T03:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, gravity always aplies to all veesels, even those that are on rails.

So orbits are still dependent on the SOI, and orbits that encounter another body\u0027s SOIs (such as a moon) will stilll be effected.
