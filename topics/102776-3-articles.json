Also idk if it is this mod or not but my save is no longer saving flights in progress every time I restart ksp my probes and space stations are gone, so I have to launch them again.\n\nI\u0027ve got a similar problem to this. I noticed last night when I was trying this out (absolutely love what you\u0027ve done with this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) that my ships were no longer in orbit around Kerbin. But they hadn\u0027t disappeared, and had in fact somehow left Kerbins SOI. It seems that craft that were prograde with respect to Kerbins direction of travel had been ejected into a higher orbit in the Kerbol system, and vice versa.

Think it could be something to do with how the game loads the planets. I launched a series of ships at set intervals with hyperedit into kerbins orbit, and the only one ship was there upon reloading the game, the one that was at a 6700km orbit (edge of the soi). It seems that all the ships get loading in around sonnah instead of kerbin and the surviving ship was the only one outside of sonnah\u0027s atmosphere. I\u0027ll have to think of something tomorrow as i reeeeaaally need to sleep now (my curiosity got the better of me and i had to test!).\n\nI might have to move Kerbin back into it\u0027s own orbit ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nShould it come to it, and theres no other way of fixing it, what do you think I should do with Sonnah, should i move it elsewhere (say...to laythe?) or should i completely get rid of it? hmmm decisions...."},{"CreatedByName":"Chimer4","CreatedById":58864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T22:08:41Z","Content":"Ok, so since updating new horizons to the latest version I can\u0027t seem to replicate the problem.

But whatever is causing it, I would still really like Kerbin to stay around Sonnah. It adds such a twist to the game that I love rather than having the same old Kerbin, Mun, Minmus system. \n\nAlso a couple of other things I wanted to ask.

PlanetFactory had a system with a barycenter that was a super small moon with insanly huge gravity to act as the anchor., so yeah there are multiple ways to do it!\n\nHaha yeah Eve didn\u0027t recieve much love in my pack, i felt a little bad so i did give it a nice ring! Yeah that\u0027d be a good idea, ill have to have a look in the morning at decent positions for his pack to integrate into mine.\n\nActual comets are a little tricky, but very possible, you just need to be able to muck around with the particle effects.
