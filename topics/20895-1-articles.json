Hopefully you\u0027ll be able to use the interplantary stage to start your deorbit burn so it crashes into duna so you could mount the lasers on the interplanetary stage. Your only debris would be in orbit around kerbin so wouldn\u0027t require much fuel to rendezvous with on a future mission though. Parachutes do retain their full weight even after use so I\u0027ve lately taken to mounting them on top of stack decouplers and putting sepratrons on the decouplers so I can fire them off after landing giving me less to haul back up to orbit (they work on radial decouplers too, but they\u0027re weaker/more weight).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"snow25699","CreatedById":42436,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T14:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI flew the rock yesterday with the modifications you suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to change the booster symmetry to 8, and I changed the 400l tank to 1600l tank above the nuclear rocket, and added parachutes with decouplers.
