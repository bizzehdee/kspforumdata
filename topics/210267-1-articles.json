I wait impatiently when Sun grows to red giant and blows all atmosphere away. As a bonus, we will be liberated from terror of winters too. Then we can happily see all interesting things on night sky in comfort warm conditions.\u00A0 Unfortunately, I can see a mild problem. There will not be total solar eclipses anymore at those times because Sun\u0027s angular diameter will increase significantly but Moon\u0027s angular diameter will decrease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
