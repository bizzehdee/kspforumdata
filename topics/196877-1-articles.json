This is something that in real life would be trivial. You design the plane. Then you design landing gear to fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what about giving the current LY series landing gear the ability to move up and down to give it some real world abilities. Then you can have optimal landing and other gear positions for cargo and variable takeoff and landing positions without the need to add more parts. And in particular it would need the ability to change the gear positions in flight. Just like with the telescopic hydraulic cylinders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this addition I could easily set my landing gear to super stable runway positions and both upward and downward facing positions for getting cargo out the front and back while also providing the option of upward and downward facing landings/takeoffs. It would allow for optimal performance at the push of a button. Especially for large craft like this where it is impossible to get both with just normal landing gear positions. The versatility is needed after a certain size or complexity is reached for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe physical distance could fit the actual hydraulics realistically. And both straight up and down hydraulics could exist and the part that adjust to go into the wheel base. This could also be adjustable, but at a cost to strength of the part under weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a game balance standpoint the adjustments could be an upgrade. Maybe it can be turned off or changes like visuals for fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-13T00:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2020 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EveMaster","CreatedById":199588,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-22T16:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right, adjustable landing gear would be a great thing. You could try to build them with robotic parts, with hydraulic pistons or with z-shaped hinges. If you try this you should disable wheel autostrut, because autostrut and robotic parts don\u0027t go well together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022145504\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5710704344\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/146806-how-to-disable-wheel-autostrut/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2735579\u0026amp;embedComment=2735579\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:359px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively I suggest to go with multiple sets of landing gear. For a 1kiloton plane you need a smaller front landing gear setup for maneuverability at low speed and a larger one for takeoff and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor docking you can make small adjustment in height by tuning the spring settings in game.
