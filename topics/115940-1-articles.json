There might be a few minor details here and there to smooth out, but for the most part, the wheel system revision is done.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This week I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been focusing on something that, while definitely not something you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d see on the player side, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nonetheless crucial for us to be able to keep working on the project. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve started to plan and set up the necessary tools to move all of the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s code (or as much of it as we can) into pre-compiled assembly files.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not into coding, an assembly is a .dll file, which is built in Visual Studio, and imported into Unity as an asset containing code components. These are then attached to objects in the game. Normally, each code file is a single asset in Unity, which Unity compiles whenever scripts are modified, and each code file is linked to game objects. DLL files are very similar, except that they are already a pre-compiled group of code files. That means for DLL files, we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to wait for Unity to compile every script in the project every time we make a change to any of them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Currently, the time to compile the main game project is about 1 or 2 minutes, more or less. This may not seem like much at first, but consider that this is a process which we have to repeat dozens, maybe even hundreds of times a day. Those few minutes of waiting, that many times a day, translate to many hours of lost productivity over a longer period.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; But perhaps more importantly than that, there is a weird phenomenon that happens when there is a significant time penalty between committing to an attempt, and seeing the results of it. Many a time I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found myself stuck working against an issue that should have been simple, but which for some reason persists in not being fixed. This I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found can happen sometimes because of long compile times. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Imagine that to fix this \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153simple\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 issue, the proper way to go would be to add a few lines of test code, so you can see in more detail what your stuff is doing when the bug happens. That means that before I can try to actually deploy a fix, I know in advance that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to write my test code, wait for the project to compile and run, just so I can see the extra info, then use that to fix the problem, then compile again to verify that it worked, then remove the test code, and compile yet again to finish it off. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a minimum of three compile-and-test cycles I know I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to wait through, just to fix a seemingly simple issue. Instead then, what usually happens is that we attempt to fix the issue blind, in the hopes of fixing it with just a single compile. Sometimes that actually works, but in the case I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m describing here, of a deceptively tricky issue, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very possible to get yourself stuck in a loop, where you eventually end up wasting more time trying to do the blind fix than if you had taken the time to do it properly. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is just one example of how a long compile time can affect development in a bigger way than just the extra time it takes. The bottom line is, working on a slow project is frustrating at best, infuriating at worst, so if we can shave off even a few seconds of that time, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s already a big boost to our workflow. Especially if you consider that we have a lot of features we want to add still, working on a sluggish project simply won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, this has been the focus of this week for me. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve already set up templates to create assembly projects, into which we can offload our code, and those work. However, I hit upon another issue, where Unity will lose the references to all scripts which are moved outside of the Unity editor. This was a much more serious problem. It means that any piece of code we move to a dll would have to be manually replaced on every object that uses it in the project. Considering that we have over 8000 script linkages in there, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not something you want to do by hand. Instead then, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on a tool that will help keep track and restore those broken links after we move the files. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s taken a couple of days to get it working, but it will save us an eternity of tedious scrounging through project files, trying to remember how we had everything set up. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been my week so far. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Last week was finally the release of KerbalEdu 1.0.4 , now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m the one on the Squad site who takes care of that.
