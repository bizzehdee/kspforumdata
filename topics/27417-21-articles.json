I\u0027ve got a pretty demanding job but got really ill recently, recovered a week ago, and now I\u0027ve just got offered a trip abroad that I just can\u0027t say no to, and I\u0027ve got enough holiday entitlement from work to take, but I\u0027m gonna have to really work hard at it to make it worth the while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo indeed I\u0027m still gonna be dead for quite some time.

Sometime down the line I think I will consider giving up my mods to someone else entirely. I\u0027m not at that phase yet where I want to say this for sure though, but I think it isn\u0027t long away. I don\u0027t have much interest in making the parts career compatible, but I don\u0027t mind if a CFG replacement is made for doing that. When I get some free time I\u0027ll repack and reupload some mods with the new structure so thats easier to do. Since really I dont think the modder can so easily black and white when things should be available, career is a bit weird with mods like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KirbyHCI","CreatedById":55864,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T03:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and all that with the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wheels pack is probably one of my most used mods on KSP, with me and the friends who play it on my PC. Everything from Intercontinental Ballistic Mining Trucks to offroad all-terrain monsters and tiny little jeeps have graced Kerbin (Although we haven\u0027t really done much off-world, it\u0027s far too fun just driving and crashing trucks and occasionally flying planes on Kerbin) though I have a question; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I find the car wheels don\u0027t work very well. Or at least, the suspension doesn\u0027t work as well as the truck wheels. I was attempting to do a personal modification of the pack with car-sized truck wheels to replace on some of my smaller jeep-like vehicles but I take it it\u0027s not as simple as rescale and scale adjustments as there\u0027s a few little annoyances of the wheels going farther down on the suspension than they should when uncompressed, and float a few inches up when on the floor/compressed. Other than that, they seem to work OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat something that I can fix my end for the personal tweak, or would that be more on the model side and thus not really doable easily?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T03:40:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 03:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KirbyHCI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T16:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah its something you can fix yourself. Theres a value in the CFG \u0022contactDisplace\u0022 Which is a tuning value for the height of the graphical wheel. Unity Wheels aren\u0027t wheels you see, they\u0027re sticks. And you make a wheel model follow a stick, but for some reason its not entirely accurate for me (probably something I did who knows) Anyway, it means if you rescale the wheel just tweak this value until it looks right.

First and foremost, I have to say I love the wheels! Driving around Kerbin is awesome, and these wheels make that so much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst idea I had was that I wish there were some double or triple thick wheels on the little wheel frame, for making proper hot rods. Maybe a set of thinner little wheels as well, or just a set in a different tire size, like you would use on an off-road truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond basic idea that came to mind was to make another cab, this time car-styled so we could have a good IVA rover that fits the style of the awesome car wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird was the idea of making V segments of the engines. That way one could make inline, flat, or V engines. Preferably in 2 cylinder packs instead of 4, I think, would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to say, the Modular Multiwheels are by far my favorite wheel mod, and I use the MK3 cabin as well. And the MK3 IVA view. So many things that make my KSP experience much better.
