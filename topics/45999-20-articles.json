Then when I launch it, or reload the ship after pressing the load and ship key, the paint disappears again, WTH, what\u0027s going on here? I\u0027m tired of painting and repainting the ship. Is there a problem with the mod or an interference with another mod? I\u0027m trying to build a Gundam here, but KerbPaint is failing on me, and I REALLY want the gundam to have color.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a known and long-standing bug related to KSP\u0027s dodgy symmetry function, similar to how action groups tend to disappear on parts placed with symmetry if they\u0027re moved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust hover your mouse over each part of the ship and hit P; if the bug is taking effect, the colour will disappear when you do that.

Due to the nature of how the shader is applied and the manner in which the models are rendered, when I made the mask cover the black edges, the result was a muted colour change. It did not magically recolour the black. As a result, I found the most aesthetically pleasing option was to create a mask that left these areas as they were.
