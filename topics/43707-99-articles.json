The commands will do something, but if I understand you correctly, they will do something completely different than what you want. Be mindful of using abbreviations for variable names that might already mean something else. Unfortunately, arrays are not yet implemented at the moment. However, there is a log function that allows you to write to a logfile. This includes the possibility of writing program code that can be executed later. If you do this in a smart way, you will be able to build a logfile that contains the height data in a usable manner so it can be used later. This also allows you to use a large amount of variable names, as opposed to having to hard code a limited number of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have suggested building seperate laser rangers for kOS in another topic, but if those ever come to be they are a long way off.

There is exactly 1 thing ONLY it shares with C\u002B\u002B and that\u0027s the curly braces. That\u0027s IT. Nothing else looks anything remotely like C\u002B\u002B. To claim it looks like C\u002B\u002B is to reduce C\u002B\u002B down to one single teeny tiny aspect of the language and ignore everything else about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously but, this was built on a dream of easy syntax for noobs.

The entire syntax and setup is designed with first timers in mind. It would be a bit foolish to remove some of the things that are technically considered less than ideal but should not be a major hassle if you know what you are doing (like globals), but keep major features like the English-like syntax. You will end up with a very strange mismatched set of implementations of several contrasting ideas.\u003Cp\u003EIt is also not very practical to (possibly) have two similar languages with partially shared syntax, yet that are not compatible. Something like that is just asking for trouble and confusion. Not to mention the addition of even more forks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that if someone wants to make a kos-like mod starting from the existing code and forking it, but change so much about it that it is no loner recognizable as being the same basic language structure, that the proper way to do that would be to pick a brand new name for that project and call it a different mod entirely. Continuing to call it the same thing when it\u0027s totally different would lead to unnecessary confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
