I was building an asymmetric launch vehicle today and was trying to use this mod to keep fuel tanks above the engines balanced fuel wise (great in theory, it is the purpose of the mod) but I ran into the problem of rebalancing on the fly. Could you add the option to balance fuel levels in a stage, ie so that all engines are burning from an equal fuel stock. Example, you have a FL-800 tank with a mainsail underneath it You also have 4 rockomax 32s strapped the outside of it each with a mainsail underneath it. You want them to all burn out at the same time. Doable enough just balance the tanks and take off. the 5 mainsails burn and shutoff exactly at the same time, bravo. You have a stage above it that is precisely identical to this one. This time however you don\u0027t have the luxury of sitting on the pad clicking balance for all the tanks. Maybe a \u0022balance fuel for stage\u0022 button where the plugin tries to keep fuel levels the same in each stage. Thanks for the consideration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrouping. If you could assign these tanks to group one, those tanks to group two, group one would balance and group two would balance separate from each other so you do not have the headache of figuring out which of the many many tanks are this stage and which the next. if this could get saved in a little config file for the next time you loaded that would be a great combo of features..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T15:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found I can \u0022ground edit\u0022 resources on remote places like the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Erzengel","CreatedById":79923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T03:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this mod.
