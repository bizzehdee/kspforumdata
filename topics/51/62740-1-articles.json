It has just enough fuel for a skilled pilot to get it up to a stable low-Kerbin orbit of around 75KM, and enough RCS to easily maneuver about. The first flight up was picture-perfect, in fact. It was the trip back where things reached Jebediah levels of Kerbal... As it so happens, Jebediah was the pilot of the Damselfly. A brief transcript follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Mission control, flight complete. I\u0027m inbound now. ETA: 2 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Jeb, we\u0027ve noticed that you haven\u0027t dropped your speed enough. Please burn off another 25m/s immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: You worry too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Seriously, Jeb, you\u0027re going to overshoot KSC if you keep that trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Coming in hot, mission control! I can see you from here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Jeb, you\u0027re going to hit the ocean!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Negative, mission control. Adjusting my course now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Are you insane!? You\u0027re at a 75-degree tilt towards the ground! Jeb, pull up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Not on your life, Gene. I\u0027m overdue for a bath, but I\u0027d rather not take one going at mach 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: You\u0027re going to lose steering! Jeb, pull up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Now I\u0027ll pull up. Whoops, there goes the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Oh no, oh no! Eject!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Negative, mission control. Touching down now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: I can\u0027t watch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Mission control, this is Jebediah Kerman, reporting in. I have completed a successful landing, over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: You survived?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/damselfly_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022damselfly_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: It was cutting things a bit close, I\u0027ll admit. But I\u0027m home safe and sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Why do we ever let you pilot anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: Because I\u0027m the only one brave enough to get into your crazy contraptions. Mission complete. Could you send a recovery crew? I really don\u0027t wanna taxi this thing half a kilometer inland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: What did I do in a past life to deserve this torment?

I purposely chose the smaller-profile wings for Damselfly because I\u0027ve noticed that larger wings lead to much more dramatic loss of control upon re-entry.
