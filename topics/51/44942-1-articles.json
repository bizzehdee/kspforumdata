I also wanted to do something a bit different from just putting a lander or small rover on another body, so decided to run an entire space program around sending some colonists to Laythe, with an airship. Originally, the plan was to send a single vessel out there, then potentially fly it back (there\u0027s never a shortage of dV with Orion, just the minor issue of vessels being so heavy they are nigh-impossible to turn) to pick up more gear. Eventually, this morphed into developing a small fleet, and flying the whole lot out there in one transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hO3nk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
