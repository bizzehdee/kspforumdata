It is noted for the later Duna editions of Cerbarus that additional drills could be subsituted in place of having a refinary on every craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, someone miscounted, as you can see Decender IV has had to be left out of the link due to there being 2 pipe ends too few. Cerbarus Ic enroute is carrying (like Ib did) two ports of its own so linking it in will not be an issue when it arrives. The only concern now is the flow rates, whether we can physically pump enough methane in order to meet the transfer window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd thats it for this episode, not a great deal of time has passed in game, I am really trying to get as much done in as short a time as possible to meet this transfer window. Next episode is likely to be around the end of May, and should include the first few of the 6 (maybe 7) launches required to assemble the Charon Duna ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
