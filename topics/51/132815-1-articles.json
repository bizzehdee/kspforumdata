I\u0027ll post a few pics, those craft all work pretty well, but i feel i tend to built way to heavy and expensive, so any input is welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gotta be said that when i restarted the game for this career, i went into \u0022mods mode\u0022. I played mostly vanilla except for engineer and alarm clock before, and decided to make an install for a moded game. not all i use i find so useful, and maybe there is jewels yet undiscovered in the enormous mod list offered for this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a list of what i use at the moment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nToolbar\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBDarmory (that one only use is creating interest for the game with my son)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nChatterer\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDocking port aligment\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKAS\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEngineer\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal joint reinforcment\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKIS\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKopernicus\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKWRocketry\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMagic smoke industries\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear futur everything\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTAClife support\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlarm Clock\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTweakscale (that one feels like cheating to me lol)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUbiowelding (Kinda limited, but i think it\u0027s useful to create big structural part that are just 1 part on your count)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very unused to modding games, and only started this career a few days ago, so here again any comments are more than welcome, maybe some thing in there should not be together for one reason or another, lol.

That design is symptomatic of my too big tendency. It do it\u0027s job pretty well, but i really think i could do much more work out of the same amount of fuel. The goal was to obtain a large landing \u0022pad\u0022 that would be stable, this thing can land on pretty steep slopes if i keep pushing down with the RCS. But no EVA in those condition, as i need to keep controlling the vessel or it quickly tip over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022288\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Am5lRs0.png\u0022 width=\u0022513\u0022 alt=\u0022Am5lRs0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond is my first (in this career) Mun station. I normally try to go to Minmus first, but the contract was lucrative. I present you the Munchurian Laboratory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022610\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H4Bid1Q.png\u0022 width=\u00221085\u0022 alt=\u0022H4Bid1Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big module is a temporary addition to house the 12 kerbals the contract was asking for, i suspect it to be the reason why my station is always rotating on it\u0027s longitudinal axis, making docking a pain. It\u0027ll stay there till i got enough experiment to bring back to Kerbin, never to be seen again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as design is concerned, i normally wait further along the tech tree to built stations, so this on is kinda lacking in advanced part, simply cause i had no access to them at this precise point. Yet, my construction normally look a lot like this, just with better all around parts. Yet, those big caseless solar panel looks kinda nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust for the fun of it, here is Caldrun Kerman on a space walk around the Munchurian Lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SMcfNaU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SMcfNaU.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look forward your comments on my little space program \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
