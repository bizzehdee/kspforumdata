Issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to try gliding back to KSC. Getting down to a half-decent flying altitude, I noted a problem- we were halfway across an ocean. More issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I spotted an island to the North and made of rit, figuring I could land. about halfway there, I realized it wouldn\u0027t be close enough an decided to try for water landing. Shedding speed and altitude, I dropped low enough to lose one set of wings (triplane) and the engine, along with 2 landing gear. Oh...kay. This..might be an issue. Might.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I gained a bit of altitude (infiniglide, maybe?) and kept heading north. getting close, I dropped the nose gear and pulled up. both cockpits survived, as did Bill.
