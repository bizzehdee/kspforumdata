In mere decades they went from rickety pods held together with spit and tape to huge space stations and interplanetary spaceships, from cheap solid rockets and inefficient, unreliable liquid-fuelled engines to the ludicrously high ISPs of electric, nuclear fission and fusion propulsion systems, from tiny probes that could be strapped to the back of a pickup truck to gigantic interstellar vessels longer than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway assembled in orbital shipyards that could have held the entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E inside their structures, ground and all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next few decades were a waiting game as those first interstellar probes hurtled across the cosmos at up to 15% of light speed, crossing the unfathomably vast expanse of the space between star systems to discover what lay at the other end. Kerbol system was colonised in a big way with populations building up on Duna, Laythe, Eve, even Tylo. Technological advances made in these intervening years made possible the next grand phase of Kerbalkind\u0027s expansion beyond its home system: interstellar colonisation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reports started trickling back from those early probes. Dozens of star systems from four to fourteen light-years away were investigated and many found to have worlds that looked conducive to life, with a few showing indications that life may already exist. The colossal interstellar ships sent out to begin the long process of colonisation and terraformation could have impaled Gilly with several kilometres of spacecraft sticking out at each end, their engines so large that the ignition lasers had to be carefully tuned to take the speed of light delay into consideration when they fired so as to strike each car-sized pellet of fuel at exactly the same time, every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEleven targets were chosen in all, each given its own Colonisation Task Force. Those working in Task Force Nine were focussed on the star Ciro which- almost unbelievably- had\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0potential targets for colonisation. The fourth planet, assigned the name Gael by the automated planetary name generator, was similar in size to Kerbin, almost a perfect twin in fact, while the fifth planet Tellumo was significantly larger with a much thicker atmosphere and nearly double the surface gravity- in both cases exceeding Eve! Perhaps unsurprisingly Gael was chosen unanimously. At some point, Colonisation Task Force Nine became known as Gael Force Nine, a play on an old way of measuring wind speeds where a gale force wind was nine on the scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first automated vessels departed for Gael about a decade before the initial colonisation crew, giving time to set up all the necessary equipment before the crew arrived to deploy the big terraforming systems. A century of cryo-sleep later the crew arrived and discovered that their new home had a breathable atmosphere and the automated systems had already begun releasing spores and seeds across the land and oceans to kick-start the planetary ecosystems. They worked for another decade, building up a whole city to await the arrival of the main colony ship carrying half a million new inhabitants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it never came.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYears passed, the new Gaelans\u0027 hopes fading all the while, until their ship\u0027s long-range scanners detected a massive object approaching at a significant fraction of light speed. They watched as it approached, joy turning to alarm as it made no effort to slow down, then disbelief and horror as the huge colony ship bombed straight through Ciro system without stopping and kept on going. Radio hails went unanswered and telescopes couldn\u0027t focus on an object moving that fast, but from what data they could gather it was clear that the colony ship\u0027s propulsion section was badly damaged, or possibly missing entirely. The population on Gael could do nothing but watch as the crippled ship receded from view, vanishing into the cold void of deep space forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGael Force Nine found themselves on a planet that was perfectly habitable and would comfortably support a population of several million Kerbals indefinitely, but with mere thousands of Kerbals to populate it with. Kerbol system was seventeen light years away and a huge cloud of dust and gas had moved in between the two stars. Ciro\u0027s companion star Grannus, a stone\u0027s throw away relatively speaking, hadn\u0027t been chosen for a colonisation mission as Ciro was a more viable option. Almost all the other stars chosen for colonisation missions were even further away than Kerbol and would be using their interstellar communications systems to talk to Kerbol, if at all- with round-trip delays best measured in generations there was no such thing as a quick reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGael Force Nine were totally alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe contingency plan prepared for exactly this scenario was activated: strip the ship of anything useful, deploy the gestation pods to start turning frozen embryos into the first true Gaelans, transition back to a level of technology nearly a millennium behind what they were used to and build back up once the population was stable and the planet\u0027s resources could be utilised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCenturies passed. Kerbin became a legend, a mythical land lost in time and space. Technologies were reinvented, key principles rediscovered and then one day a group of like-minded individuals got together for a traditional working lunch to discuss setting up a new venture. Gaelans loved to look up at the sky, see the planets and moons moving in their ceaseless dance, and dream of joining the dance themselves some day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome day had become today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was time for Gael Force Nine to once again reach for the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220tZ0iPF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0tZ0iPF.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-07T18:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224216572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211369\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221673109219\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220tZ0iPF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0tZ0iPF.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCosine Loss XII, you are cleared for takeoff\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove the story.

The origins of that term were lost in history, but if someone tended to act first and think second, jump headlong into something with an excess of enthusiasm to cover their total lack of other qualifications and generally blunder through dangerous situations miraculously unscathed with a massive grin plastered across their face, they were a Jeb- and Galileo was the Jebbest Jeb in all of Jebdom, bar none.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall wonder, then, that when the nascent Gaelan Space Centre put out a call for test pilots to be strapped into a rickety tin can and fired into the sky atop a barely controlled explosion, Galileo was first in the queue and first into said rickety tin can when the Test 1 craft was dragged out to the vaguely circular slab of concrete serving as a launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the most interesting feature of Test 1 was the lack of obvious rocket engines on the bottom- instead two pressure-fed monopropellant thrusters were built into the sides of a cylindrical tank strapped underneath the pilot\u0027s capsule. Gaelans were more cautious than their Kerbal ancestors, partly as a result of having such a small population to begin with, so this strange rocket system was in fact a prototype launch abort system that could hurl the crew away from a failing rocket and keep them save from the inevitable explosions that followed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch procedures were a carefully choreographed series of checks and double-checks to ensure that everything was in tip-top condition ahead of the launch, taking precisely two hours in total to complete.

The rocket\u0027s first stage was powered by a \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine, so-called because someone suggested they \u0027put it on a swivel\u0027 to get more control during the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227CMkSNu.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7CMkSNu.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch went perfectly, the Swivel performing exactly as planned and stage separation occurring without incident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227ZtDQT4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7ZtDQT4.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, a misread of a manual meant that the abort pack beneath the capsule was completely unsuitable for use as an upper stage- once activated, it would burn at full power until the fuel ran out.
