Someone back at Mission Control thought we could pick up some great science and hit the suspect Munlith locations at the same time.\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027ll take us days, if not weeks, to make it around the Mun! And doing it polar...Lucky we started near the dawn terminator!\u0022\n\n\u0022Mission Control sees it as a chance to test out this vessel design.\u0022\n\n\u0022I know Nedfield, I \\*am\\* an engineer, I helped design it! It\u0027s supposed to be a Moho support base, not a long duration rover. I can fix any tires we blow along the way, but...\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah, I know, we\u0027re going to have to be very careful, or else we\u0027ll keep getting Deja Vu!\u0022 (caused by excessive F5/F9 use!)\n\nAnd so, our intrepid explorers, Engineer 3rd Class Anlie Kerman, and Scientist 3rd Class Nedfield Kerman, set out on the first circumnavigation of any body. Pilot 3rd Class Merrey Kerman should have been here, but he was tasked with taking a Moho Rover clone to Minmus for some gravity scan contracts, and to test the balloon tires in low gravity. Luckily, Anlie\u0027s from a long line of car mechanics, practically born holding a wrench. We shall see how it turns out for our team!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u0022What do you mean, you forgot to put batteries in the camera Nedfield?\u0022\n\n\u0022Uhh, I thought they would have put them in back at KSC!\u0022\n\nOh well, looks like we lost some of our glamour shots of the start of our journey. Luckily Anlie decided to stop at a scenic overlook at the north end of the Mun Canyon for some pics.\n\nWernher managed to find an engineering photo of the Moho Support Base (same design as MUN GROUND BASE) lying on his desk.http://imgur.com/a/e4IxF#0\n\nThe southernmost flag below the waypoints is where this journey started. Our team is currently at the red marker. Our scientists estimate they\u0027ve gone about halfway to the northern Munlith, but should be hitting some new Biomes ahead, and really rough terrain.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
