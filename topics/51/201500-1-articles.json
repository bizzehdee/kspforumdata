Across that whole time, I\u0027ve only ever seen a small handful of people return kerbals from Jool\u0027s lower atmosphere, only a\u00A0portion of them returning from sea-level, and an even smaller portion of them doing it\u00A0without cheating (though I do consider excessive part-clipping cheating). However, a few months back, while thinking about those past sea-level missions, I realized a common trend across all of them: \u003Cem\u003Ethey all landed near Jool\u0027s equator\u003C/em\u003E! So, I laid before myself the following challenge: \u003Cstrong\u003Eget a kerbal within 1 degree of Jool\u0027s North Pole and to within 50m of the gas giant\u0027s\u00A0crush depth and return them to Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E. (Granted, I also performed the mission so I could claim I was the first person\u00A0to return from Jool\u0027s north pole, but my memory may be fuzzy and it may have been done in the past.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the\u00A0\u0022free-standing\u0022 mission album, no other context needed\u003Cspan\u003E:\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u00A0\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/grrPEQv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/grrPEQv\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of my time on this project was spent trying to work out the kinks in the Jool ascent vehicle, named the \u0022Jool Escape\u0022, seen below in descent mode. Namely, I don\u0027t have access to either DLC, so I built my own stock propeller, something I don\u0027t want to try again. Also,\u00A0I\u00A0tested\u00A0some ideas I\u0027ve had on the mothership, named the \u0022Jool Express\u0022 - notably, I used a prototype Mk2 shuttle\u00A0as a return vehicle and a relocatable heat shield to make aero-brakings more stable, both of which worked acceptably, though the shuttle can definitely be improved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221MnhOMt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1MnhOMt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIn the picture above, the Jool Escape descends below ~10km at Jool\u0027s North Pole, shortly before the Jebediah preps the ship for the ascent to orbit.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may elaborate on this mission in the future (and may also post a variant of it as a challenge in the challenge sub-forum), but I am willing to answer any questions you all may have.

As for the torque countering, the rotor was a separate craft to rotate freely, only contained by 2 stayputnik bearings inside the structural fuselage at the top. The 3 reaction wheels beneath it are connected to the actual rocket part of the Jool Escape and help counteract the forces from the rotor wobbling, with shamelessly extensive help from MechJeb, since it\u0027s far more precise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maria Sirona","CreatedById":210882,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-19T16:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis be \u00E4pic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
