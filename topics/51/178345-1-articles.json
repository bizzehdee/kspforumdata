We are all that is left of what used to be a flourishing society. We had huge cities, food for all, a planet-wide transportation network, and, most importantly, a Space Program. Then the asteroid came. Nobody saw it until it was too late. Three days. That\u2019s all the warning we got. Oh, there was a DSN, and deep space radar, in fact, it was analyzed in the same place it is now, at the bottom of K2 mountain complex. At least that\u2019s what they say. Three days away. There was none of the heroic stuff from the movies, rockets aren\u2019t built that quickly, and even if they were, there was no way to destroy or divert the asteroid, not with the technology that they had. They had gotten to orbit, landed on the Mun, Minmus, and even sent probes to Duna, but the technology to deflect an asteroid of that size was beyond them. In a way, it was amazing that they got that far, for in that time we still had many nation-states, with the Space Program only being supported by one. With no chance to stop it, we had to survive. The first thing Kerbalkind did was to unite together in a global government. Then we started to dig. We turned the mines of our ancestors into tunnels and connected them to the few bunkers built by people who had foreseen something like this. We built huge chambers to house our whole population. We built huge underground farms. We built skylights, to let in some natural light. We evacuated people out of the impact area. It\u2019s amazing what a whole species working together can do. We made ventilation shafts and sealed the tunnels. Then we waited. We didn\u2019t have to wait long. 1 hour after the last tunnel was sealed, the asteroid hit. The ground turned to fire and the sky to one black cloud. Over time our natural green color made to help us get energy from the sun, turned slightly darker as it got more efficient with the limited amount of sunlight. It\u2019s been ten years since that day. The ground is no longer fire, the atmosphere no longer bloats out Kerbol.

About 18 Kerbal years have passed since I was born. I volunteered to help with engineering work on the surface, specifically the rebuilding of the space center. Most of our top engineers are working on this, I\u2019m just a lowly engineering student with a passion for space. Before the asteroid(asteroid FF5-55A-PPA-SG-1, or Worldkiller) struck, I dreamed of being a kerbonaut. Now I doubt that\u2019ll happen. They\u2019re looking for kerbonauts, sure, but they want pre-Worldkiller pilots, not engineers. Anyways, the reason that most of our engineers are working on the space center is that shortly put: Our ancestors died because they didn\u0027t have a space program. And if we die because we don\u0027t have a space program, it\u0027ll serve us right! Larry Kerman said that I don\u2019t know who he is, but he sounds like a smart guy! The goal of the new space program is to make sure that what happened before doesn\u2019t happen again. I\u0027ve applied to work on the space center rebuild effort, and been accepted! I guess I\u0027m off to help rebuild the space center!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve arrived at the space center! It was totally leveled when I got there. Every building in ruins. Scouring around the remains of what used to be the tallest building, we found some plans for the space center. They said that that building used to be the Vehicle Assembly Building or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. They contained detailed plans on all the buildings, so we set to work repairing them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 months later.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI stood in the completed Spaceplane Hanger. It was an awe-inspiring site.\u00A0\u00A0I stood at the back, looking out over the vast hanger in front of me. It didn\u0027t have any underground vaults like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, where people could work on designs or rockets, or where you could even store rocket parts, but it was still huge. Thousands of crates containing parts, materials, and whatever else we might need lined the walls. Interspersed between the crates were forklifts and fuel trucks, all awaiting the day something, anything would be built in here that would require their services. There were also some cranes, on the walls or roof, for hoisting large pieces off a plane into position to be put together. Then there was the roof itself. It was a huge skylight, interspersed with support beams, and slightly white-tinted out. And finally, the hanger door. The huge door was open and... Wait, why was it open? We\u0027re just exposing this place and all of the stuff inside it to the weather. Nevermind. Anyway, the SpacePlane Hanger, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E for short, was awe-inspiring. Before I left, an idea struck me, and I jotted it down in my notebook. \u00A0After having a look at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, I decided to walk over to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. I had seen it before, of course, as it was the first thing we finished, but it was still amazing. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E was huge. In addition to the main bay, it had several underground hangers, which could be used for anything from storage to module building. The many balconies around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E lead to small rooms, which, once again were used for everything from meeting planning, to building small modules, to living quarters for some of the Kerbals who wanted to be around their work 24/7. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E was abuzz with activity, as this was the last day of planning for our first rocket. I walked over to the table where two teams of engineers showed their designs to each other. It appeared that one favored a kerballed design, and the other favored an unkerballed design. I looked over the first design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VW6dbuQ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VW6dbuQ.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a simple capsule atop a small solid rocket booster(\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E). Looking over it, I saw so many problems with the design: First, we don\u0027t know much about rockets but the one thing that we do know, is that solid rockets can\u0027t be controlled. Second, it has a Kerbal on top of it! If anything went wrong, like the rocket veering out of control or the parachute deploying will the rocket was still active, we\u0027d be killing a Kerbal. In my opinion, it wasn\u0027t worth the risk. You might wonder why we didn\u0027t know anything about rockets, after all, the space program was alive and well 10 years ago. Well, \u00A0there\u0027s one reason: Most of the engineers of the original space program were old when they started and from the stress of having a big asteroid that they didn\u0027t see coming hit their planet, they didn\u0027t last very long after Worldkiller. They called their design the Moho 1, after the first planet in the Kerbol system. Anyway, the other design was a small probe on top of a small rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WsiAmVr.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WsiAmVr.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey called it a sounding rocket. This design was named Jool 1 and seemed much more reasonable because it was a probe, instead of a Kerbal, on top of a liquid fueled rocket. Luckily, the engineers saw this and opted for the Jool 1 over the Moho program. It was amazing that Moho 1 even got through the first round of the bracketing system we used. Who designed that again? Steve or somebody? I don\u0027t remember. It was a good system, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022atdu14g.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/atdu14g.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Jool 1 sat on the launchpad. It was a simple rocket consisting of 4 fuel tanks, a small engine, probe core, and nosecone. There was also a self-destruct, for if it fell on the space center. We would probably use it anyways, and keep it on al future missions. We didn\u0027t want to litter Kerbin or space. There was still space junk falling from the skies over Kerbin. We didn\u0027t want that sort of environment.

When I was in a meeting, a space center security Kerbal came up to me and said,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sir, I\u0027ve been told to escort you to the Astronaut complex for Kerbounaut testing.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What?!\u0022 I almost jumped out of my seat at the news.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027ve accepted your application and are requesting you be brought in for physical testing to determine if you are a suitable candidate for the Kerbounat program,\u0022 He said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027Wha..

I\u0027m glad to say I did better than some. I managed to get flag planting down okay, and I think I did fairly good on the running. Some applicants fell off the treadmill or toppled themselves in flag planting. I think I did better than they did. While I was running on the treadmill, I had an idea. I worked it out in my head and went to present it to the engineers afterward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne day after the first anniversary of when we started to rebuild the space center, the Jool 3 was complete. It was my design, a larger rocket body, 1.25m instead of .625m, carrying a small satellite. Yes, that\u0027s right a satellite. The satellite had solar panels, big batteries, and a big antenna. The launcher and satellite both had self-destructs on each side. There was also fins and detachable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s. \u00A0I did forget to put self-destructs on the SRBS though. Whoops.

You can\u0027t help me fly the plane, and will it\u0027s nice to have you handling radio traffic, I could do that myself. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t like you, I\u0027m just curious.

I started doing a 180-degree turn to get lined up with the runway but ended up overshooting a little bit to the right. I decided to keep going, and just land on the grass. I figured that it would be easier than trying to pinpoint land on the runway.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Uh, James, shouldn\u0027t we be heading for the runway?\u0022 Madwell asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m going for the grass.\u0022 \u0022It should be fine, and it\u0027ll be easier than trying to land on the runway,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay...\u0022 Madwell said. I turned off the engines of the plane, angled the nose down, and put the gear down. I tried to keep the airspeed going down: 71.05m/sec, 65.79, 34.99m/sec at 200m. \u0022James, shouldn\u0027t we be going a little slower?\u0022 Madwell asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ll be fine, the cockpits both have like 40m/sec impact tolerance, so we\u0027ll be fine,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay, but what about the rest of the plane?\u0022 Madwell asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It might not be so good,\u0022 I said. \u0022But at this point, I just want to keep us both alive,\u0022 I continued. 30.14m/sec at 100m, 9.69 at touchdown, 5.79m/sec, as we skidded along the grass, .47m/sec, and... stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nek3AmV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nek3AmV.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got out of the plane and turned to face the rear cockpit as Madwell got out.

Madwell walked around the plane and stopped when she reached the back landing gear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Uh, James, isn\u0027t there supposed to be 2 engines back here?\u0022 Madwell asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, why?\u0022 I asked worriedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s not,\u0022 she said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002277fINjy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/77fINjy.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe next morning, Astronaut Complex, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, James Kerman\u0027s quarters.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you for all you did, James, you really saved us!\u0022 Said, Jebediah Kerman.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022My hero,\u0022 Said Madwell, as she planted a kiss on my lips.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, James,\u0022 Said Valentina, as she shook my hand and kissed my cheek. Buzz! What\u0027s that? Is that the rocket launch alarm? No that\u0027s a shrill- buzz! Wait... Jeb and Val are dead... Buzz! Madwell... Buzz! I opened my eyes. It must have just been a dream... Buzz! That alarm clock! I hit the \u0022off\u0022 button, and the annoying buzzing turned off. Knock, knock, knock... What now?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James!\u0022 \u0022James, come on, you gotta get up!\u0022 I blearily walked over to the door and cracked it open. Madwell stood there in her flight suit, looking nervously excited.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Madwell?\u0022 \u0022Why are you here so early?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I shouldn\u0027t tell you...\u0022 \u0022Never mind! We\u0027re going to SPACE!\u0022 She said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 I asked. I was still only half-awake and wondered if this was still a dream.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re not dreaming, James.\u0022 \u0022Now get your flight suit on, and let\u0027s go to the briefing room! I\u0027ll wait outside,\u0022 she said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay,\u0022 I said, and blearily closed the door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got my flight suit on and headed outside to meet Madwell.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Can we at least stop on the way to get some koffee?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sure, but make it quick, okay?\u0022 She said. We walked through the Astronaut Complex hallways towards the Briefing Room and stopped in a cafeteria on the way to get some koffee. I didn\u0027t normally really like the taste of koffee, but I had the feeling that I would need it today. After we got our cups of koffee, we continued to walk through the hallways. The Briefing Room was at the other end of the Astronaut Complex from the living quarters. I wondered idly what I had been dreaming about. Something about Jeb, Val, and Madwell... I looked at Madwell. She looked nice today, although I wish I could see her with her hair down... Anyway... I decided that I should say something.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022So, Madwell, are you looking forward to your K38 flight?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I am! It\u0027s not nearly as exciting as what we\u0027re doing today!\u0022 She said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What exactly are we doing today?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t tell you, it would ruin the surprise,\u0022 she said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Why do you always get the memos?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know James, I don\u0027t know,\u0022 she said. We walked into the Briefing Room, where Gene Kerman was standing in front of a projector. Yay, another KerbPoint presentation.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Hello, James, Madwell,\u0022 Gene said. \u0022Madwell, you were supposed to get him here earlier.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not her fault sir, I had no idea,\u0022 I said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s fine, we gave you guys some buffer time, in case something like that happened,\u0022 Gene said. \u0022Also, don\u0027t call me sir, call me Gene.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Gene, so why does she get all the memos?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene laughed. \u0022It\u0027s because she sets her alarm clock earlier, and statistically, because of that gets up and ready earlier than you, so we tell her to get you up,\u0022 he said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Oh, sorry, I\u0027ll try to get up earlier,\u0022 I said. \u0022That way, I can wake you up!\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What, want to see me in my sleep clothes?\u0022 She asked jokingly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay people, we should get started here,\u0022 Gene said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022So, a KerbPoint?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yes, James,\u0022 Gene said, grabbed a remote, hit a button on it, and a screen popped up on the projector. On the screen was a Tracking Station picture of a Derelict Object, Derelict Object P1-239A. I looked at the derelict, excepting a fuel tank, or pod, or other small to medium size object floating through the void of space all alone. Instead what I saw was anything but that. It had what looked to be some sort of tubular structure, with some sort of... plane at one end, and what looked to be some kind of medium size spacecraft at the other end. There was also what looked to be some sort of solar array, viewed edge-on from our telescope. \u0022This is Derelict Object P1-239A. Originally, we thought that it was simply a large derelict. However, we have a policy of taking pictures of all large derelicts to determine if they pose a threat to Kerbin or if they could be useful. We\u0027re certainly glad that we did. We believe this to be some sort of multiple launch space station, with some other spacecraft attached to it. Now, understand, that this is only an assumption, we need to visit the station to learn more,\u0022 Gene said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Gene, this is all very interesting, but what does this have to do with us?\u0022 I asked. Then I remembered something that Madwell had said. She had said that we were going to space today. Could it be... No. It couldn\u0027t be.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022As I said, we want to launch a mission to visit this space station. We believe that this craft should be manned, in order that we may explore the interior of the station. The crew that we will be sending up is you and Madwell. You will be going up in a revolutionary 2 person capsule. There will be a probe core to do the flying for you,\u0022 Gene said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Why are you sending us?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We want an engineer to be able to learn how the station is made, and any new engineering techniques we may able to discern from the construction of it or its parts. We want a scientist on our first manned mission to space, to see what we can learn about the space environment. You two are the only flight crew that has actually flown together, on your K38 Talon flight, so therefore you\u0027re our most experienced flight crew,\u0022 Gene said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Wow, I didn\u0027t realize that we were the only ones who had flown,\u0022 I said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Doing the flights wasn\u0027t really a priority for us, because we didn\u0027t think that we would be sending Kerbals into space anytime soon,\u0022 Gene said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022When are we launching?\u0022 Madwell asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022In 5 hours,\u0022 Gene said. \u0022Here\u0027s what spacecraft you\u0027ll be launching on...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene continued with his presentation. To sum it up, the spacecraft looks like this and will be called the Eve 1. Our mission is to launch into Low Kerbin Orbit(\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E) and then transfer to a higher orbit than the station, which is in an almost completely circular 100x100km orbit. Then we\u0027ll do something that Gene called a \u0022Homahen Transfer\u0022 to get a rendezvous with the station. Once there we\u0027ll cancel our relative velocity, and then one of us will do an ExtraVehicular Activity(EVA) over to the station and hope to find a hatch to get inside and look around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T-10,\u0022 Said the PAO. We were sitting on the launchpad, in a new 2 Kerbal capsule design that had been made specifically for this mission. It was bigger than any rocket technology we had at that point, so there was a small fueled adapter below the capsule connecting to the 1.25m Service Module(SM), with a launcher consisting of 8 1.25m tanks and engines clustered around an identical assembly in the center, for a total of 9 engines. There were 4 self-destructs on it, enough to make it even but hopefully not cause too much drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RxE51L4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RxE51L4.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T-5,\u0022 The PAO said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Are you ready?\u0022 I asked Madwell.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022As much as I\u0027ll ever be,\u0022 she said. \u0022You?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Same,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Liftoff of the Eve 1 on its way to Derelict Object P1-239A!\u0022 The PAO said as the engines roared to life and the launch clamps released. I was pressed back into my seat by the g-forces. The launch computer started the gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bKGn4S6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bKGn4S6.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe g-forces lowered, and we rode the rocket into orbit. Mission Control plotted a maneuver node for us to execute to get a rendezvous with the station. \u00A0We executed the maneuver and then had to perform a course correction because the maneuver didn\u0027t quite work as planned. Mission Control assured us that this was perfectly normal. As we got closer to the station, I asked Madwell what she thought we were going to find there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, James, but I imagine that there are at least 2 independent spacecraft docked to the station and that the station was composed of multiple launches. It also looks like there is a solar array,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s boring stuff, and you could tell all that form the picture,\u0022 I said. \u0022I mean exciting things, files, maybe even some Kerbals!\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I doubt that we\u0027ll find Kerbals, James, but you never know. I\u0027m pretty sure that they evacuated everybody from all the stations and bases,\u0022 Madwell said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re right, but how fun would it be if we found out that Jebediah Kerman is actually alive?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022That would be great! Or if we found Valentina, she\u0027s my hero,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I know, right! Sadly I doubt that we\u0027ll find them,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, highly doubtful,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, I\u0027m going to go to sleep,\u0022 I said. \u0022Wake me up when we\u0027re close.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay. But how do you want to sleep? This is so interesting! So many opportunities for science!\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Remeber, I\u0027m an engineer, not a scientist,\u0022 I said, put my head back, and closed my eyes. \u0022Not much engineering out here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James.\u0022 \u0022James.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 I opened my eyes. I was in a spacecraft, but it wasn\u0027t the Eve 1. It was a 2 seater compartment, with the other Kerbal across a table from me. I looked out the window and Kerbin was orbiting below me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James, you drifted off,\u0022 The other Kerbal said. I looked at her. It was Madwell. She had her hair down, and it was loose, floating around the cabin.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sorry, Madwell,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s fine,\u0022 she said. \u0022What do you think of the refurbished KSS?\u0022 She asked. \u0022I thought it was the perfect place for a space date.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, it is, I agree,\u0022 I said. Wait, KSS, we don\u0027t have a space station, and that sounds like a name for a space station.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuddenly I was in a 2 person command module, like the one for the Eve 1, but it was flatter. I looked at a display and then heard a message come through my earpiece. Wait, I don\u0027t have an earpiece...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Update on the status of Worldkiller-2:\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen the cockpit erupted in flame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI woke up with a jerk, which isn\u0027t a good idea while buckled in in space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMadwell looked at me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James, I was just going to wake you up,\u0022 she said. \u0022It\u0027s 5 minutes till the burn.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Oh, okay,\u0022 I said. I looked over at her. Her hair was up in the standard Kerbonaut bun. I looked at the computer, displaying all the spacecraft in Kerbin orbit. Yep, no KSS, just us, the Jool-3, and our target.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Are you all right, James? You woke up with quite the start,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m fine, just a bad dream, I was on the KSS and then it exploded, and before that...\u0022 I drifted off. I debated whether or not to tell her about the earlier part of my dream. I decided not to. \u0022I don\u0027t remember.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t like bad dreams either. KSS though? That sounds cool,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Eve-1, prepare for deceleration in t-minus 3 minutes,\u0022 A voice came through the radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Uh, roger Contol,\u0022 I said. \u0022Actually, what should I call you? In air traffic, it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Control, Airport, Tower, etc., but what do I call you?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, my name\u0027s Emiko, so you can call me that,\u0022 Emiko said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay, but there are multiple people who do what you do right? What are their names?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Um, the other ones are Ethan, Lucas, Steven, Kutz, Jim, Julian, Sarah, Bob, and Mindy,\u0022 Emiko said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Cool, I guess that\u0027ll work for informal situations, but what about formal situations?\u0022 I asked.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Will, my position is Capsule Communicator or CAPCOM, so you could call me that,\u0022 Emiko said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sounds good,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Oh, and by the way, you\u0027re 1 minute from deceleration,\u0022 Emiko said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay, thanks,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Eve-1, you are go for deceleration,\u0022 CAPCOM said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Roger, CAPCOM, initiating declaration,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI pushed the throttle lever forward, and the craft shook with the g-forces. Emiko had to leave, so I asked Sarah if they would let me fly the craft, and she asked the flight director, who was named Jim(not James, Just Jim), and he asked Gene, and Gene gave me the go-ahead. \u00A0I looked out the window as we approached the station. If we used it for our own purposes maybe KSS would be a good name for it. Kerbin Space Station, maybe? I don\u0027t know. \u0022We can\u0027t see anything, it\u0027s against Kerbol.\u0022 \u0022It\u0027s against Kerbin now, and we can definitely see... something...\u0022 I said. \u0022Deceleration complete, 1.2kms away from Target. Turning for intercept. Burning. Reversing to retrograde orientation... 202.3m away from target... 194.1... 20m, initiating deceleration...\u0022 \u00220m/sec at 15.5 m away from center or mass of the target.\u0022 \u0022Reversing orientation for faster and safer EVA...\u0022 \u0022Done.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022H0wb65a.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/H0wb65a.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Madwell, do want to go over, or do you want me too?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You can go,\u0022 she said. \u0022This whole EVA thing seems pretty dangerous.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m glad I have your vote of confidence,\u0022 I said. \u0022 A kiss for luck?\u0022 She pecked me on my cheek.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Have fun, James, and don\u0027t die. It\u0027s lonely up here without anyone else,\u0022 she said.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ll try not to die, for you,\u0022 I said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022My hero,\u0022 she said. I suited up and opened the airlock. Madwell had to put on her helmet too, as opening the airlock depressurized the whole cabin. I would have to have somebody fix that on the design of this capsule. Or just make a whole new one. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cJb9yWv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cJb9yWv.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI flew over to the station, and found a hatch, on the largest module of the thing, and turned on my voice recorder, in addition to my radio. \u0022This appears to be some sort science facility. I\u0027m moving up the ladder. Passing through a command module, I\u0027ll come back later, now I\u0027m going through some sort of pressurized 6-way adapter. \u00A0I\u0027m in a command module. It looks sort of like the Eve 1\u0027s, but it\u0027s a 3 seater. This looks like some sort of crew ferry craft. I think it was called the Koyuz. I wonder why it\u0027s still here. Oh. Jeb and Val. I\u0027m heading back now. On 2 of the other sides of the 6-way adapter, I\u0027ll call it Unity, \u00A0are 2 two seater crew compartments strung together, for a total of 4 crew an arm with 2 arms.\u0022 I noticed that the crew compartments looked eerily like the ones in my dream. \u0022I\u0027m passing back through the science lab now and heading through another 6-way adapter. I\u0027m in a cockpit now. This must be an experimental spaceplane because that\u0027s what the note on the dashboard says. Actually, it says: Expermintal, don\u0027t die! Feel free to bail out. Oh, and Bob, DON\u0027T eat all the snacks. I\u0027m heading back through the 6-way adapter now. I\u0027m in the middle command module now. I think that this is the station\u0027s command module. It\u0027s the only command module I\u0027ve seen that\u0027s actually on the station permanently, I think.\u0022 I sat down in one of the chairs. I noticed that this command module looked like the one in my dream. The one that blew up. I looked out the window. I saw Kerbin below. I decided that I should get out of there quickly. I resumed my narration. \u0022I\u0027m accessing the station\u0027s computer. There appears to be a schematic of the station on here. There is indeed a crew return vehicle and experimental spaceplane docked here. There are also 2 habitation modules, along with a coms module, power module, and fuel tank module. There\u0027s a science lab below me, where I came in. The science lab and command module were launched together. There\u0027s also some sort of encrypted file on here, called the station\u0027s log. I wonder why it\u0027s encrypted.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James, we want you to head home. Download the station\u0027s log to the Eve-1 and return,\u0022 Sarah said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Roger that, Sarah,\u0022 I said. I opened the big antenna and transferred the data to the Eve-1.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James, can you do a quick atmosphere test before you leave?\u0022 Madwell asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sure, what kind of atmosphere test?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Just if it\u0027s there and breathable,\u0022 She said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022And how do I do that?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022There should be a program on your suit called atmo sampler. Run it,\u0022 She said. I found the program on my suit computer and ran it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Atmosphere breathable, but thin. Density 0.8 atmos. Taking of helmet is not advisable.\u0022 The suit computer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Did you hear that, Madwell?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yup, I heard that, okay interesting, that means that the station must have lost some atmosphere over time, if we want to use it, we\u0027ll need to pump some more air in,\u0022 Madwell said. I found the hatch I got in at and left the station. This station actually had an airlock, not that I needed it, but I did cycle it, to avoid losing any more atmosphere. I flew back over to the Eve-1 and got in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Honey, I\u0027m home!\u0022 I said as I entered the Eve-1 command module.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Very funny, James,\u0022 Madwell said. \u0022Now can you get the door closed so that I can take off my helmet?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sure... there we go. Door closed. Cabin repressurizing,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Why thank you, James,\u0022 Madwell said as she took off her helmet. \u0022Now get strapped in, and let\u0027s get out of here.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay, sounds good,\u0022 I said. \u0022I\u0027m ready. Hit it.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Hitting it,\u0022 Madwell said as she turned the spacecraft to retrograde and pushed the throttle lever up.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Wait, who gave you permission to fly?\u0022 I asked Madwell.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Gene did, he said that I should get some flying in before my K-38 flight,\u0022 She said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay,\u0022 I said. We stopped decelerating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002220 minutes till atmosphere contact,\u0022 Madwell said. \u0022I think I\u0027m going to take a nap.\u0022 She put her hair down (I guess putting your head back on a bun is sort of hard, but I wouldn\u0027t know.), leaned back in her seat, and closed her eyes. I busied myself by looking at some of the unencrypted files we found on the station, although it was all fairly boring. There wasn\u0027t much there, and eventually, I ran out of stuff to do and ended up just staring at Madwell until it was only 2 minutes till contact. Then I woke her up gently.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Madwell.\u0022 \u0022Madwell, it\u0027s time to wake up,\u0022 I said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 \u0022Oh, James, right.\u0022 \u0022Where are we? The K... no, the... the... oh right, the Eve-1.\u0022 \u0022Hi, James,\u0022 She said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Hi, Madwell, a little sleepy there, huh?\u0022 I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, a little bit,\u0022 she said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s t-minus 1 till atmo contact,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Oh, okay,\u0022 she said and lifted her head up off the seat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Eve-1, this is Sarah, prepare for deceleration,\u0022 Sarah said over the radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Roger that Sarah, prepared for deceleration,\u0022 I said. We hit the atmosphere 30 seconds later. We had lots of extra fuel in the engine, so we used that to slow down. We lost contact with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, as expected. Re-entry was nominal until- we flipped.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James!\u0022 Madwell shouted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not my fault!\u0022 I shouted back.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What are we going to do?\u0022 She asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We should probably turn off the engine,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, that\u0027s a good idea,\u0022 she said. I pulled the throttle lever down. \u0022We\u0027re not slowing down fast enough,\u0022 she said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Just give it some time hopefully, it\u0027ll slow down,\u0022 I said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Hopefully,\u0022 she said.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI read off the altitude numbers, \u002227000, 25000, 20000, 15000, 10000, 9000, still going at 1300m/sec.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James, maybe we should jettison the Service Module,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sounds like a good idea,\u0022 I said. At 8000 meters I hit the button to jettison the Service Module. The capsule immediately flipped around. We began to decelerate dramatically. I watched the velocity indicator go down and the g-force indicator go up much more quickly. I felt the g-forces pressing on my chest. I heard Madwell gasp, and then her eyes were forced closed and her body went limp.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Madwell?\u0022 I asked. Then I passed out from the g-forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parachutes were open and the capsule was gliding slowly down toward the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226b4SIVa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6b4SIVa.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Madwell?\u0022 I asked. She opened her eyes and groaned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022James? Are we dead?\u0022 She asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Nope, we made it,\u0022 I said. \u0022That was a good idea, jettisoning the Service Module. The same button that jettisoned it also armed the parachutes, and when we slowed down enough, they deployed.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Wow. I guess I\u0027m pretty smart then,\u0022 Madwell said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I guess so,\u0022 I said. \u0022You are a scientist.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022That I am,\u0022 she said.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe landed, and she decided that she should get out to plant a flag. I was against it, but she went anyway. She named the site Landing Site of the Eve-1. I don\u0027t know what she put on the plaque. Then she got in and we waited for the recovery teams.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sWSMD5g.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sWSMD5g.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the lack of pictures and the long wait, I was busy flying(The incident with the capsule flipping and them blacking out actually happened, I was worried that I was going to have to revert because James would die.), and traveling in RL.
