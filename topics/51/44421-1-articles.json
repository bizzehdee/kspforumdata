Time for my first manned mission to Duna. I\u0027m sending one-way a lander/rover with badass James Kerman, a new recruit who shone in my SSTO program. Also headed to Duna is a surveyor satellite with a detach for Ike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve launched both and they are in Duna insertion orbits. I\u0027m not entirely sure I have enough delta v in the sky crane to get Jim down safely. Ah, the joys of being first!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll throw up some shots of the expedition as it unfolds. While Jim is heading to Duna, I\u0027ve got to work on my Mun base and think of a way to bring him back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T18:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the Duna Explorer en route (James is enjoying himself perhaps too much):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921272559335876971/9119D9DD0D7F74F294B82B5F1D9DA2B163664129/\u0022 alt=\u00229119D9DD0D7F74F294B82B5F1D9DA2B163664129\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly enough, everything went smooth.
