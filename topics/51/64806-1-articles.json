On top of the central node, we have science lab and control room. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the right of node, we can see strange structure, which functions as station\u0027s dinner room, kitchen, storage and life support. It also has nice cupola, to look somewhere while eating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder the node we can see crew-wheel module. This thing actually rotates and creates pretty enough gravity to sleep like at home on Kerbin. This part also has station\u0027s primary solar array for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BUirWzs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BUirWzs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the left of the station we see a vessel. That is my Maintenance Vessel, or MV for short. It is quite obsolete, and lacks some vital life supporting machinery, so it just sits here, waiting to be burnt in the Kerbin atmosphere. I tried to use it for comm-satellite upgrading, but it was quite difficult, due to satellite\u0027s geosync orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBehind the station is former booster-ship, which carried dinner-module to the station. Surprisingly, it had too much fuel to be wasted if burnt in atmosphere, so I decided to keep it as fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jzUOUeQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jzUOUeQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some view from command block.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7iKakWh.png\u0022 alt=\u00227iKakWh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it. As you may notice, I use mods, so I\u0027d like to make a short list of mods, which are used to build this station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Habitat Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- TAC Life Support (and some side-modes for fancier parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RemoteTech2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mechjeb (only to have good intercept nodes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Attachment System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RasterPropMonitor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- LLL pack Lite (those two baloons on the dinner\u0027s sides)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
