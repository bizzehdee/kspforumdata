However, I don\u0027t always want to spend time building the pieces in the VAB. So, this is where you guys come in. I will build the Station core. But I would like for you guys to create different parts to eventually be added to the station. This is, essentially, a community built station, but I will be putting the thing together in orbit myself. Please provide me with a picture of your piece as well as a location where I can get the parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very modded install, so, these are the mods I am using which are part-based:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Shuttle Program - Mike-NZ\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMir\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface Lights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaidernick parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elionhead\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFASA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Solar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy request is, if you use modded parts in your station pieces, please make it so that they are ONLY from the above packs.
