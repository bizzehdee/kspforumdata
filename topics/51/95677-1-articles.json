Welp, today I\u0027ve marked the same achievement, except this time it was Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying around with US probes I decided to send Magellan (Makellan) to Eve, using a Saturn 1C rocket. And it was glorious. It was real nice to see Eve up close and not in the tracking center. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, originally I just intended the probe to just be an orbit and then deorbit (just like Magellan actually did), but little did I know that US probes are stupidly non-fragile. Despite my highly negative periapse (it was almost a straight free fall down the planet. I hadn\u0027t let lose my Centaur-E stage so I used its remaining propellant and half of that in Makellan to make sure the probe would be destroyed) the thing managed to survive entry into Eve\u0027s atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd indeed, it survived well enough that it slowed down to the point where I was able to use the remaining propellant to try and make a last minute suicide burn. And low and behold, I\u0027ve touched the surface of Eve for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wyVdQOu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wyVdQOu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mGsNRQJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mGsNRQJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairly awesome I must say.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Peanut","CreatedById":82721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T07:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome! Congrats. Great work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally I just slap a parachute on my Eve probes, the atmosphere is so dense thats all it really takes to land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo fun though that you not only did it for yourself but had a bit of an adventure doing it in a probe that wasn\u0027t really designed to do it!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
