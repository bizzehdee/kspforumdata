Before we get to those payloads arriving at Jool, I\u0027ll mention the single ship that was sent out in the next transfer window that came up after those three payloads were sent (transfer windows from Kerbin to Jool occur about every 115 days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the Laythe ShoreLab being launched on a Reusable Rocket. The ShoreLab is a jet-hopper/floating-laboratory designed to study the sea bottoms offshore from Dansen Island. Unlike Kerbin, where you can see someinteresting things through the water, the surface of Laythe\u0027s seas are not transparent (at least not with the video settings I use), but this ship will allow our explorers to peek beneath the surface (but not actually navigate around under the sea). This is also the first ship I\u0027ve built using the cupola module, which will serve here as our glass-bottom boat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MEhrpJB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MEhrpJB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo push the ShoreLab to Laythe, the boys at KSC decided to use Laythe Tug 3, which had returned earlier from Laythe and was sitting in Kerbin orbit. It only had standard docking ports, but this was a relatively light payload. Below is the Tug3 Refurbisher mission being launched on a Reusable Rocket (which can lift that payload into orbit without requiring any of the payload\u0027s fuel, and leave enough fuel in the sustainer that it can return to KSC). The rear tank will be docked to the bottom of the Tug, and then propellants and monopropellant from the top tank will be transferred to the main tank of the Tug. The top part of the Refurbisher will need to retain less than 15 units of fuel to deorbit and be recovered via parachute at KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wZyfrKC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wZyfrKC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Tug 3 was refurbished, it was docked to the ShoreLab and was ready to be sent off to Jool.

The rear tank was expended during the escape burn, and dropped off as the ship left the Kerbin system. The ascending node occurred out beyond the orbit of Dres and took about 78 m/s of delta-V. We\u0027ll see the arrival of the ShoreLab at Laythe in a future episode (when the main game file gets to Year 26 Day 89).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e7VHhpo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e7VHhpo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CHrGDYP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CHrGDYP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RE7GlF6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RE7GlF6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETug Treatments\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Laythe Tugs 4, 6, 7, and 8 that were waiting in Kerbin orbit, I decided just to land them near the KSC so that they could receive some minor improvements (adding Senior docking ports, and removing some unneeded parts). The following pictures show the recovery sequence with pictures of the various Tugs. First, Tug 4 does its retro burn. These Tugs all had enough fuel to target them in to KSC (in one case, just barely). Tug 4 will only need refitting with Senior docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bU9aULm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bU9aULm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, reentry is demonstrated by Tug 6.

Note that the nuclear engines will not be refurbished...the amount of fissile fuel you need to make the nuclear reactors work is much greater than the amount that would be used up in several trips to Jool and back (which each take less that 40 minutes of engine runtime), so the nukes are fine. I envision an unmanned rover/crane coming out to the Tugs to clamp some radiation shields around the nuclear engines (which are radioactively \u0027hot\u0027 because they have been used) to make them safe to handle by the refurb crews in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/966GBF9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022966GBF9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one of the refurbished Tugs as it would appear on top of a Reusable Rocket to be returned to orbit for continued use. Shortly before launch, the radiation shields will be jettisoned (see the animated GIF below). There are a couple girders on the side boosters to bounce the shields off to the sides. This leaves behind the minimal shielding of the engine fairings, and those will be jettisoned when the nuclear engines are ignited at high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uVHM4pc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uVHM4pc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NGAW3gx.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022NGAW3gx.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose Tugs will be used to send more payloads out to Jool later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETrain Traffic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we get back to the three trains (double-Tugs with double-payloads, one of which is just extra fuel) that are arriving at the Jool system. Tain #1 did not reach the ascending node of its transfer orbit until it was within Jool\u0027s sphere of influence, but Train #3 and Train #2 required plane-shift maneuvers enroute. Because these occurred close to Jool, they only required about 51 m/s of delta-V. This expended the propellants in the rearmost tanks of Train #2, and they were dropped after the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gIgwg7z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gIgwg7z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to take the easy route and target all three trains straight to Laythe (rather than do an aerocapture at Jool first). Train #3 and #2 were both targeted very close to Jool back when they left Kerbin, so those orbits were just tweaked a bit until they got Laythe encounters, as seen below, with Train #3 swinging past Jool to a farside encounter and Train #2 encountering Laythe on the way in. Both of these trajectories resulted in intercept velocities of around 5,000 meters per second, leading to hot aerocaptures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5AS3Ifw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225AS3Ifw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, Train #1 was targeted (after entering Jool\u0027s SOI) to approach Laythe close to tangentially to its orbit. This resulted in an intercept velocity of only 2973 m/s, much less than the other two trains. Changing the radial component of the targeting burn moves the trajectory closer or further from Jool to get the correct intercept with Laythe, and changing the prograde/retrograde component allows you to adjust where Laythe will be in its orbit when the ship arrives (and adjusting the normal component allows you to determine the inclination of the resulting Laythe orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FfBP2iR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FfBP2iR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Train #1 came in tangentially and experienced only a few G\u0027s and rather anemic flames during aerocapture.

So Kurt cut in the engines again just before touchdown to reduce the speed to a few meters per second. This was done with the engines still in closed-cycle mode (rather than air-breathing mode) because it\u0027s easier that way (although doing it the trickier way in air-breathing mode would take less fuel...and might not be as difficult as trying to land on jet engines alone would be, because the parachutes have slowed the ship down so there is more time to react to the spool-up/spool-down lag time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F9OqX4l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F9OqX4l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the RASSTO is safely down about 630 meters from the original crew-transfer SSTO rocket. After landing, the RASSTO had a little under 91% of its liquid fuel left, and its oxidizer tanks were filled to a little over 84% of their capacity. The difference in those percentages is because the small side tanks were tweaked to hold less than 100% of their oxidizer capacity, because the ship will use more fuel than oxidizer during ascent because the R.A.P.I.E.R. engines will initially boost the ship in air-breathing mode.

This left the ship with 952 m/s of delta-V (according to MechJeb\u0027s data readouts). That\u0027s more than enough for lots of orbital maneuvers, but somewhat disappointing after the previous Ladyhawk flight. The Raptor\u0027s orbit was inclined about 0.6 degrees, so Aldner did a burn at the ascending node to align the Raptor\u0027s orbit to the equatorial orbit of Laythe Space Station. This left the ship with 935 m/s delta-V...at which point he told Nelemy that the snacks were hidden in the survival gear compartment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JeBM16y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JeBM16y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Raptor does some orbital maneuvers to rendezvous with Laythe Space Station.

It wasn\u0027t even necessary to get the Runabout rover to reposition the plane. The plane can make pretty sharp turns during the rollout as long as you remember to use the roll controls to counter the tendency of the plane to tip to the side as you use the remapped rover-steering keys to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GnDfbrx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GnDfbrx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the flight, Aldner and Nelemy studied the flight data plot to consider how they could get better results on the second test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude, you could have kept the altitude curve smoother at the start.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022True. The R.A.P.I.E.R. flamed out sooner than I expected. Keep that in mind and pitch down sooner on the next flight. My main concern is that cruising along at 26 to 27 thousand at a third-to-half throttle just didn\u0027t seem to work well. It took way too long to build up speed. And I didn\u0027t get the feeling that trying it higher at even lower throttle would work well like it did for the turbojet. Maybe it would work better at higher altitude...or maybe we may need to stay lower and run at full throttle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022I like full throttle! Pedal to the metal, Dude!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Then you may want to start your cruise at 22 thousand, and climb very slowly as the speed increases so the engine can tolerate full throttle all the way. Certainly stay below 25 thousand until the end of the cruise.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Cool.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022The other problem I had was that I burned too much liquid fuel, so I had excess oxidizer when we reached orbit. To have more delta-V in orbit, you should try to have matching amounts of fuel and oxidizer when you switch over to rocket mode. Since the Raptor currently has 402 units of oxidizer, you should have at least 329 units of fuel at switchover.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude! Sounds like a plan!

The purpose of the Saddlebag Deorbiter is to deorbit the spaceplane without the plane having to use any of its own fuel so it could land with full tanks. (I originally slapped the Deorbiter together and sent it along just in case the spaceplanes turned out to be very marginal in getting to orbit...but both the Ladyhawk and Raptor have proven that they don\u0027t need this extra help...but I wanted to try it out anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6XrBAYE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226XrBAYE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo deorbit the plane using the Saddlebag Deorbiter, the docking port on top of the Deorbiter is set as the \u0022Control From\u0022 point.

With a crew capacity of four, it uses somewhat more fuel than two flights of the two-kerbal SSTO spaceplanes, but it can be a good choice for Laythians with an on-to-go lifestyle who want to do without all that tedious mucking about in the stratosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt and Nelemy were chosen to test the R.A.P.I.E.R.-powered SSTO transport rocket. They first had to make a couple trips over and back from Base 2 to empty all of the cases of supplies that were packed into the crew compartment when the RASSTO was sent to Laythe from Kerbin. Below, Kurt repacked the eight parachutes while Nelemy had a last snack at the Fido rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ar4gNB0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ar4gNB0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I spent quite a lot of time messing with the parachutes. Because of a bug in KSP, repacked parachutes won\u0027t deploy using the staging sequence -- you can mess around resetting the staging sequence, moving the repacked chutes here or there, but the new arrangement just won\u0027t \u0022take\u0022 and disappears when you switch away from the ship. You CAN deploy the chutes using action group keys -- but another bug causes the chutes to deploy instantly fully open, ripping your ship apart (although the parachutes rather embarrassingly notice that they shouldn\u0027t have opened fully, so they quickly switch to reefed appearance before you can notice what\u0027s going on...not that this is any help for your mysteriously-ripped-apart ship). Luckily, this second bug CAN be avoided by either switching away from the ship to the Tracking Station, then switching back, or by doing a Quicksave followed by an F9. Either way allows the chutes to be deployed later safely by action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran into this bug back when I was testing the NAMOR prototypes back on Kerbin, and I thought that I had also found a combination of steps that allowed the repacked chutes to work in the staging sequence again, but I could not duplicate that behavior here. Happily, the RASSTO has action keys to deploy the chutes in multiple pairs (the 5 key deploys the two chutes on the main tank, the heaviest component of the structure; the 6 key deploys two chutes on the crew cabin; and the 7 key deploys the other four chutes on the crew cabin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we have tweakable parachute full-deployment altitudes, the need for staged deployment is obviated, and the chutes are simply set to open fully in stages between 600 and 500 meters, starting with the two chutes on the main fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Ready, Nelemy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Ready, Kurt-Dude!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022OK.
