The contract they\u0027d picked up to build a Munar orbital station wasn\u0027t worth half the funds they were pouring into the Orbiter\u0027s construction. But Command refused to be satisfied with the rickety collection of struts and girders that had been the initial (and cost-effective) design. They wanted something with longevity and purpose, and Ker help anyone who tried to say otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, for his part, was pleased. He still remembered the first Orbiter, which had been little more than a span of solar panels above a spine of empty docking ports. The others had taken to calling it \u0022the Jellyfish.\u0022 He\u0027d spent several months in it, bored out of his mind. This new Orbiter gave him tingles though - certainly Command would not sink half a million into a station only to see it rot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene Kerman was no accountant, but he did have plans for the Munar Orbiter. Despite the considerable expenses of sending the station skyward, he felt confident it would earn its keep. Three new contractors had come forward during its construction, requesting survey and exploration data. He intended to kill several birds with one rocket. Well, one rocket with a number of much smaller ones attached. Beneath the station\u0027s long solar arrays hung three sophisticated satellite pods, and a trio of Cricket rovers. Scientific instruments and other equipment lay secured in the storage lockers at the end of each pylon, easily attached to either satellite or rover as needed. By the time the Orbiter launched, that half-million had already balanced itself out on the ledger - provided its crew could make good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerbus rode in the jump-seat of the Orbiter\u0027s \u0022Lander Can\u0022 module, just below the pilot\u0027s cupola. Bill Kerman sat to his right, where the controls would have been if the Can was expected to do any Landing. Instead, the veteran kerbonaut poked at monitor controls, keeping a wary eye on the payloads docked above. The satellites and Crickets were holding now, but who knew how much those little Clamp-O-Tron Jr\u0027s could hold? The engineers had never used them until now. \u003Cem\u003EHard to put stock in stuff ain\u0027t been field-tested.\u003C/em\u003E Gerbus himself was an engineer of the most practical sort. Unless he\u0027d used it, worked with it, and tinkered on it personally, it couldn\u0027t be trusted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe assignment ahead made him very nervous indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the Orbiter had reached its destination and stabilized itself, the engineers found a flaw in the Crickets\u0027 design. Though they had ample fuel reserves for deorbit, Mun-roving, and return to the Orbiter, they lacked a key element for the rendezvous: \u003Cem\u003ERCS controls\u003C/em\u003E. No RCS thrusters or monoprop had been included, making docking a nightmare for the pilots. A secondary module for the Orbiter\u0027s lower half was already in the works, though its primary function was to carry karbonite-scanning satellites out for survey purposes. The engineers quickly scrapped together a lightweight RCS tug-drone with a grappling claw, but the module would take another day to reach the Munar Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was one thing Gerbus disliked more than untested gear, it was \u003Cem\u003Ewaiting\u003C/em\u003E. Moments later, he was suited up and sitting in one of the Crickets\u0027 command seats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowered by a tiny-but-efficient Atlas low-profile engine, the Cricket packed nearly 3,000 d/V into its tiny frame. With conservative maneuvering, Gerbus felt certain he could align the craft with the contracted survey points. Passing over them at orbital speed wasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eideal\u003C/em\u003E, but both contractors had requested readings several thousand kilometers above the Mun\u0027s surface. On Kerbin, that would\u0027ve meant a small Recon flyer. In airless space, it meant keeping periapsis above surface level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next few hours were a nerve-wracking blur of \u003Cem\u003Ewait - burn! - wait - reading - wait - burn! - reading!!! - wait...\u003C/em\u003E that threatened to drive him insane. The little lander was amazingly nimble, and several times he wasted fuel correcting a burn that went a few seconds too long, but as he passed over the last of the gravity-scan sites, he realized he still had plenty of fuel to tackle some of the other regions near the northern pole. When the Cricket finally began running low, only one point remained. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027ll have to wait. Not getting stranded out here.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Stranded,\u0022 was the immediate concern of both the Orbiter\u0027s remaining crew, and Command back at KSC. They determined there was still enough fuel for rendezvous and matching orbit, but without RCS it looked like Gerbus would have to abandon the Cricket. Some suggested he could use his EVA pack and push the lander back into its dock, but that ran the risk of bumping it into (and through) the Orbiter\u0027s solar panels or damaging other key components. The better option was to simply leave the Cricket adrift, EVA back to the Orbiter, and let the RCS grappler pick it up when it arrived in a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerbus wasn\u0027t having it, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess than 200 d/V remained in the tank as he began his slow drift towards the station. Jeb\u0027s voice crackled over his headset, urging him to drop the rover. \u0022The Orbiter doesn\u0027t have a tenth the impact tolerance of that skiff, Ker damn you! Leave it, the tug will be here in less than two hours!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And who\u0027s going to make sure it \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E hit the station, if no one\u0027s piloting? I\u0027m bringing \u0027er in, son.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb snorted, not because he was related to Gerbus in any way, but because it sounded exactly like something he would do. Still, it was very risky. The Cricket could easily whack into one of the station\u0027s pods, the solar panels, or accidentally detonate the fuel-laden satellite in the dock beside its target. \u0022You\u0027ve got an OCTO sitting right behind your head. It\u0027ll operate remotely just fine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Never trust those newfangled probe cores. Now cut the chatter, need to focus here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a heavier rocket, it would\u0027ve been madness to even try. The lightweight little lander practically danced under Gerbus\u0027 hands, however, sliding neatly along the Orbiter\u0027s spine as he lined it up with the empty Clamp-O-Tron Jr. He felt a sudden jerk as the magnetic field took hold, pulling the Cricket solidly into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs much of a joy as it had been to pilot, Gerbus was still very eager to get back inside where there was \u003Cem\u003Eair pressure\u003C/em\u003E. He felt the pumps cycling under the deck as he climbed back into the Orbiter. Filling a Cricket barely put a dent in the reserves the Orbiter had in her tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill twisted around in his seat as Gerbus strapped himself in. \u0022You alright there, Ger? You look a bit dazed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerbus shrugged. \u0022First time I\u0027ve ever docked,\u0022 he said vacantly. \u0022RCS really spoils you kids.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...So yeah, I sent up a whole beautiful station, then forgot to put RCS on the rovers. Derp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Gerbus finally made it back to the station, tracking said the Satellite module with the grappler would hit Mun SOI in another hour-thirty (and my latest contract satellite was due for a burn in about an hour). He spent way more time spinning around that grey ball than I realized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad I been a little smarter, I could\u0027ve lined up his orbits better and taken \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the readings, but ah well. Gives other crew something to do. Initially I was just going to match orbit with the station and wait for the tug, but after piloting it for about an hour (IRL time), I figured it might be maneuverable enough I could coax it in even without monoprop, as long as I was careful on the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, nothing exploded! ...this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/6gkQB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/6gkQB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, I have no pics of the actual orbital paths as he worked his way through the readings, but that\u0027s the dull part anyway. Set up a node, wait / time-lapse, burn, and wait / time-lapse again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
