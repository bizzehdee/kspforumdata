Kill the thottle! you forgot to select the maneuver node on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E!\u0022\u00A0 I hit the maneuver node button, instead of killing the throttle and the ship spins around in the direction it should have been going, but the damage has been done, and Jebediahs ship slips out of Kerbins sphere of influence and into solar orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving exited the game and returned later, I discovered that you can\u0027t revert a flight after you\u0027ve left a ship to it\u0027s own devices, so Jebediah is now stuck...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have set myself a mission...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo rescue Jebediah...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom this point forth, the entire Kerbal Space Program has dedicated all its resources to figuring out how to rescue Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u00A0has been volunteering for as many missions as possible as\u00A0she does not trust any of the other pilots in the space program.\u00A0 It has been Valentina\u0027s tireless efforts that is driving everyone in the space program to continue their efforts to rescue Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Jebediah has some precious science points on board, the Kerbal Space Program Committee tasked with returning Jebediah decide that they need to mount a rescue that enables Jebediah to fly his ship home and re-enter Kerbins atmosphere so that Jebediah can emerge triumphant from his ship.\u00A0 To this end, it was decided that research must be done into newer technologies to enable bigger and faster rockets, so a delegation was sent to the research center to ask about fast tracking some research into newer technologies.\u00A0 The delegation came back with a report stating that to discover new technologies, science would need to be collected to expand understanding of the universe.\u00A0 \u00A0So new missions were devised to\u00A0\u00A0collect as much science as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA smart-allec scientist suggested sticking a thermometer out the window of the research facility, to which a team of engineers immediately set to to build\u00A0 a rover to drive around the Kerbal Space Complex to see if there was a difference between all the different buildings.\u00A0 Due to limited technologies, this rover looked somewhat like a stubby jet plane .\u00A0 The scientist and pilot assigned to drive around the Space complex thought they would show the researchers how dumb the idea was, and how stupid the science rover looked, and collected samples from all the buildings, and even planted a flag on top of the Fuel depot.\u00A0 Upon returning with all their data, they were shocked that research staff were over the mun with excitement with all the data that was brought in, and their jeers were turned to amazement as the researchers produced landing struts that looked like a glimmer of hope for actually landing on the mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, moved onto the next lot of tutorials to learn how to land on the mun and return.\u00A0 Back to the Science mode game, and now Valentina\u00A0has been able to declare \u0022Thats one small step for a Kerbal, one giant leap for\u003Cs\u003E Kerbal kind\u00A0\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0rescuing Jebebaby\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I can land on the mun it seems like a good idea to visit all the biomes for science.\u00A0 So I built a lander for collecting science, however, it doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to do one maybe 2 landings, so building a space station seems like a good idea.. somewhere that I can refuel before returning to Muns surface to get more science...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the Rescue Jeb Committee decide that if we are going to build a space station in Munar orbit, we 1st need to build a space station in Kerbin orbit... so Whack a couple of Rockomax X200 tanks together with a 4 radial clampotrons (only Jr version available at this stage... and a PPD12 Cupola Module at one end and another clampotron jr at the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill need a source of monopropellant on the space station, so a stack of monopropellant tanks attaches to one of the 4 radial clampotrons,\u00A0and a couple of lander cans and a hitchhiker module whacked together make a \u0022living quarters\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok so now I have my Kerbin orbit space station (haven\u0027t yet figured out how to insert images in this forum...) time to build a space station for the mun...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtra science has now unlocked the Rockomax jumbo, so make the mun station components with the Rocomax jumbo tanks rather than the Rocomax X200, so launch the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E module, monopropellent and habitat modules into kerbin orbit, and string them together like a long train.\u00A0 then send up a big rocket to push the lot to the Mun in one burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso perform the Trans Munar burn, and start heading towards the mun...\u00A0 do the usual \u0022warp\u0022 to get there faster... oh bugger! warping such a long ship is not a good idea... kracken pulls the whole lot apart and it ends up looking like a space ship grave yard...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so individual module transfer and build in munar orbit....\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat worked... now several refueling trips later, the fuel station is full and ready for business.\u00A0 (pro-grade orbit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso so now I put my lander on top of a ship that has a science storage container, and send it up to the mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dock my lander on the docking port on the end of the fuel tanks and the ship that pushed the lander up goes onto one of the remaining 2 radial docking ports.\u00A0 I transfer fuel to the lander to prep it for traveling down to the mun. and then undock...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhoops, the pilot and scientist are still on the space station... and no control of the lander...\u00A0I shouldn\u0027t have played chess with the kerbals moving them around their new quarters \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg

Had they collected all biomes faster than expected? was the Mun made of cheese? was there a Mun space program run by Munbles? to which Megwin\u00A0had to answer \u0027No\u0027, \u0027No\u0027, \u0027No\u0027... Valentina\u00A0was livid! why were they wasting a trip to Kerbin when they should be out there collecting science for Jeb?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as everyone was feeling like they would never rescue Jebediah, Megwin pulls out a Science storage container.\u00A0 At that moment, you could hear a pin drop.\u00A0 It was clear that the container was not empty.\u00A0 There was something in it. It moved in a way that an empty science container shouldn\u0027t. Megwin began to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002211 years ago to this day, the great Space Pioneer, Jebediah Kermin, set forth by sheer luck on a voyage of great significance!\u00A0 No one could have predicted the effect on progress that one single journey could have.\u00A0 One journey beyond the Mun! One Journey around the Sun! By sheer dint of forgetting to press a button, Jebediahs inaction has brought together the greatest minds in all Kerbal history, and pushed science far beyond the bounds of imagination!\u00A0 Without a common goal to unite us, to drive us to higher orbits, we would still be stuck flying peashooters into suborbital flights.\u00A0 We would have a ring of flags around the Kerbal Space Station showing how far we could never go.\u00A0 But now, thanks to Jebediahs epic journey, we have a ring of flags around the Kerbin Solar system because we are united with one voice, one program, and I present you ONE science container.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Within this science container there are reports, gauge readouts, and surface samples! this is precious information that has traveled millions of meters and I present it to you, the Jebediah Rescue Committee, to analyse and study for we need new technologies to enable the safe collection of additional valuable scientific data which in turn will enable discovery of additional\u00A0new technologies and in so doing, we will forever move closer to the ultimate goal of sending out a rescue mission to bring home our Geatest hero Jebediah!\u00A0 Jebediah!\u00A0 JEBEDIAH!\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0JEBEDIAH!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the last \u0022JEBEDIAH\u0022 the entire room was on their feet shouting \u0022JEBEDIAH\u0022\u00A0 \u00A0 The atmosphere was electric.\u00A0 Everyone wanted to know what Megwin and the Munar crew needed.\u00A0 Valentina, as the head of the rescue committee, came forward and looked Megwin in the eye and said \u0022what do we need to do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMegwin replied, \u0022We need a vehicle the likes of which have never been seen before!

air.\u00A0 The committee decided to appoint a sub-committee to build a rover.\u00A0 Valentine thought they should see if the research department could provide parts needed to launch a direct attempt to rescue\u00A0Jebediah, to which the committee replied \u0022your the head of this committee, go ahead and build a ship if you want, but it must be un-kerbaled.\u00A0 We can\u0027t risk having more Kerbals in solar orbit outside of Kerbins sphere of influence\u0022\u00A0 Megwin was shockedwhen he was overlooked as a possible candidate for the Rover Sub-committee, and decided he would recruit some of the quieter committee who he saw were sympathetic towards him.\u00A0 He was determined to provide the means for fuel to his friends and fellow Kerbinauts who were waiting for a way to refuel their station without incurring the wrath of the committee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the 1st items produced by the research department following the injection of data provided by Megwin, was an advanced grabbing unit.\u00A0 Valentina knew this was just what she needed on the ship she would build.\u00A0 A ship capable of reaching solar orbit and matching orbits with Jebediah\u0027s ship to\u00A0refuel, so that Jebediah could maintain his dignity and fly home under his own power.\u00A0 The small team of engineers she had recruited to assist her were driven mercilessly despite complaints that they were being pushed too hard, and construction of the JR Mk 1 began.\u00A0 Complaints were made and ignored that there simply wasn\u0027t enough time to properly calculate fuel requirements, and no-one seemed to notice that this \u0022unkerbaled\u0022 craft had a Mk1-3 command pod at the top.\u00A0 The crafty Valentina had discuised the pod with the advanced grabbing

noticed that Valentina was missing from the Command Centre during the launch.\u00A0 The engineer sitting at the remote control panel noticed a slight delay between his commands and the response from the ship, but it never occurred to him that the delay was caused because Valentina\u00A0was on the ship madly trying to respond to the engineers commands making it look like there was a remote control

the early years of the Space Program really paid off for Valentina\u00A0as she effortlessly guided the rocket along a perfect gravity burn as she took the ship into orbit.\u00A0 The engineer at the remote control panel\u00A0 felt rather pleased with himself as the rocket seemed to take a path far closer to the perfect liftoff than he had ever been able to achieve in all his years in the space program.\u00A0 He felt sure the kerbinauts would accept him more now, even though he had never been in a rocket before. He was quite shocked when Valentine\u0027s face appeared on the video feed on his control panel. That panel only lights up when activated by a pilot on the launching ship... but that means...\u0022Chief! Abort! Abort! the rocket has a stowaway!\u0022 the chief replied - \u0022Abort authorized\u0022 but when the engineer pressed the abort button, Valentina\u00A0grinned mischievously, and said \u0022you don\u0027t think I thought of that when my team built this ship?\u00A0 I\u0027ll be back\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was nothing anyone in the control center could do now but hope and pray,\u00A0 The JR Mk 1 was in the hands of their most experienced pilot.\u00A0 The engineers who built the rocket, however, were concerned.\u00A0 They had not had sufficient time to properly calculate deltaV requirements, or to calculate optimal transfer nodes.\u00A0 they could only hope that their calculations scaled to solar orbit distances.\u00A0 Of course such a flight would take time, so they had plenty of time now to perform proper simulations and find more accurate data for all the required burns.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the Rover Sub-Committee

a rover.\u00A0 This meant he had to leave his\u00A0 team secretly building a mining ship to their own devices.\u00A0 So the rover was transported to the mun and landed on the Mun surface near the equator about 50k\u0027s west of the North west crater.\u00A0 WIth a scientest and pilot abord, the rover headed towards the North West Crater collecting science at lowlands and midlands along the way.\u00A0 The journey was tedious as the rover became unstable above 15m/s.\u00A0 after collecting science in the north west crater, the 2 intrepid kerbins headed north across the crater aiming for the polar crater.\u00A0 Along the way they experienced a solar eclipse as never before witnessed by kerbinkind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n{Kerbal Archivist,

finding the terrain on the pole very mountainous, they decided to go no further than necessary to collect the science data, and then headed west to find a highland crater that scans had shown.\u00A0 Upon arriving at the highland crater, they found a steep decent to the bottom would be required.\u00A0 Megwin was carefully monitoring their progress from the space station and radioed down that he did not consider it safe to take the rover down the steep slope, but the 2 kerbins on the rover had been driving for hours on end and were feeling reckless.\u00A0 They felt they had a far better

Two Kerbinauts, Gary and Frank, today lost their lives in service of the Saving Jebediah foundation.

The circumstances of their deaths is still being investigated, but it is understood by our corespondent, that the brave young Kerbinauts were attempting a dangerous science mission when their craft lost control as it was being manoeuvred into\u00A0a crater. Several low fly overs have confirmed no survivors. A recovery mission will be scheduled once a suitably experienced pilot can be located. This is a major setback to the Jebediah Rescue program. And questions are being asked about whether we can continue to risk further lives for one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TanDeeJay","CreatedById":188578,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-01T11:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mood in the Kerbal Space Center was sombre.\u00A0 Two Kerbals had lost their lives, Valentina was millions of miles away on a crazy rescue mission, and Jebediah was still stuck in space.\u00A0 This was a low point for everyone.\u00A0 There would be an inquiry, and all further work on the program would be halted until the findings from the inquiry were released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the inquiry, it came out that the Munar station was out of fuel, and that a mining operation was being planned by Megwin.\u00A0 \u00A0It was determined that too many corners had been cut trying to rush through missions.\u00A0 A new rover should be designed with additional stability.\u00A0 The Mining operation should be endorsed and made an official part of the Kerbal Space Program, after all, having a station around the Mun that could refill itself sounded like a great idea, and was a boost to the morale of everyone in the space program.\u00A0 After the months of the inquiry, activity started up again at the Kerbal Space centre.\u00A0 The Kerbals in orbit around the Mun breathed a collective sigh of relief.\u00A0 Their future was no longer in doubt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe staff kerbaling the tracking station got back to work to see where Valentina\u0027s flight was.\u00A0 One of the mathematicians remembered that Valentina had requested them to recalculate the orbital transfer nodes and burn data for the Jebediah Intercept burn.\u00A0 After several late nights and many calculations, he worked out that the initial rushed calculations were within 1% of the correct values, but at solar distances that would leave Valentina more than 1000Km away from Jebediahs craft.\u00A0 Unfortunately, the correction burns should have been made 6 months ago in the middle of the inquiry, and Valentina was due to rendezvous with Jebediah in about 5 days.\u00A0 Valentina would have only enough fuel to return home, and would not be able to correct her course.\u00A0 He grabbed his calculations an ran as fast as he could to the tracking station to request an urgent transmission to Valentina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter her launch, Valentina knew the burn calculations were not as accurate as they could be, but she was confident her hand picked mathematician would have the time to calculate more accurate orbital maneuvers, and more importantly, have time to feed the new calculations into the KSP simulator program to confirm the updated data.\u00A0 She was unconcerned, as it would be a year before she needed to perform the 1st burn.\u00A0 \u00A0This was going to be a long journey, so she pulled out her favourite book \u0022Harry Kerman and the philosophers stone\u0022.\u00A0 the plan was simple... Get into solar orbit, adjust orbit to be inside Jebediah\u0027s, lots more waiting... burn to intercept Jebediah... more waiting (and wishing real life had a warp mode like the KSP simulator..)\u00A0 then retrograde burn to intercept Jebediah, Then grab Jebediahs ship with the advanced grabbing unit the research centre had produced, and then transfer fuel to Jebediah\u0027s ship and then for all to return home safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could go wrong? There was plenty of time for the updated burn data to be transmitted.\u00A0 If only these rockets had bigger onboard computers, she would be able to re-calculate that data herself.\u00A0 In the early days, they had loads of paper in the craft and they would have done the calculations themselves, but these days, the builders were so confident with the simulator calculations that they left out any mechanism for manually performing calculations. If only she had Jebediah\u0027s ship.\u00A0 His was of an era that was well stocked with all the necessary log tables and work books for manually performing all the orbital mathematics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Valentina approached the 1st maneuver node with no updated data from Kerbin, she made another request in her daily transmission to Kerbin for the updated data.\u00A0 The reply back was that there was no updates to the flight plan.\u00A0 there was no indication at all of the upheavals occuring within the space program back on Kerbin.\u00A0 Valentina performed the burn as planned and then went back to her daily routine of passing the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain Valentina was approaching the maneuver node that should put her\u00A0ship on an intercept course with Jebediah, and she put in the same request as before for updated data, receiving back the same reply.\u00A0 anyone could have thought there was a robot at the other end as the response was word for word the same as for the approach to the previous maneuver node.\u00A0 Valentina could not believe that the initial calculations were still valid, and she was sure there was something wrong, but without the means of performing the calculations herself, she had to trust the data she had, so she performed the burn as planned, and then sat back to wait again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, Valentina was approaching the point where she needed to perform the retrograde burn to bring her to a complete stop relative to Jebediah.\u00A0 \u00A0As\u00A0she begins the burn as planned, a voice breaks into the cabin over the radio.\u00A0 For half a moment she hoped it was Jebediah, but she knew he was unaware of this rescue attempt, and was not likely to be wasting his power transmitting.\u00A0 The voice was one she had not heard since before she left kerbin.\u00A0 It was the voice of the mathematician she had charged with confirming her maneuver data. \u0022ABORT ABORT ABORT\u0022\u00A0 The call that no kerbinaut wanted to hear, especially after spending several years traveling somewhere and then being within a stones thow of your destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is KSP to Valentina Kerbin, ABORT ABORT ABORT.\u00A0 By the time you receive this transmission, you should be slowing down relative to Jebediah Kermin.\u00A0 The original calulations are wrong.\u00A0 You are still over 1000km away from Jebediah. you don\u0027t have sufficient fuel to make the necessary corrections and then return safely home.\u00A0 ABORT ABORT ABORT.\u00A0 Included with this transmission is all the maneuver data required for your safe return to Kerbin.\u0022\u00A0 The transmission then proceeded to relate to Valentina everything that had occurred since she had left.\u00A0 Valentina realized that leaving Kerbin was a mistake.\u00A0 Without her at the helm, the Jebediah Rescue Committee was incompetent, and she needed to get back to Kerbin as quickly as she could if there was any hope of progressing the rescue effort.\u00A0 So she programmed the updated maneuver data into the onboard computer, for the long journey home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TanDeeJay","CreatedById":188578,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-03T12:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe atmosphere in the Kerbal Space Centre

the rover crew by the time Valentina returned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mining team successfully landed on the Mun and filled their ore tanks with ore, and in the rush to satisfy the committee with full Munar station fuel tanks launched in the wrong direction and after attaining low mun orbit, they ran out of fuel trying to correct their orbit in preparation for docking with the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when Valentina walked into the Kerbal Space Centre after returning from her mission, she was not happy to discover the state the committee had managed to get things in\u2026 2 more kerbals stranded without fuel, a rover in orbit with no pilots\u2026 She was not happy! \u00A0The committee sheepishly assigned the committee leadership back to Valentina in the hope that she would be able to restore order to the chaos they had created. \u00A0One look at the plans for the mining ship, and Valentina could immediately tell that it would require hundreds of trips between the mun and the station to fill the stations tanks, as the ship would require most of the fuel it generated to be able to make the next trip, so she ordered a bigger ship that could create its own fuel. \u00A0One terrified junior communications officer was too scared to report a nutter who had been using KSP radio frequencies claiming to be Jebediah. \u00A0After all, on Jebediahs last known orbit, it would be several years before Jebediah was due to be close enough to Kerbin to make radio contact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina insisted that she be the pilot to fly the new Mining ship to the Mun as she was still furious at the lack of progress while she was away, and was not inclined to trust anyone. \u00A0The committee were still terrified of Valentina since they failed her so badly, so they let her have her way, and soon the Mining ship was on its way and landed on the Mun with its teeth sunk into the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

all 4 conversion programs at once. \u00A03 concurrent programs was the limit it could handle before the operating temperature started to rise above the optimal operating temperature. \u00A0Still, the fuel tanks were filling, and soon the ship would be full of both fuel and ore ready to return to the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe return to the Mun space station was uneventful, but Valentina found the ship maneuvered \u00A0like a cow and it took longer to dock than she had ever taken before. \u00A0Once docked, both convert-o-trons were activated while Valentina called a meeting of the crew who had been manning the station. \u00A0She found they were very likable and were full of ideas. \u00A0These were Kerbals who had been away from the committee since they had come to the station. \u00A0They remained free of their influence. \u00A0They had ideas. \u00A0Their ideas were good!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey wanted to do the science collection with a hopper that could get in and out of each zone on the mun. \u00A0But to do it efficiently they wanted to change the orbit of the space station to a polar orbit. \u00A0This would reduce the need to do inclination burns to get to each zone, also a smaller ore transport that didn\u2019t have to carry the weight of the convert-o-tron if it could be designed with a fuel tank big enough to lift off from the mun with a full load of ore, and then return to the mun without needing to refuel before it left the station, it could refuel from the mining ship which could be left on the mun to continue to mine and create fuel. \u00A0The crew could be rotated so that no one got complacent being stuck in the one job for too long.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrust began to build between Valentina and these valiant kerbals. \u00A0Valentina decided to allow one of them to pilot the ship back down, but 1st they would change the inclination of the station to a polar orbit. \u00A0The 1st stop for the mining ship on its way back down was to the 2 Kerbals stuck in orbit to refuel them so they could return to the space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina called the Kerbal Space station to relay their

Jebediah calculated the burn required for the\u00A0Munar transfer burn just as the mathematitions had instructed him, and fed the coordinates into his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E computer. \u00A0if his calculations were right, this would put him within 200km of the Mun. \u00A0Closer than any Kerbal had ever been. \u00A0The excitement level was very high both in Jebediah\u0027s rocket and also in the control center. Jebediah aimed his rocket in the direction that his calculations indicated and sat back and waited for the burn countdown timer to expire, when he hit full throttle. \u00A0This would be quite a long burn and no one had ever tested the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems ability to maintain stability over such a long burn. \u00A0He carefully counted down the seconds until he had to cut the throttle, then checked his new orbit, to confirm that he would pass within the desired distance from the Mun. \u00A0He requested confirmation from the Kerbal Space center of his new orbit, and they confirmed that he was within acceptable margin of error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah then proceeded to calculate another maneuver node required for the Munar Injection burn, and programmed the coordinates into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system. \u00A0He now had a long wait before anything else needed doing, so he explored the ship that the engineers had built for this epic journey. He wasn\u0027t quite sure what the engineers had in mind when they had stocked one of the store cupboards full of orbital mechanic textbooks, and note paper, and even the full specifications of the ship he was in and an operations manual. \u00A0Did they think he would forget how to fly? or maybe they wanted him to write down every last thing he observed so that someone could write an epic space opera about \u0022Kerbals in Space\u0022. \u00A0Yeah! Jebediah liked the sound of that. \u00A0So he spent a good part of the next day thinking about who could be part of the story. \u00A0He had just got to imagining Kerbals having to perform a space rescue to the Mun because someone had forgotten to top up the tank before lift off, and his ship ran out of fuel on touchdown on the Mun, when his manouver alarm sounded draging him back to reality. \u00A0It took him a moment to remember what the alarm was for and suddenly remembered the Munar Injection burn so he pounced on the control pannel and hit full throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was close,\u0022 thought Jebediah, as he sat back and watched the burn timer slowly count down the seconds to the end of the burn. \u00A0At 1st, he thought it strange that the countdown timer was counting down so slowly. \u00A0Did time move at a different speed this far from the Mun? \u00A0perhaps gravity afected reality? as the timer reached the halfway point, it seemed to slow even further. \u00A0When the deltaV indicator started moving the wrong direction, Jebediah started to realise something was wrong. \u00A0Had he missed a step? he carefully did a mental walk through of everything he\u0027d done. \u00A0Suddenly he realised that he\u0027d forgotten to press the 1 button that would align his ship for the Munar Injection Burn. He was firing his rocket in the wrong direction. \u00A0In a panic, he stabbed the maneuver node selector button, and he felt his ship jerk as the reaction wheels kicked in to rotate his ship by nearly 90 degrees, but as he looked at his fuel guage, he realised he had let the rocket burn for far too long, and suddenly there was nothing more he could do. \u00A0The guage was reading empty, and he just heard the roar of the rocket engine die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a deathly silence in the cabin. Suddenly the radio burst to life \u0022Jebediah, the tracking station just reported that your ship was mis-aligned when you started the Munar Injection Burn. \u00A0Are you ok?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I just ran out of fuel and you ask \u0027am i ok?\u0027\u0022 no im not ok, I\u0027ve no idea where I am, and I have no fuel, its my own fault, I got carried away thinking about a space opera I could write, and forgot to select the maneuver node button.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t panic! \u00A0We\u0027ll work out what to do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah then spent the next few hours reliving the past day. \u00A0Trying to see if there was someone else he could blame, but he could not escape the truth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor days his ship traveled further away from the Mun, and for days, the space center kept telling him they would figure out something. \u00A0Just as his radio was starting to get to the limit of his range, he heard Valentina\u0027s voice saying to him \u0022Don\u0027t give up Jebediah! I\u0027m \u0026lt;crackle crackle\u0026gt; team that will work out how to \u0026lt;crackle crackle crackle\u0026gt;.....\u0022 at that point Reception dropped out, but hearing Valentina\u0027s voice had given him hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could Valentina do? Here he was stuck in a ship with empty liquid fuel and oxidizer tanks, and a nearly full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank. \u00A0And what could he do with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters? They were designed to allow maneuvering but what if he could harness the monopropellant? Could he funnel it somehow into his main rocket engine? How much thrust could he get out of it? Would it provide him enough deltaV to return to Kerbin? He pulled out the spaceship operations manual and started to flick through it until he found the part about maneuvering. \u00A0As he had never performed any docking maneuvers in space, he was somewhat unfamiliar with maneuvering, and was pleased that his thrusters had directional operations that might be able to be used to perform any orbital changes... great! But he had no information on how much deltaV he could hope to squeeze out of his monopropellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo he found he had 2 tasks that would occupy him for some time. \u00A0 He had to calculate his current orbit, and figure out how much deltaV he had available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccurate orbital calculations would take some time as he had to do everything with pen and paper, and initially, he had to triangulate his position. \u00A0Everyday he took readings to locate his position, and each day, the new position readings enabled him to improve the accuracy of his orbital calculation. \u00A0It was 3 months before Jebediah was satisfied with the accuracy of his orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe then spent the next 6 months trying to calculate an orbital change maneuver that would bring him within the atmosphere of Kerbin, he finally found a location where the required deltaV was low enough to fall within the capabilities of his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. \u00A0It was going to take 14 years to get to his calculated maneuver node. \u00A0Jebediah earnestly hoped that Valentina could find a way to get him back sooner, but without radio contact, there was no way he could find out what they were up to, nor could he let the space centre know of his own solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next few years were un-eventful except for 1 incident when early one \u0022morning\u0022 Jebediah\u0027s radio burst to life \u0022This is KSP to Valentina Kerbin, ABORT ABORT ABORT...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah thought \u0022What?!?\u0022 Then it occurred to him, that Valentina was somewhere in this region of space trying to rescue him. \u00A0He immediately jumped up and started scanning the sky trying to find Valentina, but as he listened to the rest of the radio transmission, he realized she was still too far away for him to be able to see. \u00A0He didn\u0027t even know what direction to point his antenna to send a signal to Valentina. \u00A0As he heard the end of the transmission telling Valentina to return home, he knew that his plan was the only one that was going to work. \u00A0But if the space centre had a transmitter powerful enough to reach him here, why hadn\u0027t they been transmitting to him all along? \u00A0The answer to that question would have to wait until he got back. \u00A0Jebediah was determined to make his plan work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon reaching his calculated maneuver node, he carefully aligned his ship with the maneuver marker (never again would he make the mistake that got him out here), pushed on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster control for the calculated time, and then took more position calculations. \u00A0it would take a few more readings to confirm his orbital change, but from this moment on, he was outside of KSP\u0027s ability to rescue. \u00A0He had changed his orbit, and unless the Space program had improved their tracking station, they would not know of his new orbit, so if they sent any more rescue missions, they would not find him where they expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalculations taken in the following days and weeks confirmed for Jebediah that his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E burn had him targeted to within the atmosphere of Kerbin. \u00A0He still had sufficient monopropellant that he could adjust as he got closer if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 years after departing Kerbin, Jebediah was finally within radio range of Kerbin, so he put in a call \u0022KSP, KSP, KSP, this is Jebediah Kerman checking in\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who are you? Please get off this channel, this is a private channel,\u0022 came back the reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah was shocked. He checked his radio to make sure it was transmitting on the correct channel, and tried again; \u0022Kerbal Space Center, Come in Kerbal Space Center.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is the Kerbal Space Center. \u00A0You are transmitting on a private channel, please stop. \u00A0We could receive a transmission from any of our Kerbinauts currently in space, and we need to keep this channel clear\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am one of your #@\u0026amp;!* Kerbinauts currently in space. \u00A0I\u0027ve been here for 16 years. \u00A0I was flying planes before you were born. \u00A0Put me onto Valentina\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry Valentina is not available at the moment. She is off planet. \u00A0Now please stop transmitting on this channel. \u00A0Jebediah\u0027s current orbit does not put him in radio range of kerbal for another 5 years, you can\u0027t possibly be Jebediah.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am Jebediah, and when I get back on Kerbin, I\u0027ll be having words with your supervisor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah threw his hands up in exasperation, and decided he was just going to have to land and make his own way back to the space center. \u00A0He was just hoping his parachute was still functional after 16 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral days later, there were many reported sightings of a ball of orange light in the sky. \u00A0The Kerbal Space Centre claimed an uncharted meteorite burning up on re-entry. \u00A0Some fisherkerbals who were out on the high sea trying to catch a fabled kraken noticed a command pod hanging below a parachute falling towards the sea, and cranked up their engines to try and get close enough to the pod\u0027s landing to be able to witness the recovery of a ship returned from space. \u00A0By the time they reached the touchdown location, they found that there was no recovery crew, only a single command pod with Kerbinaut sitting on top waving at them trying to get their attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRather than sitting back and witness a recovery, the fisherkerbals realized that the kerbinaut was calling out to them, so they approached, and the kerbinaut announced \u0022I\u0027m Jebediah Kerman, back from around the sun. \u00A0Thank-you for picking me up, can you take me to the Kerbal Space Centre please\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon arriving at the Kerbal Space Centre, Jebediah went straight to the Administration building, and knocked on the door to the Directors Office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Jebediah entered the office, the Director said \u0022Jebediah?

We were trying to cut down on the number of refueling trips for science advancement, so that we could save you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb replied; \u0022Well, don\u0027t stop advancing science just because I\u0027m back now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah had an idea, \u0022Hey Director, \u00A0don\u0027t go too hard on the young comms officer. \u00A0But can I have a little bit of fun with him? \u00A0Can you get me a two-way radio, and then walk up to the Comms officer while I hide in this room with the radio.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe director smirked as he realized what Jebediah wanted to do, and agreed to the plan, and found a radio for Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe director walked up to the comms officer while Jebediah called on the radio \u0022KSP, KSP, KSP, this is Jebediah Kerman checking in\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe office turned around and saw the director. \u00A0\u0022Director, there is an idiot claiming to be Jebediah on the radio again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let me handle this,\u0022 said the director. \u00A0The director takes the radio, and presses the local transmit button saying; \u0022Jebediah, welcome back to Kerbin! Come on down!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this queue, Jebediah stepped out of his hiding space and approached the communications console. \u0022Director\u0022, said Jebediah. \u0022Jeb,\u0022 said the director, and they hugged like two friends who had not seen each other in years. \u00A0The poor comms officer looked on in confusion and embarrassment.

Then radioed back to the engineer. \u00A0\u0022All shutdown now. how is your situation now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineer replied \u0022The fuel loss has stopped now, but you won\u0027t be able to transfer anymore fuel until I can examine the entire system. \u00A0Let me get the rest of the crew to assist, this will take some time\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the Kerbal Orbit Space station crew distracted looking for a non-existent leak, Valentina took the opportunity to undock and prepare for the riskiest maneuver she had ever performed. \u00A0She was going to try to land as close to the Kerbal Space Center as she possibly could, and her ship did not have any heat shields or parachutes, so she would need to slow down enough to safely enter the atmosphere within the safe confines of the ship, and then abandon the ship and use her own parachute for the final decent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina carefully lowered her orbit to 90k, and was thankful that the Kerbin Orbit station was in a prograde orbit, she would not need to change her orbital plane to meet the Kerbal Space center. \u00A0Never having attempted a reentry like this, Valentina was not totally sure of when to begin the final decent burn to land her on the space centre, so she started the retrograde burn at her estimated point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith full power on, Valentina watched her orbital speed decrease as her altitude decreased, and she hoped her calculations were correct and that by the time she entered the atmosphere, her speed would be low enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zg80Bc3J4F7aI-Gf2cduJD_eQ0c5jbKu5YNf40q_\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zg80Bc3J4F7aI-Gf2cduJD_eQ0c5jbKu5YNf40q_j5WOi3rbRuCBT-v_4ypTrjYIDmdVlEfIeOmYII8BbeTXML62bNSVNDNzcWYkbFiHH-ZH3iLIwTrOm43IctArH7FICYIM6mn2w9JI_Devirectpolp8_sffwtpmiOaD53n5aR_1_RCV87glMibTjanHwCjrgL7cbeTUWDgZZWQRNmPiILtyQaL_Froa4jw4-S7r34nPhdmcIogbfp9DbviiPSdNrWjJ115WWTAG_q04BZOHRIYplOCWm0Kl07EwPQwHBLWWehPVrZmR88SprZ969tmAky1ZxHPQrNyrZUQYdqS8PcEvnnIAK_mc9RQFqL80v3Xvt0cVur4SZfqXlketOug8m5AK9oPT_1Kw6nZAICO-ibkS1i7u8ioyUQ9UJsHcV9CjUpCxH47ArMPuJyD-wrsLPxCK5HdO3cs7ylpMNtbToRbTKBCf5wWco6KB4BJ0v25r9oBlAxyqmk6gh4YiGfiVxFRjbOAHY0OQx8PEUWOxvnY4_u86_7DOeT-cSHWZ7mu9lyOaMHGDw9bOKDks6pTNIbhBlQvwJeq6eXz9AMOhNGCJuUUGG_xgDFDGh9L2b2vAlhOHk3W7xHUpoaXQrvZsVo1av3niQ5pGvlxfadzmj4VXq0jOyMyJHlKfUh0X1EZ4zssMcLTBZ6J_LknGavTmR06uCTsg4bcDlhMEX4tv8_Pw=w1684-h947-no\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===#===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, on the Kerbin Orbit Space station, everyone had heard the distinctive clank as Valentina disengaged the docking clamp. \u00A0What was Valentina thinking? \u00A0Her ship had no way of re-entering the atmosphere. \u00A0so an emergency call was put through to the Kerbal Space Center notifying of the situation. \u00A0The Tracking station immediately when into action to determine Valentina\u0027s orbit. \u00A0They watched as her orbit was lowered to 90k. \u00A0Suddenly, Jebediah said \u0022I know what she is attempting! She is going to try to re-enter using her rocket engines to slow down, and then to use her own parachute to safely reach land. \u00A0Where is she going to come down? we need a recovery crew!\u0022 \u00A0But no-one knew the flight plan so they didn\u0027t know where to send any recovery crews. \u00A0All they could do was watch and wait. \u00A0Everyone in the Space Centre crowded into and around the tracking station to watch events unfold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon, the tracking engineer announced that Valentinas ship was changing orbit again. \u00A0The rate of orbital change indicated her rockets were firing at full power with the ship in a retrograde attitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe director shouted \u0022She\u0027ll burn up on re-entry! what does she think she\u0027s doing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was silence for about a minute, when a voice piped up \u0022No! I don\u0027t believe it! Jebediah\u0027s right! I\u0027ve just done the math, and at her current burn rate, her velocity will be below 600m/s by the time she hits the atmosphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother voice piped up \u0022I hope her parachute was packed correctly!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where\u0027s she going to land?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002230-40km due west of the Space centre\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah said \u0022Is there a rover in this center?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomone said \u0022yes, there is a Rover Mk3 in the space plane hanger waiting for a test run\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah bolted! \u00A0Valentina would be on the ground before he could get there, but he was determined to be there for Valentina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---===#===---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s fuel ran out while she was still at 25k. \u00A0She looked out the window and could see the lights of the Kerbal Space Center on the horizon. \u00A0Damn! she was going to be about 40k\u0027s short. \u00A0It would be a long walk back to the Space Station. \u00A0She was wishing now that she had organised for someone to pick her up. \u00A0No matter, there was nothing she could do about that now.
