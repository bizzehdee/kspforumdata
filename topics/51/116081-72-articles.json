They are both seeing imagery through the eyes of the other. The fact that Kenlie writes fiction (both Kenlies actually) has nothing to do with the existence of the devices or ships or the Kerbulans. I think it only makes him sensitive to seeing the images from his opposite number.  \n\nThat\u0027s why I think it\u0027s ominous.

Both images (the one Bob Kerman is staring at and the one Bob Kermulan is staring at) at are taken at precisely the same zoom and focal point, and so in each one Moho ends up being too close to the sun to be rendered.
