Cool realistic features like safety (what astronaut would settle for less) and mobility (an astronaut can sit in a can at home) all cost Primary Score. I couldn\u0027t find a good reason to weigh one against the other.\n\nWhile watching Kubrick\u0027s Dr Strangelove I was inspired to an all out Primary Score effort.\n\n**SAY NO TO A RED DUNA! DASH 4 DUNA**\n\nIn a UN speech the Krussian Premier Khrushchev drunkenly boasts \u0022We will bury you!\u0022. The incident is widely reported and the world laughs at our impotence.\n\n...\n\nA spy within the Komunist space program reports the Krussians have advanced plans for a permanent Duna base of unknown size.\n\n...\n\nSecretary State Kissinger advises the President that \u0027we cannot afford a red Duna! we must preempt the Krussians with our own even more ambitious program!\u0027 - How ambitious? \u0027we just don\u0027t know, we\u0027ll have to go all out\u0027\n\n...\n\nPresident KFJ addresses the nation setting out an ambitious new space program: \u0022We chose to do this thing, and some others, not because it makes sense - but because we must be first\u0022\n\n...\n\nGeneral Keck Turgidson is appointed to head the program. Engineering says it can deliver on two of fast, cheap, and safe. Gen Keck practically explodes out of his chair \u0022Two? Two! You WILL deliver three - fast, fast, and fast!

Transit supplies are designed to be consumed en-route and jettisoned, Xe for the transfer burn and RCS for the crew. The first image is the payload-less thruster and heat shield Duna-Kerbin return configuration.\n\nFor those not familiar with low thrust transfers here is the flight profile:\n\n- I used alexmoon\u0027s transfer calculator ([http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/)) to know what to expect and when to time the initial burn to have the pre-escape orbit close to the right angle.\n- Make a series of few minute burns, for my craft about 3.5 mins for 80 m/s delta v each burn.\n- After about 9 of these and 4 Kerbin days your orbit is Ap-ing near Munn distance and you are ready for the final burn.\n- I just picked the simple method of setting a maneuver node in the middle of the \u0027falling to Kerbin\u0027 side (where everything is still happening slowly) then tweaking time to start the burn and the delta v to get an encounter.\n- Finally burn for ages, after SOI adjust, fine turn on Duna approach, fine fine tune in Duna SOI for aerocapture.\n- Aerocapture with Ap between 50 \u0026 100 km, you will impact after the Ap.\n- After the capture you can use the atmosphere to lower your orbit without needing the heat shield, the thrusters will be doing this.\n- Jettison the shield and half the thrusters, they dock and thrust as a unit to get a safe Pe. Each thruster will have about half a Xe tank left - enough to get home.\n- Tune the payload Pe so that it will land where you want, I went for Lon 84 in the big flat smooth depression south of the volcano.\n- Jettison the remaining thrusters, they will thrust to a safe Pe \u0026 rendezvous with their siblings and the heat shield.\n- Open the chutes, at the \u0027last possible moment\u0027 burn the landing engine for a soft landing.\n\nI\u0027m doing a Kerbin-Duna transfer one launch before and one after the Hohmann window, so 3 transfers each window. I can tune the payload by trading off Supplies for Xe depending on how much delta/v is required.\n\nSoft landings are via a combination of parachute and Rockomax 48-7S with minimal fuel. I started out with 4 radial parachutes per Hitchhiker for a fully passive landing costing 600kg, but a single chute slows it to about 25m/s and needing only a little burn at the end. With passive landing I could have independent Hitchhikers, but I was aiming for something flyable so I thought to stick them together and then found they needed less than one chute each. I settled on about 1 chute \u0026 1 engine per pair, about 250kg for landing. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
