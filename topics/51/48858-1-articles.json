Flight profile calls for a simple vertical ascent, no gravity turn, and without achieving orbit. Ship design will use a simple two-stage rocket to bring the capsule into space, which will then simply fall back into the atmosphere and return to the ground safely via parachute. Once on the ground, crew will go EVA to collect soil samples and report any additional observations. Capsule to then be recovered and studied. \u003Cem\u003EAddendum: As it turns out, Kaerospace engineers have yet to unlock the mysteries of stage separation, therefore this was not a multi-stage rocket.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew:\u003C/strong\u003E Jebediah \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStatus:\u003C/strong\u003E Mission successfully completed; craft not reusable; demerits filed on Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s permanent record\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReport:\u003C/strong\u003E After transmitting a mid-flight observational report, Jeb stayed the course and reached an apoapsis just over 112 Km above the KSC. In violation of mission parameters and without proper authorization, Jeb exited the capsule and completed the first successful EVA; despite the flagrant violation of safety protocols, Mission Control must begrudgingly acknowledge that his observations on this unauthorized expedition nonetheless brought back valuable insight into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn return to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface it was discovered that the 5 parachutes used to slow the descent were inadequate for a completely successful landing, however the capsule managed to touch down undamaged amidst the (really quite beautiful) explosions. Jeb planted a flag to commemorate this historic success, then gathered the required soil sample before returning to the craft to await retrieval.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
