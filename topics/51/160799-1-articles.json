We are based around creating a realistic space program environment. We will include top of the line realistic launch times, conditions, physics, and of course rockets. For instance, say that today the temperature at Cape Canaveral\u00A0is 78 degrees Fahrenheit, this is a nominal launch temperature if we had a launch set for today. We will be using extra\u00A0realisticness by adding in launch timer and event callout. We will also be using others such as booster cams, (no floating cameras), occasional failures, and real development times for new rockets and technology. Any real world satellites or suggestions will be accepted if available\u00A0with our current rocket capabilities. I am running a pretty packed version of Realism Overhaul to meet real world requirements. We primarily specialize in LEO station building, LEO or GSO orbits, as well as NASA related missions. I will mainly be launching from Cape Canaveral, but if required, I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E switcher for maximum performance. I will soon set up a post for real world or \u003Cu\u003Ehighly detailed satellite\u003C/u\u003E suggestions\u00A0as well as, eventually, manned missions. While this is 100% for the fun of it basically, I will, to the best of my knowledge, explain the physics and reasoning behind my designs. I hope everybody enjoys this journey, and without further adue, enjoy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLink to my heroes who inspired me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacex.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spacex.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T09:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks like this is going to end up being reports of missions.
