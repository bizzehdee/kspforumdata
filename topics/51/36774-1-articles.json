That\u0027s because you have to use the heavy manned capsule: you\u0027re going to lose 95% of your speed to low-altitude drag, so the low-drag capsule is a necessity over the much lighter probe core. You also can\u0027t attach anything to it: it turns out that once you get into the neighborhood of thousand-G impulses, things start to tear off. While attempting to solve these problems, I ended up creating the vessel I dubbed Plaid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zR38VUa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zR38VUa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lqv8AGX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lqv8AGX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaid is a mere 300 parts, loading in seconds. It\u0027s basically a line of struts with decouplers stuck on the bottom, and a detatchable probe core. The RCS block is instantly annihilated by the acceleration, but it looks pretty at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m sure you\u0027re eager to get to the whole \u0027Mun in 13 seconds\u0027 thing I mentioned in the title.

Plaid is leaving Kerbin at nearly a million meters per second. This is possible because Plaid is built with a strut as its core piece: the probe core is left behind on the ground, meaning all of the decoupler force transfers into those virtually weightless struts, accelerating them to completely insane speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Plaid isn\u0027t just shooting off into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dm1kgvN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dm1kgvN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/syUExQe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022syUExQe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaid has a destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2vyYYoc.png\u0022 alt=\u00222vyYYoc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s going there very, very fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yP0aF87.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yP0aF87.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kaUyFcZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kaUyFcZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z3yj2In.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z3yj2In.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it.
