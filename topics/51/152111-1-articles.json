Ares I and Ares II left\u00A0about a month apart and arrived at the red planet about 10 days apart. Ares I, a ground sample retrieval\u00A0and return mission with a small one person lander. Bold for the first interplanetary mission, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E decided if we were going, we were going to get our money\u0027s worth. Ares II was a much bigger lander, with the main objective of the mission being getting a science lab on the surface. The Ares II crew were going to be the loneliest Kerbals in the solar system until Ares IV came to rescue them 2 years later. They did get a rover\u00A0in the mail a few months later to ease the boredom, though. Ares III went on the next transfer window and was a similar mission\u00A0to Ares II with the only difference being this lander would return to orbit for rendezvous with the rescue ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbum of Ares I \u0026amp; II:\u00A0http://imgur.com/a/91j3l\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings me to today! Got back in the game after a lull and decided to rescue my Kerbals and finish off this mission. I built a big transport ship with a smaller return ship\u00A0that I named the Odin spacecraft. Two pieces assembled in orbit, a habitation and utility module (w/ 2 simple satellites in payload bays,) and a thrust module with 4 nukes and lots of fuel. Here is a photo\u00A0with the payload bay open showing the satellite. Lander docked to the front.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pPjra6X.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pPjra6X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission of Ares IV : rendezvous with Ares III\u00A0in orbit, retrieve Ares II crew with rescue lander,\u00A0orbit Ike, come home!\u00A0Also, put\u00A0one satellite in orbit around Duna and Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YcEpM0U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YcEpM0U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWish there was more excitement, but Ares IV was a complete success!\u00A0The ship had plenty of extra fuel, got into a good orbit, and Ares III rendezvoused without a hitch. Sent the rescue lander down and landed it about 20 km away from the Ares II. A short rover trip later, and after 4\u002B long years away from Kerbin, the crew made contact with another Kerbal.
