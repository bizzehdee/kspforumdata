First failures were during the launch and while planning the transfer maneuver nodes, so it was easy to revert to a pre-launch savegame and not loosing much advance in other parallel missions. The largest part of failures came with the entry on Eve and back to orbit there, and those fails where pills really hard to shallow as they occured more than 100 days after launch, so reverting made me lost a lot of advances in other missions. But also it gave me the opportunity to test some other missions as well and design it better. So finally, when I managed to return the lander module to the Space Station, I was really happy, returning to Kerbin seemed really easy then. But to be true, I didn\u0027t really breathe normally until they entered on Kerbin atmosphere... about 320 days after departing XD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe starting a sandbox to test it all is a really good idea.
