I\u0027ve restarted several playthroughs and been a part\u00A0time lurker on these forums, but now that\u0027s changing. With this career I\u0027ve decided to become more active, particularly with the Mission Reports and general conversations, I might even take on a few challenges within my career. In my entire time with this game I haven\u0027t left Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, but again, I\u0027d like to change that. My mission reports may be inconsistent in their formatting and style, but one thing I\u0027ll try to keep throughout is a track of the money earned from each mission (space exploration is a business, after all), and the science earned from each mission. Without further ado, here is the first instalment, landing on the Mun.**\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Report: Year One, Day 16.\u003Cbr\u003E\n** OPERATION MUNSTRIDER **\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the successes of the Space Program thus far, the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society has allocated funding for the next milestone; to land on the Mun.The recent flybys and sightseeing launches have piqued interest in the planet\u0027s closest natural satellite, and it\u0027s time we landed on it and returned safely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission Objectives:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPRIMARY\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Land 3 Kerbals on Mun\u0027s surface and return them to Kerbin safely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Gather scientific data by performing every available experiment we have currently developed; Materials Bay, Mystery Goo, Barometer, Thermometer, Surface Samples, Crew Report and EVA Report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSECONDARY\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Proof of concept and test run of a reusable lander, able to land on the surface and return to orbit capable of docking with another craft for refuelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Plant flag for FLOOYD Dynamic Research Labs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u0027ve been allocated a 70,560 advance in funding to develop and construct the lander and launch vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch vehicle and lander came in a a total of 54,353.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n*Mission Updates*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Launch went off without a hitch, and Bob, Bill and Val settled into an 85km orbit, before burning out towards Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- An uneventful transfer between Kerbin and Mun, tensions began growing as Mun grew bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Orbital insertion burn to Mun was nominal, and the ship settled into a 20km orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Landing Sequence began, targeting the western edge of the East Farside Crater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Bill reported concerns regarding fuel levels, we ran the numbers and there was cause for concern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Touchdown on Mun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Bob took samples from the crater, performed an EVA report and planted the flag as per the mission objectives. Bill inspected the craft for damages and areas of concern. Val\u0027s mental state deteriorated, Bill\u0027s concerns over the fuel pushed her into a state of panic, she refused to leave the cockpit for fear of being stranded. However, she did manage to fill out a crew report of the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Bob decided to go sightseeing, being a surfer in his spare time he decided to visit a wave-like formation at the edge of the crater. Flight Control was not impressed. He retrieved a surface sample and returned to the ship, spectacularly wiping out on the way, proving the resilience of Kerbalkind and the spacesuits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**CRITICAL MISSION\u00A0UPDATE**\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Low fuel levels, insufficient for return.
