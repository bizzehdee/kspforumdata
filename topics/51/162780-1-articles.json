image.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing an accident report discussing the loss of Bob Kerman, Scientist, and 3 TOURIST (Transient Objective University Researching Interdisciplinary ScientisT) kerbalnauts on High Quarterlander 2, what would have been the 4th kerballed landing on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBackground, Equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Quartermaster 4-Person Capsule had\u00A0been flown\u00A05\u00A0times previously, three times\u00A0balled, and had proven quite capable of safely conducting its crew\u0027s passage on missions lasting up to 79 days, though never flown past ~ 30. \u00A0It was constructed early in the space-program so-as to possess a multi-kerbal capsule capability that was stable and safe for hands-free re-entry. \u00A0The vessel can return from Minmus with a direct-entry periapsis of 20km, though typically the Kerbin return orbit is circularized to spare the crew unnecessary stresses. \u00A0The Agency had suffered no notable failures, and was actively working through a small handful of minor issues to perfect the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch was nominal if low, though orbit was achieved at ~79k/km with no undue concern. \u00A0On service-fairing deployment however it was observed that a fairing panel became hung up on one of the service module\u0027s 4 landing \u0027piers\u0027, and while it soon broke free it took away 2 of the 4 deployable solar panels. \u00A0On panel deployment, it was found that the 2 adjacent panels adequately powered the vessel as well as covering complimentary azimuths, so no mission threat was observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew then endured a ~ 5 day\u00A0stay in orbit while they waited for their\u00A0injection window to Minmus. \u00A0As the 3 crewed flights previously, orbit was maintained with no warnings or\u00A0concerns. \u00A0On day 3 of the mission however during a routine arming and power check it was found that one of the 4 Ant reentry engines was unresponsive, and after troubleshooting Mission Control declared it dead for future mission use. \u00A0Should the re-entry engines be needed, the opposite engine to the fail would be simply deactivated, and so no mission threat was observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the transfer injection window opened a\u00A0particularly precise burn was achieved, with an acceptable 179k Minmus periapsis found with 14 days of transit. \u00A0The crew settled into\u00A0normal transit routine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproximately 2 hours later the capsule reported that power was dangerously low and life support had been disabled. \u00A0Mission Control looked into the matter and found that the solar panels had positive sun angle and the batteries were charging, and so advised the crew to disable their alarms and expect the batteries to be fully charged in less than an hour. \u00A0Orbital geometry saw no reason for this power loss- \u00A0it was well beyond Kerbin\u0027s shadow, and Mun was on the opposite side of the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproximately 3 days later the crew reported lightheadedness. \u00A0Upon investigation it was found that there was a CO2 level of 98%. \u00A0All scrubbers were running and functional, and were observed to be actively lowering the CO2 levels. \u00A0No action was taken by Crew or Control to re-activate the systems, they appeared to be functioning when observed. \u00A0Little could be done, and the crew asphyxiated before the atmosphere could be returned to safe levels. \u00A0The mission was scrubbed, and the capsule safely returned to Kerbin for recovery of the remains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnalysis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft had weathered many orbital shadow periods during her wait with no battery warnings, and the primary solar panel arrays were correctly aligned for use, in addition to the fact that the undamaged secondary capsule panels were deployed normally. \u00A0The burn for Minmus was conducted on the night side of Kerbin, so the batteries before engine ignition were in Discharge. \u00A0On engine ignition, the alternators began charging the batteries. \u00A0During the 150 second burn the batteries\u00A0should have been\u00A0topped off at 2200 units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl supposes that the alternator flow triggered a fault in the computer subsystems, such that the battery regulator was stuck\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elooking for charge from the alternator\u003C/em\u003E, thus not charging once the engine burn concluded and the craft was in solar lux. \u00A0The batteries then drained, and the energy crisis began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl\u0027s conclusion that with the restoration of solar charging all would be corrected resulted in poor instructions being given to the crew and the dire situation developing in the capsule overlooked until remedy was not possible- \u00A0though it is questionable there was any remedy at all. \u00A0The scrubbers were working when examined, and seen to be lowering CO2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedure Updates \u0026amp; Resolutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) \u00A0 The Capsule should have a \u003Cu\u003EManual Purge\u003C/u\u003E feature, to flush the atmosphere in the cabin and allow complete replacement by on-board O2. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEVEN by EVA\u003C/em\u003E the atmosphere cannot be vented, thanks to the high degree of fail-safe engineering in the auto-airlock doors. \u00A0Had the\u00A0craft had this feature, the crew would have survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u00A0 Additional solar panels should be installed and the fairing separation issues corrected, or the soon-to-be developed \u003Cabbr

Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E units should be installed in every crewed vessel to prevent this loss again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) \u00A0 A\u00A0Kerbin orbital test of all ship systems should be conducted, attempting to reproduce failure modes observed, before the craft is again used beyond \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) \u00A0 While a\u00A0timely EVA by Bob would have given him 2 extra hours for the capsule atmosphere to restore, it should be noted however that he declined to do so out of fairness to his 3 crew-mates who could not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSA hopes this analysis will bring some closure to the 4 families and many Agency employees affected, and as well serve to caution other space agencies of potential opportunities for failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-02T04:21:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2017 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by GarrisonChisholm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
