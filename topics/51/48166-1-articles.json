He hops into (one of) the driver\u0027s seat(s) so he can roll the machine out into the open for its first Munar jaunt - it should be noted that the masterminds at the VAB omitted to provide any sort of remote control capability in either vessel, because at what point would that ever come in handy? As such, it\u0027s all in Bill\u0027s hands. Fortunately, this task is an easy one.

No fear! Bill brings to bear the full might of the great practical intellect he decidedly isn\u0027t known for, hops back into the cabin, and lifts up the offending leg. Actually, he lifts up all four legs in the group, as the game refused to have it any other way.

It rate of acceleration makes my grandmother\u0027s Skoda look a Team Audi Le Mans car. Its turning circle and overall maneuverability is narrowly beaten by the Titanic.

Just get out of the immediate vicinity of the landing site. Piece of cake. Funny, it looks like a cliff face in the distance, there. Pretty steep, right? Our rover would never manage such a climb in a million years. Wait a second. There are a lot of cliff-like structures here...almost seeming to go...wait, where exactly did we land?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31907122/ksp01/screenshot368.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot368.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh no. That is the worst place to be...the absolute worst. There\u0027s just about no worse place 50km around that I could have touched down at. How...how am I supposed to get out of this? How? What am I going to DO?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow take note here...getting out really was nearly impossible. By my reckoning I spent 45 minutes freeing this blasted rover from its prison without bars, eternally taunting me with its promise of level ground. Not even 45 minutes of game time...45 minutes of real time, of my life. Driving around the same 10km\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of KSP terrain for that amount of time, always slipping, always falling back down...quickloading endlessly the whole time...never again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31907122/ksp01/screenshot369.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot369.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, after a suicidal 30 m/s run-up to the NNW face of the crater (hill assisted, of course, if the rover could make 30 m/s by itself I\u0027d be having no problems in the first place), we finally reach the promised land. As you can see, Bill even caught some major air (okay, some major vacuum) when he crested the rim. Excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31907122/ksp01/screenshot370.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot370.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill departs with relief from his foe, unaffectionately nicknamed \u003Cem\u003ENemesis Crater\u003C/em\u003E during the ordeal.

Jeb couldn\u0027t make it because he\u0027s in Laythe orbit right now, he radioed that he\u0027d be back in time for Khristmas.
