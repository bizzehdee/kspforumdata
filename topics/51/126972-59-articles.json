[insert your excuse of choice].\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really am\u00A0getting\u00A0things back on track here.\u00A0So much of 2017\u00A0was eaten up preparing for and then taking a\u00A0month-long road trip\u00A0through the Western US (in August),\u00A0and then\u00A0returning to find the Shire seriously Scoured and Houston seriously Flooded. Free time? Whazzat? Well, now I\u0027m finally finding said free time, just... not the energy. Too much ill\u0027n going around in 2018. And the weather needs to calm the eff down, if only to allow my head a few days to clear.\u00A0(It was in the mid 70s yesterday and it\u0027s 37 right now on my patio with a daytime high of 40-something.... I just don\u0027t even.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, this already rambling post is actually something of a mission report.\u00A0This past week I launched the first craft in the Forgotten Space Program save since May of 2017. (Everything I\u0027ve done since May used\u00A0craft already launched; in some cases craft I launched four years ago.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept what I should really say is: This past week I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eattempted\u003C/em\u003E to launch the first craft in the Forgotten Space Program save since May of 2017, only to discover that maybe those engines are\u00A0a bit gimbley-wobbly, and\u00A0maybe I wasn\u0027t actually using the kOS script I thought I was,\u00A0and maybe building a rocket isn\u0027t really as simple as I once thought it was (aka: BARIRASAIOTIW). For a few minutes\u00A0I wasn\u0027t entirely unconvinced\u00A0I hadn\u0027t\u00A0accidentally loaded Forgotten in my install of KSP that includes BARIS..., or maybe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Turns out I\u0027d just forgotten how to fly a forgotten rocket. And used the wrong kOS script. And left the gimbal range of my engines at 100%, which always leads to fiery death. Mucho rust to shake off here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with those troubles behind me I can safely say that\u00A0everything is updated for KSP v1.3.1, everything works,\u00A0and you\u0027ll get to read more about all of that\u00A0in the next week or so. (Of course KSP v1.4.0 and Making History are just around the corner.\u00A0I\u0027m so deep in the Mods on this save that I\u00A0expect it\u0027ll\u00A0be April\u00A0before everything is updated and I can start using said expansion in this save. Or maybe The Machine will decide to change some things....)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, long story short: Next update isn\u0027t ready, I\u0027m too beat to be able to write what needs to be written right now, and it\u0027s bloody cold here. Here\u0027s some screenshot candy to tide you over until said post is actually\u00A0ready.

All four members of the Sulphur 5 crew were glad to be free of the strange little moon, and each avoided discussing the severe anomaly encountered at the monolith. In an unusual departure from his norm, Macfred omitted mention of it from his daily report to Kerbin.

It was discarded once empty, and left in its lonely circuit around the tiny moon. Simulations suggested it would be ejected from the Joolian system many years later, after countless perturbations from Tylo, Vall, and Laythe. The Sulphur 5\u0027s engines burned a final time in a higher Bop orbit (mostly to account for inclination), and the conjoined shuttles were cast back into Jool\u0027s mighty arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock had cooked up a nice surprise for the transfer down to Laythe. After experimenting with a few options, he discovered one which used a whip around Tylo and placed them into a near-approach at Laythe. Aside from the escape burn they had just finished, another short burn to gain 264m/s in space near Tylo was all they required to reach Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Thomlock had visions of writing a book entitled \u0022Abusing Orbital Mechanics for Fun and Profit\u0022, only to realize the futility of it as memories of such a book to be lost to the Cycles.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170917_ksp0420_tylo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170917_ksp0420_tylo.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis 238km approach to Tylo was the closest they would come to a Jool 5 award. Gletrix once more suggested they create a new award called the Jool 4.5. This suggestion was later revised down to a Jool 4.25, as they had only flown past Tylo, not captured into an orbit. (They were within a few dozen meters per second of a capture, but they needed to spend their precious potential in the opposite direction.) They all jokingly agreed this was now a Jool 4 and 1/4 mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObservations of Tylo were limited, both by their high-altitude pass and by leaving in the moon\u0027s shadow. For a moment Agake thought she had spotted a face on the surface, but later examinations of photographs proved it was just another case of pareidolia. Of course there was no mysterious face on the surface of Tylo, alien or otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cratered surface of the moon suggested it was one of Jool\u0027s custodians, cleaning up all wayward debris and rogue asteroids that passed through the system. Landing there would require a great deal of planning, as finding a flat surface could prove challenging. And if the number of craters were any clue, there was a high likelihood of being struck by some piece of debris while on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170930_ksp0004_tylo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170930_ksp0004_tylo.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170930_ksp0009_tylo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170930_ksp0009_tylo.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170930_ksp0010_tylo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170930_ksp0010_tylo.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon enough their time at Tylo had passed, and the beast of a moon slipped away into the darkness behind them.

Their initial periapsis was a nice 150km, and was only 3.9 degrees off of the inclination of the Jumble of Parts. Unfortunately their station would be a third of the way around Laythe when they arrived, well ahead of them in their orbit. Catching up in a timely manner would require a periapsis inside Laythe\u0027s crust, so they opted to capture into a higher orbit and wait instead. This allowed them to adjust their nearly 4 degrees of relative inclination down to 0 from a far more efficient position high over Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs luck would have it, their higher-orbit inclination burn took place in the pitch-black eclipse of Kerbol by Jool. As is only fitting and proper.

None of them were sure if this was normal, based on their limited observations, but still recorded the apparent anomaly.

For Minmus\u2019 sidereal period (based on its 360\u00B0 orbit around Kerbin), you would be correct - there are ~8.5\u00A0such minths in one Kerbin year. For Minmus\u2019 synodic period (based on its motion and/or phase as observed from Kerbin), there are only ~7.5 minths per Kerbin year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA primitive calendar would more than likely be devised based on the synodic period, which is why I chose that. Our lunar calendar is a good example. A\u00A0synodic lunar month, full moon to full moon (a lunation), is 29 days 12 hours and some change. A sidereal lunar month, with the Moon in the same position against the background stars (completing one full orbit), is 27 days 7 hours and a bit more change. I\u2019m not aware of any lunar calendars in use in a non-scientific setting that are not based on lunation (synodic).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-26T05:54:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2018 05:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-27T00:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223327283\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521442131\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/19/2018 at 1:48 AM, Cydonian Monk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe usual stream of past-due notices and junk mail filtered into the Sulphur\u0027s computer as the Jumble of Parts synced back up.

First, the Sulphur 5 LDAV was being left at the Jumble of Parts. Its landing legs and other attachments made it heavier than the Sulphur 3, and every gram mattered. Gletrix took the task of undocking it from the Sulphur 3 and moving it to another available port atop the Jumble.

He still had no idea if anyone was receiving these, but felt compelled to continue regardless. The Boss didn\u0027t sound very stable or safe the last time he spoke with her, back on Vall, and considering the silence that followed their brief contact he could only assume something bad had happened. After recording his thoughts he scanned the message a couple of times and then hit the send button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith those tasks complete their mission at Jool had met its end. No further instructions regarding the station had been received, so they left the Jumble\u0027s static experiments running.

No reason to leave a mess for the next kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix had the honor of undocking the Sulphur 3. She nudged them away from the Jumble just as they emerged from the night side of Laythe. They watched as the sunrise cast it warm colors across the watery moon\u0027s skies. Their trip to the Edge of Infinity was routine, a short boost to a higher orbit, a change of inclination, and another burn to complete the rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220171215_ksp0059_laythe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20171215_ksp0059_laythe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Forgotten had contacted them shortly after their return to Laythe. They informed Macfred that the Jool Jester had arrived some time ago, and they could leave whenever he and his crew were ready.

The Jool Jester undocked, pulled back, and allowed them to dock between it and the station. Matching the rotation of both the station and this large ship was somehow easier than just matching the station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis old ship was clearly something from an earlier generation. Its design was nearly as alien to their multipurpose shuttle as a sailboat would be to a submarine. Macfred was tempted to have Gletrix splash their lights across the Jester, but he knew there would be many opportunities to explore the much older ship while dropping back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other ships of The Forgotten, the Onepake and the Lakeweketon, were docked opposite of them. Only one of the two would return with them, the other would be cast off to forever drift in Laythe\u0027s orbit. The Onepake was little more than a tin can with a flight computer, a ship which Jeb and Bill had held together by duct tape and force of will. Its flight computer was long dead and it provided minimal living space, so they would have little choice by to abandon it here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220171215_ksp0076_laythe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20171215_ksp0076_laythe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shuttle shuddered as the Jester pushed them in to dock at the station. Macfred wondered if their ship was qualified to take such stress, the Jester was fully loaded after all, and much much larger than them. Thankfully they had a few hours to relax at the Edge of Infinity before reassembling the ships and burning for home, time he could spend inspecting the Sulphur and worrying about all manner of engineering failures.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least he knew the radio worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E...

He was just getting to his stories of Albro and the Anzol System when some unfamiliar kerbals walked in. That question about Albro\u0027s well being had come from one of them. An unfamiliar voice, old and commanding, but he answered as he would any other kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Albro? Yes, he\u0027s still living.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pity. We figured that thing on Vall vaporized him.

He and his second in command Kening were on the original Jool mission. Ellie is the third member of their crew, also a former Continuum member. All three worked with Albro.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody works _with_ Albro,\u0022 Maclie chirped back. \u0022He does what he wants and works hard to keep it that way. He has his own plans, and he\u0027ll see through his vendetta regardless of who or what gets in the way. Ask Shelzon if you get the chance.

For as long as I\u0027ve known him his sole purpose has been to exterminate the beasties. Anchorpoint Station was a trap he set, a trap that almost got the rest of us killed. You can bet anything he told you is just a ruse to set an even larger trap.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not so sure. He claims he wants to help all of us, all kerbals everywhere.

Another conversation had splintered off and eventually caught Thomlock\u0027s attention. He listened as Agake was talking to Bob, showing him a sample she had collected on Bop. The green sliver of stone which had fallen into her lap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that...?

I tried for years to extract a sample. Nothing would break the stone. How on Kerbin did you get this? Did anything strange happen when you took it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake paused, obviously considering her response. She glanced over to Thomlock briefly. \u0022No. My field hammer broke, but otherwise,\u0022 she looked to the rest of their crew, both of whom had also abandoned the Albro debate and responded with a decided no. \u0022Nope. There is absolutely nothing weird going on at Bop. Definitely no missing stretches of memory or strange time anomalies. Nothing at all.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething clicked deep in Thomlock\u0027s mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Bob?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Back when we first met you said something about all the previous Jebs and Bills and Bobs being sent here to do research.

This story is confusing enough with the black hole planets, the secret societies, the creepy abandoned stations, the lost kerbals, and all these krakens trapped in asteroids. We\u0027re not throwing time travel into it too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock chuckled. \u0022Fair enough.

It was evident very quickly how space would be at an absolute premium, with twenty kerbals crammed into 32 seats. Jonbald and his crew had already packed the Sulphur 3 to the brim, so the others filled up the Jester and the Lakeweketon as well as they could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final configuration of ships would have the Jool Jester at the bottom of the stack providing propulsion and sleeping quarters, the Lakeweketon in the middle serving as the \u0022common area\u0022 with a bit more sleeping space, and the Sulphur 3 atop the stack, serving as yet more bunk room. Flight control would be handled from the Jool Jester, with auxiliary control in the Sulphur 3. There were only 16 beds outside of the two cockpits and the common area in the Lakeweketon, so either they would need to shut down some of the common area to all sleep at the same time, or more than likely they would end up swapping a few bunks and sleeping in shifts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore any of that could happen though, there was an important bit of work to complete: Rearranging the ships. The Sulphur 3 was still docked ahead of the Jester, while the Lakeweketon was docked to the Edge of Infinity with the Onepake behind it. They stripped the Onepake of useful parts and then started the final shuffle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Jester undocked from the Sulphur first.

In the end they settled on a single-burn departure of some 1100m/s with a plane-change correction somewhere near the orbit of Duna. To properly hit Kerbin they would need to dip under its orbit, and instead rise up to meet it from below. This was the fastest intercept they could plot with Kerbin that didn\u0027t involve more fuel than they had on hand or some extremely unorthodox abuse of the other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeparting on day 336 of the 100th year, Macfred, Gletrix, and Agake had spent some 419 days in the Jool System, Thomlock a few days fewer.

This was just the best place to start given Laythe\u0027s position and the placement of the other moons. They could have waited to conduct their nearly 14 minute burn until they were a bit further around in Laythe\u0027s orbit, but there was really no reason to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly into the burn the, Sun slipped around Laythe, a sight only Thomlock could enjoy.

Impressive, really, and very comfortable. They wouldn\u0027t be climbing around inside their motley assortment of ships while under acceleration, but they also wouldn\u0027t be forced to split their burns up over several passes.

The Forgotten had talked briefly about how they rebuilt their small fleet of ships, converting the older mixed-fuel tanks into liquid-only ones and adding radiators to cope with the increasingly old reactors. They couldn\u0027t haul as much fuel as before, but the ships were still quite capable of moving about the Kerbol System as they wished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir lightly developed network of mining rigs and refueling depots certainly helped. He wondered if it would be possible to expand their fuel operation, assuming Maclie was right and they weren\u0027t all going to move to the Anzol System. Probably best to start with some refineries and a mining operation on Minmus or the M\u00FCn, and then transport their refined fuels back to Kerbin orbit. Maybe he7d make a go of it.

The plane adjustment burn at Duna would require some 180m/s, barely a cough for the Jester\u0027s main engines. That would bring them into a 40km periapsis at Kerbin, most likely too low to be survivable in their rig of a ship.
