You can see from the navball pictures that I had a maneuver node set at periapsis as though I was going to burn there to get a 50km orbit. I watched the predicted dV for the maneuver drop as I decelerated. By the time I reached periapsis the ship was captured and less than half the dV was used up, so I knew that I would NOT use up the rest of the maneuver budget and fall suborbital before I got out of atmosphere. So I let the ship rise to about 30km, and at that point felt safe enough to deploy the brakes and bring the top of the orbit down some more. \n\nThere.
