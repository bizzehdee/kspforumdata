I have decided that I will write a mission report log of my current KSP career mode. The savefile itself has been in use since 0.90, but I still have a wide range of missions I would like to accomplish. One of the main goals of this space program is to fully explore all the planets and occasionally colonize them, not just plant a flag and immediately leave. Not sure how this will turn out, but enjoy! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![wewTDZW.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/wewTDZW.png?1)\n![IqgNzgb.png](http://i.imgur.com/IqgNzgb.png)\n\n**-Upcoming Missions-** List kept up to date\n\nMajor:\n\n-Colonize Laythe\n\n-Colonize Moho\n\nModerate:\n\n-Manned Dres Mission\n\n-Jool Five\n\nMinor:\n\n-Crash Probe into Sun\n\n-Rescue Kerbal from Ike (Contract)\n\n-Resuce Kerbal from solar orbit (Not a Contract;.![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**-Chapters-**\n\n[Chapter 1- Housekeeping and Training Day](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128769-Conquering-the-Solar-System-A-late-game-career-log?p=2086979#post2086979)\n\n**-Quickloading Rules-**\n\n-Perma Death = On\n\n-Death do to engineering oversight is real (EI, Failure to achieve orbit, resulting in crash)\n\n-The above may be re-attempted, but ONLY re-attempted, cant just not takeoff.\n\n-Death do to navigation oversight may be re-attempted, even in a different way (EI, Give up trying deadly aerobrake and gravity assist instead).\n\n-Death do to player (me) goofing around is a simulation (EI, Plane stunts, rover driving too fast).\n\n-Death do to game bug is a simulation.

There is a large amount of junk (random ships) littered everywhere, but that should be cleaned up in the coming days.\n\n![VhXitR9.png](http://i.imgur.com/VhXitR9.png)\n\nThis is the Orbital Hangar, basically a parking garage where all the equipment is stored. Nuke powered tugs, landers, etc.\n\n![eWLylgb.png](http://i.imgur.com/eWLylgb.png)\n\nYes, it\u0027s very large.\n\n![j5yQm9M.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j5yQm9M.jpg)\n\nHere is the massive Minmus mining operation. The base is currently parked on an area of only 6% ore composition, I decided that 1 drill was too slow... \u0022MOAR DRILLS!\u0022 This is what fuels my space program. A large tanker occasionally lands here to pick up LF and O.\n\n![YD04YCA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YD04YCA.jpg)\n\nThis Gilly base is as far as I have gotten with colonizing the solar system.\n\n![MohD5GB.png](http://i.imgur.com/MohD5GB.png)\n\nAnd here is the RNFSS! That\u0027s Research \u0027n\u0027 Fuel Space Station.

As you probably noticed in that tracking station pic, LKO is ridiculously cluttered. Long story short, a [horrifically inefficient craft](http://i.imgur.com/1U1XYGu.png) has consumed all the the fuel in LKO (was to expensive to fuel it via launches, so all the nuclear tugs donated their fuel). As it stands, many ships are stranded, along with a few Kerbals that need to be \u0022rescued\u0022 do to a contract. So without further delay, lets clean this mess up.\n\n...\n\nAerobrake coming in from Minmus, this is a universal lander which is rated for most planets (excluding Eve, Tylo, Kerbin, etc), it can also be used to transport 3 Kerbals around.\n\n![u4vSqDB.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/u4vSqDB.png?1)![6xSRfs5.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/6xSRfs5.png?1)\n\nAnd here is the LFO (Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer) Tanker, also coming in from Minmus. This thing will run around resurrecting all the dead crafts. Also dragging a [skycrane](http://i.imgur.com/CX3Xh61.jpg) behind it.\n\n![SSyXdDG.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/SSyXdDG.png?1)![xFCR6iO.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/xFCR6iO.png?1)\n\n*-Much, much later-*\n\n...and we have liftoff! This is the Pelican HL-B rocket. HL meaning \u0022Heavy Lifter,\u0022 and the B indicating that this is the single booster variant. Either that or I just forgot to use symmetry. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\n![Hjv9vsD.png](http://i.imgur.com/Hjv9vsD.png)\n\nThis rocket is carrying over 40 tons of fuel to the RNF Space Station.\n\n![OqJkIkt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OqJkIkt.jpg)\n\nThis is my first launch in 1.0.4 and I must say this atmosphere is much improved!\n\n![0Kmwgk4.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/0Kmwgk4.png?1)![r5ASrZt.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/r5ASrZt.png?1)\n\nThis fuel tank will be added as a new module to the station. Oh, and I am pleased to report that nothing went supernova this time.\n\n![4SoJOei.png](http://i.imgur.com/4SoJOei.png)\n\nNow to recover that rocket! A useful feature of the Pelican rocket series is the reusability of the core booster and upper stage.\n\n![ObI4kXg.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/ObI4kXg.png?1)![KNTGVzA.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/KNTGVzA.png?1)\n\nHere we see the core booster slowing itself with 8 airbrakes and performing a flawless powered landing.\n\n![y6dmsbd.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/y6dmsbd.jpg?1)![2scSsNx.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/2scSsNx.jpg?1)\n\nLanded! Mechjeb is to be credited for it\u0027s landing predictions (I hate quickloading 20 times just to get near KSC), but I performed the actual landing myself. I use a joystick throttle lever for more rapid and precise throttle actions.\n\n![yMQlg5I.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yMQlg5I.jpg)\n\nNow for the 2nd stage... The nukes make rather effective heat shields.\n\n![5Lq182T.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/5Lq182T.png?1)![6liTdfP.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/6liTdfP.png?1)\n\n*-Elsewhere in LKO-*\n\nMost of the housekeeping is finally taken care of (phew). Unfortunately before I get to any interplanetary missions my Kerbals urgently need to be leveled up. The Minmus base could refine fuel much faster if I had a bunch skillful engineers; the ones stationed there are as dumb as rocks. High level scientists could work in labs to finish the tech tree at a more acceptable rate too. The point here is that every Kerbal in Kerbin SOI needs to be trained. I have determined that the most effective training course will be to plant a flag on both the Mun and Minmus, orbit the Sun (briefly), and of course collect any other XP along the way. Edlu Kerman, presently in the RNFSS, will pilot the docked SSTO crew carrier and collect Luke and Mary, who are in need of \u0022rescuing\u0022 (contract) in LKO. Then, Lars and Valentina (stationed in the Orbital Hangar) will board one of the landers. Everyone will then proceed to Minmus.\n\n![f77QPKn.png](http://i.imgur.com/f77QPKn.png)\n\nBound for Minmus!\n\n![8Wej4uf.png](http://i.imgur.com/8Wej4uf.png)\n\nAlso bound for Minmus!\n\n![hUD7cQs.png](http://i.imgur.com/hUD7cQs.png)\n\n*-A few days later-*\n\nFirst to arrive is the fuel tanker... This should give it time to refuel before everyone else arrives.\n\n![L4ka6aC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/L4ka6aC.jpg)\n\nMining!\n\n![izrZHOk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/izrZHOk.jpg)\n\nThe SSTO arrives. It will be landing a few kilometers (avoiding lag here) from the Minmus base so that the three Kerbals stationed there can join the training mission.\n\n![X0NDQr8.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/X0NDQr8.jpg?1)![lxjSXPX.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/lxjSXPX.jpg?1)\n\nAlright class, pay attention! Planting a flag is a very difficult process. The most important concept being the direction that the flag faces! You must use this ludicrously complicated algorithm....\n\n![68SKm1Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/68SKm1Z.png)\n\nNext up is the lander, carrying Val and Lars.\n\n![AR3fasE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AR3fasE.jpg)\n\n![RmURncz.png](http://i.imgur.com/RmURncz.png)\n\nDumping science from the lander\u0027s sensors into the SSTO, hopefully it will end up at the RNFSS to be used in research.\n\n![4uE8wUM.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/4uE8wUM.jpg?1)![L9yHLQK.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/L9yHLQK.png?1)\n\nTaking off! To Solar Orbit we go!\n\n![xxhipy3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xxhipy3.jpg)\n\nEdlu is mildly terrified of the ground.\n\n![9HGqtui.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9HGqtui.jpg)\n\nBut before everyone gets to see solar orbit, both ships need refueling. Deploy the tanker! Err, I may be torching the base a bit.\n\n![NHPf9IT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NHPf9IT.jpg)\n\nRefueling! It is decided that lander crew will hitchhike on the tanker after realizing said lander only has 1500 m/s of delta-V. Also the SSTO can\u0027t seem to dock to the tanker because an engine is in the way of the port... \u0022Whoops.\u0022 I guess the lander will have to ferry the fuel.\n\n![VYBO66J.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/VYBO66J.jpg?1)![A0paPZo.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/A0paPZo.png?1)\n\n*-Yet another Several Days Later-*\n\nAlright so everyone got to see interplanetary space (ooooooh ahhhhh). Took more fuel than expected but that tanker literally has 6000 m/s of delta-v. To the Mun we go!\n\n![ShPYsKK.png](http://i.imgur.com/ShPYsKK.png)\n\nLander crew is first.\n\n![6LRJSt9.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/6LRJSt9.png?1)![Qzw5W8g.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/Qzw5W8g.png?1)\n\nThe SSTO landing with it\u0027s RAPIERs running at maximum closed-cycle power. The single nuke doesn\u0027t have the thrust for the mun.\n\n![Y8Jbdjo.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/Y8Jbdjo.png?1)![LH2Z8hG.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/LH2Z8hG.png?1)\n\nNow THIS is how a skilled Kerbal plants a flag! All 6 flags placed in the perfect lighting on the first try! Shame they never do this when planting a *permanent* flag. These are just for practice and will be taken down. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![ELHWReJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/ELHWReJ.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T00:23:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPilot573**"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T05:14:56Z","Content":"the Orbital Hangar is absolutely amazing!
