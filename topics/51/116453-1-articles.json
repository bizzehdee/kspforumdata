Made in two copies while the KSC was built, it was propelled by the Orangestone launcher wit the first stage being essentially a turbojet engine with a precooler and some structural intakes. Powered by four small solar panels, it didn\u0027t have any science instrumets exept for an antennae and no batteries. It, however, had a huge dV reserve that allowed it to go onto an escape trajectory out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. After that accidentally happened, the guys in Mission Control decided to bring it back down and get a Mun encounteer. They suceeded. While that was happening, the engineers decided to rebuild the second copy by ripping off the static solar panels, and using duct tape to strap some science instruments, deployable solar panels and two battery packs. They dubbed it Stargazer I.\n\n\u003E [Stayputnik](//imgur.com/a/)\n\u003E [/indent]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
