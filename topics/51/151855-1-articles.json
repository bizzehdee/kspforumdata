Then, I started thinking about the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E I had made just a few days before (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Su37o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Billy-Bobdock I\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0just entered it into the K-Prize) and how it was so overkill, so that lead me to challenging myself with this question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow small can I make a typical spaceplane \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was my answer to the challenge, and it SERIOUSLY WORKED ON THE FIRST TRY. Sure, I had to quick load a few times, but\u00A0the craft succeeded the first time out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, and that was amazing to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Stats: \u003Cu\u003E~1700 Liquid Fuel.\u003C/u\u003E \u003Cu\u003E165 Oxidiser.\u003C/u\u003E \u003Cu\u003E1 R.A.P.I.E.R. Hybrid Engine.\u003C/u\u003E Let\u0027s get into the details of the first flight, shall we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTakeoff was a little daunting due to the back of the plane being low to the ground, but not pitching up and just letting the plane glide off the runway solved that problem. The rest of the assent seemed\u00A0pretty average as of the actual experience, but something I only found out about once I was in space really changed my look on that part of the flight. After only ~5 minutes in the atmosphere, I put myself on a sub-orbital trajectory that I would extend into an orbit with my propellant as per the usual, but that\u0027s when I noticed I had less than 100 oxidizer left in my tanks (due to burning high-atmo), and that got me kind of startled. I thought,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECould this really be the end, this far into take-off?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully, presumably due to good technique during assent, good maneuver planning, and a whole load of luck in what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O hybrid tanks\u00A0I put on the craft, I got into a 70x70\u00A0orbit with\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eless than 35 oxidizer to spare.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0After this, I let the craft move around Kerbin once, and I then deorbited it in such a way that it would land near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, normal normal normal. Reentry was pretty hard, mostly because even though my plane was stable, this would force all the heat to flow into the cockpit and destroy the craft, so after a few failed attempts pointing straight up and down to spread the heat, I actually tried to make the plane unstable, and I succeeded, kicking the jets back on after getting to ~15 kms\u00A0BC I had quite a bit of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E left over to regain stability. After this, I simply changed the direction of my plane (I had overshot the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E) and landed on the runway.
