A team of scientists prepared to perform vital medical research on the effects of deep space travel on the crew. Flight engineers accompanied them to ensure that the station\u0027s vital systems were kept in working order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch tested the limits of the Kerbooster launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yemFrwu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yemFrwu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4xBNWu1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224xBNWu1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew morale was often strained during the voyage.
