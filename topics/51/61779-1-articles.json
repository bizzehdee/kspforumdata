It\u0027s all un-Kerballed so I can F5 and rethink things, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible targets are: Leythe, Eve, or Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStandard 3-orange tank drive section. Attached to the tank in the left of the picture is what I saw as an Eve land/return vehicle. On the right side is a rover with a hitchhiker attached (poodle for landing where parachutes don\u0027t cut it). Plan was to land the rover, fool around, then land the ascent craft, climb the ladder and sit in the command seats, and come back to the drive section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I\u0027m scared. I don\u0027t want to go back to Laythe, I just spent forever fighting with Jool/Tylo to bring that crew home. I don\u0027t think the ascent craft has enough oomph to get home from Eve. And if I go to Duna, I will crash into Ike. Guaranteed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, just because I looked carefully at this post before hitting \u0022Post\u0022, I have realized (dammit) that there will be nowhere for the Kerbonauts to return to, except for their command seats, and since I don\u0027t think they should fly millions of KM in little seats, I have to revert YET AGAIN and stick a capsule onto the main orange tank.

Then worried about the lateral forces on the large docking clamps for the whole flight to Duna, but with the exception of one RCS thruster inexplicably floating off into the void, all went well. (MechJeb was no help for the burns though. Too much steering correction = flexing all over the place. Had to do all burns manually. Time warp during burn also generated a floppy craft. Bit of a long afternoon... This is my definition of a sub-standard design - if you can\u0027t hand off control to the computer, you have improvements to make.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhooo, it was apres-Superbowl as we approached Duna. Did the gentlest aerobrake I could figure that would leave me inside Ike orbit, because I had no faith that the craft wasn\u0027t going to break into 3 separate flaming bits. (In case anybody is wondering, the rover is intentionally huge and heavy to balance the other docked craft.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly I realized that it looked like I had the BEST EVER rocket-powered rover that I could possibly land all in one piece on Duna. I imagined speeds of 200 m/s and more. Never mind all of this separating and dropping stuff, we\u0027d go in all at once !!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Ike loomed over the horizon and scared me sober. I shook off the Superbowl-induced silliness, and detached the rover and landed safely.
