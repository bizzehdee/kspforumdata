PORTS. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am new to Kerbal Space Program and going through career mode.\u00A0 After the crew of my second Mun landing returned to Kerbin with 1,859.6 science on board, I decided to get ... \u003Cs\u003Eambitious\u003C/s\u003E greedy. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started by unlocking Very Heavy Rocketry, its associated fueling needs, the long-awaited NERV, and Composites.\u00A0 Initially I just wanted to use the NERV as any upper stage, since it was so efficient.\u00A0 But there was a contract for mining ore, and I already wanted to land, so why not try to make a refueling lander?\u00A0 It turned out to be a lot heavier than expected, so I went with 3x engine symmetry (2 would have been enough power but 3 made better symmetry and I was used to high munar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E from my first two landings), and packed a bunch of the baby airplane fuel cylinders next to the engines since they have the best fuel-to-weight ratio of all the liquid tanks\u2014which also gave me a place to mount landing gear that could actually reach the ground, and a better place to mount drills than some very sneaky girders.\u00A0 Then, since I had the power, I upgraded the converter since the small one\u0027s ore-to-fuel ratio is garbage.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t have the Gigantor solar panels unlocked yet, but looking at the energy requirements I decided to use the last of my science to do so. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to do a bunch of contracts.\u00A0 I had several around the Mun, for which I needed a rover and a satellite, and I wanted to mount them both on the nose.\u00A0 Hmm.\u00A0 I decided to put clamp-o-trons on the rover and nose, then put the satellite in the middle.\u00A0 I added \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to the rover so I could, in theory, detach in spaceflight, launch the satellite, and then reattach to the lander.\u00A0 I\u0027ve never docked anything before, but how hard can it be?\u00A0 (Backup plan: carry the satellite down, drop the rover, launch satellite after takeoff.)

time \u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E\u2014ship to ship this time.\u00A0 My middle stage should make Mun orbit, and if the lander refinery works as well as hoped, I can potentially come back up, dock, donate a little fuel (I put modest L\u002BO tankage on the nuke with this hope\u2014contents donated to the middle stage, of course\u2014plus I could refine more ore after docking), then transfer crews, land again, collect science and fuel again, and did I mention both crews still need a Mun landing under their belt? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow all I had to do was figure out how the heck to lift all this junk.\u00A0 Fortunately I had just unlocked the Mammoth.\u00A0 Even so, I still needed to attach some Kickbacks to give me what I consider decent launchpad thrust.\u00A0 For the middle stage, a Skipper might be adequate to the task, but I thought, \u0022Hey, the Rhino gets better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E anyway, right?\u00A0 And it will keep my burns short.\u00A0 Let\u0027s try this sucker out.\u0022\u00A0 Plus it let me keep my rocket fatter; this thing is much taller than any rocket I\u0027ve made before. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at what I\u0027d done in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly

the Abomination.\u00A0 The fairing covered 45% of the rocket.\u00A0 It\u0027s over 100 tons heavier than my previously biggest rocket, which was almost 100 tons heavier than my previously biggest rocket.\u00A0 And it\u0027s not too far shy of double the cost, though a lot of this is tied up in stuff meant to be recovered. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[ \u003Ca

51-55km while going 1110-1890m/s, which put some constraints on my flight profile, but it actually worked pretty well with a reasonable gravity turn.\u00A0 It took me a couple of tries to get it right, but I don\u0027t feel too guilty about reverting for that sort of thing.\u00A0 They aren\u0027t terrible fins\u2014or at least they looked the part. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Rhino performed beautifully, too.\u00A0 It started up well in the upper atmosphere, so I\u0027m sure it was at least as efficient as any other upper stage could have been, and the extra power let me carry more fuel that the main lifter would have otherwise been using (at less effiency).\u00A0 The downside is that if the Mammoth was allowed to use that fuel I was confident of recovery; this way, I didn\u0027t even try for this mission, though I may if I find myself with a similar lower stage in the future. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the last Mun landing, I caught a Minmus intercept completely by accident while planning the trip home, but didn\u0027t have the fuel to do it.\u00A0 Not this time, my crew thinks.\u00A0 Not this time.

terrible at docking\u2014was that it really wasn\u0027t designed with docking in mind.\u00A0 First, the lines of sight were very bad, and second, I didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d offset the docking port so that a little bit of it was blocked by a girder.\u00A0 The magnetism seems to be holding it in place for now, so hopefully that will hold up until I land.\u00A0 If it falls off upon landing that will just save me the trouble. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[ \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/2hrhm6t.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external

altitude to turn on its engine to fulfill a contract.\u00A0 I was careful of where the main ship was, after having read many horror stories about inattentive launch collisions!\u00A0 It has tons of delta-V, which is good because it needs to fulfill two orbital requirements; it may have enough to spare to do something useful.\u00A0 Even if it doesn\u0027t, three contracts on one small satellite that at worst will be a half-decent Mun relay antenna isn\u0027t bad. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbiter (the Rhino) is another story.\u00A0 By my calculations at the time, it did have enough to get into my preferred capture orbit but it\u0027s tighter than I thought back in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when I was doing gross estimation instead of precise engineering.\u00A0 I hoped I would be able to get into my subsequent planned lower orbit.\u00A0 (To make a rendezvous with the mining ship easier\u2014the refueling might be more than a novelty now.)\u00A0 Alternatively I could have just bailed out and tried for Kerbin immediately after the capture, but I wanted to stick to the mission plan.

maneuver.\u00A0 I knew that the maneuver node could sometimes move around a bit on you, but I was totally unprepared for one that meandered across a 45\u00B0 swath of the navball!\u00A0 I can\u0027t help but imagine the loosely attached rover had something to do with it, but even so, that was ridiculous.\u00A0 Every time I thought I was close, it dashed back in the direction I came from, sort of like the way \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E autocorrects. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of misbehaving maneuver nodes, apparently the satellite was small enough, and the antenna big enough, that the engine was significantly offset from the center of mass.\u00A0 At least, that was the hypothesis I formed as the thing bucked like a bronco for the nearly two minute burn despite the fact that I was only packing a Spark.\u00A0 Or perhaps too much of the weight was in the back?\u00A0 I will keep this in mind for more important future missions. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover, in the meantime, had gotten loose again.\u00A0 Fortunately I cought it before it had gone more than a couple meters.\u00A0 I was becoming concerned.\u00A0 I wondered how it would behave under deceleration.\u00A0 At least, I reasoned, it would be only compressive forces, not pulling the clamps apart, but it\u0027s off center\u2014that\u0027s the whole problem.\u00A0 But although the clamps are off center, the center of mass (as I eyeballed it) looked like it should be right over the center of the rocket, so maybe it would be fine.\u00A0 I had plenty of monopropellant, even without being able to transfer any from the ship.\u00A0 As long as it waits until landing\u2014or perhaps even the final approach\u2014to wobble off the ship, I\u0027m golden. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, a pessimistic voice whispered, if it\u0027s not docked then you can\u0027t undock it.\u00A0 what if it sticks through the landing and doesn\u0027t want to go?\u00A0 Will the monopropellant be enough to push it loose?\u00A0 Almost certainly yes, I thought.\u00A0 I was glad I thought of the possibility, but I was sure it was not a true concern. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter another repetition of the rover escape and a couple more times it seemed to be threatening to, I think I\u0027ve figured out the behavior.\u00A0 Whenever \u0022normal activity\u0022 is suspended, either from time warp or from leaving the area (to adjust my satellite\u0027s orbit) the half-on, half-off docking port starts to freak out.\u00A0 Possibly the game is trying to make it fit correctly, but running into a conflict with the girder that\u0027s in the way.\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t a problem when it was built that way but it looks like detaching it was a one-way trip, at least for this particular rover. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere seem to be one of two \u0022resting states\u0022: one where the clamps are together but offset as in the picture above, and one where the clamps are perfectly aligned but being held apart by the girder.\u00A0 If I leave the area when it\u0027s in the first position the rover wants to go to the second position, but if I leave the area when it\u0027s in the second position then it wants to lose the connection and drift away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I lined up the target on the ground, giving it a little lead for rotation and overshooting a bit on purpose because I usually end up short of the planned line.\u00A0 In this case I had to stick to the plan more than usual once I got close to the finish line because if I turned the ship too fast the rover would definitely lose its connection, and I didn\u0027t want to do that too far from the actual landing zone. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[ \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i65.tinypic.com/vz9652.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external

done (possibly partially because of the unusually steep orbit I\u0027m coming down from), I was slowly decelerating into the landing zone, and I noticed I was drifting a little bit.\u00A0 As said before, any sudden course corrections would cause the rover to get squirrely, which is a complication I didn\u0027t need, so I quickly switched to it at a couple dozen meters up, mashed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and just let it fall to the ground, where it bounced very nicely without exploding even a little.

it\u0027s frustrating, I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume they did this so that someone can\u0027t exploit it by launching a ship that just separates and immediately re-docks.\u00A0 Forcing them to be from different launches certainly prevents that exploit.\u00A0 However... seems to me that if you go to orbit, send a vehicle down to land, then bring it back up to orbit to re-dock, then that feels like it should \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecount\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, gosh darn it.\u00A0 And in any case, as a player, the part I found the most frustrating is that

the two vessels landed and re-orbited in the time since they were last docked.\u00A0 If I\u0027ve satisfied the contract otherwise, and I\u0027ve done that, and the

fully-laden vessel and very limited attitude control, and also the fact that the higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of the NERVs was some compensation for the slow ascent.\u00A0 However, the proposal to use the Rhino for the Kerbin transfer burn was universally accepted.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n[ \u003Ca

mission\u2014well enough to extend said mission from the Mun to Minmus.\u00A0 But its days were numbered.\u00A0 The decision to retire the Mk.I miner had been made for several reasons.\u00A0 As a prototype, certain design decisions had proven suboptimal, chiefly, carrying \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks with the idea of having \u0022ready-to-go\u0022 refueling capability.\u00A0 The design team had decided that extra ore tanks were a much more versatile way to store fuel, worth the time cost of refining on the spot for the recipient as well as the higher dry tank mass.\u00A0 They were also more compact.\u00A0 Speaking of extra fuel storage, there wasn\u0027t all that much on the Mk.I miner; it was okay at refueling itself, and it could perhaps refuel a probe or give an emergency supply, but it had no hope of ferrying large amounts of fuel to other things.\u00A0 Aside from wrong turns in the design, there were also limitations and rough edges from the technological level at the time.\u00A0 It had three-way symmetry not by choice but because quad adapter designs had not yet made it out of the engineering department\u2014and its three-way adapter married a 2.5m part to a 1.25m connector for the same reason!\u00A0 And lastly, a little bit of industrial espionage (tutorial designs and Youtube) had inspired a revolutionary new side-mounted engine design that made the Mk.0 fuel cans not worth the part count.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBetween all that, and the R\u0026amp;D department\u0027s desire to examine a ship that had actually been to Minmus and back, (and the storyline contract demanding the same,) the Mk.I miner was on a one-way trip to a museum.\u00A0 Interestingly, though, the Rhino manned orbital stage that had been its faithful companion was not as completely obsolete and would remain in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E for possible future use.\u00A0 (It also had extra copies of science for science labs to potentially use.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFarewell, Minmus, we hardly

plan was to supplement a couple of aerobraking passes with burns near periapsis, because the combined mass of the lander and Rhino promised to make \u0022free\u0022 deceleration take entirely too long.\u00A0 There was some uncertainty about how well the NERVs would take to the combined heat of partial-reentry and extended burns, but they didn\u0027t complain a

periapsis was brought down to 37km and the final pass was here at last!\u00A0 Unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the planet for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E landing, but everyone agreed that it wasn\u0027t worth waiting for a window to open up for attempting a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space

That was the plan.\u00A0 But in the excitement to get home, the Rhino was detached before the re-orbit maneuver.\u00A0 It was no problem as it had plenty of fuel and the crew was still on board (to be picked up later).\u00A0 It turned out for the best, though, because the periapsis was at almost the perfect point for the re-entry deceleration to achieve a new suborbital path that would finally decay at around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Perhaps a burn to extend the re-entry and achieve the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E landing was possible.\u00A0 Turning the ship from retrograde to prograde at 45km and 2350ish m/s, however, needed more muscle than the ship turned out to have.\u00A0 Seesawing the ship back and forth proved able to build up sufficient momentum to flip around and a burn was done based solely on guesswork.\u00A0 Flipping back to retro was done (much more easily) at the new apoapsis of 50km, and then the crew waited anxiously to see how well they had anticipated the deceleration.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n[ \u003Ca
