(Probably a limitation of the mods I\u0027m using, but I don\u0027t know that I could afford to add even one more part-heavy mod at this point...) For descent, it needed to be throttlable and pressure-fed, and I didn\u0027t want it too powerful, either. In the end, a cluster of those smaller engines got me just about what I needed. (I considered copying a part and tweaking it\u0027s config to be what I wanted, but I\u0027ll admit I was a bit intimidated by trying to figure out the RealFuel settings it would need...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nice side-effect of putting the engines in a circle around the perimeter of the base of the ship is that I now have a great surface to attach the decoupler to. Instead of trying to attach a small decoupler to a central engine, and then strutting to stabilize the load, I can attach the decoupler directly to the base of the ship, allowing me to use a larger (and more sturdy) connection. I, um, totally planned it that way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamis","CreatedById":84719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T00:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just added the video for Apollo 6 to the OP.
