The most guests at the party where in doubt if it was possible.\n\nLater scientists convinced the CEO that they should start with unmand rovers. Mun Rover 1 was born.\n\nMR1 programm goal is:\n\n- Get an ummanned Rover onto the Mun, [achived 28.03.15]\n\n- Collect science, especialy Karbonite concentration for mun base later ingame [partialy]\n\n- Return that science to the orbiter around the mun [achived 30.03.15]\n\n- Recover the orbiter on Kerbin [achived 30.03.15]\n\nThis will be flanked by a ScanSat Satelite 250 km abve the mun to collect the binome findings. [achived 23.03.15]\n\n**Failed** attepmts so far (10):\n\n - rocket to small, \n\n - to less fuel in rocket, \n\n - to less fuel in lander,\n\n - fuel line mixup,\n\n - decend thrust (to slow dow) explodes rover\n\n - unexpected mun mountain (ca 6 km high!)![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n - KCS did not extend solar panels because the operator was getting koffe\n\n- fuel in return craft to orbiter was used up\n\n- rover instability\n\n- return rocket has to less fuel, one barely made it\n\n**Progress** Report:\n\nIt took numerous scientists and engeneers in KSC to develop the lifter stage and the orbiter. They made many failed attempts but in the end had a good design for the lifter, the orbiter and the rover lander. At least they hoped so.\n\nThe engenner corps came up with an idea to automate solar panel extension because the operaters did not seem to care if their probes changed to flying junk in space.\n\n**Finaly:** First Rover (Mk6 generation) landed on the surface of the mun! The science it collected was quite much (~1000) but the KSC needs more science points so it set the autopilot to enter a new binome on the mun. We will see if this works out...\n\nThe Engiineers at KSC set out to build a better generation of the Rover (Mk7) in which they incoperate what they had been told from the operators of the rover (yeah thats that guy who gets koffe all the damn time!)\n\nAfter one Kerbal Engineer did make a knot in a straw of ones other engineers limo, he came up with an idea to solve the fuel problem. Also more science intruments are added to the rover, it tuns out the now fired engineers did forget some of them in a box.\n\nThe monopropellant delivery also did get reworked as one kerbal did like christmas orbs and is surprisingly makes a lower center of mass. Mk8 Rover was born.\n\nIn a transparent and openness initiative followed from the loss of some rover parts who where quite expensive, the MKerb CEO decided to publish all craft designs from now on.\n\nKerbalkind was very proud as the operator announced a speed record of 16.1 m/s on the mun. Also the first Mk8 Rover made it to the surface. He did the speed record but also the accident that followed. However RCS and SAS saved the rover and only a few solar panel got lost...\n\nIt became apparent that docking nodes should be on the most pointy places on a rocket. Also it should have more fuel. More RSC is needed for surface stabilization and re-erecting of the flipped rover.\n\n**I finally returned my mun probe with the science in it to kerbin!** Got ~ 3500 Science Points from it, ~1500 from the probe recovery from two binomes and 2000 with transmitted science from 4 binomes (2 from from earlier rovers).\n\nSee the PICTURES HERE:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/RAAf2/embed](http://imgur.com/a/RAAf2/embed)\n\nCRAFT Files here:\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/ManuxKerb/SCAN%20Sat%20-%20Mun%20Mk3](http://kerbalx.com/ManuxKerb/SCAN%20Sat%20-%20Mun%20Mk3)\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/ManuxKerb/Rover%20Mk8](http://kerbalx.com/ManuxKerb/Rover%20Mk8)\n\nGreetings\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T23:28:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**\n  \nupdate"}]}
