I knew it was a handy mod, but I didn\u0027t have any other plans for it. But then I had a small idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI bet I can launch probe cores with this mod\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seemed harmless, so I gave it a shot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KdYW3pz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KdYW3pz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a something pretty unimpressive and enormously difficult to fire. Once payload was released and moving, I didn\u0027t know how to separate it from the cords. I opted for sepratrons pointing at the plate attaching them. They overheated the plate and destroyed it, releasing the probe. It only launched the payload a few meters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat mattered, though, was that it worked at all. It was a small start, a step in the right direction. I couldn\u0027t just leave an idea like this alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bE7tFWk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bE7tFWk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quickly figured out how to launch the cores reliably. I separated the core before launch and held it in a bucket. Arms were also added, when tensioned up, the arms bent back, like a true crossbow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt managed to fire the core a modest, but impressive distance. As the distances increased, so did the danger. I snapped one of the wires by over-tensioning the bow; the bucket whipped to the side and slapped an unfortunate Donfel Kerman a hundred meters away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got another silly idea, I emptied the bucket and stuck a kerbal inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JrkXEaV.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022JrkXEaV.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t put much tension into the shot, and watching them bounce around was hilarious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a taste of things to come. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8oc8fb8.png\u0022 alt=\u00228oc8fb8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI increased the angle of the bow, now it pointed at the optimal 45 degrees. I was reliably shooting over 100 meters now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0cKOhnO.png\u0022 alt=\u00220cKOhnO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I couldn\u0027t get the cables shorter without the bucket spazzing out. I added another set of arms to brace the original pair, increasing the tension it could store. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qhriyUR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qhriyUR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E300 meters. Then I realized that kerbals, with their tiny air resistance, made great... test pilots. I ditched the probe cores and switched to live ammunition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cm4RHuB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cm4RHuB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E400 meters! 500 meters! It just kept getting better and better. I realized though, that maybe I could do better with a single set of arms. The current setup had one that pair that bent back, and another pair to attached to it for bracing. I removed the original set of arms and attached cables from to the second, sturdier pair directly to the buck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aIWyXVi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aIWyXVi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was angled lower because the arms bent up after firing, this wasn\u0027t a reliable way to shoot things. More struts had to be added to keep things under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LTAlL3I.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022LTAlL3I.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis managed to consistently score 500 meters. I was getting excited now. I didn\u0027t know how much more I could improve my design. The strut count kept increasing, making the arms more rigid. By now it was more of a slingshot, although I still thought of it as \u0022My Crossbow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got another little, ridiculous, insane, absurd idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ks7cOeD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ks7cOeD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake it mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis added a whole slew of new challenges, making it balanced, tipping it over, etc. The biggest was phantom torque, as you tension up, the game gets weird; the ship will want to spin on its own. Without the launch clamps holding it down, it did exactly this. I added four grappling hooks around the edges that could be ejected into the ground to anchor it down, KAS really saved the day!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c7l8LAb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c7l8LAb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI continued testing on it, I was astounded by how effective it was becoming. I felt I had reached a peak with this design, and that it was ready. I had had one thing in mind ever since I first removed the launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yzZVRQO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yzZVRQO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you guess \u0022Put it on the Mun?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F1MkOIR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F1MkOIR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause that would be exactly right.

Once .21 comes out though, I\u0027ll be ready to put this baby on the Mun. I imagine a setup where I have a small craft performs a rendezvous with the kerbal and takes him back to a Munar space station. At the station there can be a mass relay to slow them down and allow them to land back at the crossbow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows?
