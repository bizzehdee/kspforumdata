There have been many changes in KSP since then. I mention this in case you are wondering things like, \u0022Why didn\u0027t he use Senior Docking Ports there,\u0022 etc. ...but that\u0027s because such parts did not exist at the time.

All of the previous interplanetary missions have been mainly just to get to all of the moons and planets, have a look around, and come back home... with the notable exception of Desdin on Eve, who\u0027s still enjoying his life as an interplanetary hermit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E planners have been limiting themselves to reusable rockets and spacecraft as much as possible, the option of using a gigantic super-booster to launch everything to Laythe in one go was right out. They considered the option of assembling a massive ship in orbit and sending everything in one go from there, but the lack of any ability to add struts to a vehicle while in space would mean such a ship would be very wobbly... so that option was eliminated. (Man, we really need to get our kerbals the ability to do a little strut construction work in space!) So that left the \u0022Armada Option\u0022 of sending a fleet of smaller ships. Initially planned to be four ships, this was later changed to five when mission planners decided to add an airplane/rover to the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me tell you right up front that controlling five ships simultaneously on an interplanetary expedition is NOT five times harder than controlling one ship... it\u0027s more like 5-squared times harder. Well, maybe not that much, but it did take up most of my free time for a couple weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ETug Time!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe workhorse for this mission would be the Standard Nuclear Tug, seen below being launched on a Reusable Rocket. This tug is quite similar to the core of the Mark Twain spacecraft that I\u0027ve used for all my previous interplanetary missions. A notable difference is the addition of token radiation shielding ahead of the nuclear thermal engines. On a typical interplanetary mission, the nukes would get less than one hour of runtime, so they wouldn\u0027t build up a huge amount of fission products in their reactor cores. But I plan to use these nuclear tugs for many trips back and forth between planets, so they would get \u0022hotter\u0022 over time than the nukes on previous ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YN2KuxT.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YN2KuxT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the trip to Jool, the tugs will include two X200-32 fuel tanks, the main one in front and an additional rear tank. The problem is that the Tug\u0027s 48-ton mass is more than the Reusable Rocket can put into orbit (it\u0027s limited to around 38 tons). And we can\u0027t just drop the sustainer stage and let the tug continue on into orbit because the sustainer stage must also get into orbit so that it can come around and land back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for re-use. This problem was solved by having the tug fire its engines during the final part of the sustainer\u0027s burn... which added enough delta-V to get the combined stack into orbit. Then the tug could donate enough fuel (if needed) to the sustainer for it to return to Kerbin. Typically the tug used about less than 1/4 of the propellant in its rear fuel tank for all this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i1iMk0t.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i1iMk0t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow: Laythe Tug #1 in Kerbin orbit, waiting for its payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bMbhBoh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bMbhBoh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext came the launches of Tugs 2, 3, and 4.

I don\u0027t understand why, but I sometimes run into the situation where a rocket will become very difficult to control during some part of the boost. For some of my asparagus-staged rockets, this can happen during the burn of the last two side boosters. For this Reusable Rocket, it can happen during turnover (which occurs rather late at 19,000 meters so that the separated boosters can land at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E). The rocket just does not respond well to control commands, despite having vectoring engines, fins, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. And it only happens SOMETIMES...not all the time. Weird. Frustrating. Most of the time, the weirdness can be gotten back under control, and all that is lost is some delta-V due to the rocket\u0027s wanderings from the desired path. But for Tug #4, the sustainer completely tumbled and ended up firing retrograde. Bugger. We ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to space today, kiddies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lEvwFXZ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lEvwFXZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince this was an \u0022official mission flight,\u0022 I couldn\u0027t just ignore it. And there was the question of what would happen to the two nuclear engines... do I just allow those to smash in at suborbital velocities, possibly annoying the neighbors? So I took action, separated the tug and got it stabilized, then separated the rear tank, then fired the engines all the way down to reduce speed and burn off as much propellant as possible, hoping for a slower impact velocity. I managed to get it down to just over 80 m/s before impact, and the reactor cores should be able to survive that. The trade off was that I made the reactors more radioactive from the couple minutes of firing. Ah, well... more obnoxious environmental impact paperwork to fill out. In the meantime, the deep sea fishies can have some nice heaters to warm their fins in the cold abyss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EUN2rEu.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EUN2rEu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo mission rules got changed: No more launching nukes without an emergency recovery system. So parachutes were added to the nuke side-pods (the same setup used to recover the nukes from the Mark Twain ships, so I know it will work if needed). And up goes Laythe Tug #4b and #5. If you\u0027re keeping score, that\u0027s six rockets so far, with only one sustainer and one tug lost. I can hear the accountants scribbling even as I type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zYLHO9a.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zYLHO9a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EHauling Hardware\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we start launching the actual mission hardware that the tugs will be tugging around. The first item is the Laythe Space Station, a scaled-down version of my station in Kerbin orbit. It will serve as a place in Laythe orbit where ships can be gathered and stored and refueled. In addition, on top of the station there there is a 2-kerbal lander can (upside-down) and a 4-kerbal container that are not technically part of the station, since they will be used to carry the kerbals back home to Kerbin several years from now. Below we also see the separation of the reusable boosters from the sustainer at 18,000 meters, just before turnover, so the boosters could be recovered at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (if the game bothered to follow them down).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RKp5Eha.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RKp5Eha.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sustainer deposits the Laythe Space Station into Kerbin orbit, then separates to return to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rXsqa7u.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rXsqa7u.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike the Tugs, the other payloads for the Laythe mission are easily lifted by the Reusable Rocket because they only mass about 21 tons each (so the tugs can handily boost them to Jool).

I like the random nature of letting KSP choose the crew members for me...unless it makes silly choices. This long-term mission is going to need four brave, personable, and hygenic kerbals. They will ride up to the Laythe Space Station ship inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket they will be taking with them to Laythe (where it will hopefully perform years of service ferrying kerbals down and up from the surface there). To get the crew for this ship (which appears on the pad unkerballed), I first \u0022launch\u0022 two of the Crew Cart ships that hold three kerbals each, and drive them off of the launch pad (all the way beyond the circular raised area, so they don\u0027t get removed as pad debris), then bring out the Laythe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

From Crew Cart #2 I chose Nelemy Kerman (who had been with Thompbles on the Poll/Bop mission and Minmus Moonbase mission).

To be more efficient, I do these burns in two parts: the first burn (around or 10 minutes) throws the ship out beyond the orbit of the Mun; when the ship comes back around to periapsis (in about four days), the second part of the burn is done to send the ship off to Jool. This two-part burn is more efficient because more of the burn is done close to Kerbin where it takes advantage of the Oberth effect. This delay is why the crew started getting ready about a week before the Jool launch window. Below is one of the initial trajectory plots to Jool. I will now point out to you the Improved Maneuver Node mod in the upper right corner, and sing its praises! I had to do a lot of maneuver plotting for this mission, and I always used to go crazy from the way the maneuver nodes like to close on me when I didn\u0027t want them to close. GRRR. But no more! One of the features Improved Maneuver Node adds is the ability to reopen a maneuver node that just closed by simply pressing the \u0022o\u0022 key. Now I laugh in the face of maneuver nodes and their capricious closing ways. Also, note that the mod allows you to set the \u0022Conics mode\u0022. The default conic mode is 3, and I\u0027m used to working with that, but I find it very difficult in mode 3 to tell what kind of orbit I\u0027m getting at the destination planet (\u0022hmm...is that a prograde squiggle or aretrograde squiggle?\u0022). But setting conics mode to 0 lets you see the intercept orbit drawn relative to the planet (it\u0027s drawn at the current location of the planet, which some people find a bit off, but that\u0027s fine with me). By clicking on Jool to give it focus, I can zoom in and see exactly what the encounter trajectory will look like relative to Jool. It\u0027s so much easier to see what\u0027s going on. Sure, you can change the conics mode setting by editing your config file, but this mod lets you easily change it on the fly to whatever mode best suits your current operation. Now...if only I didn\u0027t occasionally switch focus to some probe I have in the Jool system instead of Jool itself when I click on it, I\u0027d be deliriously happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gJqbMf8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gJqbMf8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started the burns with Tug #5, then #4b, then #3, then #2, and last #1 (the crew) so that I could abort the mission for this window if something went wrong with any of the important payloads. The good news is that all of the first burns were successful and the Mun did not get in the way. The bad news was that the payloads were somewhat wobbly (damn, I want my kerbals to be able to add struts in space), especially the Base/Rover stack. This meant that I couldn\u0027t just turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep the ships pointed (or they would start wobbling like mad) or use high physics time warp (or they would start wobbling like mad), so I had to baby sit them a lot to keep them pointing on the maneuver node marker on the navball.

The last time I sent multiple ships to Jool (three ships at once), my transfer orbits were quite a bit more spread out. And while I can smugly admire my handiwork and improved targeting skills, I also know that this means all those ships are going to arrive at Jool and want aerobraking attention at about the same time...and that will be one fun juggling act. Oh...the node for aligning with Jool\u0027s orbit was fairly close to Kerbin. There was plenty of time to get all the ships injected on their way before they got close to the node. The plane change burns took roughly two minutes for each ship (about 265 m/s delta-V). I also targeted the ships (with wonderful Conics mode 0) for periapsis values of around 120 km in prograde, near equatorial trajectories.

Good thing all those station parts were heavily coated with Jebediah Kerman\u0027s patented Snake-oil Ablative Spray Paint. It worked just as he said it would...no damage at all. I had targeted a periapsis of 116 km, trying to end up with a apoapsis near Laythe\u0027s orbit...but that put me out too far, so I had to burn retrograde just after the aerobraking to correct to an apoapsis just beyond Laythe\u0027s orbit. There was plenty of time to let the ship reach apoapsis and perform the kick maneuver to raise its periapsis safely out of Jool\u0027s atmosphere (up to 250 km). Don\u0027t forget this step, kiddies! As the other ships were coming in, I was watching the orbits of the captured ships to be sure they weren\u0027t going to have any unexpected encounters with Laythe. As it happens, the orbit I put the crew in had almost exactly one half of the orbital period of Laythe, and was about 90 degrees out of phase with Laythe, so there was no danger of this ship having a surprise encounter with laythe during the upcoming juggling. I wish I would have spotted that fact sooner so that I could have left this ship out of the constant rotation of checking that I was about to go through while juggling the incoming ships and their Laythe encounters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bWp77vr.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bWp77vr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn came three more ships for aerobraking. Tug #5 with BirdDog. Tug #2 with the Base. Tug #4b with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I had all of these targeted to periapsis values of around 114 km, and they ended up with apoapses near Laythe\u0027s orbit, where I kicked prograde to get their periapses up to 250 km. Jeb\u0027s magical spray paint worked every time. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E passed very close to Laythe on its way in and I contemplated going for a direct aerobraking at Laythe...but those can be tricky, so I stuck with the original plan and skirted Laythe. Only the Tanker was left to do its Jool aerobraking...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hf222eO.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hf222eO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Whoop! Watch out, there! The BirdDog and Tug #5 are about to have a close encounter with Laythe. A judicious burn shifted the encounter to a trajectory that would aerobrake it into a prograde orbit, adjusted to be near the equator. As you can see below, the aerobraking was...dismal. No fire. Laythe, I am disappoint. But the aerobraking caught the ship into an orbit with a apoapsis of about 1000 km as planed...then I let it do half a turn around the moon...then gave it a kick at apoapsis to lift its periapsis out to 70 km. And quick! Check the other ships!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022G3dJHC7.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G3dJHC7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo...We\u0027re fine. That looked like a close encounter coming up for Tug #2 and the Base, but it was pretty distant, so I didn\u0027t try for a capture...but Laythe did pump Tug #2\u0027s orbit up to a higher apoapsis and periapsis. Fine by me. Ah, look... the picture below shows Tug #5 and the BirdDog in Laythe orbit with the nose of the ship cleverly pointed to show you our intended landing area: Fido Bay on Dansen Island (named for my first rover probe and first kerbal to land on Laythe at that very location...and the best landing location on Laythe it is!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ed4e8hX.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ed4e8hX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut stop admiring the scenery, boy, because Tug #3 is still dropping in toward Jool with its load of fuel. Whoops! Before that, here\u0027s another close encounter with Laythe coming up, this time with Tub #4b and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Adjust! Aerobrake (no flames)! Turn! Kick! Watch the other dancers! Are you sweating as much as I am? The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is safe in Laythe\u0027s loving grasp.

Encounter for Tug #2 and the Base. This one\u0027s a bit weird because of its pumped-up orbit, and a bigger burn is needed to save it from smashing into Laythe. Hey, look! Entry flames! Half turn about to apoapsis...kick!

Then let it turn around out to apoapsis. Then kick its\u00A0periapsis out to 70 km. Then rest. Whew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sAhGUA4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sAhGUA4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve become an expert at this getting-captured-by-Laythe thing now, so listen up, since I have time now to explain. I targeted Tug #3\u0027s aerobraking to put its apoapsis a little ways below the orbit of Laythe (see diagram below, which is back in the more familiar Conics Mode 3. The other elliptical orbit that goes a little ways beyond Laythe\u0027s orbit belongs to the Tug #1/Space Station ship). Then I waited several orbits for Laythe to wander around past the apoapsis spot as Tug #3 was already there loitering in the slow part of its orbit. Laythe comes along and scoops up Tug #3 into its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I adjust as needed for the desired aerocapture periapsis. In this case, the aero-\u0022braking\u0022 is really a matter of using Laythe\u0027s atmosphere to speed up Tug #3 to nearly match Laythe\u0027s orbital speed around Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229TOtQmA.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9TOtQmA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause Tug #3 was loitering around on the Jool-side of Laythe, it gets captured into a prograde direction (see diagram below). An aerobraking periapsis of around 27,800 km ends up capturing Tug #3 into an orbit with an apoapsis of 1033 km. Dance around to apoapsis, kick the periapsis up to 70 km, and rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XREPHNz.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XREPHNz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTug #3 got a tiny bit of aerobraking flame at Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GStnYww.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GStnYww.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Tug #1 and our intrepid crew, the apoapsis needed to be lowered to inside Laythe\u0027s orbit to break out of the orbital resonance that kept the ship from encountering Laythe, then wait for an encounter as described before. Aerocapture showed only minor flames. Finally, I kicked the periapsis out to 70 km. Done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SqVbg4H.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SqVbg4H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boys are safe in Laythe orbit, and there is plenty of time now to admire the scenery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rbrHWwa.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rbrHWwa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see the result of all that juggling: Five orbits with apoapses near 1000 km and periapses near 70 km. That capsule icon in the circular orbit is the docked Lewis and Clark landers from the first kerballed expedition to Laythe from 12 years ago (Earth years, in-game time...not Kerbin years). What seems to have mysteriously disappeared is the nuclear transfer stage that brought the Fido Pup rover to Laythe...I was sure I left that in orbit, but it\u0027s gone now. Maybe the Kraken ate it? Anyway...before I went on to land the hardware, I took a break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tLPfuKG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tLPfuKG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELandings on Laythe\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe last left our intrepid crew and all their shiny space hardware in 70 to 1000 km elliptical orbits. While the orbits were still large, the ships did plane change maneuvers to all get as close as possible to zero-degree inclination orbits. Then the crew dropped their periapsis back down into the atmosphere and used aerobraking to bring their apoapsis down to 80 km, and then kicked their periapsis up to 80 km. Laythe Space Station with our gallant heroes was now in its final orbit. The other ships were maneuvered in similar ways to get then into orbits with periapses of 80 km and apoapses of 90 km. Then it was just a matter of waiting for the faster Space Station to catch up to each ship in turn, and then adjust the orbit of that ship for rendezvous and docking (if desired). Meanwhile, the boys were finishing high resolution photo surveys of Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a picture of the leading hemisphere of Laythe (the hemisphere that faces forward as it moves along its orbit). This is the target area for the crew\u0027s explorations. The plan is to set up their base at Fido Bay (named for the first rover probe landed there) on Dansen Island (named for the first kerbal who landed on Laythe, also at that same spot). The other nearby large islands are named for Fredoly (who landed his Clark lander on the small arc-shaped island just to the north of the big island that bears his name), and Jenlan (who stayed in orbit, but who gets an island named after him anyway). (Even Michael Collins got a lunar crater named after him, you know.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rq6PXYb.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rq6PXYb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp in Laythe orbit, Laythe Space Station was taking shape as the hardware rendezvoused and docked with the station core. In the picture below, Tug #1 (which carried the Station to Laythe) is on top. Tug #3 with the Tanker payload is docked on the left side. And Tug #4b with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is docked on the right (rear-end first, so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E can depart later). I got desperately low on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel with Tug #4b (the ship would wobble and waste lots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E while I was trying to dock). Tug #3 did not have that problem (but that\u0027s because it had a lot of extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel in the Tanker). Note to mission controllers: Send extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel in the first resupply mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xPx7epv.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xPx7epv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t even TRY to dock Tug #2 to the Station. It had by far the wobbliest payload (the Base/Rover stack), and there really wasn\u0027t a need for it to go to the station anyway, since the Base/Rover would be dropped directly. Below we see Tug #2 depositing the Base/Rover stack in an 81 km circular orbit and backing away a little. Tug #2 would be left in this orbit and could be brought to the Space Station later if its resources were needed.

I used MechJeb to target the payload into the desired landing trajectory. MechJeb wouldn\u0027t be able to actually land it because that involved parachutes and a special deployment sequence. The landing site at Fido Bay is located 0.992 degrees north of the equator, so a small northward component is needed for the retro burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w7HPUWZ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w7HPUWZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the final targeting burns are done, the retro pack is jettisoned from the heat shield.

The picture below was taken in Laythe\u0027s shadow (sorry about that), but the BirdDog\u0027s forward light illuminates the GasStation as they tumble away from each other after separating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MnA0DXz.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MnA0DXz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GasStation is mostly made up of seven jet fuel tanks, but it does have 12 little toroidal propellant tanks on top to supply the six 24-77 radial rocket engines that perform the deorbiting burn. Below we see the GasStation coming in with entry flame effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UXIekZO.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UXIekZO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe automatic control system of the GasStation deploys the three legs and six parachutes as it descends into the Laythe Base area. And by \u0022automatic control system,\u0022 I mean me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TnNlvA5.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TnNlvA5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJudicious timing of when to pop the chutes determines how close you get to your target.

It certainly doesn\u0027t need that giant solar array...but it was actually added because it had the right mass to balance the girder to which the BirdDog was attached by a radial decoupler. And it\u0027s a good thing that the GasStation doesn\u0027t need that solar array, because it mysteriously vanished later on. I don\u0027t know why...it just wasn\u0027t there when I came back later. I know solar panels can easily break off of moving rovers, but this GasStation is just sitting there. So I think I\u0027ll leave the panels solar panels on the Base module closed for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XTmdzSK.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XTmdzSK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext down: Aldner and the BirdDog. I didn\u0027t want to mount any unnecessary rocket engines on the airframe of the BirdDog itself, so I added a retro-rocket pack to its docking port (since that\u0027s located at the CG). I also included a small OKTO2 probe core as part of the stack so that I\u0027d have a core lined up in the right direction to control the ship during retro-fire. But I ran into a problem: when I tried to select that probe body to \u0022control the ship from here,\u0022 the navball was displaying 180 degrees off. Weird. I pondered this a while and went back to a BirdDog prototype in Kerbin orbit to try to figure out the problem. It turned out that the problem was I was NOT clicking on the probe body to select \u0022control from here,\u0022 but was clicking on the docking port (which is oriented in the opposite direction). Ah. It\u0027s very hard to select the tiny sliver of the rather thin OKTO2 probe body that\u0027s visible between the docking port and the toroidal fuel tanks. Anyway: TL;DR... Retro-fire time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ibStpAC.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ibStpAC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the final targeting burn, Aldner pops off the retro pack (which drifts very slowly away) and gets the plane\u0027s nose lined up for entry. He\u0027s done this same maneuver entering into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, but now we see how the plane will handle in the thinner atmosphere and lower gravity of Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IEYFpVV.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IEYFpVV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtmospheric-entry flames! I presume this plane uses the finest in spaceplane thermal surface protection, but I thought the rover wheels looked very exposed...so I added some token heat shield plates in front of the wheels. Aldner was looking particularly maniacal in this screen shot, so I was sure to include him in the cropped picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ID0Yx0d.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ID0Yx0d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the entry flames disappear, Aldner pops off the wheel heat shields. He fires up the jet engine for a short burn, but he\u0027s coming into the landing area well, so he cuts the engine and lowers the landing gear. Second picture: Aldner on final approach to Laythe Base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kmjTLCq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kmjTLCq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Bk8NZcH.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bk8NZcH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter landing, Aldner raises the nose gear only. This lowers the rover wheels to the ground and the BirdDog is now in rover mode. He drives the two kilometers over to Laythe Base and gets out, becoming the first kerbal to stand upon Laythe in a dozen years. Man, don\u0027t you wish we could say a similar thing about humans returning to the Moon? I sure as hell do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wvftBJ9.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wvftBJ9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner climbs into the Laythe Base module to pick out the best bunk. Actually, the thing is probably packed to the gills with boxes and boxes of supplies filling all the normally empty space, so you can picture him unpacking most of that stuff and setting up a tent to cover the big pile of supplies on the ground next to the base module. I know that\u0027s what I\u0027m picturing. At least with Laythe they don\u0027t have to bring along years worth of oxygen and water, since those can be extracted from the environment. The Base has three levels: The top level is a 4-kerbal container that serves as the sleeping and living quarters for the kerbals. The middle level is the 2-kerbal lander can that serves as control and communications center. The bottom level is another 4-kerbal container that serves as laboratory and experimental equipment workspace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022udIzGEE.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/udIzGEE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut lets not forget the other three adventurous crew members still in orbit. The three remaining kerbals transferred fuel from the Tanker to the Laythe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E ship, and probably spent a lot of time and EVAs hauling over supplies and equipment from the Station to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and packing it to the gills, with barely room for them to fit. No wonder Nelemy is out having fun EVAing around in some open space. Anyway, all the Station systems are put on automatic, and the three kerbals get aboard the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E for the trip down to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vN7Nk91.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vN7Nk91.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E separates from the Laythe Space Station, controlled by Kurt Kerman\u0027s steady hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xrBVUBK.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xrBVUBK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRetro-fire uses a small percentage of the fuel on board.

Maybe some random spacebar press long ago while the ship was attached to the station set them to release early. Don\u0027t know. Anyway, a bit of undesired excitement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe chutes attached to the bottom fuel tank opened fully at 500 meters, taking the shock on that most massive structural component, and then it was safe to deploy the four other chutes mounted further up. But the ship still has almost-full tanks, so even with all eight chutes open, it descends at a little over 10 m/s and won\u0027t survive the landing undamaged without some extra cushioning from the engines.

The original target landing location for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E was beyond the Base module, but landing on this side is OK, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D2ruOBT.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D2ruOBT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fido only holds two kerbals (in separate single-kerbal capsules), so Nelemy and Kurt hop in for the drive over to the Base module, leaving Thombles to hoof it.

Double checking. Taking data (the fuel flow rate and engine Isp can be found by right-clicking on the jet engine). As the plane got higher, more pitch-up trim was required to keep it flying level. Also, as the plane got higher, the speed increased (because the thinner air caused less drag), the engine Isp dropped, and the fuel flow rate increased. That last part about the fuel flow rate surprised me because the only thread on the KSP forums that I could find about jet plane fuel efficiency suggested that the rate of fuel consumption was simply proportional to the throttle setting (times the number of engines)...but all of these measurements were being made at the same throttle setting. At 10,000 meters, the amount of pitch-up trim was getting to the point where the plane was becoming difficult to fly (wanting to pitch up even more...and having seen the thing do sudden back flips during test flights on Kerbin when pulling up too much, this was not a regime I cared to explore), so the experiment was stopped at 10,000 meters, and then the plane was taken down to fill in the data for low altitudes (checking the baseline values at 3,000 meters twice more). The data from the flight test are shown below, with graphs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qpLjlmn.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qpLjlmn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting things to note: The fuel flow rate (in whatever units \u0022U\u0022 means) is simply mirroring the decrease in engine Isp. Apparently the jet engine makes this adjustment automatically as you change altitude. Even though the Isp is dropping and the fuel flow rate increasing with altitude, the speed of the plane is increasing even faster with altitude, so the fuel efficiency (found by dividing the fuel flow rate by the air speed) increases with altitude. The BirdDog uses a standard jet engine with two ram air intakes (because I thought those would be useful even for a standard jet engine in Laythe\u0027s thinner atmosphere). Another effect noticed was that each time the measurements were made at 3,000 meters, those values got a little better. This was because the plane was using fuel, so it was getting lighter and more efficient. The last graph applies a rough correction for this increase in performance (about 6% over the time of the test) assuming the data points are spaced equally apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022So it looks like flying high is more efficient, but I\u0027ll keep it well below 10,000 meters for reasons of\u00A0flight stability.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomples: \u0022That\u0027s nice, Aldner.

He passed over the pole at 1000 meters and landed about a half degree south of the pole on the opposite side. The total fuel consumption for the flight north was 139 liters of fuel (out of the 300 liters that BirdDog carries). Aldner then raised the nose gear to go to rover mode, then drove the BirdDog back to the pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YfqEgqy.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YfqEgqy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinding the exact location of the pole is pretty easy because the view direction (and Aldner\u0027s gyrocompass) flips as you pass over it.

This would save jet fuel. The problem was, he was driving nearly straight toward the sun which meant that solar panels on the fuselage of the plane could not get sunlight. So he was only able to drive for about 1.25 degrees of latitude before the batteries ran low. Then he had to stop and park the BirdDog at right angles to Kerbol and let the batteries recharge (this first took about 15 minutes of waiting, but the delay got less each time he stopped further south because the sun angle was increasing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FoKw8l8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FoKw8l8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Aldner approached the edge of the ice cap, he could see that the area near the edge was a different color and slanted down fairly rapidly toward the sea, so he thought it wise not to drive the plane out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228Lx1FYz.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8Lx1FYz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner got out to check out the edge of the ice cap on foot.

Aldner put the BirdDog in rover mode and rolled on over to the GasSation to refuel...and ran into problems. Hmmm...the plane would not quite fit under the refueling boom. OK...try another side. Nope...even worse. Third side\u0027s a charm? No. Well, bugger all. Didn\u0027t I test this refueling setup multiple times back on Kerbin?? Don\u0027t tell me I sent along a version of the GasStation with the booms set too low. Is this going to mean the end of the BirdDog exploring other islands?

But as you see in the picture below, the docking port on the boom is still just barely too low. Grrr. The plane\u0027s docking port is SUPPOSED to fit under the docking port on the boom with a little room to spare, and then the lowering the nose gear is supposed to prop the front of the plane up so the ports make contact.

He gets lined up, then makes sure the rover wheels are free to move (things get \u0027stuck\u0027 if you sit still too long, and then take multiple key-presses to get moving). Then he toggles the rear landing gear...and as the rear gear fold down, he scoots the plane forward and brakes before the rear end bottoms out (since it would probably not be a good idea for the BirdDog to drag its nozzle along the nice clean carpet of sand on Laythe...mostly to prevent damage to the engine). And when he lowers the rear gear again to raise the back of the plane, *click!*, we have a perfect docking! Whew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Q9z5NY5.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q9z5NY5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeeding the BirdDog is completed without any further problems. A reverse dog squat maneuver after undocking allows the plane to disconnect. Also, strangely enough, after having done this, the BirdDog is now able to just barely fit underneath the refueling boom without doing the dog squat again. The position of the GasStation must have shifted a little when the boom was pushed up.

Mission planners had already considered this, and before they would allow Aldner to try to explore one of the other islands, he would first have to test the roving capabilities of the BirdDog on Dansen Island so that one of the other kerbals could come rescue him using the Folding Fido if he ended up wreaking the plane. (Landing and roving on the polar ice cap was not considered a risk, even during early mission planning, because it is so flat.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner got up early and prepared for the drive by first packing the storage compartments of the BirdDog with lots of rations and survival equipment that could sustain him for many months in case he gets stranded. Not that this is expected to be needed on this mission, but standard mission rules for the BirdDog require this preparation. If he ever DOES get stranded on another island, the only way to rescue him at the moment is to use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket, boosting to orbit...refueling...then going down to get Aldner and coming back up. This would probably mean cutting the whole mission short for some or all of the crew. Since nobody wants this to happen, precautions are being taken...including this workout of the BirdDog on Dansen Island.

There is no ground scatter in the lowlands by the Base, so this is the first rock found by the crew. Aldner gets out and chips off a sample and hugs it and calls it George.

In order to make it up this slope with the BirdDog, Aldner had to switchback a couple times, taking the slope at an angle (not straight on). But the BirdDog was able to top the rise (at an elevation over 1,150 meters), and made it into the valley on the other side of the ridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022s9mWyD1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s9mWyD1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen heading down the other side of the ridge into the valley, Aldner had to apply brakes to keep the BirdDog at around 20 m/s (although a couple time it got as fast as 30 m/s, but that was the absolute maximum speed allowed by mission rules). There were several fields of rocks on this side of the ridge, but one caught Aldner\u0027s attention: One of the mysterious rumored \u0022floating rocks.\u0022 It was too high to get a sample, but Aldner got out for some photos, and named the rock Feather.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qy8kVJg.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qy8kVJg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A3UcUjo.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A3UcUjo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were a couple patches of rough ground on the way down to the lake in the bottom of the valley, but for the most part the drive was not difficult.

They got a later start, and they\u0027ve been messing around near the base... let\u0027s get to the serious testing! So the boys bring the Fido back through the base area (and wave to Thompbles as they go by), and head for the hills. The hills to the North, that is.

But it handles very well...except that the hinges make this rover considerably weaker than its non-folding cousins (like I used on Eve and Duna). And high physical time warp is right out, because the mysterious extra time warp weight would smash the rover to the ground. Not that you would want to be doing time warp on a slope like this in any case...your rover would just slide down hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U7vVThZ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U7vVThZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the top of the mountain at 2359 meters.

After one of the game saves, the structure of the Folding Fido rover was ragged. The hinges were a bit off kilter and not connected at quite the right angles. The sides of the rovers had a small angle to them that made the rover somewhat \u0022duck footed\u0022 (or pigeon-toed, if it\u0027s going the other way), and the hinges seemed looser and sloppier than before. Or maybe it just seemed that way because of the difficult driving conditions of the steep descent. But right away I ran into problems where the sides of the rover would skew out suddenly and try to make the rover turn sharply and dig its wheels in and start to tip. Thank Jool for the stabilizing force of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E unit, or these boys would have been tumbling down the hill is a cloud of debris. So I had to drive very slowly, and I had to be vigilant about correcting the sudden turns before they got large. It turned out to be easier to drive it in the \u0022pigeon toed\u0022 direction than the \u0022duck footed\u0022 direction. And things got easier once the slope leveled off more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think the moral of the story is that while a folding rover is cool, it would be much safer for your kerbals if you send them off to work in a rigid rover. I guess I\u0027ll put that on the wish list of stuff for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to send out to Jool in the next shipment. In the meantime, Kurt and Nelemy are just going to have to poke along at a slow but safer speed. Of course, if the game allowed the kerbals to add struts to ships during EVAs, the rover\u0027s frame could be strengthened after deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, Nelemy and Kurt stop at a more impressive-sized rock than the one Aldner sampled.

Huh? A look overhead showed that Kerbol was being eclipsed by Tylo, blocking the light. I still get excited when I see an eclipse in KSP, but I assume these guys who grew up on a planet with a zero inclination orbit and a moon with a zero inclination orbit find these things to be ho-hum. Kurt suggested they get out and gather some samples while waiting for the batteries to recharge.

Larger than the Fido Bay site, but not as flat. Further west they came to another lake, and Nelemy insisted it was Kurt\u0027s turn to name one, so he chose Likeaglove Lake, which slightly puzzled Mission Control, but they did not object. Further west they reached the coast at the location of a nice little bay that Nelemy named Gusden Bay after the first kerbal to land on the Mun. Mission control happily approved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eibRNJF.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eibRNJF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002286z3ChB.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/86z3ChB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKurt and Nelemy will be continuing this journey, probably heading north and driving all the way around the island on an initial geological survey, but I think we can leave them to it at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, down south, Aldner has ended his rover validation journey and lowers the nose gear to turn the BirdDog back into a plane.

But back when I did my first landings on Laythe, I had not yet gotten MechJeb, and I was able to land the Fido Pup rover and the manned mission that followed it into the same landing zone I\u0027m still using for this mission... but if I got within 5 km I was a happy camper (I\u0027d only been playing the game a month back then). If I NEEDED to land closer to a particular spot in my pre-MechJeb days, I\u0027d use F5/F9 as needed to retry, and usually get where I wanted to be in a few tries. In any case, it\u0027s kind of hit and miss when you are using parachutes (not like when I\u0027m landing on Minmus...then it\u0027s not hard to get exactly where I want to be even without MechJeb). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I did my original missions to the Jool system, I looked up aerocapture altitudes on line (but I found some that were wildly off). And I kept track of what I tried and what results I got (one of the reasons I wrote up my missions in detail was so I could go back and look up this stuff). MechJeb can tell you the expected apoapsis after aerobraking (for the current trajectory your on), so I use that if it\u0027s critical what altitude I reach. All of the aerocaptures at Laythe (after Jool aerobreaking) for this mission were around 27.6 km, and those resulted in orbits with 1,000 km apoapses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T19:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPART 4 has been added\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E to the thread (in post #4)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"olopi","CreatedById":61916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T20:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027m just going to say that I really like these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the Naming of Landmarks to the Flavor texts, even the whole Backstory thing, I just really like how you do this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
