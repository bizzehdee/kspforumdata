But back in the \u0022real\u0022 universe, the supernovae had left many new things in their wake, so out with the old, in with the new yet again. First off, money now matters. Second, the new universe has Karbonite instead of Kethane. And for added fun, we have NEAR, Deadly Reentry, TAC Life Support, and even Remote Tech 2. Plus some fun stuff like the super-cool MKS mod, Lack\u0027s SXT to help lift all that, and Station Science. So on with the show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the usual stumbling around and a LOT of testing of parts, the boffins decided they\u0027d saved up enough money and had sufficient tech to start setting up a satellite communications network. This would allow cheaper probe missions, would allow completion of some of the more extreme test contracts, and would allow transmissions from the far side of Mun, which was the next target on the science agenda. The plan for the network was that it would last forever, without needing to be upgraded, to support eventual operations on all planets. This is one reason for the delayed start of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once the necessary tech and money were available, the boffins designed the initial stage of the communications system, the satellites KGN-01, 02, and 03 (Kerbin Geostationary Network). These had the mission covering the entire surface of Kerbin and a useful amount of space around it, plus be able to link to future statellites at Mun and Minmus. Because no network yet existed, the KGN satellites would have to be boosted to orbit with crewed rockets. This made for a long payload, so the NEAR Demons caused problems, but eventually the boffins came up with a reasonably cheap way to placate them:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oo9ZoU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3906/14690565780_1beec16377_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214690565780_1beec16377_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the current version of FAR/NEAR again likes high-mounted SRBs. This seems to vary with each new update. Anyway, it made it to orbit although it was a real fight, so the boffins decided they\u0027d have to get a bit more aerodynamic tech before launching the other KGN satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oEC4Ad\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3850/14876911852_03d1f3159b_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214876911852_03d1f3159b_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce safely at 100km, the payload looked as shown above. The satellite has enough batteries to last when eclipsed by Kerbin for realism, not because it will actually need them while on rails. It has 6x DTS-M1 antenna: 1 coned at Kerbin, 2 for aiming at the other KGN satellites, 2 to be aimed at future Mun satellites, and 1 set to \u0022active vessel\u0022. It also has 3x KR-7 dishes, 2 to be aimed at future Minmus satellites and 1 set on \u0022active vessel\u0022.

Then it was time to get some better tail feathers for subsequent launches, and the boffins had heard these grew in Munar orbit, a place no Kerbal had yet been.

Instead of bulky external pods, now they were neatly enclosed in Universal Storage containers. There were also some totally novel experiments provided by DMagic. The major use of SRBs is a new policy to save money. Also note that the boffins had discovered that the NEAR Demons preferred the SRBS not to have nosecones. After an uneventful trip, the Mun Orbiter Mk 1 duly returned with the bigger tail feathers it had gone to find so the boffins redesigned the KGN launch vehicle and got back to their main project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oErfpb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5586/14874801984_e1b8e82968_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214874801984_e1b8e82968_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis flew no problems and soon KGN-02 was in place about 120^ around from KGN-01 and KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oErfp1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3840/14874801974_83242dfae2_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214874801974_83242dfae2_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an effort to save even more money, the returning KGN crews were directed to land at KSC.

In the meantime, probes will need still need dishes so will be limited to operating in space, not the atmosphere. So still not much doing on some of the really bizarre test contracts, although with all the \u0022active vessel\u0022 dishes on the KGN satellites, probes can fly out ot Minmus no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now the boffins decided to test their new system by putting a probe into polar Kerbin orbit to map it and test out the new scanners for Karbonite and other resources. The other resources can be found with standard dish antenna, actually. Anyway, Karbonite uses the \u0022Open Resources System\u0022, which is significantly different from the familiar Kethane. No more hex grid with limited and depletable quantities that takes forever to scan. Instead, everything is available in limited but inexhaustable quantities everywhere, but has concentrations called \u0022hotspots\u0022 which allow must faster resource collection. IOW, the system is based variable collection rates than on a total amount. Should be interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s the cute little rocket designed for this job, with .... tailfeathers supplied by Porkjet\u0027s Spaceplane\u002B mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oCBYYJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3863/14854263346_817c41e4d0_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214854263346_817c41e4d0_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe long-range dipole still not having been invented, SCANsat Kerbin required 4x DTS-M1 antenna, 1 for each KGN satellite and 1 to scan Kerbin for resources. Plus it had the low-res SCANsat mapper, the SCANsat biome scanner, and the Karbonite scanner. The SCANsat instruments return science so at least this mission wasn\u0027t a total loss on books as the KGN satellites had been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oo9YXo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5582/14690564300_62e8f327a3_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214690564300_62e8f327a3_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe various instruments are pretty power-hungry so it needed a fair amount of solar power. Here, the boffins decided to use some SXT panels. Each is nearly as powerful as a Gigantor but is immobile so they needed 1 for each direction. But this was still lighter and cheaper than using Gigantors and it all seemed to work OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/ooabRc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5573/14690604309_82e3e9fa93_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214690604309_82e3e9fa93_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SCANsat mapping was uneventful so attention focused on the Karbonite scan, which would have implications for future missions elsewhere.

Hopefully this isn\u0027t going to be the normal thing elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after this, the boffins decided to get back to research (they still had nearly $3M in the bank from the previous orgy of part-testing) so sent another Munar Orbiter with a few more instruments that had been developed in the meantime. Then it was finally time to do a Munar landing. In the interests of being cheap, they designed the smallest Mun rocket they\u0027d yet built, with the tightest margins of delta-V.

They invented these parts very soon after the supernova made them start afresh, at a time when the KTC had very little money and nearly no rocket parts. Nevertheless, the boffins gave it a go, spending nearly the entire budget on a station that was only in orbit for a few days and hardly accomplished anything scientific. This set the whole space program back and the rest of the time before Chapter 1 was spent begging money doing a huge amount of part testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the boffins\u0027 dreams of building a proper science station never faded, even if it would be a white elephant.

However, the existence of the KGN satellites enabled some extremely dangerous but irresistably profitable contracts to be carried out with probes. Here are a couple of test vehicles, testing 3.75m rocket engines under bizarre combinations of speed and altitude.

It was all over the maria and in and around most craters. SCANsat Mun also paid bills by testing some decouplers in Munar orbit for a very significant payday. With the bank account back over $450K and with the Munar communications system tested, it was finally time to blow the wad on the long-desired Science Station, which the boffins decided would be at Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom them as don\u0027t know, Station Science consists of a 15-ton, 4-Kerbal lab module which is required for all experiments but can only do 1 experiment, \u0022Plant Growth\u0022, by itself (as shown in the video above). To do the other experiments, you need 1 or 2 cyclotrons, which weigh 35 tons each and require insane amounts of electricity over a long period of time. Once you have these things, you can then send up small, light, cheap modules containing the experiments, run them through the lab and cyclotron(s), and take them home to get the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the 1st thing to do was to get the lab module into Munar orbit. Based on experience with the original \u0022station\u0022, the boffins chose a 250km altitude to warp fast through the long run-time of the experiments.

It also carried enough life support for the crew to remain on station for nearly 2 years. Which they\u0027ll probably have to do because getting this station set up pretty much drained the bank account again, as you\u0027ll see. But to help with that, the lab module has a retractable magnetometer boom to periodically do regular science contracts in Munar orbit as they become available (there\u0027s a tiny probe with a thermometer in Kerbin orbit now for the same purpose).

At its present state development, Karbonite equipment is all big and clunky, so their lander designs pretty much needed 3.75m rockets. These having been obtained finally, the boffins set to work finalizing the Mun mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea was to totally pillage all the Science! from Mun\u0027s various biomes with a reusable lander and a Mobile Lab. However, instead of having to send a large orbital fuel tank to refuel the lander as had been done at Minmus prior to the Supernovae of \u002724, this new lander would refuel itself on the surface using Karbonite. Karbonite being available on every square inch of the surface, the lander wouldn\u0027t be forced to miss any biomes. Also, Karbonite itself can be burned as fuel in special rocket engines (insane TWR, pathetic ISP), so there was no need to carry a refinery along. So if the lander didn\u0027t need to go up to refuel, the boffins ultimately decided it could also just lug the Mobile Lab around with it, this not adding too much to what was already a very massive vehicle, and thus eliminate the whole time-consuming process of many dockings. But the lander was complicated a bit in having to carry 2x radial drills, there being no good way to use the single ventral drill when the vehicle also needed a heat shield. The boffins thought about jettisoning the drill for reentry but that would have made the lander even more top-heavy and complicated, so settled for a more brute-force approach.

First, when the pilot climbed out of the lander can on top, he hit his head on the big parachute and immediately fell off all the way to the ground. And the boffins having neglected to put ladders near the experiments up there just below the can, this made it next to impossible to collect the data and bring it to the Mobile Lab. Even worse, the boffins had sent the ship fully crewed so the pilot couldn\u0027t even get in the door of the Mobile Lab anyway, and sending one of the scientists out to get the data ran into the same access problems with the experiments that the pilot had encountered.

No more insanely time consuming hex-by-hex scanning--I\u0027d seriously rather gouge my eyes out with a fork than scan for Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Karbonite never gets used up so you can actually make large-scale, permanent things relying on it. Kethane seems to have been designed to support small, finite operations, like for exploration, not occupation. The industrial-scale consumption I inflicted on it used it up in a hurry (although usually not entirely before a supernova happened).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Karbonite can be used itself as a rocket fuel, although it\u0027s not too efficient. Still, it creates enough thrust that you don\u0027t need that much efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Karbonite\u0027s distribution varies with the planet in question instead and is based on its terrain, instead of using the same random hex grid distribution algorithm for them all. As a result, you get logical distributions that make sense for that planet, and don\u0027t have situations like last time I went to Laythe where 99.9% of the Kethane was inaccessible due to being in the water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You can get to the Karbonite no matter where it is (on land, in the water, or in the air). This provides variety and multiple challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never used Dangit!

This ring was reached by a Y-shaped ladder above the hatch of the Mobile Lab, so collecting the data was the job of the 2 Kerbals in the lab. Not so obvious is that the position of the lander can and the 1.25m Universal Storage science bay were reversed so the pilot wouldn\u0027t hit his head on the chute anymore.

Also transmitted would be the \u0022flying over (insert biome name)\u0022 EVA reports obtained by the pilot while hanging onto his hatch, and the crew reports. Besides collecting and storing the data from the Goo and Materials, the EVA\u0027d lab resident would also go to the surface, obtain a sample and another EVA report, and plant a flag to help Mission Control remember where the ship had been already. While this latter EVA report could have been transmitted, it plus the surface sample plus the 8x Goos and Materials made for an even 10 experiments returned per biome, which made it easier to keep count of how many biomes the ship had been to by checking the inventory of the Mobile Lab.

Its 12x 400-unit batteries weren\u0027t enough to last out the Munar night running life support, and by this point in time the Midland Craters where the lander currently sat was in the dark.

Furthermore, all this mucking about with communications satellites, especially chasing down stray satellites, plus going to Minmus just once and all the biome-hopping on Mun, had consumed a lot of time. So when the boffins sobered up after celebrating the return of the Karbonite Mun Lander Mk 2, they suddenly realized it was only a few days (the KTC, seeing no compelling reason to change, continues to use 24-hr days) until the transfer window for Duna opened. What to do about that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe natural reaction of the KTC, based on its long tradition, was to immediately start a crash design program for a huge and overly complex flotilla. But then a junior boffin reminded his superiors that this was no longer possible, first, on account of the amount of the newly invented money this would cost and, second, because the Supernovae of \u002724 had wiped out the manufacturing capability of the fully autonomous probes the KTC had previously relied upon. No, for the time being, the KTC was having to use dumb probes controlled from KSC via all those troublesome communications satellites. And due to the press of other business, the deep space relay satellites hadn\u0027t even been designed yet, much less put into position (which they would take a year or so to reach). Egad!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany boffins questioned the necessity of going to Duna at all. Given the travel time, it was pretty certain all remaining blueprints would be found on Minmus before the Duna ship(s) even reached their target, much less came home. But the accountants pointed to contractual obligations to go not just to Duna but Ike as well so there was no escaping having to send SOMETHING. And whatever went had to map both bodies. Normally, this would have been a job for probes, which also would have set up a refueling infrastructure while crewed ships set up stations and did landings. But such grandiose projects were beyond the technological and financial means of the KTC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end it was decided to send just 1 big crewed ship. This ship would map both Duna and Ike from polar orbit, plus do a lot of science in the area, but would not land. Thus, it needed a lot of delta-V not just to get there and back but for substantial maneuvering within the Duna system. Plus every instrument in the arsenal. The boffins toyed with the idea of it being a mothership controlling a swarm of probes without signal delay (that is, an RT \u0022Command Center\u0022) but this proved to be impractical for the time being. Thus, the end result was a huge abortion weighing in at about 115 tons for the Duna-bound payload. And it needed an impressively large lifter with a newly invented 5m rocket on the bottom. Surprisingly, the end result only cost about $270K. The KTC has sent more expensive things to Mun in recent memory. They called this monstrosity the \u0022Duna 1\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oM5Hd8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3871/14950010291_7a3b82d012_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214950010291_7a3b82d012_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose SRBs are the big ones from the NASA pack and the smallest visible tanks are 3.75m. Apart from the NASA SRBs, the lifter is SXT. So are the radially mounted nuclear engines, the boffins somehow having made the LV-Ns only burn liquid hydrogen. which requires ridiculously huge tanks. The boffins considered pushing the mission payload with VASIMR engines, which would have worked just fine except they were hideously expensive. Had the top stage been VASIMRs, this rocket would have cost over $3 MILLION instead of not quite $300K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe continual taper from 3.75m to 5m in the lower stage caused some concern with SRB separation, especially as radial decouplers haven\u0027t been acting as expected since the Supernovae of \u002724, but putting 2x Sepratrons top and toe resulted in a clean staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oKjLkQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5557/14930119406_b5852b7242_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214930119406_b5852b7242_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boffins had by this point established clear dominance over the NEAR demons so the rest of the rocket made it to orbit just fine, putting the payload into a 100km orbit with about 20m/s to spare, just as planned.

This will enable Duna 1 to transmit Science! back to Kerbin most of the time. The round solar panels only rotate on 1 axis so usually only 2 of them will be working. Also up there are a Karbonite scanner, a biome scanner, and a low-res radar mapper. Behind the nose girder is a Universal Storage ring with all the reusable experiments, which will be transmitted. Then there\u0027s a 2-kerbal can and a 2-kerbal version of the Hitchhiker from SXT. Behind this are 2 Universal Storage rings full of Goos and Materials (so 8 of each). 2 of each will be used in the Kerbol SOI, and 3 each in low orbit at Duna and Ike. All this will hopefully return safely to the surface on Kerbin. This is all pushed by the 2 radial nukes with over 5000 m/s in the tank and copious RCS to swing the vast bulk around in a reasonable time.
