Welcome to SeaFoam!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time back I decided I wanted to run a mod-light KSP career play-through based around the Making History expansion. The idea was I\u0027d only use graphical and user-interface mods and see what I could do with the new parts in the expansion. And I\u0027d do it all with no reverts, limited design time, low stress, just winging it all as I went along. In other words: play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was brutal. Over the course of 34 flights I lost six kerbals. Two died in what I\u0027d categorize as freak training accidents. The first kerbal in space died when he popped his capsule on the side of a mountain. The first kerbal in orbit died when her capsule became a dart during reentry and slammed into the desert at Mach 2. Two others died during early aircraft tests, one due to the slabtastic landing gear springs, the other due to bad decisions while flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately the survivors made it to the M\u00FCn, landed rather roughly, planted a flag, and came home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180728_ksp0451_starfish_26.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/seafoam/20180728_ksp0451_starfish_26.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180728_ksp0499_starfish_26.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/seafoam/20180728_ksp0499_starfish_26.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is not that play-through.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I was running through that career I found I wanted more. More than my usual milieu of mods and plugins. More than I was doing in Forgotten Space Program. More than just some graphical dressing. More failures. More chaos. More dumb kerbals. More random explosions. More hard decisions. More challenge. More than just Making History. I wanted to make a new history. Tell a new story. Forge a new path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately all that \u0022more\u0022 was more than my computer could handle. And I introduced some ugly mod incompatibilities I was ultimately unable to track down. On top of that, if I right clicked on a capsule I was presented with a list of buttons and stats twice as tall as my monitor. A lone kerbal on EVA was enough to cause the framerate clock to go red.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually they made it to orbit, but not without their own share of major trauma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180816_ksp0195_orbit.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/seafoam/20180816_ksp0195_orbit.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is not that play-through either.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had to scale back my ambitions and find something that was stable and yet still captured the spirit of what I was after. Something... less. I\u0027d need to lose things such as CryoEngines and the NearFuture suite of mods. Maybe I could add them back in later, or maybe I\u0027ll wait until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E are updated to use them again.

I also had to lose some resource-heavy plugins, and a few parts mods I rather like but will either use in Forgotten or return to later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually I settled on the following list. The three which will have the largest impact on gameplay are BARIS, Kerbal Construction Time, and Principia. Funding for this adventure is to be provided by Monthly Budgets, on a 49.5-day minth (rounded up to 50). Celestial bodies are hidden and will be discovered by either scientific endeavor using Research Bodies or by brute force using kinetic assaults. Kerbals will need to eat, and drink, and breathe, and excrete, all with TAC. Oh, and we\u0027re going to the Outer Planets.

Well, no, they call us much worse than that. Thief, traitor, degenerate, frog, kerman..., spume. Or they call us nothing at all. Usually they just spit at us or kick us away. We\u0027re the rejects, the convicts, the outcasts, those who dare to question the \u0022proper\u0022 order of things. Those who do not belong in the society of the Deep Ones. Those who no longer serve the Great Old One.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur punishment? Elevation. Banishment from the deep waters and the safety of the drowned cities, condemned forever to the shores and shallows. They take our true names, brand us as Kerman, and cut the webbing from our fingers to make sure we can never swim home. Some get lucky, float into a friendly cave with good air. Some become hermits and dig their own tiny domes in the soft soils near the coast. Most just wash up on shore, churned about and spat out by the ocean that birthed them, dead, lungs full of the dry surface air. SeaFoam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a hard life, up here close to dry land. The heat goes out for half the day, and when it\u0027s here the water is so blindingly bright it stings your eyes. Food is scarce, and we fight for it with critters larger than your usual grabtooth or dogfish. There\u0027s not much in the way of good minerals, and what forges and factories we have are fed by inferior fuels. Our tools and ships tend to be cobbled together deathtraps. And good wet air is neigh on impossible to find.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what choice do we have? We can\u0027t fight the deep ones any more than we can grow wings and fly. So we band together, form our own societies, our own little governments. Trade is essential to our survival. Caravans of float ships take raw materials, food, and finished goods all over the seas and trade them for more of the same. They tread only the shallower seas, as the Deep Ones get angry if we venture too close to their cities. To our former homes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd maybe we\u0027ve learned something the deep ones don\u0027t know. There\u0027s more water, more oceans, up beyond the sky. The legends told of them, the forbidden stories. Said we could reach those unclaimed waters if we worked hard and were pure enough and blah ti di blah. Me? I think all legends are bunk, but what do I know? I\u0027m just a lowly spume. Legend or not, some kerbs far smarter than myself built gizmos to find that water beyond the sky. And they\u0027ve spotted it everywhere they looked. Granted they\u0027ve only looked at the M\u00FCn, but you have to start somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow these same madkerbs want to go up to the puddles in the stars and live there. Dig new air domes, fill \u0027em with healthy, wet air. Maybe we could find a new home, a safe harbor beyond the reach of our arrogant cousins and those who lord over the depths of Kerbin. Make us some place where the weirdos and the outcasts and the kelp-eaters can all belong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do I think? You probably already know the answer.

It\u0027s not my real name, but it\u0027s the best one you\u0027ll get. And it\u0027s the name everybody knows me by. Most days I\u0027m off running a hustle, sprinting contraband through deep waters, or maybe introducing two frogs for a business deal or three. The good days? Well these madkerbs pay me to stand around and watch stuff explode. It\u0027s quite a bit of fun, even if I secretly think they\u0027re trying to off me. Or maybe they don\u0027t care. They would care, if they knew who I really was, but my life is easier this way so let\u0027s just stick with Jonesy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see, these crazy frogs all started from nothing, and that ain\u0027t so easy. Nothing\u0027s ever easy. That\u0027s true for everything from digging mud domes to building slick space ships. I figure it\u0027s why they came to me in the first place. You see, my reputation in such matters is, well, it\u0027s rather unique. Finding the things these poor frogs needed to start from said nothing and do the impossible is exactly my speciality. \u0022Hey Jonesy, help a kerb out would\u0027ja?\u0022 \u0022Of course!\u0022 I might yell back. \u0022Anything for the right price!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me tell you now, there ain\u0027t no price that was ever right enough for these nutters. Ole\u0027 Jonesy should\u0027ve swum away and kept at his old gigs. But what did I know? Sure didn\u0027t know enough then. I figured the pillars of fire and the occasional explosion were worth the risk. Ha!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wildest thing of all is these frogs tried to launch rockets from the bottom of the sea. Heavy, solid fueled things, shot straight out of the hole they were built in. The first one exploded in the mud, so the damage wasn\u0027t all that bad. The second? The third? They blew up in the water, exactly like sonic charges. The shockwaves killed every kerman within range. The ones almost in range? Busted eyes, popped ear skins, internal hemorrhaging, bruises all over, the usual. Good way to wipe out a bunch of undesirables and outcasts, not so great for getting into the sky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I fixed \u0027em up real good. Introduced them to a few union guys, construction workers and shipwrights and whatnot. We put together a nice little complex here along the shore. Great place. Prime swampland. Just a few steps below 13\u00BA South on the old latitude. And most of it\u0027s buried in the mud, all the factories, the ship launch, the wet-docks and whatnot. Safe. Took ages to build, and it employees more of us outcasts than I ever thought existed. Only the final bits are up above the surface, all the assembly buildings, the pair of launchpads, the blast-proof observation building and so on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nY\u0027know, why bother blasting out through the water if you\u0027re just trying to fly through the air? It\u0027s dangerous, yeah, all that dry air, but it\u0027s usually so humid in these latitudes you can spend a minute outside before your lungs seize up.

Now that was fun. That little capsule shot off into the sky hard enough to nearly knock me out. Most of the astronutters actually passed out, even Kazu and that Berlin girl.

Why a kerbal of my background does such grunt work? I\u0027ll tell you. It\u0027s entertaining, interesting, and gives me a good excuse to put on a hardhat and stand around like I\u0027m still some important bullfrog. Sometimes they even let me test stuff underwater. Those are the fun ones, though I\u0027m not about to get outside the pod when the tests are running - I\u0027ve already seen the aftermath. No thanks, I prefer to not bleed from orifices that I\u0027m not supposed to have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180818_ksp0004_underwater.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/seafoam/20180818_ksp0004_underwater.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an added plus all this testing makes my side gig a little easier. Maybe a new rocket engine goes missing. Maybe it exploded on the test stand. Maybe it just rolled down the ramp and into my ship that just happened to be waiting to carry it off to some frog that\u0027ll pay me top shell for it. Who could ever say for sure? Not like anybody would miss it. The accounting around here is already rather laissez-faire, whatever that means.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re funded by the floatship traders league, and none of them will dare cross me if they know what\u0027s good for \u0027em. The budget allocations they slide us every 50 or so days are very much use-it or lose-it, so you might say I\u0027m making the most efficient use of the shells they give us.

The first things we launched that intentionally made it to space were small \u0022sounding\u0022 rockets. Shot a few straight up, shot a few more off at angles. Eventually we figured out how to recover the little capsule bit at the tip of it, useful skill for whenever we send a kerbal up. Mostly these sounders just disintegrated while screaming skyward, their debris fired out into space like shot from a scattergun. They were all part of the rather generic \u0022Tadpole X\u0022 program, just like my equipment liberation..., er, rocket engine tests.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180818_ksp0015_sounding.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/seafoam/20180818_ksp0015_sounding.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBarnacles\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we decided to shoot frogs up into space too. Heck, we not only decided to send them to space, but also to orbit. Tadpole steps? Whazzat? Now these silly looking capsules we\u0027ve built, they might have room for a small kerbal inside, but there was nowhere to stick a flight computer. And seeing as we wouldn\u0027t be able to talk to the thing after it went over the horizon we\u0027d never know if it actually made it into orbit. Maybe half a day later we\u0027d pick up its radio signal again when it drifted overhead. All that trouble goes away if you just send a meat computer up instead. And there\u0027s quite a few volunteers here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose volunteers? The pilots? They were the real crazy ones. These mad kerbs were floatship pilots before they signed up, which might explain some things. Not that guiding a ship atop the seas through a poisonous atmosphere prepared any of \u0027em for what they signed on for. Sure, Kazu knew what she was doing, but Berlin? She was absolutely out there. Talked kinda funny, a bit like that famous rocket frog, and claimed to be a \u0022commercial astronut\u0022 when she joined. Never mind none of these frogs had even been to space and so couldn\u0027t possibly be a commercial astro-anything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKazu got close to space during one of the Tadpole X tests, but that was as much an accident as it was an event. Calmin was the only slightly sane one, but he was a deep ship captain for the Navy before he was elevated. That military background must\u0027ve hardened up his noggin, though not enough to keep him from whatever crime it was that banished him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of us just kinda wandered in here. Me, you already know my story. As much as I\u0027m going to tell you anyway. Trisel was hired on as a Flight Scientist, meaning she was also on the short list to die horribly. Spaghetti showed up for dinner one night and hasn\u0027t left since. He\u0027s a bit like me, a shady drifter who trades info for food, so it was only natural he\u0027d become another Flight Engineer. He\u0027s good at it, even if he\u0027s a bit dull.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that was it that first year, just six of us space frogs.

Fitting, given she\u0027s been with the program almost as long as me. There was a dark ceremony the night before her launch to beg for protection from the Great Dread One himself. I didn\u0027t bother to go, as there\u0027s not much you could do to convince me those old superstitions are anything more than madness, but to each their own. It\u0027s not like His Sunken Dreadness did anything to keep us from being ostracized and elevated in the first place, so if he\u0027s actually real, he can get stuffed. I hear stuffed octopus makes for a tasty snack anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning the old girl was strapped into the Barnacle 001 and shot off into orbit. Not much fanfare to it, just slap the hatch shut, lift the rocket up onto the pad, and boom - she\u0027s gone. The LR-01c Dogfish rocket was a bit of a beast when it came to small payloads like us frogs, if a bit dangerous. This one worked as intended, which was a good thing considering all the testing we threw at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall it was a good flight and Kazu did us all proud. First frog in space, first kerman in orbit, first seafoam to go outside their spaceship. Lots of firsts. Lots of science, too. She only stayed up there for an orbit, and we got to watch her reentry from the space center.

Sorry, that name really wasn\u0027t my idea, but I\u0027m going to run with it when I can. The science whizzes went all foamy when they saw the stack of samples Kazu brought back. And the rest of us had fifty-two questions for her to pick up. Whatzit like? Did ya see any Great Old Ones? Are those deadly space fungi still a thing?

Was it smiling at you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest surprise of all was when Kazu started going on about other planets and such. Big bright spots too dull to be stars yet too bright to be dull. Wanderers. We\u0027d seen them from the surface, the floatship frogs all knew about them, but nobody had ever suggested they might be anything more than really bored stars that felt the need to pace across the sky.

These new ones are tiny from what she could tell, but they were all sorts of colors you didn\u0027t see from down here. Green and brown and red and blue and so forth and when did this become a home decorating show? Even a mint ice-cream looking one. Maybe a really dark grey one, but that might have been a speck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe she\u0027s right, maybe she\u0027s wrong, but what do I know? We had some other frogs start looking into it anyway. They\u0027re out there now in their observatory, \u0022searching the skies\u0022 and whatnot. They might just be weirder than us. Guess it goes with the territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was all good info, good intel, too good to sit on. I decided maybe it was time to take another of those vacations. Visit a few friends. Make a few shells. Maybe see if they knew anything we didn\u0027t. Maybe suggest they start looking in a few new places for things that might be beneficial to the lot of us. Make all of us rich.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I got back and we got around to running a serious space exploration program.
