Initial launches carry a Communotron 16 and Goo containment unit. The initial configuration was amended with the structural pylons dropped after the vehicle developed uncontrollable rotation after lift-off. Thanks to the ability to jettison lower stages, this 1.0b version comfortably achieved orbit with Jebediah Kerbin able to conduct an extended EVA (well....let\u0027s just say it took a while to get things under control and a few attempts to safely get him back to and inside the ship) and perform Goo observations.

Advances in science points saw the program develop larger engines and fuel tanks, allowing development of the Dresden launch platform, which allowed Mun and Minmus landers that were able to return to Kerbin. Small improvements were made to the Dresden series, initiating the St Petersberg platform, and a single manned capsule substituted for the probe head on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, this platform completed major local system objectives for VAT Aerospace - to land a Kerbal on the Mun and Minmus, and safely return them to Kerbin.

A small probe was successfully landed on Duna, and adoption of the ScanSat technology has allowed full mapping of Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus, with a mapping probe sent to Eve, which has mapped around two thirds of the planet around the equator (insufficient fuel was left for polar regions - a later mission with a polar insertion is planned to complete mapping). A landing attempt with a probe was made but was ultimately unsuccessful due to the omission of a seperator between the de-orbiting stage and lander, but a lot of science was gained on the descent - a second lander, properly configured, is planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediate priorities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mapping of Eve and Duna, and their respective moons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- unmanned lander on Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- unmanned lander (as opposed to probe) on Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- three man capsule landings on the Mun and Minmus, with an eye to investigating biomes on the Mun, and establishing more permanent facilities on the Mun and Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- investigation of anomalies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, my flying skills are definitely improving. I\u0027m getting much more accurate with my insertions now, with aerobraking used for the Duna and Eve probes (adjust early, adjust often...), and unmanned/manned missions returning from the Mun and Minmus. Landing skills are on the improve, with the manned Minmus landing being particularly smooth (although the flat areas make for a pretty easy time of it). Jeb\u0027s landing on the Mun was somewhat fraught, with the landing ending up on its side but able to be righted with gyros. I need to make a habit of landing in daylight - the lights aren\u0027t really powerful enough for someone of my skill to safely put on in sloped regions at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have installed two mods - Kerbal Alarm Clock and as mentioned above, ScanSat. The KAC mod is particularly helpful - I\u0027ve been able to study and have the game run, setting the alarm and time warp to coincide with study breaks, as well as negating my unfortunate habit of warping past mission critical moments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T23:40:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vat","CreatedById":32259,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T02:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and some fail shots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img585/2964/ztd7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ztd7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img801/3270/87hj.png\u0022 alt=\u002287hj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
