(Using my existing rocket performance calculation spreadsheets and the equations for Brachistochrone transfers provided by Atomic Rockets.) I\u0027ll be calculating a thirty minute one-way trip from Kerbin to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn using a Brachistochrone transfer (accelerate halfway there, then flip around and decelerate the other half of the way). I\u0027m not doing a round trip since a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to Kerbin trip can accelerate the whole way and use the atmosphere to slow down.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Brachistochrone equation is:\n\u003E \n\u003E T = 2 \\* sqrt(D/A)\n\u003E \n\u003E Where:\n\u003E \n\u003E T is transit time is seconds\n\u003E \n\u003E D is distance in meters\n\u003E \n\u003E A is acceleration in meters per second per second\n\u003E \n\u003E For a thirty minute one-way trip to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, our time is 1800 seconds. The M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn has a perfectly circular orbit of 12000000 meters. However, it is 200000 meters in radius, and Kerbin is 600000 meters in radius, so our actual distance (assuming a perfectly spherical M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn [and cow]) is 11200000 meters. So we have:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1800 = 2 \\* sqrt(11200000/A)\n\u003E \n\u003E (Divide both sides by 2.)\n\u003E \n\u003E 900 = sqrt(11200000/A)\n\u003E \n\u003E (Square both sides.)\n\u003E \n\u003E 810000 = 11200000/A\n\u003E \n\u003E (Multiply by A)\n\u003E \n\u003E 810000 \\* A = 11200000\n\u003E \n\u003E (Divide both sides by 810000.)\n\u003E \n\u003E A = 13.827\n\u003E \n\u003E So our one way torchship to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn needs to accelerate at about one and a half gees.\n\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s the delta-v?\n\u003E \n\u003E To find that, we need to use this equation:\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta-v = 2 \\* sqrt(D \\* A)\n\u003E \n\u003E Same terms as above. Delta-v is delta-v (the snozberries taste like snozberries!)\n\u003E \n\u003E So we plug in our mumbers from above:\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta-v = 2 \\* sqrt(11200000 \\*13.827)\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta-v = 2 \\* sqrt(154862400)\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta-v = 2 \\* 12444.372\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta-v = 24888.744\n\u003E \n\u003E So to do a one-way trip to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in thirty minutes, our rocket will need to have almost 25 km/s of delta-v, and be capable of accelerating at one and a half gees. This only gets worse when you add in the delta-v for the trip back (which could actually be done faster since you can accelerate the whole way, which also means your trip to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn can take more the 30 minutes if you want to do an hour round trip). This also doesn\u0027t take into account losses from atmospheric drag, or time lost while turning around to decelerate or spent on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn after landing. But I think it\u0027s safe to say that your boostship will need upwards of 40 km/s of delta-v.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll be calculating the mass ratio (and estimated size) of the 25 km/s, thirty minute to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn ship in a later post.\n\u003E \n\u003E TL;DR: Much rocket, such delta-v.\n\nEdit: Second round of number crunching\n\nOkay, I decided to take a stab at calculating the delta-v needed for a complete, one-hour round trip between Kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. The math for this is similar to the last one, so I\u0027ll stick it inside spoilers so you can skip it if you want.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First, some starting assumptions. I\u0027m assuming that you want to make a one-hour round trip (this was stated in OP, so not a huge assumption.) I\u0027m also assuming that you will be thrusting the entire time (again, stated in OP.) Now we get to some \u0022spherical cow\u0022 assumptions.\n\u003E \n\u003E I am assuming that the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Kerbin are both perfectly spherical (they aren\u0027t). I\u0027m also assuming that you can turn around and begin decelerating instantly (doubtful), and that you will spend zero time between M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar touchdown and liftoff (also doubtful). I\u0027m also assuming that you can fly perfectly, and that you begin the deceleration burn at exactly the right moment (again, doubtful). I also assume that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere will decelerate you instantly when you hit sea level (slightly less doubtful).\n\u003E \n\u003E First, our trajectory to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. This is a Brachistochrone transfer, like we looked at in the last post. This time, though, we\u0027ll try to do our Kerbin to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn part of the trip in 40 minutes, while the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to Kerbin leg will be 20 minutes.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s the math for the Brachistochrone, for those of you following along at home:\n\u003E \n\u003E 2400 = 2 \\* sqrt(11200000/A)\n\u003E \n\u003E 1200 = sqrt(11200000/A)\n\u003E \n\u003E 1440000 = 11200000/A\n\u003E \n\u003E 1440000 \\* A = 11200000\n\u003E \n\u003E A = 11200000/1440000\n\u003E \n\u003E A = 7.777 m/s^2 (approximately 0.8 gees)\n\u003E \n\u003E Now for the delta-v:\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = 2 \\* sqrt(11200000 \\* 7.777)\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = 2 \\* sqrt(87102400)\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = 2 \\* 9332.866\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = 18665.733\n\u003E \n\u003E Not bad. It\u0027s better than the first 30 minute ship. But we still need the return ship.\n\u003E \n\u003E The math for this is actually easier than the Brachistochrone, since we don\u0027t need to worry about slowing down.\n\u003E \n\u003E A = D/T^2\n\u003E \n\u003E So:\n\u003E \n\u003E A = (11200000)/(1200^2)\n\u003E \n\u003E A = 11200000/1440000\n\u003E \n\u003E A = 11200000/1440000\n\u003E \n\u003E A = 7.777\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey, wait, that\u0027s the same acceleration as our Kerbin to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn ship which made the distance in twice the time! That\u0027s because the previous one only accelerated half of the way, before turning around to decelerate. The return ship can accelerate the entire way, then use Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to slow down. \n\u003E \n\u003E So what\u0027s our delta-v? This one\u0027s another simple one.\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = A \\* T\n\u003E \n\u003E Acceleration multiplied by time is velocity, and since our initial velocity is zero, our delta-v is just our final velocity (before aerocrushing aerobraking.)\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = 7.777 \\* 1200\n\u003E \n\u003E Dv = 9333.333\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey, that\u0027s not too bad! When you combine it with the delta-v from the Kerbin to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn ship, our total delta-v is 28000 m/s! That\u0027s far less than what I expected based off of the numbers for the 30 minute ship. So obviously, doing the first leg of the trip (relatively) slowly, and then doing the return trip quickly is better than doing them both the same speed.\n\u003E \n\u003E But we\u0027re missing a few things.\n\u003E \n\u003E You may have noticed that our acceleration is only 0.8 gees. This is bad. This isn\u0027t enough to take off from Kerbin. So we need higher acceleration. But not for the entire trip. Only until we hit Kerbin escape velocity. (You could probably drop your acceleration sooner, but you\u0027d have losses due to gravity.)\n\u003E \n\u003E The wiki informs us that Kerbin escape velocity is 3431 m/s. Round up and call it an even 3500.\n\u003E \n\u003E What about losses due to atmospheric drag?\n\u003E \n\u003E I have no idea. My completely unscientific estimate is that you\u0027ll need around 2000 m/s of extra delta-v to escape the atmosphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E So 30000 m/s of delta-v. Tack on another couple thousand as a safety margin. The first 5000 m/s or so of this need to be done at an acceleration greater than 9.81 m/s^2 (I\u0027m adding in the losses due to drag to the boost stage.) Once you hit escape velocity, you can drop your acceleration to 7.777 m/s^2.\n\u003E \n\u003E How big is this rocket?\n\u003E \n\u003E Assuming a specific impulse of 360 seconds (the Isp of the Mainsail), and that our delta-v budget is 32000 m/s, the rocket will have a mass ratio of 8613.18. This is a rocket that is over 99.98% propellant by mass. Yikes.\n\u003E \n\u003E What if we try nukes? With an ISP of 800, our mass ratio can only improve.\n\u003E \n\u003E According to my spreadsheets, this gives a mass ratio of 59, or 98.3% propellant by mass. That\u0027s a bit better.\n\u003E \n\u003E What about ions? With their ISP of 4200 seconds, we get a mass ratio of 2.17, or 54% propellant by mass. Hey, that\u0027s not bad!\n\u003E \n\u003E Unfortunately, ion engines are not an option for our torchship, since their thrust is too low for our acceleration needs.\n\u003E \n\u003E So how do we manage to attain such ridiculous mass ratios?\n\u003E \n\u003E We cheat the rocket equation.\n\u003E \n\u003E With staging.\n\u003E \n\u003E Lots of staging.\n\u003E \n\u003E To figure out the mass ratio of a multi-stage rocket, you take the mass ratios of all of the individual stages, and you multiply them.\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I said multiply.\n\u003E \n\u003E For a mass ratio of 8613.18, assuming each of our individual stages has a mass ratio of 9 (88.88% propellant by mass), we\u0027d need to have more than four stages but less than 5. These are, of course, massive stages.\n\nAll of the above math was done with some pretty big assumptions in mind, so take it with a Gilly-sized grain of salt. In reality, said rocket might need more or less delta-v depending on landing site, atmospheric drag, piloting skills, and design. Assuming that asparagus staging is used, your number of stages will almost certainly be more than 5. But it should give you an idea of the size of the rocket required.\n\nI have no idea what a thirty minutes round trip would look like. I can run the numbers if anyone wants me too, but I think it\u0027s safe to assume that the final numbers will be drastically larger than an hour round trip.\n\nTL;DR: 32000 m/s of delta-v, lots of staging.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T20:12:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GreenWolf**\n  \nUpdate"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T02:18:50Z","Content":"\u0022These are, of course, massive stages.\u0022\n\nGood..."}]}
