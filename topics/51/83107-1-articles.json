I completed the contracts, but found that it was quite difficult to simultaneously fly high enough and slow enough to meet the required conditions. By the time the tests were complete, I realised I had already flown a quarter of the way around Kerbin and by coincidence had used a quarter of my fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a bit of fun, I decided to keep going and try to fly all the way around Kerbin and try to make it all the way back to the KSC. I fully expected that I would burn through my remaining fuel and have to make a rough landing somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit, I\u0027ve read accounts of \u0022Air Hogging\u0022, which supposedly is achieved by means of part clipping, intake spamming, and generally building planes in ways that were unintended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ultimately ended up circumnavigating Kerbin three times, purely because I underestimated how difficult it would be to bring myself back down from sub-orbit with only control surfaces and an air breathing engine to guide my aircraft. Third time around, I managed to bring my craft down close enough to the KSC to make a powered go-around and land on the runway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1zSm8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
