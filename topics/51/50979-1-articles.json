It is a multi-kilometer deep HOLE. That\u0027s all there is to it. There have been other projects that use the Munhole, such as the Hanging Gardens of Mun, but I\u0027d like to make this massive hole (shut up) more known.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X6JmWhD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X6JmWhD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperation Munhole is an effort to create a large versatile base that can have multiple purposes. As of now, the base consists of three modules: the hab module, the generator tower and the skycrane. Using KAS, I can easily attach these modules and create a large, non-dense base. For heavy lifting purposes, we have a skycrane equipped with a winch (farthest to the right). For living quarters and whatever Kerbals do just sitting there, there is the Habitation Module, or Hab Module for short (far left). And finally (for the moment) there is the generator station (middle), or as I like to call it, the TOWER OF POWER. The Tower of Power, or TOP for short, supplies solar and RTG power for all of the other modules in the base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned additions include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A mobile Kethane mining ship, as there is no Kethane present in the Munhole area as far as I know, but there is a deposit roughly 3-7 km away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A bulky Kethane conversion module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An escape module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A rover or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A rover hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS PROJECT IS OPEN TO \u003Cstrong\u003EYOU!\u003C/strong\u003E Your ideas matter, and I am always willing to take them and maybe I\u0027ll add them.

First off, landing (which I will do once I fly all the components there) is quite hard (and fun) in the munhole, as the slightest horizontal translation could be the end of you. Also, the main reason I wanted to go there originally is because I have a sort of challenge for myself to put a bridge across the thing. That would be awesome. I just think it\u0027s sort of a fun place to try things at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SDIR","CreatedById":59117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T14:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting.

Sorry to all who thought that! Um, the reason I said it is because first of all, it is impossible to spot from more than roughly 15 km away, as the game often does not render fine terrain details like that from afar. Second of all, it is not a very well known feature! Googling \u0022munhole\u0022 gives little to no results.

Not many people know about the Munhole, so I included that in the hook of my post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YourEverydayWaffle","CreatedById":83957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T17:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMONOLITH SEEKERS:\u003C/strong\u003E I have found that there is a monolith UNDER the Munhole!
