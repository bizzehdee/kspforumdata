Sure, I tend to release something every Monday, but that was a decision I made for myself, as a creator. My old way was to release the same day I finished something. This led to not having anything that was ready but unreleased, and that meant I could never take a day off. I changed to releasing once per week and suddenly I was getting a backup of episodes that allowed me to take a three week vacation and still have stuff to release. Sadly that changed. I fell behind as things got harder to make. Odyssey is getting unstable again. Alexandria ships are harder to make now. Odyssey interludes take 90 minutes to make per 1 minute of video and new ships still require new parts added. Every ship in Alexandria is a custom build with home made CFG files. All of this I do because I enjoy it. My YouTube channel does not run ads like other channels (not counting some early mistakes I made of using copyrighted songs so now those videos have ads, beyond my control). Since I don\u0027t get paid for my work, that makes it a hobby, with no defined release schedule, and therefore stuff is done when it\u0027s done, and releases when I can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I love the passion you\u0027re showing for wanting to see more.

This may never get fixed. Not just RVE, but ALL visual packs are in big trouble because of Rbrays absence. Which by now I\u0027m convinced is permanent.
