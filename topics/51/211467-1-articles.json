Luckily, as previously mentioned, I already had quite a bit of infrastructure built up on the Mun in this save, which included flags located at a monolith, the Neil Armstrong memorial, and two of the Mun Arches. all left by the crew of my Elcano circumnavigation from almost a year ago. Searching the Armstrong memorial and the first Mun Arch (Beaski\u0027s Arch) yielded nothing, but what I saw next was truly something to behold...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KEdcI5b.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KEdcI5b.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.. The second Mun arch I had visited, which I called the Highland Arch, had become an alien arch/stargate of some sort, which had been hiding within the rock arch this whole time, perhaps connected in some way to KSP 2 or the original storyline for KSP1 that was never implemented (the precursor civilization). Immediately after seeing this new arch in all its glory, I knew I had to land there with Kerbals, and subsequently did so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven during the approach, from several kilometers away, the Highland Arch\u0027s strange lights were easily visible against the darkness of the Munar twilight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y052rWI.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Y052rWI.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon landing about 500m away, I then deployed the rover, as well as the two brave Kerbonauts, Germund Kerman, a veteran kerbonaut, and Shepvey Kerman, a new recruit, to approach the wondrous arch. This arch was especially meaningful to Germund Kerman, as he had stood on top of it with his own feet during my aforementioned Mun Elcano, which had taken place just a few\u00A0 in-game years prior.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022S7V4VMk.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/S7V4VMk.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YKO97KB.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YKO97KB.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the duo drew ever-closer to the structure, Germund could hardly believe his eyes. He was a veteran kerbonaut in the most literal sense of the word, having served on\u00A0 a plethora of missions; an asteroid capture, two circumnavigations, one of Tylo and one of the Mun, during both of which he\u0027d covered thousands of kilometers and encountered several anomalies, standard landing missions, he\u0027d seen it all, and yet, he\u0027d seen nothing like this. He knew that he bad been year just years ago, and yet the arch made it feel as though he had never been at all. It almost brought him into a trance, calling him to get closer, and, well before he should have, use his jetpack to ascend to the top of the arch. Shepvey and Mission Control shouted to him to stop, but their words went in one ear and out the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k0jh0xl.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k0jh0xl.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt filled him with wonder and confusion to know that all of this had been just inches beneath his feet, so close to being discovered, and yet so far away at the same time. Instead, it had taken what was presumably a meteorite impact to shatter the rocks that had concealed the true nature of this arch for so long. For a moment, Germund hardly even considered the actual implications of discovering an artificial structure on another world- instead, he was overtaken by the wonder of it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aHaaRa2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aHaaRa2.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGermund Kerman\u00A0standing on the Highland Arch, as it had been named by his crew, during the Mun Elcano mission, oblivious to what lay just beneath his feet (1.12.2, January 21, 2022)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some time had passed, and it had become apparent that ascending the arch was safe, rookie kerbonaut Shepvey Kerman jetpacked up to the top of the arch to join Germund in his wonder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bg9fMjS.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bg9fMjS.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter spending several minutes in a purely mesmerized state, Germund finally came back to his senses and began to investigate the rest of the arch, which included the bright, multicolored lights that had been revealed on it.
