Everything was going to plan, until I saw it.. A strange.. what only can be described as an anomaly in the usual rock. It twinkled and beckoned, with its all grasping curiosity. I had to investigate. Little did we know how long it would take to get there... how far away it was... It took us hours. (7 IRL hours) of driving a small Mun Rover at the averaged speed of 8 m/s. In total, we drove 86 km, and once we got there, we werent prepared for what we saw... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft by our ancient ancestors we wondered? We had no idea... A sign from some other race perhaps? We have no idea, but we know one thing for sure. After traveling so far, we are lost. Completely and utterly lost. We were entangled by its beckoning like a moth to flame, and now.. we were paying for our curiosity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/33eohnb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233eohnb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/t65o1s.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t65o1s.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/dxbayt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dxbayt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright! All dramatized situations aside, Ive got no idea what this was. As the above story says, I saw a weird twinkle and went investigated it, and it actually did take 7 IRL hours to get there. Good thing its the weekend. Anyway, since I dont look anything up about KSP, I like to experience it myself after all, I dont have a clue what this is. I can only explain it as a Rock Anomaly or Arch or something, can any of you explain this thing?

Keep applying thrust until your orbit is vertical around the planet and circularize or deorbit to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately you can point your ship to 225\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 just like above and that will cause your ship\u0027s orbit to shift towards the southern hemisphere eventually reaching the South pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a screen shot of my ships in orbit over Duna. I have one MapSat in a polar orbit while the rest are all equatorial. At Duna\u0027s North Pole you can see a probe lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QNUMHpih.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QNUMHpih.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh I get it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odo","CreatedById":69000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T01:17:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went to the coordinates ofApollo 11s landing on the mun and theres nothing there:(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T01:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Odo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Odo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI went to the coordinates ofApollo 11s landing on the mun and theres nothing there:(\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we see a pic of your location?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I remember the spot of that anomaly, it should be roughly at the equator, in a very large crater.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T01:33:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sapphire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
