Although the landings weren\u0027t always without problems, no deaths were reported and some important information about the red planet was obtained, like the planetary landscape and atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/300a53n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022300a53n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays - in the year 0.21 - the KSC has decided to send 4 Kerbals on a one-way mission to Duna. Goal of this mission is to begin the colonization of the planet and to spread the Kerbal race throughout the Kerbol system. Two ships are launched towards Duna; the Grotesque I and Grotesque II. The Grotesque I is shown below and contains stuff like a Copula Module, Hitchhiker Container and some science instruments. At the time of launch the Grotesque I was unmanned; in case of failure no lives would be lost ... !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/2db4hv8.png\u0022 alt=\u00222db4hv8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Grotesque II is launched next and carries two rovers; the top rover has two seats and is supposed to be delivered near the landing site of the Grotesque I, to increase the possibilities for the Kerbals to explore the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/315j0nl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022315j0nl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, three Kerbals are launched in an old rocket that has proven itself as reliable \u0027taxi\u0027 in especially LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/15md5yd.png\u0022 alt=\u002215md5yd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last Kerbal got transferred from a space station (for some reason I don\u0027t have pics of that transfer).

Number I takes 61 days to complete the transfer, number II 69 days. After some aerobraking and correctional burns number I achieves a stable orbit (64-67 km) around Duna. The crewmen are surprised when they see the landscape beneath them; it looks somewhat intimidating with souring mountains and deep valleys, and doesn\u0027t match the description the pioneers made back in the year 0.20 ... !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/24698hd.png\u0022 alt=\u002224698hd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship manages to descent into a valley but runs out of fuel too early.

The top rover (important for the landed Kerbals as it provides somewhat fast transportation) lands at the other side of the planet and now has two broken wheels. So much for pinpoint-landing ... The other rover lands around 70 km away from the Kerbals and is currently the only properly functioning rover on Duna. Looks like more material and men are required to patch up this somewhat rocky mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/e06af4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e06af4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T11:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems your landings are as predictable as mine.

Nothing compared to the creations of the space-planes experts on these forums, but the chances are it might actually work. Gotta say it was a pain to get it into orbit, took almost 15 minutes. The initial mass of the plane is almost 15 tonnes and has one jet-engine and two LV-909\u0027s. Despite having 5 air intakes the jet-engine couldn\u0027t provide useful thrust anymore at 32 km altitude and going roughly 1.400 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the plane is certainly capable of traveling to Duna on its own power, but a \u0027network\u0027 of orbital and ground-based fuel-stations is required.
