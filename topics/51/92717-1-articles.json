My question to investigate was as follows;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhy need several launches for a space station?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started the SpaceLab programm. Its quite easy to understand; why not a rocket and space station in one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started out with SpaceLab One. SL1 however was a catastrophic failure, sending the crew into the depths of space due to a calculation error and missing the orbit window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the failure of SpaceLab One, construction of Space Lab Mk2 was commencing. Space Lab two however had a small flaw; no return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefor SpaceLab Two was forced to crashland, in hope to spare the onboard crew. The landing failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the two failures, C7 Aerospace Division saw no longer a future in the programm, untill a scientist came with the idea; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhy not add an escape module if things go wrong?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Lab Three construction commenced. The launch was succesfull, and only using ONE missle.
