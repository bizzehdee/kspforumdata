After unsuccessfully making it to the Mun by filling a garbage can with fireworks, Gene and Jebediah realized they would need funds, science, and an abundant supply of snacks to realize their goal. Calling on their old college buddies, they founded DoBaS with a government grant of 25,000 funds, and by taking up residence at a derelict snack factory. After accepting a few contracts from Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society, DoBaS embarked on the first of their historic missions.\n\nLooking over Gene and Jebediah\u0027s first attempts, Wernher Von Kerman identified a few areas for possible improvements. By increasing the number of fireworks, welding the lid on, and punching a small hole in the bottom, Wernher created the RT-5 Solid Rocket Booster. Jebediah eagerly climbed on top and prepared to make history.\n\n* * *\n\nThis will be my mission journal for my new stock career\\*. I\u0027ve been playing for a little while now, goofing off in career and sandbox modes, trying new mods, but it\u0027s time to get serious. \n\n\\*As of episode 18, I\u0027ve added KER, KAC, and Window Transfer Planner to make the interplanetary era more manageable and enjoyable.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

He had carefully calcluated that \u0027around half-a-dozen\u0027 fuel tanks should have been enough. Frustrated in his attempts to improve his rocket equation, he turned to the Kerbalnet looking for answers. He soon discovered something called the boom-velocity equation (called the rocket equation by believers in tall grey men), which was developed by Konstantin Kerman in a fit of snack-induced inspiration. \n\nUsing this equation, Werhner designed a rocket with \u0022probably somerwhere around 3700-ish units of that triangle vee stuff\u0022. Unfortunately, Jeb failed to achieve orbit, and had to be recovered from nearly halfway around the globe. Gene was furious, as the failure couldn\u0027t have cost more. \u0022We\u0027re rationing snacks until you guys figure out what\u0027s wrong and achieve an orbit!\u0022\n\nBob decided to help out by performing some science of his own. Specifically, he wanted to see if science performed the same at different locations. He asked Bill to create a moblie science lab, kicked Jeb out of the cockpit once it was finished, and set out to perform tests all around the DoBaS Space Center. Later at the Astronaut Complex, Bob burst in and shouted \u0022It\u0027s all the same! Science is the same **all over the Space Center**!\u0022. Seeing that the disturbance had nothing to do with a new flight, Jeb turned back to his snacks, while Bill tried to come up with something nice to say about all this.\n\n* * *\n\nSo I\u0027m calculating my \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and TWR by hand for the first time, and checking my numbers in a spreadsheet I threw together. I came up with a two stage rocket, first stage was 1663m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and a TWR of 1.17. Second stage was 2078m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and a TWR of 3.29. I thought that would get me into orbit, but ended up short. I\u0027ve checked my numbers with KER and I had them right, I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s just because the first stage didn\u0027t get me far enough, so I wasn\u0027t getting enough performance in vacuum with the higher Isp. I was going off of the numbers from [this map](http://i.imgur.com/Sp8xpng.png), and although I haven\u0027t verified it I have made it to orbit with 3800m/s, IIRC. Going to unlock some better parts and try again with similar total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\n\nIn the end I just tooled around the DSC for a bit so I could unlock Advanced Rocketry.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But more importantly, we get our snacks back!\u0022* - Jeb\n\n[At the Agency Picnic]\n\nJeb: Remember that one mission where I flew a rocket, right after the other time I flew a similar rocket?\n\nBob: Refresh my memory.\n\nJeb: Don\u0027t you remember? We used a bunch of rocket parts to make a rocket, and then I flew it. I even sent you a report.\n\nBob: Uh... sure.\n\nJeb: Yeah! It was awesome!\n\nGene: Enough! We\u0027re going to start naming our missions. No more of this \u0027that one time\u0027 nonsense!\n\nBob: That will definitely improve my science catalog system.\n\n* * *\n\nBuilt the Kerbiter 2(the last one has been posthumously named the Kerbiter 1) with similar \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv at both stages using the new parts, and I ended up with similar results. Thinking that it\u0027s because of the low amount of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv in the first stage, I swapped some of the fuel tanks around to have 2348m/s in the first stage and 1433m/s in the second. Still around 3700, but this one made it to orbit and came back.\n\nUsing lean kerbalfacturing techniques, I also designed a 4-in-1 suborbital test rocket. The places where it doesn\u0027t look like the rocket is connected are just optical illusions.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I had 500m/s of extra delta-v for the trip, and managed to waste all of that buffer, probably mostly in the landing. As you can see, my return trip didn\u0027t quite go off as well as I had hoped.\n\nI also utilized the sub-assemblies for the first time, I think this will be a pretty good lifter for the near future.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Dismissed.\n\n* * *\n\nI sent Catchelle to the Mun to complete temperature and crew report missions. Did a few inclination changes to speed up the process, but it still took quite a while to gather all 20-ish reports. That\u0027s ok, because it would be a while before the probe and lander got to their destination. Made some nice change and upgraded a lot of the DSC.\n\nTried my hand at asparagus staging for the Minmus Lander. I wanted it to have as much delta-v as possible so I could jump to as many biomes as possible, but an oversight by engineering meant I cut the mission short after the third landing(pity, I had so much fuel left). Good thing I had Jeb piloting that one.\n\nThe probe literally had nothing else planned other than escaping the Kerbin SoI, and seeing if it could get anywhere else after that. I haven\u0027t done any interplanetary transfers before, and I didn\u0027t bother checking any transfer windows. This just seemed like a more Kerbal-esque idea.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Eventually.\n\n* * *\n\nI landed a permanent(was supposed to be at least) base on the Mun, with a pilot and two scientists from the newbies I\u0027ve rescued. Things were going well, until I realized that they might be able to get the last EVA report for a contract I picked up back when I sent the first mission to Munar polar orbit. I really thought I had enough delta-v, turns out I needed about 70m/s more to be able to land. So instead of crashing at the north pole, I just pushed the outpost into a low orbit and started planning a rescue mission.\n\nMeanwhile, I built two new probes to explore the Kerbol system, with far more delta-v than my first attempt. 5 FL-T800 fuel tanks staged asparagus style to a single LV-N, and a lifter stage that could get them out of the Kerbin SoI. I\u0027ve set up maneuver nodes to intercept Eve and Duna, really hoping these two missions succeed.\n\nAlso built 3 satellites and sent them to polar orbits of Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. Surveyed each body.\n\nI\u0027m a little flustered, since just about every lander I\u0027ve sent to the moons has had one problem or another. I really just want to get two permanent bases up and let the mobile science labs grind it out.

I found that I could have all the RCS thrusters on, and the station could rotate very quickly with no deflection to speak of at the joints, and I could also enable 1 or 2 of the reaction wheels in the core.

Delivered that to Kerbin orbit for \u003E500,000 funds for a contract, but I thought that was a bit silly so I took it all the way to KSS.\n\nMainly just a proof of concept, I\u0027m going to set up new space stations with fuel depots around Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus, then set up another mining facility on the Mun.\n\nI feel like I\u0027m going to have all the tech tree unlocked before my probe gets to Duna, due to the research labs... they seem kinda OP. With some mods adding more tech, and especially life support, I think it would be much more reasonable.\n\nLastly, I\u0027ve got two asteroids (Class C and Class E) coming into the system soon... I have contracts to put them in Minmus orbit, so that will be fun. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I was planning to intercept the Class E that was coming in soon, but I didn\u0027t notice until *after* I had launched that it wasn\u0027t just encountering Kerbin, it was going to hit it.\n\nWhile I was tempted to just watch the show, I figured this could be a lot of fun. Hoping I had enough delta-v, I set up an intercept outside of Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Everything went smoothly, until the first time I tried to grab onto it. I just flew straight through it. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) F9\u0027d, and this time managed to latch on. I wasn\u0027t quite lined up with the CoM, so my first burn started things rotating. Maneuvered my pivot to kill the rotation, released my clamp, and lined up again. This time, I was in line with the maneuver node, and CoM. Took a long burn with my LV-N, but I got it to a 35k periapsis. The airbraking slowed it down enough to get an elliptical orbit, and one last burn at the apoapsis to get the periapsis above 70k.\n\nI can see a problem with trying to push these huge things around, you really have to line up perfectly so you don\u0027t induce too much rotation. I should try designing something that will pull instead, I\u0027m guessing that would be more stable.\n\nDidn\u0027t have enough mono-propellant to keep maneuvering the asteroid, so I\u0027m going to have to launch another vehicle to get it to orbit around Minmus.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

There is no cheaper way to bring things up from Kerbin. Think about a crew transporter and a fuel transporter. But sure it costs a lot of time to fly these things up and down again (especially if you screw up the re-entry curve and then get out of fuel on your final approach...). OTOH, flying a plane in between makes for a nice change once in a while.

Plus, same thing applies for the center of lift; you just have to make sure that the center of lift is always a bit behind center of mass, also when flying empty. Too much lift tends to have the same result, even when center of lift is behind center of mass. While piloting, make sure you never shift heading more than 20 degrees at once at any time (the more lift rating you have the less shift is possible without flipping). For steering, make sure you do not have too many elevons because this will screw up SAS.\n\nCan\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t wait to get to Duna myself! Everything is ready but the launch window...

We should all spend a little more time double-checking our jobs, and maybe a little less time running around the grounds pretending to be rockets and airplanes.\n\nJeb: You\u0027re a cruel man Gene...\n\n* * *\n\nSo, yeah. I\u0027ve been having problems with these asteroid redirect missions. My first attempt at this class-c, which was on quite the inclination, ended up being extremely inefficient, and I didn\u0027t have enough juice to even get an encounter. \n\nFor the next attempts, I designed a lighter payload, went back to a single LV-N, and abandoned the idea of trying to pull the asteroid rather than push it.\n\nUnfortunately, the staging for my sepratrons went all wonky between builds, so the second attempt met catastrophic failure during the first separation.\n\nThe third attempt would have been fine, but I decided to switch out the RCS thrusters for Vernor engines, and forgot to swap out the mono-propellant for oxidizer. I got to within 200m of the stinkin\u0027 thing before I realized I had no control. I had looked a couple guides for meeting up with asteroids more efficiently, and I made it all the way to it without even emptying my orange tanks.\n\nThe third attempt worked out better. Again I made the intercept with fuel to spare in my orange tanks, grabbed the stupid thing on-center, and redirected it to aerobrake at 30km at Kerbin. It didn\u0027t quite work out as well for a heat shield as the class-e did, so I lost a few parts to the heat.\n\nSo now I\u0027ve got two asteroids in eccentric orbits of Kerbin, I guess I\u0027ll just mine them till they\u0027re empty and then maneuver them to Minmus.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
