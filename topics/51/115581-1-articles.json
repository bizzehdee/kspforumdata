I\u0027m lilhines and I got KSP around .24, or something like that. I didn\u0027t play again for a very long time... until now. The game has added a lot of parts and now there\u0027s aerodynamics. In Beta, I have landed a Kerbal on the Mun, and sent a probe onto Duna before I was able to dock. I\u0027m basically relearning everything now with all the new additions. \n\nWhat\u0027s better than humiliating myself in front of all the forums? So, noobness and all, I will be sharing several campaigns. I will start with Age of Rocketry and move up the latter from there. So far, I have found it quite hilarious how terrible I am right now. \n\nGround rules: \n\n1. No reverting flights - This will significantly increase the amount of mistakes that ruin entire missions.\n\n2. No mods - I dislike chocolate, so I only eat vanilla ice cream. Same goes for computer games. \n\n3. Dead Kerbals stay dead - How long will the orange suits last? \n\nFrom now on I while be In-Character, unless I say things like \u0022OOC: words that are out of character\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"lilhines","CreatedById":88583,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T21:04:59Z","Content":"**Introduction**\n\nFor centuries, Kerbals peaceful inhabited their planet, frolicking about and holding international staring contests. Eventually, they grew interested in the stars and heavens above. No one knows why this change came to pass so suddenly. Perhaps they grew tired of cultivating their tiny green plants, or maybe because they had a surplus of rocket engines from the famous underground drag-races. Whatever the reason, Kerbals took to their new found passion with all their industrial might. The first buildings above ground were created under the supervision of Gene Kerman. Now the Kerbals could travel to anywhere in the Kerbol System. They just needed ingenuity, creativity, problem-solving, and communications to achieve anything. Unfortunately, they had none of that, so the stuck with the usual endless supply of kerbonaughts method.\n\n**Hammerhead I**\n\nTo quick start the entire program, Gene Kerman called for a mission so stupid easy that it would be impossible to fail. Leading rocket scientist Karl von Kerman, came up with the brilliant idea of launching a solid booster straight up. Using the cheapest parts and not a single calculation, the rocket was quickly ready. The rocket was creatively named the Hammerhead because the solid booster was nicknamed the Hammer. Droves of Kerbals gathered at the launch site to watch their pinnacle of Kerbal civilization go to space. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Luis de Kerman was the new lead rocket scientist and discovered that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere produce drag. The drag caused friction which created heat. Everyone agreed Luis was and called the atmospheric phenomena \u0022de Kerman effect.\u0022 Luis encouraged the use of equations to make sure the rocket would work BEFORE it was launched. This was a novelty idea that was far ahead of its time. Luis explained the concept of the Thrust to Weight Ratio that was discovered by Karl von Kerman years ago, but nobody gave it any attention. Luis calculated that the TWR was around 5.04, which was far to much acceleration in Kerbind\u0027s thick atmosphere. Using simple algebra, he came up with the ideal 2.00 TWR by setting the \u0022Hammer\u0022 booster to 40% power. At launch time, which was not lunch time like some other engineers thought, Luis von Kerman nervously waited to see if his calculations were correct. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Science was no longer considered witchcraft after everyone observed the wonders it could do. The Kerbals were proud, they had sent a rocket into space. For their next mission, the space program would build a two stage rocket. The 1st stage was the same as the 2nd stage, except that it didn\u0027t have a probe core. In the rush of preparation, everyone forgot to put batteries onto the craft. Just before launch, a parachute was strapped onto the front so the rocket could be salvaged for later us.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The destruction of Hammerhead III was only an afterthought. However, the mission goals were not satisfied. All the top scientists gathered together to fix the overheating problem. Someone shouted \u0022Moar Chutes!\u0022 and it was settled. In addition to the large main parachute, three more were added on the sides. Also, extra batteries were placed on so the parachutes could be deployed at the correct time. Nobody really knew when the correct time was exactly, but they all nodded in agreement.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
