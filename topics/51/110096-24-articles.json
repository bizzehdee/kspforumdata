Can you give a full lust of the rank titles?\n\nThank you! The titles mirror USN/USAF ranks as follows, parallel ranks being equivalent:\n\n[TABLE=width: 200]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]SpaceService[/TD]\n\n[TD]Air Service[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Enzin[/TD]\n\n[TD]2nd Looty[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Junior Looty[/TD]\n\n[TD]1st Looty[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Looty[/TD]\n\n[TD]Kaptin[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Looty Comder[/TD]\n\n[TD]Majer[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Comder[/TD]\n\n[TD]Looty Kernel[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Kaptin[/TD]\n\n[TD]Kernel[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nRank insignia for Space service is pretty intuitive, pattern is the same as USN and of course the color of the stripes are per the officer\u0027s specialty. Only Command Pilots can hold the rank of Kaptin in the Space Service. Air Service ranks would look like USAF insignia, but I\u0027ve only drawn the Looty Kernel insignia so far. Color that goldish and you\u0027ve got Majer, simple silver/gold bars will do for the lower ranks. If I ever have to show insignia for a full Kernel it will look vaguely eagle shaped but will not in fact be an eagle ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBy the way it\u0027s also rumored that there exists a Kerfleet Surface Mobility Corps (KSMC), who are a branch of the Space Service but use ranks similar to Air. KSMC personnel specialize in driving rovers and have a reputation for being somewhat hardcore... \u0022From the rolling hills of Duuu-u-na/to the shores of Laythe\u0027s seas...\u0022 You get the idea ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-09T14:13:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2015 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T05:31:15Z","Content":"Ooo oo!
