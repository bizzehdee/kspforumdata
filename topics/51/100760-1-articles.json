If so I\u0027ll add whatever you decide to a registry in the same op too as a thank you for flying a successful mission!

This one was supposed to be the Challenger.\n\nNext one will be Columbia. I will use names that were not part of NASA\u0027s shuttle program but I felt I should pay respects to those two.\n\nThe Challenger was lost just a few weeks after my 1st birthday and Columbia about a month after my 18th.\n\nEDIT: Wow, I just dated myself.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T06:06:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExplorerKlatt**"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T05:00:58Z","Content":"Second launch is now up. \n\nThe Shuttle Columbia lifted off on Y1, Day 57. It is delivering two 4-way docking hubs in preparation for the fuel storage cells. It is also carrying a robotic station tug. After waiting for a proper rendezvous window, it closed to within 90m of Copernicus Station. Once the cargo was delivered, Columbia deorbited to return to KSC. An uneventful flight and landing saw the crew home safe and sound. The ground crew is now prepping the *Nautilus* for liftoff to deliver the docking arms to the station.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9UoYa60uY8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I found the SSI Catalog a while back. Downloaded the whole thing before it moved onto your DMP server. The station that I\u0027m building is based off of the SSI HQ Spacedock\n\nAwesome!\n\nI still have them too. I have a Proton IV (1 seat) and a Neutron III (2 seats) built for .25. I also developed a Proton T2 (3 seats) which flies fine but needs some offset love to hide a few edges. The all new Proton H (1 seat) is practically ready for flight trials from Kerbin to Duna. It make it to Duna in .22. The Proton U was um... ok. But the Proton series is just too small for utility dropship work. I guess I will have to cede that niche to Cupcake. Besides my dream of inspiring engineers to develop subassemblies has sort of moved into the STS, which is actually which I prefer now for most of my medium to heavey tonnage LKO utility and space program needs.\n\nHowever before I work on the tedium that is laid out above to make them all .90 aesthetically ready, I have an itch to build my first STS Fuel Pod capable SSTO spaceplane... inigma style... to my exacting design requirements. Rune has a huge lead in this area, as do a few other engineers. But that was true of the state of space shuttles before I went shopping for one and couldn\u0027t find one that satisfied all my needs... heh. Necessity is the mother of invention, eh?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T05:55:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 05:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T06:28:18Z","Content":"Actually, now that I think about it, I wonder if I could modify the Proton U to be a KAS and Karbonite modcraft for use with your station challenge.
