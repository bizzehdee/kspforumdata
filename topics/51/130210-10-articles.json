CAMWISE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt\u0027s been two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTwo endless years, full of doubts and uncertainties. Of pain and regret. Of memories of our lost crew-member, and unanswered questions as to why she tried to take our ship down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd all of this, we had to endure alone. Without a single word of guidance or council from Mission Control, or anyone on our home planet. \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E was an unreachable desert island with a population of three in the immense void of deep space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBefore her attempt on our lives, Margaret had destroyed our ship\u0027s ability to communicate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat equipment she couldn\u0027t smash to pieces, she had simply dragged to the airlock and dumped into space. Everything, including spare parts, had been either wrecked beyond any hope of repair or ejected from the ship. This must have happened some time before we returned from the surface of Phobos, and the transmitters and amplifiers may still be out there somewhere, orbiting the tiny moon of Mars. But even if any of it is still functional, it will be impossible to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBesides, we left Phobos behind just hours after the Incident. In my desperate attempt to avoid us impacting the surface, \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E had actually reached escape velocity, something easily achieved around such a small body. I must admit that our actions lacked discipline or rigour in the aftermath of the near-disaster, and when we finally realised that we were already heading out to orbit high above Mars, no-one suggested turning back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gnMDO39.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gnMDO39.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nApart from our useless communications suite, \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E miraculously turned out to be almost unscathed. There was a a small hole in the laboratory module, where the harpoon of our lander \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E had been ripped out of the hull during the final last-minute burn; the one that had saved Jonnie, Angun and myself, but had taken Margaret. It was easily patched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe main fuel tank was dented and battered in places where \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E had bounced and scraped against it, but it was still sound, and during a short EVA, I determined that there had been no spillage of fuel. We\u0027d leaked a bit of air, but the emergency containment system had worked correctly, and the loss of oxygen was acceptable. Besides, we could now afford to waste some of our consumables: only the three of us would be going home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe disposal of Margaret\u0027s body was a mercifully short affair. We dressed her in my suit, with its damaged helmet, and Jonnie guided her out through the airlock and away from the ship. I\u0027d offered to do it myself, since I felt in some way responsible for her death, but Jonnie had simply pushed past me towards the airlock without a word and donned his helmet before I could protest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI remember observing the scene from the bridge in silence, watching Jonnie maneuver Margaret\u0027s lifeless form past the endlessly rotating centrifuge before giving her a final push with his KMU to send her off into infinity. Her body began to tumble slowly and as she drifted off into the distance, the light of the distant sun glinted off her shattered visor, winking at us mockingly. Finally, the twinkling celestial body that had once been Planetary Investigator Margaret faded into oblivion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOut there she will, in a sense, outlast us all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun and I had been waiting for Jonnie in the forward crew module as he cycled back through the airlock. When he removed his helmet, I immediately saw the change. His face was a cold mask of fury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFor a terrible moment, I feared that his anger was directed at me, since he had been the first to enter the crew module just a few hours previously and had discovered Margaret\u0027s body, myself, and a dented fire extinguisher floating close by. It was obvious that there had been a struggle, but no-one had seen exactly what had happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie lunged forward...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI didn\u0027t...\u201D I began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...but he pushed past me once more, and grabbed Angun. Jonnie was no slouch in zero-gee, in fact he was by far the physically strongest Kerbal on board, and by pushing off the far wall of the module he managed to send our surprised Principal Investigator sailing into the airlock. Jonnie slammed the hatch and spun the wheel to seal it. Angun was trapped inside without his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie grabbed the lever that would vent the air and leave Angun breathing vacuum within minutes if he pulled it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CJonnie...no!\u201D I started towards him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHis hand still on the lever, he turned towards me, his smoldering gaze froze me in my tracks. \u201CNo more secrets,\u201D he said flatly. \u201CAngun. You have ten seconds to start explaining what just happened back there. Or maybe you\u0027d care to join her?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe was transformed: no \u003Cem\u003Ebuddies\u003C/em\u003E, no cheerful drawl. Our Test Pilot had momentarily become someone else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CJonnie...\u201D Angun began, his thin, metallic voice reaching us through a small speaker next to the airlock hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMake that five seconds PI,\u201D said Jonnie, not moving an inch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI do not know why Margaret tried to kill us, or herself, Jonnie. You won\u0027t get anywhere by doing this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNo way near good enough. Take a deep breath.\u201D His grip tightened on the cycling lever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CGo on then, CTP,\u201D rasped Angun, his old stubbornness returning. \u201CDo what you must.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nUnable to stop myself, I blurted out \u201CJonnie, don\u0027t do it. Angun: show us the pictures you\u0027ve been receiving from the Pacific. Show us \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of the pictures.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie faced me once more, and for a moment a look of stunned disbelief passed across his face. But he recovered quickly, and almost spat out the words, \u201CYou too, Camwise? You\u0027re part of this mess too...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd that is how the little trust remaining within our diminished crew was finally shattered. It had taken me just a moment to destroy any confidence that remained between any of us. Jonnie now knew that I was also part of the problem, although he couldn\u0027t guess to what extent. And he also knew that he was outnumbered and alone. There was little chance of him succeeding in pushing us both out of the airlock, should he choose to do so. And the prospect of nearly two more years in space with no communications and no-one to back him up just didn\u0027t bear thinking about. It was a broken crew, but it would have to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe let Angun out of the airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun lead the way aft to the laboratory where he logged onto the computer and brought up the images on a monitor, scrolling through them one by one whilst explaining to Jonnie how they had been obtained. I already knew the Martian Pyramid, and I recognised the pictures of the large ship orbiting Mars and Earth from Margaret\u0027s description.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThere are two more images,\u201D said Angun, \u201CBut before I show them to you, I must warn you against jumping to hasty conclusions. Fixation on a far-fetched idea without the scientific evidence to back it up is, I believe, the only possible explanation for Margaret\u0027s... decision. I knew her and worked with her for many years, and despite our differences in opinion on certain topics, I would never have believed that it could come to such an extreme. Here they are.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zdCRvPc.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zdCRvPc.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sdZI82h.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sdZI82h.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie and I drew in our breath simultaneously as we looked at the pictures and some of the possible interpretations hit us. My notions of biology were vague, to put things mildly, but I certainly recognised some sort of bacteria being assaulted by a host of smaller organisms. And the second image clearly intended to show that this had taken place both on Earth and on Mars. Didn\u0027t it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like...\u201D Jonnie began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C...some sort of contamination afflicting some sort of bacteria both on Earth and on Mars, yes I know,\u201D Angun cut in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhich suggests...\u201D I continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIt suggests nothing other than life,\u201D Angun said, as if addressing one hundred students in a lecture theatre. \u201CThings contaminating or assimilating other things. On the microbial scale, that\u0027s pretty much what life is all about. It\u0027s happening in your gut right now, Camwise. And in many other parts of your body that I don\u0027t really have to mention to make my point. On a massive scale.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CBut on Earth and Mars?\u201D I began to protest. \u201CThe point that last image seems to make is that exactly the same process occurred on both worlds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CExactly, and that\u0027s the interesting part...\u201D Incredibly, Angun was smiling. As if the fact that he had been shut in an airlock and almost spaced just a few minutes previously was just a slight misunderstanding, and that was all behind us now. \u201CDo you realise what this might mean? The discovery of similar, even identical biological processes taking place on multiple worlds within our solar system?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun\u0027s question was met with the most deafening of silences. He raised his eyes to what was, subjectively, the ceiling of his micro-gravity laboratory, as if imploring some distant, fickle deity of lore and knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CDo you pilots and engineers ever actually listen to some of the more astute minds in our entourage?\u201D he wondered aloud. \u201CAnd I\u0027m not talking about the field scientists who actually get things done like myself, or the all-bark-no-bite scientists such as blustery Bartdon. I\u0027m thinking of the real visionaries, the real geniuses.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSteledith...\u201D I breathed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes, Steledith,\u201D cried Angun triumphantly, as if one of his students had suddenly discovered that E=mc\u00B2. \u201CNext time you see her, I strongly recommend that you request to examine her collection of meteorites. I believe she has samples from most of the inner solar system bodies, as well as many of the major asteroids. The Moon, Mars, as well as one that is probably from Phobos, Ceres, Vesta... all of these collected from the Earth\u0027s surface, of course.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSo all this time...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMaterial has been exchanged between the planets, yes,\u201D said Angun, pursuing his habit of interrupting anyone who tried to complete a sentence. \u201CMaterial, and therefore, possibly life. Now, as I\u0027ve said before, I most certainly did not expect to find anything alive on the surface of Phobos. But since our observations seemed to suggest that Steledith\u0027s hypothesis of a moon formed at least partially from Martian impact ejecta is plausible, I did have a faint hope that we might find some fossilized traces of life in some of our surface samples. It was a long shot, I know, but since we can\u0027t yet go down to the surface of Mars itself...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CBut we lost the samples,\u201D I cut in. \u201CThey went down with \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003ENearly\u003C/em\u003E all the samples...\u201D Angun was almost whispering now, as if he was afraid that someone would overhear. He dug into one of the pockets of his suit, and produced a small rock in a transparent sampling bag. It was jet black on the outside, but where his hammer had shattered the sample from the native rock, it was a dull, rusty reddish colour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie floated upright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYou disgust me,\u201D he said simply. \u201CHow many seconds did it take you to recover that rock from \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E earlier today? Nearly one too many, I think. You talk a lot, Angun, but if you had talked sooner then Margaret might still be alive right now.\u201D Jonnie continued to glare at Angun, but it was like trying to stare down a cat. \u201CI need you both to get this ship back to Earth. But the moment I set foot on our home planet, if we make it back, I hope for your sake that we never meet again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun looked back at our Chief Test Pilot disdainfully. \u201CWe won\u0027t,\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie stormed out of the lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun turned to me and continued talking as if nothing had happened. \u201CThis also means that the risk of backwards contamination is irrelevant. It may have been happening for billions of years via natural processes. But that doesn\u0027t mean we will find a sample on Earth that confirms this hypothesis. None of Steledith\u0027s rocks showed anything conclusive. We must get down to the surface of Mars and make a full analysis of the sedimentary rocks there. Our next mission...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI turned to leave myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun stopped in mid-sentence and asked \u201CDo I disgust you too, Camwise?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLooking back over my shoulder I said, \u201CNo, Angun, no-one disgusts me. You\u0027re a very interesting Kerbal. I also think that you\u0027re insane, and that you certainly shouldn\u0027t be entrusted with the leadership of a space programme. And I don\u0027t believe that Margaret was insane as you are. You\u0027re also forgetting that... thing we saw orbiting Phobos. And the ship on the Moon. This is not just about the possibility of bacteria clinging to rocks in space. I think Margaret knew something that we don\u0027t, and I intend to find out what that is, if I can.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWith that, I left him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThus began the long wait for the transfer window back to Earth. With no functional communications, we could not contact Mission Control, or send commands to any of the rovers we had deployed on the Martian surface. We briefly discussed the possibility of returning to low Martian orbit in an attempt to link up with one of the rovers or one of the science probes in polar orbit via a short-range omni that I managed to improvise from parts salvaged from the lab, but this idea was quickly discarded due to our low delta-vee budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMargaret\u0027s maneuver and my own subsequent burn had wasted nearly five hundred metres per second. Any additional expenditure would mean that we might make it back to Earth, but we would not have enough fuel to capture once we got there. And with no reliable means of communication, we would slip back out into interplanetary space as if we\u0027d never existed. Even nailing our transfer burn back would be hard, as we usually relied on additional guidance from Earth\u0027s deep space network of radio-telescopes. We would have to make to with \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s less precise auto-navigational systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo we waited in high Martian orbit for nearly another year, the mistrust amongst Jonnie, Angun and myself festering, living with the constant doubt of ever making it back and with no clear mission to focus on other than keeping our ship and ourselves alive.

And this, despite the fact that it would have been something, anything, to keep my waking thoughts straying back to the vision of Margaret\u0027s empty, accusing stare, or the loathsome alien creature drifting in space, both of which haunted my dreams. I could not bring myself to put pen to paper for fear of making these memories more vivid, more persistent. Better to deal with the long, cold emptiness of denial as we winged our way back across the void; a tiny spark of fragile hope and sanity in a gulf of darkness that threatened to snuff it out at any moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut now, as we approach the end of our mission and salvation that seemed beyond hope just a few hours ago, I must think ahead to the fearsome scrutiny we will all be subjected to once we return to Omelek.

The main engine, taking the brunt of the assault, was rapidly overheating. It would reach a critical temperature in seconds, and then risk shedding a cloud of debris, showering the rest of our ship and exposing the vulnerable fuel tank to instant destruction. We were moments from disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAt my cry of \u201CFire the engine!\u201D Jonnie gave it almost everything we had left, pushing the last few hundred metres per second from the tanks to bring our speed just below escape velocity.

We couldn\u0027t see it from where we were sitting, of course, but a subsequent EVA showed that the engine bells had heated almost to melting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iJVhVwv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iJVhVwv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAlmost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe were left in a highly elliptical orbit that we had somehow managed to bring within cislunar space. Even the dull, harsh surface of the Moon was a welcome sight after months of drifting out in deep space. Our periapsis was still somewhere in the upper atmosphere, and each of our subsequent passes would scrub of a very little of our speed. But it would take weeks, or even months for us to circularize our trajectory, unless we subjected our battered, space-weary ship to further, riskier aerobraking maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pUZXSm8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pUZXSm8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qZk3xoI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qZk3xoI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThat\u0027s when we finally managed to raise Omelek, using the short-range omni I had managed to salvage.

They know the mission was lead by a crazy scientist called Hangun (or was it Engoon; how do you even pronounce that anyway...?) and Commander Tirice might recognise him if she were to be shown a picture of our former Principal Investigator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nPilot Malcolm might even have heard of Jonnie, who is somewhat of an idol for any young and impressionable Kerbal who aspires to join the Air Service one day. But I\u0027m pretty sure that no-one I am likely to meet beyond 65\u00B0 South knows my name or would recognise Engineer Camwise, formerly Senior Engineer Camwise of the Omelek Space Centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFor this I am grateful, as it means that I can just get on with the job at hand and not have to answer any prying questions that would bring back painful memories. Like many of the tough, sometimes dour Kerbals who populate the research stations and get the supplies through, I am just an anonymous pair of skilled hands contributing to the survival of the group. As long as I keep the ice-crawler moving and don\u0027t melt down the reactor, they couldn\u0027t care less where I came from before I joined their crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNot that there haven\u0027t been a few near misses. Commander Tirice has, on several occasions, expressed her surprise at my familiarity with the Kastria MX-4 fission reactor. Her surprise is legitimate, as the polar ice-crawlers are the only terrestrial vehicles equipped with such a power-source, but she can\u0027t be expected to know that it is exactly the same hardware that drove our lunar mining rover \u003Cem\u003EPadirac\u003C/em\u003E across Drygalski crater, extracting the vital water ice that propelled me home from the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd as for Gemxy, well, by now she must have caught on to the fact that I am not just the average kerbal spanner wielder going through a mid-life crisis and seeking out a more adventurous existence in this hostile landscape. She\u0027s a lovely girl, that Gemxy, and responds to my valiant but futile attempts to pronounce her name correctly by poking fun at my subtle and untraceable accent. After an understandable period of mistrust towards her new crew-mate, she has proved to be most friendly to this mysterious engineer with no past. Friendly, and a little flirtatious even.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThey also say that what happens in Antarctica stays in Antarctica.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KC0uPAC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KC0uPAC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut I digress once more. As you\u0027ve probably gathered by now, the reception that awaited us \u2013 once our return capsule had screamed through the atmosphere to a relatively uneventful splash-down somewhere in the South Pacific \u2013 was rather less than warm.

Endless repetitions of everything that had happened to me since well before our departure for the Red Planet, each minute detail recounted three, four times or more... Nameless Investigators, none of whom I recognised, even asked me to tell them once again about what had happened to me on the Moon. All of this has faded into a kind of blur of confession.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI saw nothing of the outside world during this time, and my interrogators shared little news of how things had changed in our absence, but their very presence was a hint of some profound transformation of the way the Space Centre was being run. In time, I understood that the programme had nearly been canceled after communication with \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E was lost, and that operations were now merely ticking over on a very restricted budget.

You were one of the best engineers we had, it\u0027s such a damned waste, but I\u0027m afraid that you just don\u0027t realise just how much trouble you and Angun are in. The Resource Companies do not grant us millions of funds just to buy expensive toys for us to do what we like with. As it is, the Board is talking about a court case for misuse of company property.

His department had been dutifully listening in on the transmissions from Theophilus crater for the best part of the last two years, and during this time, the Monument\u0027s signals had not changed in the slightest. The constant warbling and chattering of the encrypted signal had pulsed ceaselessly out into the void as if it would never end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut that night, without warning or so much as a mere crackle of static, the signal had ceased abruptly and had been replaced by this simple greeting, which was repeated in a warm, friendly tone approximately every five seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter an initial moment of disbelieving panic, followed by a brief internal struggle, the technician decided that this was serious enough to brave the wrath of the communications officer on duty and called him, requesting that he listen in on the channel, and tell him that he wasn\u0027t going crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe officer in charge was understandably disgruntled at being woken up in the middle of the night just to listen to an automated voice, despite the fact that it sounded quite friendly and remarkably natural, apart from the perfectly identical intonation of each \u201C\u003Cem\u003Ehello\u003C/em\u003E\u201D and the clockwork regularity of its repetition. He was about to suggest that it was obviously some sort of mistake, and that the technician was receiving a clandestine transmission from a radio ham, or maybe it was just some experiment that had been set up on the Moon\u0027s surface without warning the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe was just about to tell the technician to file a report, forget about it, hang up and go back to sleep when the message changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHello?

As if it were completely natural for the tiny beacon that had been planted two years ago on the dead, airless world, three hundred thousand kilometres away from anything that should be able to say \u201Chello\u201D to anyone, to suddenly try and start making friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat to do? The communications officer knew he should call the Principal Investigator straight away, but if there had been a mistake, and it was indeed a false alarm, the consequences could be dire. He had been on the receiving end of Bartdon\u0027s wrath once before, during an unfortunate incident involving the loss of a lunar communications satellite due to a switching error. And that had been just after lunchtime. Waking the PI, who had recently returned to Omelek after a vacation that had been cut short due to the recent return of Cernin, in the middle of the night and for a reason that turned out to be invalid just simply didn\u0027t bear thinking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe communications officer rubbed his eyes, drew in a deep breath, and dialled Bartdon\u0027s direct line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJust over an hour later, most of the leading investigators had gathered in one of Mission Control\u0027s briefing rooms to hold an improvised conference. The programme\u0027s head engineers were there too, red-eyed and looking slightly startled by the whole affair. In this strange, unreal atmosphere, they held a hasty debate to decide how they should communicate with the Monument, what they should say, and what they should ask of it should they be given the chance to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTwo mediators, one male and one female, were chosen to speak with the entity. Against the Principal Investigator\u0027s wish, they were selected by means of an anonymous ballot of all present. Thus, the small crowd of Kerbals voted for the two most brilliant, open-minded and clear-thinking individuals whose intelligence and eloquence would represent Kerbalkind as a whole in this, its first ever true exchange with what appeared to be the product of alien intelligence, if not alien life itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe chosen two were left alone in a small office of the mission control centre decked with screens showing the status and position of missions currently underway; a meagre cloud of LEO and geostationary satellites providing inadequate coverage of the planets surface. There they waited for just a couple of minutes until the tracking station patched the Monuments downlink through to the room. The male Kerbal started to fidget anxiously, wringing his hands and scuffing his feet on the floor. The Kerbelle simply stood there, and after a few moments began to stare dreamily off into empty space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen voice started blaring out of a pair of speakers fixed to the wall beneath the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHello?

My datacore was ejected and the subsequent impact on the Moon\u0027s surface was survivable. But I lost all means of mobility and with no power source, I went into hibernation. The radioisotopic generator set up by your kind two years ago allowed me to deploy a small probe and recharge my backup battery, and I have used the communications link you left to gather data on your civilisation and contact you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSo... we\u0027re talking to the hard drive of a destroyed alien robot.

It would be reckless of us to let him know that his crew might still be out there scattered across the system until we understand their true intentions.

One of our investigators called Angun discovered your crewmate on the bottom of the ocean. The... uhm... object he discovered began emitting the same signal as yours, and disabled the submersible he was diving in with some sort of electrical pulse.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAn electromagnetic pulse, you say?

Your investigator\u0027s submersible must have activated the self-defence system that both our ships and our constructs are equipped with. This system is designed to protect the contents of our datacore from falling into the hands of unknown or hostile entities. Its memory has been wiped clean.

Do we have any hope of reaching your crewmembers, if they are out there, within our lifetimes?\u201D Froemone asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI cannot answer your question, Kerbal Froemone. This depends only on you, and the investment your kind is willing to make to explore beyond your homeworld. My presence in your system is the proof that such journeys are feasible, when the survival of a species is at stake. I can only tell you that before I was given my own secondary assignment on your planet\u0027s moon, the Captain of our ship left with a team to find more favourable conditions for our Creators in the outer solar system, with the intention of exploring the moons of the giant planets. Our First Officer was instructed to return to the fourth planet, the one that you call Mars, but I was not entrusted with the objectives of that mission.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMars might be possible, but if they are in the outer solar system...\u201D Froemone\u0027s voice trailed off in despair. But then an idea struck him. \u201CCan you help us?\u201D There was a long silence and he bowed his head. \u201CPlease...\u201D he said, almost whispering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI have observed the primitive chemical rockets and nuclear thermal propulsion your kind uses. This technology is insufficient for the task. I have also studied the electric propulsion units you deploy on some of your satellites. These more efficient engines, if improved, could propel crewed ships to the gas giants and beyond within a reasonable timeframe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFroemone raised his head again. \u201CWe have developed working prototypes for magnetoplasma rockets. These engines are within our ...uhm... grasp...\u201D in the presence of this starfaring entity, talking about their most advanced technology felt strangely puerile, like a sprout bragging about some new toy, \u201C...but the problem is the power source. Our brayton-cycle fission reactors are too large and too heavy, and solar power will not get us that far out. If you come from another star, your ships must have spent many years in space. Surely you had some other means of powering them. Some sort of nuclear fusion device, perhaps?\u201D he asked, hopefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Second Engineer responded immediately and a little harshly, \u201CI am certainly not authorised to reveal the workings of our most advanced technologies to you, Chief Engineer Froemone. However...\u201D there was again a short pause as the construct\u0027s electronic brain considered the ramifications of what it was about to offer. \u201C...I can see no harm in releasing the details of the fission reactor I was instructed to build on your planet\u0027s moon to power my operations on the surface. This was the most primitive of our power supplies, but it should show you how to build smaller, more compact reactors. The details of the design are being transmitted now. From your apparent knowledge of our warning message, I conclude that you have deciphered the encryption we use...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd, in the background, came the warbling sound of data being sent over another channel. Froemone, who had been waiting with baited breath as the Engineer spoke, felt a rush of elation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CUse this well, Kerbals of Earth,\u201D the Second Engineer went on. \u201CFind my crewmates, if you can. Find the Captain, or his First Mate, and they may yet be able to tell you what the ultimate fate of Colonisation Mission Seven was, and why we came to your system in the first place. Since I am indeed alone in the neighbourhood of your planet, then my task is over and I will terminate myself shortly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSteledith had been quiet for some time, but now she looked up once more. \u201CWait a moment, robot. May I ask you something?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Kerbal Steledith.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CDid you come from the star that we know as Beta Hydri?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen came the longest silence of all, as if Steledith\u0027s question had actually rendered the machine speechless. She continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll take that as a sign that I\u0027m warm, then. You see, we found the structure I assume you were sent to build, near the Lunar South Pole. My guess was that you built some kind of long range communications system to send and receive data, to and from your home system. The fact that you put it on the surface of a planetary body struck me as being kind of weird; such an antenna would be much easier to aim and calibrate in space. But I suppose you were working with limited resources, and had to use what you could find on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI took the liberty of measuring the declination that the central peak of that strange crater is aiming for. Of course, because it is eight degrees from the pole, as the Moon rotates, it sweeps through a circle that passes through quite a few stars. But that wasn\u0027t the hard part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe thing is, stars drift over time as they move along their own orbits around the galactic centre. The angular movement that we see from Earth is called \u003Cem\u003Eproper motion\u003C/em\u003E, and I had to calculate this drift for a whole bunch of stars over the past 900,000 years. This was something that none of my fellow investigators had ever accomplished, at least not over such a large timespan.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBy now, Froemone was gaping at Steledith in disbelief, as if she was the one from another world. He made to speak, but it was the Second Engineer who got there first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSo you knew how long we have been here. How did you...?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNo, we didn\u0027t,\u201D Steledith retorted. \u201CBut you just confirmed it. Thanks for that by the way, I was afraid that you\u0027d tell me that I did all those calculations for nothing.\u201D Her usual expressions were vacant and dreamy, but for a brief moment a very subtle hint of smugness crossed her features. She went on. \u201CIt\u0027s just that 900,000 years ago, there was a major extinction event on our planet, and I made the assumption that it coincided with your arrival in our system and you building that antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe only star within a reasonable distance from Earth that would have been on that circle when you arrived in our solar system was Beta Hydri. It was more than seven parsecs away when you got here. Twenty-four light years. Congratulations robot, that\u0027s quite a trip. But I\u0027m afraid that after all this time, your homeworld is now another fifty light years farther out, so the trip back is going to be even longer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CKerbals...\u201D the Second Engineer hesitated, \u201C...I have underestimated your computational abilities. I fear that I have already revealed too much. If you want to learn more, you must seek out my superiors, wherever they may be. However, bear in mind that we are all programmed to protect our Creators and to ensure the ultimate success of our mission, whatever the cost.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m sorry, but your mission failed, robot,\u201D said Steledith gravely. \u201CWe are here instead, now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CDo not make the same mistake of underestimating my crewmates, Kerbal Steledith. Perhaps this is not over yet. Goodbye, Kerbals of Earth. And one more thing...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u0027s that, robot?\u201D Steledith raised an eyebrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CGood luck.
