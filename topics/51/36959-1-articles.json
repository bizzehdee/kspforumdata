I had gotten the encounter with Duna and all, but when I got there, I noticed something odd. Namely, I WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE NORTH POLE OF DUNA. I burned for orbit anyway, because orbiting Duna forever with a slim chance of rescue is a lot nicer than orbiting the sun forever with no chance of rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow Milholt and his pal are now stuck in a highly elliptical polar orbit around Duna. The ship has less than 100 units of fuel left, 98 units of RCS left and no docking ports. Chances of rescue, due to the extreme distance involved, are very slim. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, we got a nice picture...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3m1YdDF.png\u0022 alt=\u00223m1YdDF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELesson learned: \u003Cstrong\u003EDo not treat interplanetary missions like a Mun landing!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T22:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your orbital periapsis? If it\u0027s low enough, you could expend a small amount of fuel at apoapsis to bring your periapsis down into the atmosphere, aerobreake for a few orbits to drag your apoaosis down, and then kick your periapsis back out. It would make the orbit more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, your only chance of a rescue is a simple rendezvous with a craft with enough empty seats for the crew, and EVA them over, leaving the empty craft in orbit forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, you are best to match orbital planes with Duna half-way during the interplanetary coast, at either the ascending or descending node. This will mean you\u0027ll come very close to the equatorial plane. You should also aerocapture at Duna by passing through its atmosphere at periapsis, this will allow you to be captured without expending fuel. I find this online calculator useful when aerobreaking: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use that tool to aerobrake at the right altitude to have an apoapsis close to Ike\u0027s orbit, and from there an encounter is almost guaranteed if you wait an orbit or two. Don\u0027t try to brake-burn right to Ike, you\u0027ll waste a lot of fuel.
