My brother came in and asked what I was playing so I told him about it and was going to show him my next launch.\u00A0 I always use Kerbal Construction Time mod, so as a result many of my missions are prepped and built well in advance of their actual launch.\u00A0 My brother was pestering me to do something quick, so I picked the next project that was nearing completion and timewarped to its completion. Not even knowing the purpose of the mission it was prepared for I played a quick game of match the build with the contract and determined it was a satellite prepped for munar orbit. I was actually kinda nervous as I\u0027d never had anyone watching over my shoulder for a launch, but it went off without a hitch and I was on the way to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI timewarped towards my munar orbit injection and it was then that I realized in my haste I had skipped a fairly important step. The satellite was reporting negative communication with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I thought that it was me simply forgetting to face my panels into the sun before warping, and I told him I could fix it by cheating a bit. Unfortunately, upon closer inspection, I realized the problem was much worse. Because I was using the construction mod, I had built my satellite without any solar panels (They were supposed to be installed after initial construction, since the better version would have completed research by then). I explained the mishap to my brother and we had a good laugh \u0022It\u0027s only a couple hundred million dollars, and besides I have others, I didn\u0027t need that one anyways!\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter he left and went to bed I went to the tracking station and deleted the mission. I\u0027ll just add that one to the \u0022Loss of Vehicle\u0022 pile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NotAgain","CreatedById":150764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-08T15:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFupp\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003En.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0That small part you forget, which you then remember when you\u0027re almost at your destination, which is really quite critical for the non-horribly-failing of the mission.
