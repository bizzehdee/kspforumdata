I want to start a space program.\u0022 replied Wernher von Kerbin calmly, in his distinctive, thick, Eastern Kermany accent.\n\n\u0022We simply don\u0027t have the funds for that. We only scraped the latest general election, and we still owe the Kapanese government several million kresos in war aid. It cannot be a priority at the moment.\u0022, said PM Kameron, back to a calm state.\n\n\u0022Yes, but think of the support the public will give this project. Think about it! Since the dawn of time, Kerbals have looked up at the sky, wondering what secrets it has in store, wondering if we can ever reach the planets, even the stars. People want to go to space. Space is important. Technologies can be developed from space trav-\u0022, babbled Wernher, before being interrupted by the Prime Minister.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s a good thought, yes, but it\u0027s not a priority.\u0022, answered the Prime Minister.\n\n\u0022Please.\u0022 said a slightly frustrated Wernher.\n\nIt was a good notion. The technology was already there. Wernher von Kerman\u0027s missiles had helped secure the Hexanian victory in the great Shape War of 2014. Suddenly, the Prime Minister had a notion.\n\n\u0022We have a patch of land we used to use for missile tests at the Kafrican coast. We can build a basic space centre there, and give you some funds to start off. But after that, you have to get your funding from private sources.\u0022\n\n\u0022That sounds like an excellent idea Mr. Prime Minister.\u0022, smiled Wernher.\n\n\u0022Get to it then Dr. von Kerman.\u0022\n\nAnd so began the Hexanian Space Program...\n\n* * *\n\nChapters\n\n[Chapter I - Beginnings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115446-The-Hexanian-Space-Agency-A-story-set-in-a-0-90-career-save-%28will-be-pic-heavy%29?p=1835484\u0026viewfull=1#post1835484) \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\n* * *\n\nCrew Roster\n\n![lzM5wNr.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/lzM5wNr.png?1)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E Occupation: Pilot\n\u003E \n\u003E Status: Active\n\u003E \n\u003E Notable Achievements:\n\u003E \n\u003E Ribbons: \n\n![PuaJA39.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/PuaJA39.png?1)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Occupation: Engineer\n\u003E \n\u003E Status: Active\n\u003E \n\u003E Notable Achievements:\n\u003E \n\u003E Ribbons: \n\n![nxCUoZi.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/nxCUoZi.png?1)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E Occupation: Scientist\n\u003E \n\u003E Status: Active\n\u003E \n\u003E Notable Achievements:\n\u003E \n\u003E Ribbons: \n\n* * *\n\nAchievements\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T17:45:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaintedLion**"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T17:25:32Z","Content":"**Chapter I - The Beginning**\n\n\u0022The Prime Minister did us good Linus.\u0022 happily exclaimed Wernher von Kerman. The facilities were finally built. Although they were basic, they could easily be upgraded in the future.\n\n![jE6eiJY.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/jE6eiJY.png?1)\n\n\u0022We\u0027re going to need astronauts. Probodobodyne has not completed their Stayputnik probe core yet, and Kerlington has offered their Mk.1 Capsule design to us. We\u0027ve reconfigured it from its original use as a pressurised balloon gondola into something a bit more functional.\u0022 said Linus Kerman, the intern of Wernher von Kerman.\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry about that.\u0022 said Gene Kerman, head of Mission Control, \u0022We\u0027ve got the facilities to train five, and we got three of the best.\u0022, and he passed three files over to Linus.\n\n\u0022Ahh, Jebediah Kerman. I\u0027ve heard a lot about him. How the .... did he pass the psych evaluation? Isn\u0027t he slightly insane?\u0022, said Linus in a worried tone.\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t know. He has an unmatchable reputation though. He is probably the best pilot alive. He volunteered to join after bein fir- I mean leaving the Royal Hexanian Air Force. He\u0027s also the owner of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co. He offered to give us a 75% discount on all his rocket parts in return for letting him fly on out ships.\u0022 said Gene confidently.\n\n\u0022His recklessness may bite him in the arse one day.\u0022\n\nLinus picked out the next file.\n\n\u0022Bill Kerman. Engineer, top of all his classes, graduated the University of Hexford with a Ph.D in Aeronautical Engineering at the age of 16. Genius, tech whizz. He\u0027s our guy.\u0022\n\nNext file.\n\n\u0022Bob Kerman. Twin brother of Bill Kerman. Another genius, graduated from the University of Kambridge with a Ph.D in Astrophysics at 16. The twin brother part might be good publicity, if they were ever to go into space together. I\u0027ll talk to Walt about that.\u0022\n\n![09HOx7w.png](http://i.imgur.com/09HOx7w.png)\n\n**From left to right: Jebediah Kerman, Bill Kerman, Bob Kerman.**\n\nGene suddenly called for everyone\u0027s attention.\n\n\u0022Our mysterious benefactors of the Hexanian Space Program, the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society, have tasked us with achieving various altitude records and achieving orbit before they will let anyone else offer their contracts. Only time will tell if the Hexanian Space Program is up to the task. Remember guys, failure is not an option most of the time.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T17:49:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaintedLion**"}]}
