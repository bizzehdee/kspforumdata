The NASA-KSP Program has had to make great strides in technology to prepare a rescue mission for a crew that has been stranded in space for almost a year. Nuclear and Ion propulsion have propelled the space program forward many years and for the first time in Kerbin history, an orbital station was to be built above Kerbin. No scientist on Kerbin was certain if the Orbital One Heavy Lifter could even take off with the first parts of the Orbital One station and the Director of the NASA-KSP Program could be seen fiddling as the countdown began:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00225, 4, 3... main engine start, 2, 1....

The ideological differences had put these two countries of Kerbin on a collision course of Mutually Assured Destruction. However, after a disastrous collapse of the UKKS economy and the reformation of the UKKS into the Kerbal Federation, or KF, a new era had begun: one of global economic partnerships and the global Kerbin economy. Now the planet comprises of three countries: the United States of Kerbin, the Kerbin Union, the Kerbal Federation, and Kerbhina. While relations between the USK and the KU have been excellent, the KF and Kerbhina found themselves at odds with their western neighbors. Nevertheless, the four countries on the planet were willing to work together to develop a Solar Observatory and deploy it in orbit of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait!!!!\u0022 Jeb yelled as he came running into Mission Control where a bunch of dignitaries from the four nation-states have gathered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We forgot the observatory\u0027s computer!\u0022 Jeb said in a panic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was too late however, the USK-KU\u0027s most advanced computer system: the MechJeb, had already engaged the observatory for 150,000m orbit of the planet. Although the observatory was essentially rendered useless due in part to design flaws from the Kerbhina contributions like neglecting a decoupler for the Kerbal Federation\u0027s Ion Engines to engage, the observatory hit its target orbit and represented to all the people of Kerbin what happens when space agencies work together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/280730548768423479/88A0D5F28668F5B7732F85CDEFD6B93C7323A984/\u0022 alt=\u002288A0D5F28668F5B7732F85CDEFD6B93C7323A984\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/280730548768423377/63FB4A0FC272810D82F209F38B59C59AEFFFBE33/\u0022 alt=\u002263FB4A0FC272810D82F209F38B59C59AEFFFBE33\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach of the four countries have been running their own space program: the USK had NASA-KSP, the KU has the KSA, and so on.
