Most were as likely to detonate on the pad or in the workshop as they were to launch, often taking their inventors and any progress in the field with them. It took three exceptional (and, depending on who you ask, insane) kerbals to transform this series of independent efforts into the start of the space program we know today. The first was the brilliant scientist/engineer Wernher von Kerman and his revolutionary designs; the second was the fearless test pilot Jebediah \u0022Jeb\u0022 Kerman, who started a junkyard to deal with the pieces of all the experimental planes he crashed and turned it into the first supplier of parts for the fledgling program. And the third, of course, was President John F. Kerman and his famous mandate to put a kerbal on the Mun by the end of the decade (and the associated offer of unlimited government funding for anyone who could make it happen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrough a long process of trial and error, Wernher refined his first experimental designs (all custom-built by Jeb and his brothers, and later their employees as the company grew) to fly further, faster, and safer. Within a month, he\u0027d reduced the chance of in-flight explosion to less than 50%; in three, he was lobbing inert test masses into adjacent counties. Not all landed in empty countryside; in an early interview, he confessed, \u0022I aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit Kerbin.\u0022 To reduce the risk of more such incidents, construction of Kerbal Space Center soon began on the shore of what is now known as \u0022Booster Bay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first true orbital rocket was ready just in time for the first anniversary of the President\u0027s announcement, and Wernher felt confident enough of its success to mount a payload that actually did something. \u003Cem\u003EStayputnik I\u003C/em\u003E (\u0022We send it up, you see, and it does not fall back down, at least not right away - it stays put, \u003Cem\u003Enicht wahr?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022) was little more than a radio transmitter and batteries in an aluminum sphere, but it could be seen and more importantly heard by kerbals for days (until the batteries ran out). It was exactly the kind of stunt the KSP needed, and after that there were no more questions whether the government\u0027s money was being well spent. (Also, the university electronics club that Wernher hired to build the thing for him immediately incorporated themselves as \u0022Probodobodyne Inc.\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flurry of satellite launches followed, with many top scientists competing (and in some cases, getting into fistfights) to have their instrument package be the next to be sent into low orbit on one of Wernher and Jeb\u0027s rockets. Many startling discoveries were made about \u0022near space\u0022 during the next few months. But while \u003Cem\u003EStayputnik\u003C/em\u003E had kicked off the Space Age, what the public wanted to know was when the first kerbal was going into space, and who that would be. Among those close to the program, the answer to the second question had never been in doubt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKrishna\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E: First Kerbals In Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design of the first kerbal-rated booster, \u003Cem\u003EOrbiter\u003C/em\u003E, was nearly as simple as its name: one FL-T800 tank and LV-T30 engine atop three others, with the two stages joined by a tri-coupler (a special new part which Wernher had seen at a trade show and was said to be looking for an excuse to use). This coupler, a product of OMB Demolitions, was one of the few components of those early flights not built in the Kerman brothers\u0027 junkyard. Another, ironically, was the crew capsule itself. Jeb had gone to the model-makers at Kerlington Paper Products (already renowned for their meticulously-crafted tiny cardstock buildings, found in architects\u0027 offices everywhere) to create first a series of scale models, then a 1:1 mock-up, of exactly the craft he wanted to fly. When he finally presented it to the program engineers, they just shrugged and began fitting it with instrumentation and a parachute. It promptly caught fire during a wiring test, forcing them to quickly rebuild it in steel, aluminum, and other less flammable materials. (Kerlington, having provided the original model and blueprints, retains design credit to this day.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the extra weight of the metal capsule was enough to keep Orbiter from reaching orbit; an additional \u0022kick\u0022 of delta-V would be necessary. Rather than stretching the rocket by adding another stage, it was decided to add a ring of solid rocket boosters around the base, attached with explosive bolts (also supplied by OMB). There were some mutterings about the wisdom of this, but Jeb dismissed them with his usual confidence, claiming that it would \u0022make the ride more exciting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221EMdgiv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1EMdgiv.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Exciting\u0022 was definitely one word for what happened when \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 1\u003C/em\u003E roared off the almost-new Pad 1 at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on a sunny afternoon. A slight imbalance in the mounting of the SRBs caused the rocket to immediately begin spinning clockwise like a carnival ride. Without the aid of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, using only the gyros mounted in the capsule itself, Jeb managed to keep the rocket pointed more or less straight up while the SRBs burned themselves out. Thirty seconds into the flight, they dropped off and Jeb immediately slammed on the next stage\u0027s engines at half throttle before the rocket could lose momentum. Once he had it wrestled back around to a heading of 90 degrees, he went to full throttle and began to pitch over in a gravity turn. The rocket, with its ungimbaled engines, became progressively more difficult to control as fuel drained and its center of gravity shifted; after staging (at T \u002B 2 minutes), the upper stage alone proved to be much more manageable. Jeb was able to circularize his orbit and perform several other basic maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CZ6lRH8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CZ6lRH8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKrishna 1\u003C/em\u003E completed one full orbit of Kerbin, with an apogee of 102,108 km and a total flight time (launch to splashdown) of just over 41 minutes. They fished Jeb out of the ocean, gave him a medal and paraded him around the country as a hero. Wernher also got a medal, but insisted that he was much too busy for parades; he was hard at work on the next rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EKrishna 2\u003C/em\u003E was, in many ways, even more ambitious than the first historic mission. The redesigned upper stage included several new features invented specifically to address the control issues encountered with \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 1\u003C/em\u003E: an Advanced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E module and a Reaction Control System with thruster quads both fore and aft. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E mountings had been adjusted in hopes of eliminating the unexpected roll. The parachute had also been moved from the tip of the capsule to both sides, to make room for another new invention: a docking port. In theory, this would allow \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 2\u003C/em\u003E to attach (and later detach) itself to another spacecraft. That craft was already under construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe docking target (again, the engineers never bothered to come up with another name) was a short upper stage for Orbiter with a radio tranceiver to allow for ground control. Like the manned craft, it had several innovations over the cobbled-together Stayputnik, including a pair of extendable solar panels to keep the batteries charged while in orbit; its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E were the same as those aboard \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 2\u003C/em\u003E. The plan was to launch it one hour earlier and allow Jeb to catch up and rendezvous with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022llgkTrD.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/llgkTrD.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, reality deviated from the plan. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-induced roll was still present in both launches, despite the best efforts of the engineers; however, the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was able to counter it (with continuous \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust in the other direction) until the very last seconds of the burn, and then swiftly eliminate it after separation. Jeb was reluctant to engage the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and did so only after repeated prodding from mission control. He also had more trouble than expected with the rendezvous, which required maneuvers that were often unintuitive, and it was not until almost three hours after launch that \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 2\u003C/em\u003E finally matched orbits with the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the target was in sight, docking was relatively easy; Jeb quickly got the hang of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E quads, and the ports locked together on the first try. Jeb immediately followed that accomplishment with another: after a brief suit and helmet check, he depressurized his capsule, opened the hatch, and stepped out to inspect the now-joined craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JwZSBAZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JwZSBAZ.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, the first orbital EVA by a kerbal, was perhaps the most dangerous part of the mission. While Jeb\u0027s life-support backpack included a miniature set of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, they had only a tiny fraction of the monopropellant reserves of his parent craft; if he lost control or used up all his fuel before returning to the capsule, he could drift away and be lost - eventually suffocating when his air ran out, or burning up on re-entry, whichever came first. There had been talk of a tether to keep the kerbonaut connected to the spacecraft, but Jeb kept getting tangled up in tests and refused to wear one in flight, preferring (as always) to rely on his own flying skill and courage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, Jeb performed very well during his eight-minute EVA, moving out from the combined spacecraft and back, then from one end to the other. The only difficulty came at the end, when he misjudged the distance to the capsule and drifted past it while trying to board. Chuckling and cursing, he stopped himself and came back for a second pass, managing to grab on this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter another hour, two more orbits and a few more tests - including transferring fuel from the docking target to refill \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 2\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s tanks - Jeb finally cast off and moved to a safe distance with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E before making his retro burn. The capsule fell short of the recovery area in Booster Bay, landing several kilometers west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; thanks to the two parachutes, however, there was no damage to it or the contents. \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 2\u003C/em\u003E thus qualified for another, inadvertant first: the program\u0027s first kerbaled landing on solid ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was serious talk of canceling \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 3\u003C/em\u003E. The three-kerbal Rama capsule (see below) was undergoing ground tests by this time, and Jeb\u0027s above-and-beyond efforts had already accomplished all of the original objectives for this part of the program. On the other hand, some argued, Rama (and the new booster that would carry it) wasn\u0027t ready \u003Cem\u003Eyet\u003C/em\u003E; and with the imminent and considerable expansion of the kerbonaut corps, it was necessary to demonstrate to everyone - inside the program as well as outside - that they had more than one qualified pilot. Besides, the rocket had already been built, though not assembled, and the docking target was still up there...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so Bill Kerman and \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 3\u003C/em\u003E, \u0022the forgotten Krishna\u0022, lifted off Pad 1 in the program\u0027s first night launch. Bill was a more careful, by-the-book pilot who kept the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E toggled on for most of the flight. He managed to rendezvous with the target in only two orbits, and his successful docking proved that Jeb\u0027s accomplishment was reproducible. His splashdown in Booster Bay was on target, with an overshoot of only a few kilometers. \u0022He managed to make it all look almost routine,\u0022 mission controller Gene Kerman observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-11T13:42:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2017 01:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Commander Zoom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emoved images from Photobucket to Imgur\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T08:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERETOOLING: RAMA AND ROCKOMAX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though the President\u0027s speech had only called for sending one kerbal to the Mun and returning them safely to Kerbin, it was decided early on in the program that for maximum safety and redundancy, it would be best to send two or even three kerbonauts along. Not only was three one of the \u0022magic numbers\u0022, it was also the practical limit of current engineering - though some scientists were already imagining even larger expeditions, with whole fleets descending upon the Mun - and the point at which most discussions of \u0022but what if something happens to...?\u0022 trailed off into absurdity; it was difficult for the planners to imagine a mishap that could incapacitate three kerbals at once without destroying the spacecraft outright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was equally clear that there was no way that an Orbiter could carry even one kerbal to the Mun and back, let alone three. (Not if he intended to land, that is; Jeb volunteered to attempt a once-around and free return, just to see if it could be done.) A capsule had been designed that could support three kerbals for the duration of such a mission, but all by itself - without parachutes, crew, or the supplies needed to sustain them - it weighed \u003Cem\u003Efive times\u003C/em\u003E as much as a Krishna pod. The Mun rocket would have to be built on a new and different scale - larger, stronger, heavier and more powerful than anything built so far. And Jeb\u0027s junkyard, frankly, was not up to the task of making such parts - especially not with Jeb himself busy with/distracted by kerbonaut training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnter Rockomax. The industrial conglomerate had been waiting for such an opportunity since the news of Stayputnik broke. A leading manufacturer of storage silos, large pressure tanks and high-capacity pumps, many of their products could be adapted to the needs of the program with little work or delay. With their cash reserves and profits from other divisions, Rockomax could afford to always be the lowest bidder. Thus, Rockomax became the space program\u0027s biggest contractor - and the company that would build most of the Mun rocket - by being there at the right time to fill a need that few others could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERama 1 - 3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E: Advanced Orbital Operations\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though it was only intended to carry \u003Cem\u003ERama 1\u003C/em\u003E into low Kerbin orbit, the name of the new booster - Munatic, mark 1 - left no doubt as to its ultimate purpose. Taking inspiration from Orbiter, three stages of X200-32 tanks, stacked two high and painted flat white for high visibility and heat management, were grouped around a fourth core stage. Each stage had, at its base, a single giant \u0022Mainsail\u0022 engine - Rockomax\u0027s trump card, a rocket motor so powerful that it required the purchase of gauges with more zeroes just to measure its thrust. All four of them would fire at the start, to lift Munatic and its payload off the pad, but fuel lines ran from the three outer boosters to the center; once empty, they would drop away, leaving the still fully-fueled core stage to finish the journey into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003ERama\u003C/em\u003E capsule itself was also a mix of the familiar and the revolutionary. First, it was difficult to talk about the capsule (now the \u0022Command Module\u0022) separately from its dedicated upper stage, the \u0022Service Module\u0022, which provided it with air, water, and electrical power during flight. The service module included \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and one of Rockomax\u0027s small rocket engines, the \u0022Poodle\u0022, which was \u0022only\u0022 about as powerful as a LT-T30 or the new LV-T45 but built to a shorter, wider form factor, with a larger reaction chamber and smaller bell. Kerbonauts still sat with their backs to the base of the capsule and the thick heat shield, but now the cabin was large enough to fit three of them, with enough room to trade seats if necessary. It was also amply supplied with windows, both forward and to the side, at least for the left and right seaters; ironically, the center seat, mounted below the other two and designated for the mission commander, had no windows at all and required flying by instruments alone. (Jeb protested bitterly about this, but was ignored.) Radial parachutes (three of them, allowing the crew to touch down safely on land or water) and a docking port on the nose (with its own protective cover) were now standard as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bg6neeK.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bg6neeK.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring a ground test of the capsule with the \u003Cem\u003ERama 1\u003C/em\u003E backup crew - Sidden, Gus, and Kennard Kerman, who would later fly on \u003Cem\u003ERama 3\u003C/em\u003E - the hatch was accidentally locked from outside; it was soon found that the spare key had been lost, requiring a locksmith to be called. As the capsule had not been stocked with snacks for the test, the crew soon grew hungry and began banging on the hatch and hull, demanding to be let out and/or fed. This accident resulted in a delay of several weeks while the hatch was redesigned and other minor changes made to the capsule. Two months after \u003Cem\u003EKrishna 3\u003C/em\u003E, the new capsule and its service module was finally rated ready to fly; it was mated to the top of a Munatic and the whole thing rolled out onto Pad 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, another craft was being prepared for launch on Pad 2. The ADT (Advanced Docking Target) was also mostly just a scaled-up version of the original; one new feature, however (the multiple docking \u0022hub\u0022) was to have considerable influence on the next few missions, and pave the way for permanent installations like Kerbin Station 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221ocuxOf.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1ocuxOf.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERama 1\u003C/em\u003E was the first time that the famous team of Jeb, Bob and Bill all flew in space together.

This was intended to help \u003Cem\u003ERama 3\u003C/em\u003E reach orbit with full or nearly-full tanks, in anticipation of the next phase of the mission. After launch and another long wait for a good rendezvous, \u003Cem\u003ERama 3\u003C/em\u003E finally docked with its two predecessors and the ADT in a cross formation, with 80% fuel (compared to the 50% of the others).

It took them eight hours to reach the Mun and eight hours back.

The design team for the latter, however, had yet to produce even a final design, let alone a working model. In its absence, advocates of the \u0022Direct Ascent\u0022 approach gained favor within the program; their argument could be summarized as \u0022Rama can already get to the Mun; why not just give it a little more fuel and some legs and let \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E land?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end result - the Munatic mk 3 and the stretched \u0022Rama M\u0022 - was a little more complicated than that, but not much.

The strap-ons burned half their fuel, transferred the rest inward, and fell away a mere twenty seconds into the flight; the three secondary boosters (throttled back slightly, to avoid overheating or overstressing the rocket) lasted another minute and some seconds, to the start of the gravity turn. The core stage carried the transfer stage and Rama CSM to the very edge of orbit, then was jettisoned to fall somewhere in the middle of the ocean, just as planned. Jeb let the spacecraft coast to apogee before using half of the upper stage\u0027s fuel to establish a roughly circular parking orbit in the vicinity of 100 km.

The transfer stage, on the other hand, would be allowed to crash right into it. This had been part of the mission plan from early on; not only would it help keep space around Kerbin free of possibly hazardous debris, some scientists thought that \u0022something really cool\u0022 might happen when the discarded stage hit the munar surface. Alas, cameras on \u003Cem\u003ERama 4\u003C/em\u003E saw only a small puff of dust and the formation of a new crater, later confirmed by telescopes on Kerbin.

Sidden was not deterred, and quickly climbed aboard. He brought the rover around in a slow turn, then aimed it at a large rock near the top of a nearby rise, some 600 meters away.

By the time he picked himself up, dragged himself over to the rover and got the wheels bent back into a vaguely round shape, he was almost nine kilometers away from the lander and, for the first time, beginning to wonder if he had enough oxium to get back. And, just to make matters worse, the lack of an ionosphere to bounce radio signals off of meant that he couldn\u0027t even call for help until he was back in line of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe briefly considered abandoning the rover and making his return by jetpack, but the prospect of running out of fuel halfway there and/or plowing faceplate first into the surface at an even more unsafe speed daunted him.

True, it was a lot farther and at a bit of an inconvenient angle, but the pilots of the program had plenty of experience (though some of them only in simulators, so far) with matching orbits. The really hard part, as one writer had observed, was getting into orbit of Kerbin; after that, you were \u0022halfway to anywhere.\u0022 And if Minmus was so much smaller than the Mun, that meant it would take less delta-V to land on or take off from - enough to make up for the extra needed to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest question - one that the best telescopes Kerbin had at the time couldn\u0027t answer - was what the damn thing was \u003Cem\u003Emade\u003C/em\u003E of.

There were plenty of nice flat frozen lakes (or regions that looked like frozen lakes) down there, and he could reach them as easily from this orbit as any other. Another pair of braking burns (to lower first the periapsis, then the apoapsis to match) left \u003Cem\u003ERama 6\u003C/em\u003E circling the small moon at a distance of a mere 20 km. Many more photographs were taken at this close range. Finally Hudwise made his selection, and turned the ship around for the next pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun was already low in Minmus\u0027 sky over that region, however, casting the hills and valleys in deep shadow, and by the time the craft came around again the landing site was (just barely) on the night side of the line. Hudwise chose not to abort, but to continue the descent by radar and landing lights. Two bright circles appeared on the flat, glittering surface... then suddenly vanished in a roiling, opaque cloud of steam. Hudwise reacted instantly to his fellows\u0027 startled cries, aborting the landing and throttling back up before easing off into a hover at 500 meters. By that time the cloud had mostly dissipated, and Obney was able to observe that while the hot exhaust had melted a shallow crater in the ice, it did not seem to have broken through to liquid (or rock): \u0022Must be frozen solid all the way to the bottom, however deep that is.\u0022 With fuel, options and daylight all running out fast, the crew elected to put down again a short distance from the original spot. Hudwise had to rely entirely on the radar altimeter for the last dozen meters, cutting the throttle precisely at zero; he waited until the cloud cleared again and he had visual confirmation from the other kerbonauts before informing mission control (at T \u002B 2 days and 24 minutes) that \u003Cem\u003ERama 6\u003C/em\u003E was safely down on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022skyoUfG.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/skyoUfG.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gUFA8Dn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gUFA8Dn.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aLGn5cP.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aLGn5cP.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe celebration in the capsule was brief, with the crew more focused on getting outside to survey the surroundings and their craft. Kenkin won the toss and was the first down the ladder. \u0022Kinda slippery - watch your step\u0022 were the first words, accurate if not very poetic, spoken on Minmus. The other two soon joined him, and found themselves standing in another shallow crater, gleaming in the floodlights, jagged in some places and treacherously smooth and slick in others. A thin layer of ice had refrozen over the landing legs, but it could be and was quickly chipped away with their rock hammers. With that taken care of, Hudwise and Kenkin moved out of the crater to start drilling for core samples while Obney unpacked the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002280sqPiK.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/80sqPiK.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latter was one of the great disappointments of the mission, if not an outright disaster. In actual use, it proved almost impossible to hold on to the pitching and rolling sled while also working the thruster controls. Obney was thrown off again and again, cursing as he flew through the near-vacuum in slow motion, before finally abandoning the thing where it had come to rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite this setback, and the added difficulty of working by helmet lights, the crew returned to their craft with the core samples (which were placed in an insulated, refrigerated compartment - i.e., the beverage cooler) at the end of their half hour. At that time, another conference and vote was held to determine whether they should immediately start back for Kerbin, or attempt a short hop and second landing on one of the sunlit plateaus to the west, to take more samples and observations from the highlands. All were in favor of giving the latter a try, with the understanding that another abort would mean the end of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022B8Za9Jt.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B8Za9Jt.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iWMmEWq.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iWMmEWq.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRising out of yet another steam-shroud, \u003Cem\u003ERama 6\u003C/em\u003E lifted off and turned westward, clearing the rolling hills with legs and ladder still extended. Hudwise had gotten the hang of flying on Minmus by now, and after just a few minutes of flight time he found a nice flat mesa to set down on with hardly a bump. \u0022And that, gentlemen, is how we do that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HiAXb85.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HiAXb85.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p0jkxuS.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p0jkxuS.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second EVA went much more smoothly - between the better lighting, more experience moving around on the ice in very low gravity, and no need to bother with a troublesome rover - and many samples were obtained, not only of the ice but also from some exposed boulders. Tired but pleased, the kerbonauts finally climbed back on board and began securing everything for the trip home. Liftoff and the escape burn were performed by the checklist, with little chatter. Three and a half hours later, \u003Cem\u003ERama 6\u003C/em\u003E left Minmus behind (or vice versa) and began the long fall towards Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Bvp1SDw.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bvp1SDw.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220wJFlS3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0wJFlS3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo days out, two days back.

Kerbin swelled in the windows.

This one was much shorter and sharper than that long gentle glide, pressing the crew firmly into their seats as the capsule punched a fiery hole in the atmosphere. But soon the pressure eased, the sheath of flame faded, radio contact was reestablished and the chutes deployed. \u003Cem\u003ERama 6\u003C/em\u003E splashed down in mid-ocean just short of four days and nine hours after blast-off - yet another record for the program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BZfV7Br.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BZfV7Br.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETO BE CONTINUED...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-11T14:10:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2017 02:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Commander Zoom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emoved images from Photobucket to Imgur\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T11:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EINTERLUDE: BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe achievements of the space program left most kerbals simultaneously in awe and eager to see what they\u0027d do next. John F. Kerman handily won re-election to another term, his campaign marred only by a bizarre incident in which a lone kerbal ran up and - for reasons that would be speculated about for years - tried to hit him with a pie. But there were still those who complained about the expense of the program, and wanted to know why it should continue, now that its goals had been accomplished. Hadn\u0027t kerbals been to both moons, one of them twice? What else was there to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientists had plenty of ideas, though some were hard to explain to the public. Both the kerbonauts and their bosses were eager to press on and not lose momentum (or funding). But the grand visions of the mission planners faced a stumbling block in the form of a basic and apparently inescapable fact of celestial mechanics: it would take months for transfer windows to open to other planets, and months more for the probes now being designed to travel to those planets and report back. And then months \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E to design and build craft that could take kerbals there and return them to Kerbin, across distances that made even the just-completed mission to Minmus seem like a walk to the corner store. All of that added up to years. What to do to fill up all of that time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer, as with so many things, would come in three parts. And it would be sold to the public as their past and continued investment in space paying dividends that they could see and enjoy in their everyday lives, as well as an ongoing string of accomplishments to be proud of and keep interest in the program up... a chance for the kerbal race as a whole to slow down a little and catch their breath, before going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin Station 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E: An Outpost on the Edge of Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first it was just \u0022the Station\u0022, with no need to be more specific. The natural extension of the early docking experiments - just on a much, much larger scale - it would serve as an orbiting science lab, a way-station for other spacecraft, and the first long-term settlement in space.

The program, short on boosters during the early stage of the transition (see next section), elected to launch these relatively light components on a few extra Orbiters that had been ordered and built, then left to rust in Jeb\u0027s junkyard when \u003Cem\u003EKrishna\u003C/em\u003E was cancelled in favor of \u003Cem\u003ERama\u003C/em\u003E after only three missions. The original six SRBs were replaced with just three of the new double-length type, making the rocket simpler and easier to fly (if not much safer). The first power mast completed and launched was the central one, with only a few small solar panels and four radiothermal generators (RTGs). Once docked to the core, it provided steady, reliable power even when the station was in Kerbin\u0027s shadow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e98EpKx.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e98EpKx.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022avvb1WU.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/avvb1WU.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other two trusses, with their giant solar panels, were considerably heavier and there were delays in modifying the rocket to carry them; in the meantime, the station\u0027s docking and observation modules were launched. The latter had been fitted with a temporary small docking port, in the expectation that a Krishna pod would be on hand to transfer it to its permanent position opposite the former; lacking that, it was left attached to the power mast for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220WoV2XA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0WoV2XA.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h5IkGmD.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h5IkGmD.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the solar arrays were finally launched, it was on a rocket that (literally) stretched the Orbiter/Krishna design to its limit. The engineers, determined to make what they had work rather than give up and start over, kept adding struts and interstages until they had something that would, \u003Cem\u003Ein theory\u003C/em\u003E, make it into orbit. Hudwise and Kenkin were chosen for these white-knuckle flights (as Jeb was already on the station), and they performed admirably under the pressure; still, it was decided at the highest levels of the program that this was the last time those rockets would be used. (Not that they had any more of them anyway.) The cupola was moved to its proper spot, and the station was now fully powered. Hudwise and Kenkin remained aboard, while Bill and Jeb - the original \u003Cem\u003EKrishna\u003C/em\u003E kerbonauts - rode their capsules back down. \u0022Just like old times,\u0022 the latter fondly reminisced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Zcm4GOc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zcm4GOc.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ssZyy7a.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ssZyy7a.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pair would be going right back up, joined by regular third-seater Bob Kerman, on the next flight. The payload was two habitation modules on top of a \u0022Rama X\u0022; shortened, simplified and standardized, these were to be the ubiquitous utility craft of the program\u0027s next phase. This particular one would remain docked with the station as what program literature called a Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) and almost everyone referred to informally as a \u0022lifeboat\u0022; it would also serve as a \u0022tug\u0022, to help position modules, until a dedicated craft was available for that. A second, identical flight carrying two more hab modules was made by Harman, Dunny and Donfrey Kerman, the new official command crew, bringing the long-term capacity of the station to an even dozen. (While the station could hold at least half again that many, it wouldn\u0027t be very comfortable or, after a week or two, pleasant-smelling.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PxhPXXu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PxhPXXu.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FSqhDJd.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FSqhDJd.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother Rama X would be coming up with the station\u0027s final component, the science module. But that still left the station short one lifeboat for its final crew count. Rather than launching a Rama \u0022bare\u0022 (as would be done with future crew-relief flights, carrying three up and three back down), the engineers took this opportunity to send up a little something they\u0027d cobbled together in their off hours: a docking adapter, for connecting the now standard port to its smaller predecessor. (Not that the latter was expected to see much use in the future, but one never knows?) Rather than take up a space on the docking module, it was attached to the top of the mast. Camble, Sidbas and Danke Kerman joined the station crew at this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CCpuHp7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CCpuHp7.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther delays with the science module and the need to bring Jeb and his crew home (so that they could begin training for their next mission, and stop crowding Harman et al) led to another \u0022hindsight flight\u0022. The engineers had been looking at the design of the station\u0027s docking module and decided to add an extension to move it further out from the main axis of the station, in the process adding more fuel tanks so that ferry pilots could top up their own.

this was quickly built into one of the other two ships that would be sent along to the red planet (everything in threes, remember?) and broken up for parts on arrival.\u00A0 Everything was launched and assembled on the 22nd and 23rd, and on Christmas Eve, I sent the First Duna Expedition on its way.\u00A0 Thanks to the magic of time acceleration, they would arrive late on Christmas Day (after I\u0027d spent the first part wrangling Janets into orbits around the Joolian moons).\u00A0 Actually landing would have to wait until the 26th, after I\u0027d fired off the mini-rovers attached to \u003Cem\u003EVishnu\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s sides like limpets... but land they did, just before midnight my time.\u00A0 And Tre Kerman was, for me, the first kerbal on Duna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that promise kept, the rest of 2013 was spent bringing down the Duna rover next to the hab and lander, adjusting the Janets\u0027 orbits for better mapping, etc.\u00A0 The start of the new year saw a kerbal landing on Ike, some additions to the Mun base, and the space station finally getting a proper science (lab) module.\u00A0 Then KSP would be put away again, until the spring, when the Duna crew took their rover on some very long drives - halfway around the planet (and back) and to both poles.\u00A0 June saw the launch of an even bigger mission to Jool - three ships \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E three tankers, plus a couple of small \u0022afterthought\u0022 rockets trailing in their wake, with some useful items I\u0027d thought of too late - as well as improvements in imaging technology (SCANsat) and thus a new set of probes, sent in pairs to (almost) every planet and moon in the system... and then, in July, version .24 brought money into the equation.\u00A0 Once again I was able to convert my save (to the aforementioned \u0022Science\u0022 mode) and update my mods, but it was becoming clear that it was only a matter of time before an update broke my game for good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill I pressed on, hitting all the biomes and anomalies on the Mun and Minmus for maximum Science (putting another small station in Minmus orbit in the process), then trying my hand at asteroid intercepts.\u00A0 I managed to capture a fine pair of class Ds and wrestle them both into an 500km equatorial orbit of Kerbin, bringing them together and (this is the crazy part) trying to connect them.\u00A0 It worked, sort of, but the connection was never as rigid as I wanted, even with a whole forest of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E struts; KSP physics just don\u0027t work that way.\u00A0 Still, I had to try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion .25 came out in October 2014, and as I feared, changed too many important things, including parts used in in-flight craft.\u00A0 Rather than try to fix it, I called a version freeze at .24.2 and carried on in another (non-Steam) directory.\u00A0 I\u0027d finish out the Jool mission, then wrap things up and start again with whatever version was then current.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsteroid wrangling lost its appeal toward the end of the year (in part because I realized that because of the constant spawns, I could never be \u0022done\u0022), and I went back to focusing on my kerbaled missions - making mid-course corrections for the ships bound for Jool, and then preparing a mission to Eve.\u00A0 The latter was thoroughly documented, in order to qualify for the \u0022Eve Rocks\u0022 challenge, and featured a permanent orbital outpost (staffed by two kerbals, with provisions for more) as well as a one-kerbal lander.\u00A0 A similar station would be sent to Duna along with the imminent Second Expedition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe First Expedition made the most of their remaining time on Duna, driving all the way around just to make it official, before returning to the orbiting \u003Cem\u003EVeda 1\u003C/em\u003E and burning for home in mid-February.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EVeda 2\u003C/em\u003E was on its way to Jool, and \u003Cem\u003EVeda 3\u003C/em\u003E - last of the trio - was taking shape in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Due to tweaks and revisions along the way, seeing what worked and what didn\u0027t, none of the three interplanetary vessels were alike; \u003Cem\u003EVeda 2\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003E3\u003C/em\u003E had centrifuges built by different contractors (PorkJet and RoverDude), while \u003Cem\u003EVeda 1\u003C/em\u003E had no centrifuge at all and a much different engine module which clustered its four LV-Ns together rather than putting them on outriggers.\u00A0 (The latter configuration proved much easier to launch, stack... pretty much everything, really.)\u00A0 The first and the last would cross paths, somewhere in the endless night, in March. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut first, there was the small matter of getting two kerbals to Eve, assembling a station in her orbit, and landing one in that seductive purple hell - and then (this is the important part) getting him safely back into orbit.\u00A0 This task, plus a side trip to Gilly, occupied the rest of February.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarch 2015 marked two significant achievements for the program, but one - the triumphant return of the First Duna Expedition - eclipsed the other, the long-awaited arrival of a Janet at lonely Eeloo, in the eyes of the public.\u00A0 Still, it made the scientists happy, and me too.\u00A0 I could officially say, \u0022I\u0027ve been everywhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond Duna arrived in mid-April and landed without much fuss, requiring only a short hop (using the same lander, refueled and with chutes repacked) to deliver an additional hab module to the base site.\u00A0 This, plus inflatable greenhouses and living/work spaces by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E, would make their stay on the red planet more comfortable.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t do as much with them as I did with the previous expedition, but they did get to drive to the top of (and name) some mountains, and visit that unmissable tourist attraction, the Face.\u00A0 Meanwhile, the ladies of Duna Station (okay, no female kerbonauts in .24, but if Brotoro could do it, I could pretend) made a return visit to Ike and tried out the PackRat rover; it worked okay, but flipped \u003Cem\u003Econstantly\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 At least it was almost as easy to set upright again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that carried me through May and June, and then it was July... or Jool-y, maybe.\u00A0 Ships started arriving, making the harrowing passage through the upper atmosphere and swinging out to rendezvous above Laythe.\u00A0 First was the core of what would become Laythe Station, then \u003Cem\u003EVeda 2\u003C/em\u003E itself, and then the \u0027misc\u0027 ship carrying the Laythe lander and other pieces.\u00A0 In the midst of all of this, and popping off probes, I got a reminder that it was time to dispatch the tiny uppermost stage of the Eve lander - now repurposed as a sample return capsule - for Kerbin.\u00A0 Then it was back to the jolly green giant and its ocean moon.\u00A0 Exciting times!\u00A0 Assembly of Laythe Station (in the first of many configurations over its life) was finally finished on the morning of the 4th, and I took a well-deserved rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA month later, in August, I came back to Laythe.\u00A0 First were the rovers for its few spots of solid ground (and one more probe aimed to splash down in the seas); I even managed to land two on the ice caps.\u00A0 When one found a likely-looking beach, I sent down the lander - another first for Jeb.\u00A0 They spent a day and a night on the surface before lifting off and docking with the station again.\u00A0 About this time, I was starting to have concerns about my fuel margin; looking at what was left after sending all of this hardware out here, I wasn\u0027t sure I had enough to visit all the other moons \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E get the boys home safe.\u00A0 (And this was .24, so I couldn\u0027t make more.)\u00A0 At one point, I thought I\u0027d have to use the return fuel to complete the mission, and launch another set of tankers at the next transfer window from Kerbin.\u00A0 But that turned out to not be necessary after all, for a couple of reasons...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiguring I\u0027d use the fuel I had now and worry about it later, I sent two of the other kerbonauts out to Vall and Tylo, and then perhaps (with in-flight refueling) to Bop and Pol.\u00A0 The Vall landing (in September-October) went fine; then several things happened which I hadn\u0027t planned for.\u00A0 First, while I\u0027d tested the Laythe lander (again, in the \u0022simulator\u0022), I\u0027d just assumed that the Bug-series lander/shuttle could make a safe landing on Tylo and return, perhaps with the use of a spare \u0022orange Jumbo\u0022 tank as a crasher stage and fuel source for the descent.\u00A0 But my attempts to soft-land a rover showed me what I was dealing with, and a quick round of \u0022sims\u0022 with every combination of lander and tank I had on hand convinced me there was just no way: nothing I\u0027d brought had enough fuel and/or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Tylo had beaten me.\u00A0 I\u0027d need to return with a purpose-built craft (not that I was going to).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiving up on Tylo, they moved on to Bop... and found you-know-what.\u00A0 (Just a few days before Halloween!)\u00A0 And there the story took a sharp turn in my head, because I figured that it was enough to drive both of them slightly \u003Cem\u003Einsane\u003C/em\u003E - things kerbals were not meant to know, and all that.\u00A0 So much for my optimistic tale of conquering space!\u00A0 They took off and rushed back to Laythe (in part because I\u0027d realized it was actually a lot easier to go back there, refuel, and then make an entirely separate burn for Pol rather than get there direct from Bop; inclined orbits are a pain).\u00A0 My unflappable pilot had to ditch an empty (and technically superfluous, but still expensive!) Vishnu in order to complete the aerocapture safely, and the scientist was a good candidate for a rubber room.\u00A0 None of this was according to plan, but once the idea got in there, I couldn\u0027t shake it.\u00A0 I blame all the other stories where things go horribly wrong on these long missions, usually near Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkipping forward to December 2015.\u00A0 The return fuel is (finally) almost here, I\u0027ve run the numbers again and I do have enough (barely) to send Jeb and a plus-one out to Pol to tick off that box before going home.\u00A0 (Not landing on Tylo saved a lot.)\u00A0 So they do that, and come back.\u00A0 And then I decide that the poor crazy scientist should go out the airlock.\u00A0 Without a suit.\u00A0 (Major bummer all around, but that\u0027s where the story wanted to go.)\u00A0 So I send him out on EVA, terminate the flight, and... I see he\u0027s back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, on the roster, ready to fly.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat the hell?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 I am now thoroughly weirded out.\u00A0 Quick rewrite: he \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E wearing a suit.\u00A0 And then, he just vanished.\u00A0 They\u0027ll find out when they get home... which will be sooner rather than later, because Jeb has had \u003Cem\u003Eenough\u003C/em\u003E and as soon as \u003Cem\u003EVeda 2\u003C/em\u003E is filled up, he\u0027s taking the (not perfectly optimal, but close enough) return window and getting \u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E of there with his (remaining) people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings us to the present.\u00A0 I\u0027ve spent the last few days bringing both Second Duna and First Jool home, shuttling their crews down to the surface and leaving all three \u003Cem\u003EVedas\u003C/em\u003E in orbit.\u00A0 If this save was continuing, they\u0027d be used again; as it stands, they make nice museum pieces (and lessons for next time).\u00A0 Same for the satellites, the stations, the bases... and of course, the flags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe save will be archived, backed up, along with the game itself and all the mods I\u0027ve used.\u00A0 If I ever need or want to, I can reopen and revisit it.\u00A0 But for now, I have albums full of screenshots, my memories... and this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do in 1.05, 1.1 and beyond; by most accounts, it\u0027s an almost entirely new game.\u00A0 I\u0027ll have to (re)learn a lot, including all of career mode.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever find the time and interest to undertake anything so \u003Cem\u003Eambitious\u003C/em\u003E again.\u00A0 But whatever may happen, I\u0027m glad and I\u0027m proud that I did -
