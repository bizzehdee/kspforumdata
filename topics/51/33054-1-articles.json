More solar panels to account for the weaker sunlight, an additional engine, making it a quadrion satellite. To keep the weight low I scrapped all but one \u0027emergency\u0027 tank, but those extra gigantors make up for it by being able to thrust at/near 100% with the ions continually. It went to jool ok and is orbiting the big hunk itself, except for the retrograde orbit and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi41.tinypic.com/dp7kg5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dp7kg5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi39.tinypic.com/b65vud.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b65vud.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi39.tinypic.com/2q3uiht.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222q3uiht.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy deep space splitter multi-probe from the spacecraft exchange (With craft. file go get it and give some feedback!): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35878-MLAS-Presents-The-Deep-Space-Splitter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35878-MLAS-Presents-The-Deep-Space-Splitter\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with the big cheese out of the way time for the moons.. I decided to send a series of small Ion probes to each moon of jool, sending a quadrion satellite for each one would be grueling, have to do a jool mission 5 times over. So I went and made a single ship containing a cluster of probes, and these small, light, and awesome little probes that could were born. Also when designing the transfer stage, I noticed being tall made your rocket unstable, and I did not want to sacrifice fuel, so I came up with the weird middle bit, only as tall as a FL-t200, but with 4x the capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese probes are specifically engineered for a trip to jool, one for each moon. Carrying two gigantor solar panels to make up for the half strength of the sun at jool, even then able to burn a 100% with no charge loss in correct position. Has Plenty of xenon gas for maneuvers, an avionics package for looks-with the bonus of flight assistance (.2t lighter than a small cone too!), and four batteries that keep through the night. However they can be modified for closer worlds by taking off the extra solar panel and replacing it with some other part that will be of use, or adding very light parts such as communotrons, dishes, or other useful small mod parts. They can also be mass deployed and heavily cover a single body instead, or deployed on your voyage and hit other planets as well. Their biggest advantage is the small weight and parts count for the D\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC they offer. So small, they barely weigh down a ship... with subassembly, you could add one or more of them to your jool destined ship and have a free satellite(s). Or you could add even more to a ship that launches them by themselves and mass deploy two or three for each moon! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDestination arrival in chronological order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf curious the parking orbit of the main ship was between tylo and vall, but after conquering tylo, vall, and laythe, was soon to be found on a collision course with tylo after several orbits, and was moved between tylo and bop, farther away this time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETylo:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi40.tinypic.com/22lwef.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002222lwef.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVall: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi41.tinypic.com/33p7kn7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233p7kn7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaythe:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi43.tinypic.com/a2cfmd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a2cfmd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to prove that these Ion engines can stand up to the big boys, It can even save itself from a collision course, and even then it still didn\u0027t use up the first tank!
