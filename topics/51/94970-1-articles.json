After reading a rather ludicrous challenge about circumnavigating Kerbin by walking, the idea of a ground based circumnavigation began to appeal to me. There are so few things left to truly conquer in KSP and I had done most. Driving across a planet and the long-term challenge of all the things going wrong... appealed to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was already aware of a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66887-I%C2%B4m-circumnavigating-Kerbin-on-a-Rover-Completed-August-24-2014\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erover-based circumnavigation of Kerbin that was completed\u003C/a\u003E. Since everyone wants to be unique and do something no one else has, this left only a couple of choices for planets to drive around... Duna and Eve. Duna would be a unique challenge and it\u0027s in the back of my brain, but the grand challenge, one bigger and more daring that Kerbin? Eve... without a doubt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, it\u0027s stinking huge. There\u0027s roughly an extra million kilometers to drive across compared to Kerbin. It\u0027s gravity is on the verge of a black hole and trying to fly through it\u0027s atmosphere is like trying to cut a brick with a butter knife. Even thinking about doing this was proof of insanity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made several attempts a couple months back to design a vehicle capable of a ground based circumnavigation and ended up putting it on the back burner. Here\u0027s the problem I kept encountering. How do you create just one vehicle capable of driving around a planet that\u0027s just at home on land as it is on water yet able to drive millions of kilometers at warp speeds without things falling off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the gent who circumnavigated Kerbin, I wasn\u0027t going to be able to replace crashed vehicles. His basic rule was, no game saving. If he crashed, he flew another replacement vehicle out to it (He claims to have gone through some 70 Kerbals). On Kerbin, that\u0027s fine. On Eve, a replacement vehicle is a year away. Plus, when he needed to cross a body of water, he loaded his rover on a boat. Eve is too remote to send gobs of support vehicles. Mine, had to do it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I finally sat down and commited to it, I imposed some basic rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESelf-imposed rules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. No infinite power source. This means, no thermo-electrics, nukes or anything else that provided constant power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I wasn\u0027t going to restrict myself to stock. While I admire those that do things stock and many things I do stock as a challenge to myself, this was not going to be one. I wanted my Kerbals to ride in style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. One vehicle. Reloading saves was fine, but after the landing, no replacements. If something broke, it had to be fixed or the entire mission started over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I allowed myself one reconnaissance vehicle. Eve is vast and keeping pointed in the right direction would be a challenge. I decided to use one aerial recon vehicle to act as a \u0027target\u0027 to point the main rover towards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter days and days and days of testing, I finally settled on a design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present ... Walkabout\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Walkabout/Components.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Components.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWalkabout Description:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing you\u0027ll notice is... no wheels. I settled on some screw drives developed by Kerbal Foundries. Two things influenced this decision. First, I know Eve\u0027s terrain. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46323-The-Eve-Circumnavigation-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve been there\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s not exactly flat. One big thing the screw drives provided was length... It meant that if I ended up diving down a hill, provided I mounted them far enough forward, that I wasn\u0027t going to have the nose diving into the ground and exploding. The second thing was, they had HUGE ground clearance. For my planned method of flotation... that was a must have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, you\u0027ll notice I went with LLL for the main body parts. I liked the wide-based stance of the 2x1 parts and the ability to change the fuel tank into a Karbonite tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I am using Karbonite. This is more or less a test after using Kethane for years. But, it\u0027s not rocket fuel. It\u0027s purpose is to provide power via a roof mounted generator for when I felt like driving at night. The BIG drawback. Karbonite is damned heavy. Loading up that fuel tank adds another 13 tons to the vehicle. Yea, fully loaded, 35 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a few other basic parts, like batteries, a collection of solar panels and a small Karbonite drill. But the other major decision was KAS. Being able to fix and replace broken parts in the field was going to be essential. You\u0027ll notice 2 roof mounted KAS containers. I loaded them with a whole collection of goodies should things break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there you have the vehicle and the basic plan. Now, for the route. Since land based travel is typically safer than water, I chose a land-heavy route. Although this may be a bad choice, I decided to tackle the long boring trek across the vast desert first and save the challenging water crossings for last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Walkabout/Route.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Route.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may notice the word \u0027Target\u0027 on the map. Since avoiding that huge sea in the middle of Eve was going to end up saving me a lot of time, the northern point of that sea would be a waypoint I\u0027d need to hit. That would be the landing spot for the recon drone. From there, I could target it and head it\u0027s general direction and save a good bit of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... the design was complete, the testing was done and the route planned. I had 3 Scansats around Eve giving me some nice detailed maps that I could reference from the ground. The only thing left to commit myself to this lunacy... was to pull the trigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Walkabout/Launch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As I complete this self-imposed flagellation, I\u0027ll keep you apprised of the events unfolding)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- -

The first order of business was getting rid of the parachute module. While sounding simple, it was going to be the first critical part of this journey. Not only does it house a collection of parachutes but it\u0027s also a counterweight. Walkabout, surprisingly, has a very low center of gravity. This is actually nice as it has less of a tendency to flip over. But, it had the potential to cause problems during flight with it being off center. So, I added six tons of dead weight to the parachute module to bring the COG up a bit. And now, it was sitting on the roof and had to come off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attempted to do this gently. After decoupling it, I sent Kirke (he\u0027s a Captain ya know) up on the roof to try to push it off. And he jumped, and pushed and beat on it, without success. I even had him smash it a few times with his helmet, and we all know, Kerbal helmets are deadly weapons. It didn\u0027t budge. Finally, I resorted to plan-B. The least desirable one. I turned Walkabout sideways to the hill and shook it. Having 6\u002B tons rolling around on the roof wasn\u0027t my first choice but... it worked. It finally rolled off without becoming a loose cannon. While he was up there, Kirke decided to go ahead and remove all the radial parachutes from Walkabout since we wouldn\u0027t need them any more. You know, part saving, weight saving... etc. He thinks someone back at the VAB coated them with grease. As soon as he grabbed them, they slid out of his hands, fell to the ground and promptly exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys crawled to the top of the nearby hill and planted our Day 0 flag. They named the spot Walkabout Hill. They turned West and began the long journey across the desert. They didn\u0027t make it 10km before they made their first scientific discovery. They\u0027ve tentatively named them \u0027Shiney Spots.\u0027 Now this is a real mystery. They\u0027re bright spots on the ground. But, they don\u0027t appear until we drive over them. Bob, the science guy, wanted a sample so he got out. Here\u0027s where it gets strange... once he left Walkabout, he couldn\u0027t see them. But, those still in Walkabout could. We directed him to the spot where it was and he planted a flag just in case we wanted to come back later and study it. He got back aboard and we headed west again. More strangeness. Exactly SIX kilometers later, another one appeared! Again, Bob got out but couldn\u0027t see it. So, we directed him to the spot and he planted another flag. We did this four times and every time, the Shiney Spots were exactly 6 km apart. It was at that point that Kirke suggested it might be monsters living under the sand and if Bob kept jabbing them with flag poles, he was going to end up poking one in the eye and get eaten. We left the Shiney Spots alone after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys managed to make a couple hundred kilometers and just before we stopped for the night, we found a small lake. We decide now would be as good time as any to test the hydrofoil system by crossing it.

Don\u0027t ask me why, but that\u0027s just one of my life experiences I can count on. I expected Kerbals, since I\u0027m inexorably tied to them, would have the same issue, three things going wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter we tested the hydrofoils and nothing fell off (don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m saving the pics of them working for when I actually cross a real body of water... assuming I get that far,) we did a visual inspection and found some... issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue 1:\u003C/strong\u003E It was discovered that whenever we quickly reversed direction that the forward screws would twist and bend and point about 10 degrees downward before coming straight again. Bill, the engineer for the mission took a look at things and suspected it was the lower suspension system flexing. As a patch job, he got on the roof, grabbed one of the KAS boxes full of spare parts, crawled under Walkabout and began trying to strap the undercarriage down. After he was done, we tested again and it was still flexing. After further study, Bill declared it an engineering flaw. Apparently, some genius back at the SPH decided that the gyroscopes in the cab just weren\u0027t enough and added an extra gyroscope module between the cab and the forward solar array. They then bolted the undercarriage to that gyro. Now, every time we quickly go from forward to reverse, that whole module flexes and bends and even points the cab downward. So, Bill undid his repairs, climbed on the roof and attempted to bolt the gyro to the forward solar compartment. While it didn\u0027t completely fix the problem it did help. Hopefully the whole forward end of Walkabout won\u0027t fall off now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue 2: \u003C/strong\u003EWhile crawling around under Walkabout, Bill noticed that the rear center hydrofoil was bent. Somewhere along the way, it had managed to shift a couple of degrees off true vertical and was now canted slightly with the top toward the port side. We did some background checking and as best as we can figure, this happened during landing. For now, it\u0027s nothing critical. That particular foil stays submerged while we\u0027re traveling by water. It\u0027s main purpose is to lift Wakabout up and above the surface. The hydrofoils on the side provide the actual stability, so it being off a few degrees is still acceptable. BUT, if it shifts any further it could cause issues later. And we still have a LONG way to go before we\u0027ll actually use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue 3:\u003C/strong\u003E Nothing else broke... yet. Ok, wait... there\u0027s supposed to be an issue three because that\u0027s how things work. Who\u0027s screwing with my Karma? Well, tomorrow will definitely fix that! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys packed up, planted a flag, called this spot Fixit Lake and continued to head west.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday we locked onto Target, our aerial drone at the first waypoint, and turned on Otto. Even though Target was still reading 55 degrees below the horizon, Otto aimed straight for it and we took off with a heading of around 325 degrees. The basic plan is to head north, around some highlands and then turn west toward Target. Jeb set the cruise control and the rest of the day, fortunately, was uneventful. I\u0027ll save a description of how Otto and the cruise control works for a day when nothing much happens... assuming there is a day when nothing much happens. Suffice it to say for now that the two together allow me to walk away from the drivers seat while still heading the right direction and moving forward. It\u0027s not perfect and I can\u0027t go watch a movie, but I can go grab some coffee without TOO much worry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy our best guess, we made around 300km today.

Here\u0027s how long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve equatorial radius: 700,000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve equatorial circumference: 4,398,229.7 m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAverage speed of Walkabout: 13 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimal circumnavigation Time: 338325.36 seconds / 5638.75 minutes / 93.9 HOURS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, assuming I don\u0027t use warp and assuming I can keep a perfectly straight path around Eve I was looking at 93.9 hours of holding down the \u0027W\u0027 key PLUS having to do some steering. I dunno about you guys but I occasionally feel the need to flip someone \u0027the bird\u0027 and I felt that doing so with a nub for a middle finger just wouldn\u0027t have the desired effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so first, I needed a way to hold down the \u0027W\u0027 key without sitting a rock on my keyboard. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.autohotkey.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAutohotkey\u003C/a\u003E to the rescue. This is an open source program that I tinkered with years ago when playing MMO\u0027s and I knew it worked. Next... I needed a script. While I\u0027m still playing around with other scripts, here\u0027s the one I use mostly because it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ENumPad1::HoldW()\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHoldW(){\u003Cbr\u003E    SendInput {w up}{w down}\u003Cbr\u003E    Loop\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        Sleep 100\u003Cbr\u003E        GetKeyState state, w\u003Cbr\u003E        if state = u\u003Cbr\u003E            return\u003Cbr\u003E        If GetKeyState(\u0022s\u0022)\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            SendInput {w up}\u003Cbr\u003E            return\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, as long as KSP is the focus, I hit the numpad 1 button and it holds down the \u0027W\u0027 key. When I hit the \u0027S\u0027 button, it releases it. I\u0027m sure you can see the advantage of doing this. (Note: If you decide to use this, Autohotkey must be run with Administrator Priviliges, otherwise, KSP doesn\u0027t even know it\u0027s there.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Otto, Squad to the rescue. Prior to .90, I would have had to use a mod. But now, with SAS being able to track a target, it\u0027s dead easy. I built a \u0027target drone\u0027 and flew it to Eve prior to launching Walkabout. I landed it at the first critical spot I\u0027d need to hit and then set it as the \u0027target\u0027 for Walkabout. Turn on the SAS, click the target icon and voila, I have an Otto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, before you think I can go do bed and let this thing drive itself, not so. First, we know for a fact that Eve is not flat. Second, I\u0027ve already found bodies of water that I\u0027ve had to avoid that aren\u0027t visible on any map. And finally, there\u0027s warp vectoring. When using physics warp, Walkabout tends to follow the lay of the land. It prefers to go straight up hill and straight down hill. Any time it\u0027s on the side of a hill, it vectors in the downhill direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Walkabout/vector.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vector.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is my Otto and Cruise on a hillside at warp 4.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even if I can get up and walk away, using physics warp while doing so is just begging for a disaster.

I guess the added gravity of Eve has magnified my bad Karma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it started off well enough and the boys left Fixit Lake with high hopes, it quickly changed at sunset. Walkabout has roof mounted solar panels that provide the power to turn the screws and run the SAS during the day. While they do keep up most of the time, when the sun gets low on the horizon, they start to wane a bit. There are four battery packs on Walkabout so it\u0027s not like we come to a screeching halt when the sun goes down. And we have the Karbonite generator sitting on the roof. But, the plan was to use it as little as possible. Instead, the forward and aft compartments on Walkabout are solar arrays. When needed, we could stop, open them up, throw a quick charge on the batteries and go a bit further. Well, that system is now crippled. When we tried to extend the forward panels, that nasty word \u0027broken\u0027 appeared and Bill declared them un-repairable. We did some research and found out exactly what happened. Apparently, when Kirke (he\u0027s a Captain ya know) was up on the roof removing the radial parachutes, he dropped one right on the solar array. Everyone glared at Kirke and his only response was... \u0022It was grease I tell you.\u0022 Since it\u0027s not a \u0027critical\u0027 system, we decide it wasn\u0027t worth it to backtrack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext came the anchor. For whatever reason, our nose mounted winch has become... well... flaccid. It started popping out of it\u0027s retracted spot and just dangling there. Now if it were just the winch connector, it would be no big deal. But, we had a massive anchor attached to that thing. Originally, we\u0027d planned on having the anchor in one of the cargo boxes, but we discovered whenever we warped, that the box would sink half way through the roof of Walkabout. It was decided that rather than have a potential explosion, we\u0027d just mount the anchor to the winch. Well, now it came loose and was flailing around, banging on the nose of Walkabout and we had a potential explosion. Again, Bill our engineer got out and attempted to put it back where it belonged. We even lowered the center hydrofoil so he could stand on it and then lifted him up like it was an elevator. But, every attempt to re-mount the anchor failed. And then... Bill dropped the anchor, at which point, it promptly exploded. Of course, Kirke thought this hilarious. Bill glared at him and said, \u0022grease.\u0022 Even though the winch keeps coming loose, it\u0027s not nearly as dangerous without the anchor attached. Let\u0027s just hope we don\u0027t need it, that\u0027s the only one we had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Shiney Spots continue to follow us at precise six kilometer intervals. We managed to stop right on top of one and it looked like beams of light were shooting through Walkabout. Kirke said the monsters probably had \u0027lazors\u0027 and were trying to burn their way into the hull. We kept going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe stopped once to let Jeb get on the roof and watch the sunset. He enjoyed this moment of serenity, and he\u0027d need it. Tomorrow would bring a disaster that could cripple the mission to the point of not being able to continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe drove on into the night running the generator for power and our best guess was, we made around 300km.

While this did give me 40 m/s speeds at 2/3 throttle, it created more problems that it was worth. First, warping became a massive challenge to keep the thing straight. Secondly, all that fuel increased the mass to over SIXTY tons (which is why it took 2/3 throttle). Third, trying to float 60 tons on water added up to a huge part count. And finally, when driving at night, the generator uses about 800 Karbonite to keep the screws alone powered. With all that Karbonite usage, I\u0027d be stopping every few hours to fill up. Instead, with warp 3, I\u0027m still at almost 40 m/s and 0 Karbonite usage (during daylight).

So, they kicked on the lights and began a night journey across Eve. Everything was going great, the Karbonite generator easily kept up with the demand and it looked like we\u0027d have more than enough fuel to drive all night. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then... things began to go horribly wrong. At first we noticed that the middle pair of screws was somehow getting off center. When Walkabout was designed, all of the screws were pointed in a nice straight line. That was no longer the case. Somehow, the middle screw was getting twisted. On the starboard side, the screw was pointing downward in the front while on the port side, it was pointing up. It wasn\u0027t too far off yet so we\u0027d managed to catch it early. Bill again, crawled under Walkabout for a looksee but couldn\u0027t even tell which part was actually bending. The only idea he had was that the Karbonite drill, which was mounted to the undercarriage for that pair of screws, was somehow banging against the underside of Walkabout and causing the misalignment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, the engineers back at SPH had the foresight to use the mini-drill. That meant, it was movable. Bill unbolted the drill and reattached it to the side of Walkabout. Hopefully, that would solve the problem and with any luck, the screws would come back into alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot so. The further we went, the worse it got. By the time we decided to stop and attempt a repair, the mid screws were canted a good 7 degrees. While Walkabout is fully capable of running on four screws, if these got any worse they\u0027d be digging into the ground, bringing us to a screeching halt. Bill had only three suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. We keep going and see how bad it gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. We attempt to break the screws off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. We use the winch now to try to straighten them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of these options were very appealing. We voted for option 3. Since this was going to put some serious torque on most every part of Walkabout, Bill insisted on an F5 before we even began. Nobody disagreed. He climbed on the roof and grabbed the magnet from the KAS box. Since he couldn\u0027t stick it directly to the screw, he attached it to the mounting hangar. We fired up the winch and began pulling... and the magnet popped off. We tried this a couple more times and the net result was no change before the magnet lost it\u0027s connection. Bill\u0027s response, \u0027moar boosters.\u0027 He put the magnet back in the box and grabbed a port connector. This time, he bolted it to the outside of the screw. We began pulling and this time, it didn\u0027t come detached. But, it began bending the cab of Walkabout as the tension got tighter. The screw refused to budge. Instead, the entire forward set of screws were bent out of alignment as well from all the winch torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill put the port connector back in the box, retracted the winch and stepped back inside. Grumbling in frustration he said this left us with options 1 or 2 and slammed his fist on the F9 button...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the lights came back on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe screws were straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill looked utterly baffled but after checking, the screws looked just like they did when they came off the SPH floor. All three pairs were in perfect alignment. Jeb declared him a genius and Kirke (he\u0027s a Captain ya know) said we\u0027d managed to dodge the Kraken. Nobody disagreed with either assessment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a sigh of relief, the boys settled in and we continued onward. But that relief would become worry again tomorrow. We checked on the misaligned hydrofoil... and it had shifted position again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve never seen a sunrise on Eve, it\u0027s amazing. Not only do you get treated to a green sky, you also get some other wonderful effects. The twinkling of rocks. While this occurs most everywhere, at sunrise on Eve, it seems intensified. Looking off into the distance at the dark purple hills, just as the sun comes up, you see hundreds of bright twinkling lights. Offset against the green sky, it\u0027s an amazing sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, you get the shadows of nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as the sun is coming up over the mountains, and if you\u0027re in a valley, dark shadows begin creeping across the valley floor. While a picture simply doesn\u0027t do this justice, we actually parked for a few minutes to watch these shadows moving across the ground as the sun came up. We all knew it was caused by rocks up on the hill but it made it no less amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe kept going well into the morning and finally stopped at a place Seanbles named Flying Rock Hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, we checked our progress... and then we broke out a calculator because something looked wrong. According to what we were seeing, we easily drove 800 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomorrow... we meet up with Target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I can offer no solid evidence of actually driving this far in one setting and I can sit here and give you lots of anecdotal \u0027proof\u0027 that it\u0027s possible, the two best sources of proof I have are math and my BTDT (Been There Done That).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWakabout averages 13 m/s. Uphill, it still holds 11-12 m/s depending on my physics warp. Downhill, it usually keeps to 15 m/s though I have had it up to 26 m/s. So let\u0027s assume first that I sit down for an 8 hour session of driving. 8 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds x 13 m/s = 374,400 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the past few days I\u0027ve been crawling around in the Eve lowlands and midlands. No huge hills and I\u0027ve been able to keep the physics warp at 3 most of the time with spurts of warp 4. It\u0027s been pretty easy running. Occasionally, when going uphill I have to drop down to warp 2 or 1 to let the screws gain some traction. So let\u0027s assume for now that I\u0027m averaging warp 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E374,400 m x warp 3 = 1,123,200 m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmmm wow... wait a minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an equatorial circumference of 4,398,229.7 m. That means that, purely theoretically, it\u0027s possible.. I say possible... to complete a circumnavigation at 13 m/s in 31.3 hours... at warp 3!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, I didn\u0027t do this math before setting out on this journey. I even informed the wife, not to expect to see me for a month or so as I\u0027d be driving across Eve (yea, she looked a bit confused).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow obviously, this number is well short of reality as terrain will influence the time it takes as well as the route I have to take to avoid various obstacles. But, 1,000 km definitely is doable in an 8-10 hour driving session.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so you\u0027re thinking, how utterly simple-minded must this guy be to sit and stare at a rover driving across Eve for 10 hours straight? I can only say this... it\u0027s INFINITELY more entertaining that watching reruns of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBonanza\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only \u0027hard\u0027 evidence I can present is the BTDT (Been There Done That) scanner of the roof of Walkabout. Primarily, I mounted it so I could access data from the Scansats without having to switch to them. One neat side benefit of this device, it tracks your movement and highlights a path in the mini map. If you look at the image with both of the maps up, you\u0027ll see on the mini map, one trail that starts from the west side of the map, heads north west and then west. That\u0027s the BTDT track of Walkabout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also note two trace dots just north of that large sea. That\u0027s where Target initially landed and where it is now. I turned it\u0027s BTDT on briefly when I landed and parked it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it. By my best estimates, in 3 days of driving, I\u0027ve now surpassed 1/4 of the distance around Eve. But trust me, I\u0027ve looked what\u0027s coming.

They got started shortly after sunrise and made only one pit stop along the way to watch some more shadows of nothing crawling around on the desert. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the issues we\u0027ve faced so far, continue to plague us. While the middle screws are remaining mostly straight, we can still see them getting slightly out of alignment over time. Bill\u0027s fist slamming on the F9 key seems to fix it each time. The winch keeps coming disconnected, though that\u0027s just a matter of retracting it again and Kirke\u0027s monsters are still trying to bore holes in Walkabout. And the hydrofoil... that\u0027s a different story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mentioned in day 1 that it was somehow off center. The mechanics behind it are quite simple. There\u0027s an Infernal Robotics piston that connects to the undercarriage and runs up and through the center of Walkabout. It allows us to lower the hydrofoil into the water and thus, raise Walkabout above it. It is becoming a serious concern. It\u0027s basically wallowing around inside it\u0027s mounting, constantly changing position, thus, twisting the foil. If you go back and look at the pictures from day 1, you\u0027ll see it sticking up through the roof in the midst of the solar panels. In one picture, it\u0027s sitting low and canted to the left, instead of being centered. Two pictures later, it\u0027s sticking up several hundred centimeters higher. Well now, it\u0027s mostly returned to a centered position but it\u0027s canted forward... and it\u0027s raised up significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is, Walkabout doesn\u0027t \u0027need\u0027 that foil. It has a total of six. While that one is really nice to have it\u0027s not essential to a water crossing. It\u0027ll just make the crossing a good bit slower. The big concern... corrupted saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, this was not a day to worry about engineering problems. This was a day to focus on Target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe popped over a hill and there sat Target on the beach where we left it well over a year ago. Target is a quad-Karbonite turboprop powered VTOL. Some of you may have noticed it\u0027s a 1.1 version. The original version only had two wings mounted horizontally opposed. While it few great, Eve has a way of sucking down anything that doesn\u0027t have a wide stance. Even though there was plenty of landing gear it still became top heavy enough that whenever we filled it with fuel, it would flop over. So, the engineers back at the SPH added two more wings, on top and bottom. Now, the only problem with it is all those landing gear tend to grab the ground when we take off. But, it\u0027s manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst order of business was to get it\u0027s engines restarted and warmed up. They\u0027d been sitting a long time. While we were there, we decided to refill Walkabout\u0027s Karbonite take. We\u0027d used up most of it in the previous nights travels and expected at least one more night run. Since Target has 2 drills, it would make the process a lot faster. So, we hooked the KAS winch up to it\u0027s connector port, transferred some fuel over to Walkabout and began drilling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that was finished, we took remote control of Target and began the process of relocating it. And that\u0027s when plans changed. If you look on the map of Eve, right on the equator is a massive crater lake with an island in the middle. We\u0027d seen images of this area and knew we could get around to the west side of it. So, we sat target down on the west side of that lake. But as we studied the map further, and with our engineering issues on our mind, a new plan developed. Just north of that massive crater is a smaller crater lake. To the north of that is a passage to the west, our intended direction. If we could skirt around to the north side of that crater, we\u0027d avoid a lot of mountain terrain and save a lot of time.

The piston for the rear hydrofoil has gotten worse, much worse, and it continues to wallow around in it\u0027s mounting. To add even more to that problem, the pistons for the rear side foils and a one of the front side foils has also began to shift positions. Again, we called on Bill our engineer to... fixit. Bill pretty much declared the piston a lost cause after only a brief attempt to fix it. He tried to attach struts to it and have it extend and retract. The struts broke. He tried anchoring the whole works to the ground while we used Walkabout to pull it straight... the struts broke. He even attempted to bolt a ground pylon to the foils and retract it upwards, hoping it would pull the piston downward. The pylon got sucked up inside the solar array doing nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, there\u0027s some really, really strange quantum physics going on inside those KAS boxes. Ground pylons are huge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the side foils, Bill had an idea of what might be causing the rear ones to get out of alignment, the solar panel array. He suspected those panels were banging against the pistons and knocking things askew. So, after demanding an F5, he started work on getting rid of those panels. I\u0027ll let the pictures tell that story... Let\u0027s just say, we did an F9 afterward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no hope of fixing things, Bill suggested we give Walkabout a bath. Perhaps all that jostling caused by the water would have some effect. Since we were going to have to make a water crossing, we really had no choice anyway. We pulled up to the river we needed to cross, extended the side foils and dove in. Walkabout floated just perfect. We turned on the screws, started lowering the bottom foils and... it took off like a jet ski... to the right. It seems the misaligned foils in the rear were causing it to turn hard to the right in the water. We turned back to the left and found that even though we had to do a lot of steering, it was at least manageable. One of the interesting parts of Walkabout\u0027s design, it\u0027s actually faster in the water than it is on land. As in, rip itself apart fast. In order to keep it in one piece, we have to adjust the depth of the center foils to keep the speed down. As long as we\u0027re under 20 m/s, it stays together. Anything over that and we\u0027d need a lot of glue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe made it across the river and... the rear piston was sitting lower, not where it should be, but not as bad as it had been. Bill was right. A bath did wonders for Walkabout. The side pistons were still out of whack but, again, there was nothing much we could do about that. Our only hope was that this beast held together for the rest of the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news, that trip was half way over now. At least according to our Scansat. We got really confused looking at the numbers. According to Scansat we started somewhere east of the 180 degree mark and headed west. We crossed the 180 line and the longitude started going down. Today, we passed the 0 degree mark and the numbers started going back up. Now, if you look at the orbital view of where we are...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt says day 4 ended at 39 north, 20 east... Today we ended at... get this... 31 north, 368 west... I knew Eve was huge but apparently, it\u0027s so large, they had to increase the number of degrees in a circle to accommodate it. I\u0027m not sure if Euclid would approve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe met up with target again at the isthmus that it had spotted (previous days pictures) and decided to call it a night.

The piston has become a major issue. Not only is the rear center one leaning left and right, it\u0027s now leaning forward and it continues to change vertical position. And, the rear side pistons have angled further downward as well. And now, one of the forward pistons has begun to shift positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concern isn\u0027t that we won\u0027t be able to make a water crossing. Walkabout is capable of floating on it\u0027s own but the side pistons regulate it\u0027s stability. Without out at least two opposing foils, it will eventually tip over. The concern is the effect they\u0027re having on the rest of Walkabout. Any time parts intrude into other parts and they get to wallowing around, strange physics begin to occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve already looked at the possibility of completely ripping out the rear center one. And while ripping the foil, the plate that holds the air intakes and even the piston itself is easily doable by running at speed and jamming it into the ground, ripping out the piston housing is a different matter. And with nothing solid to use for leverage, yanking out the side pistons... isn\u0027t going to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re at the point now that we have to run with all of the pistons, except the forward center one which is behaving, extended in order to keep them from banging into the sides of Walkabout. To make things even more painful, the two center screws continue to get misaligned, but not nearly as bad as before. But the only way to fix them seems to be Bill\u0027s miracle cure of F5 followed by bashing F9. But, each time we do, it seems the pistons get further out of alignment. We fix one thing and four more problems get worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill got out and, knowing before hand it would probably fail, attempted to coax the side foils back into alignment. He even left struts attached to the pistons as we drove along, hoping it would jostle them back into position.

And so is our travel distances. While I certainly wouldn\u0027t call these mountains unpassable, the steep grades are slowing progress down to warp 1 and 2.
