It\u0027s notable that there is a huge bump in production quality and plot over time, which is why there are a couple ways to read The Asteroid Sentinels.\n\n1. You can read the whole thing from Series 1. It\u0027s good if you want to know every bit in the story, but the current stories are quite different in format and plot from the first ones.\n\n2. You can also read from Series 5 with this *Star Wars*-style title crawl that summarizes the Series 1-4. (Series 5\u0027s format is quite similar to the current ones)\n\n**COMPANION THREADS**\n\n**[Self-Analysis and More on the Series (Read it after you\u0027ve read the series)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/158500-thoughts-and-ramblings-on-the-asteroid-sentinels-and-future-works/#comment-3009228)**\n\n**[The Many Ships of The Asteroid Sentinels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/158550-crafts-from-the-asteroid-sentinels-all-of-them-released/#comment-3007498)**\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmoHGrGucPA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[Read all of Series 2 here](http://imgur.com/a/8zdi6) (No Series 1, since it is all on this page, and some dialogue was on the forums itself.
