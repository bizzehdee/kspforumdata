I hope to use this space to share the accomplishments of the Kerbrazilian Space Agency. After playing many savegames, I decided to try and do one that is more or less long-term. I\u0027m playing career mode, starting on .23, and will try to update the thread with the highlights of the playthrough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not planning to post a description of every single mission, since that might end up quite boring.

The first few \u0022mission\u0022 were actually just tests of the Mk1 cockpit and the spacesuits, which I\u0027ve used to get all the science I could from KSP, the launchpad and the runway.

The first few were just tests of the ejection systems, structural integrity and the parachutes. With those I got science from the atmosphere and the shores. Then I started flying the space missions.
