The first is that the entire ship was built inline, meaning that in order for the lander to land the transfer stage (And it\u0027s remaining fuel) must be jettisoned. The second is that there is no decoupler between the Heat Shield on the lander and the fairing base meaning that in order to land the heat shield would have to be jettisoned early. Despite these issues Milzon, Burburry, and Roddan made their way into the lander. Philfort oriented the craft to allow a clean separation of the lander, which was then undocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vo1Qhed.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vo1Qhed.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzon fired up the transfer engine, burning a very small amount of fuel to put them on a sub-orbital trajectory.

Unfortunately there just wasn\u0027t enough science at Eeloo to give them the data they needed. Minmus, on the other hand, had one region that still hadn\u0027t been explored, and with recent advances in scientific technology it had been all but forgotten. Now it was time to go back. An aging spacecraft was pulled out of mothballs and readied for launch. It had been sitting abandoned in a corner since there really wasn\u0027t any use for it in the age of re-usability.

Since Minmus has such low gravity Ferby calculated that they had enough delta-V to be able to use the transfer stage as a de-orbit engine. Once they were in a stable orbit Philford began going over the landing data as Ferby and Nelgan made final adjustments and calculations.

The pointed the ship at Jool, a trip that had taken the previous crew several years to complete, and that Milzon hoped would take them a matter of hours. \u0022Retracting radiators.\u0022 he said. This was done as a precaution since no one knew exactly what the drive would do, since they were unable to test it on Kerbin like they had every other engine used in a ship. \u0022Stand by for jump in Three...Two...One...JUMP!\u0022 he said before activating the drive. This shot off towards the Cosmos, the occupants inside oblivious to the fact that they were moving, other than the large blue light that they seemed to be heading towards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/019fq6R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022019fq6R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xBLG7ho.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xBLG7ho.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CCVQZLU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CCVQZLU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Captain, we\u0027ve detected a warp signature coming from a nearby system. Should we investigate?\u0022 came a voice from over the captains right shoulder. \u0022Well then, let\u0027s pay them a visit. Helm, lay in a course, Warp 3.\u0022 came the reply before she stood up and looked out the view screen. \u0022Let\u0027s see what they are up to.\u0022 she said to herself as the ship continued on its way. As they got closer the Operations officer spoke up. \u0022We should be able to hide behind the 6th Planet. It\u0027s a Class J with enough magnetic interference that it should mask us from sensors.\u0022 he said as he looked expectantly at the captain for an answer. \u0022Do it. Helm, put us in a standard orbit around the planet.\u0022 she said simply before returning to her seat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y28wUy9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y28wUy9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0uj2MRR.png\u0022 alt=\u00220uj2MRR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile the \u003Cem\u003EArc Apollo\u003C/em\u003E continued on its journey. They approached the planet and once they had crossed the sphere of influence of the planet began correcting their orbit. \u0022Not bad for our first jump. Half an hour to get here.\u0022 Milzon commented once things had calmed down enough that they could take a breath. Suddenly Burburry pointed out the window. \u0022What\u0027s that?!\u0022 he shouted as a very large ship loomed into view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/urWE5gx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022urWE5gx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Capitan, I\u0027m detecting a ship. Unknown configuration. No weapons or shields. They are harmless.\u0022 the Tactical Officer chimed in. The Captain smiled and stood once more. \u0022Onscreen and Open a channel. This is Capitan Katheryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager, Please Respond.\u0022 she said confidently and evenly. Milzon and Burburry didn\u0027t know what to do. The transmission they had just received was in their own language, but it was a voice neither of them recognized. It wasn\u0027t coming from mission control, could their be other life in the universe? Milzon keyed the communication unit and replied. \u0022This is Milzon Kerman of the planet Kerbin. We come in peace.\u0022 he uttered nervously, remembering all the old horror movies he watched as a little Kerb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1gpYN6b.png\u0022 alt=\u00221gpYN6b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaptain Janeway smiled. \u0022So do we.
