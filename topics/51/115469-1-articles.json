It will be an attemt for level 3. I will warn you, I have included a lot of screenshots in imgur albums, due to time restrictions I only included discriptions on the most important ones (you can always PM me if I missed an important pic). Furthermore I advise you to listen to this song:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jha4OkG-ixw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n (over and over and over ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) as seeing the craft made me think about it, hence the name of the Mothership. Anyways, let\u0027s start with the mission.\n**First off, i\u0027ll answer these questions:**\n\n- Which game versions did you use?\n\n1.04\n\n- What mods did you use, if any?\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock, to easily find the transfer windows\n\n- How many Kerbals are on the mission?\n\n5, 1 for every moon (aka level 3)\n\n- How many launches was needed to start your mission from Kerbal?\n\n10: 1 main launch\n\n7 refuel launches (could have been less with a better pc)\n\n1 extra fuel modules\n\n1 to bring crew and an extra reentry pod\n\n- Did you needed a refueling mission?\n\nunfortunately yes, I did the whole mission without, but could not get the mothership in orbit around Kerbin anymore so I had to reload and send a refuel mission.\n\n- Did you bring a Living Quarter (Hitch-hiker\u0027s Storage) for the guys during the long journey?\n\nthere was 1 space plane passenger part for 4 kerbals, the last one sat in the command pod\n\n- Did you bring additional stuff like satellites, rovers, etc?\n\ndoes a SSTO for Laythe count? if so, yes.\n\n- Share the delta-V informations too, if you tracked it!\n\ndid not track it, did it all on luck, did not work out (needed refuel mission)\n\n- Any additional note or description?\n\nwill be told under the right places\n\n**Used crafts (for comparing purposes):** \n\n[http://imgur.com/a/6oX6n#0](http://imgur.com/a/6oX6n#0)\n\n**Assembly:**\n\nLaunch of the Mothership, called Big Poppa:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/pnHYF#0](http://imgur.com/a/pnHYF#0)\n\nRefuel launches:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/5Afse#0](http://imgur.com/a/5Afse#0)\n\nFinal Edits (Extra fuel tanks, crew and extra re-entry pod):\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/TKMMh#0](http://imgur.com/a/TKMMh#0)\n\n**Mission:**\n\nNow we have arrived at the actual mission\n\nKerbin to Jool transfer:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/JEsFN#0](http://imgur.com/a/JEsFN#0)\n\nTylo:\n\nFrom Jool Orbit I first wanted to do Tylo as that lander was the heaviest.\n\nI have a note about Tylo: After I arrived in Tylo orbit I stopped my play session, however between this session and the next one I played around in another save to test some new ideas (not even related). For this I installed Hyper edit as I did not want to spend too much time as I wanted that time to finish the Jool mission. When I wanted to deinstall Hyperedit I accidently deleted Kerbal Alarm Clock, I found out when I reviewed the screenshots of the session (I stopped after I had rendezvoused) and saw instead of my Kerbal Alarm Clock logo the Hyperedit one. I did not use it for the landing and return and deleted it immidiately after I found out. Luckily there are a lot of screenshots, but if you don\u0027t trust it I will post the craft file (I don\u0027t know how to do that yet, so then I will have to research it).\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/QHh6t#0\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/QHh6t#0\n\nLaythe:\n\nAfter Tylo I wanted to do Laythe as then I could get rid of the SSTO\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/PcbeZ#0](http://imgur.com/a/PcbeZ#0)\n\nVall:\n\nNext on the list is Vall as I didn\u0027t need the droptanks for Bop and Pol, but still used the same lander.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/knxWy#0](http://imgur.com/a/knxWy#0)\n\nPol:\n\nNext was Pol instead of Bop as Pol was in an easier orbit, and I was getting nervous about my left fuel\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/40jV7#0](http://imgur.com/a/40jV7#0)\n\nBop:\n\nI then went to Bop and surprisingly had enough fuel to do it and even return to Jool orbit.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/4R1nc#0](http://imgur.com/a/4R1nc#0)\n\nRefuel Mission:\n\nThen after trying to return to Kerbin I found out I did not have enough dV left, so I included a refueling mission.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/getnI#0](http://imgur.com/a/getnI#0)\n\nJool to Kerbin transfer and reentry:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/twWHM#0](http://imgur.com/a/twWHM#0)\n\nThat\u0027s it, I was quite happy about this achievement as it was the first real big mission I pulled of. The previous biggest one was landing on Duna and Ike in one mission ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).\n\nFeedback/ rep will be appriciated\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T12:29:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nigelvn**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T13:21:18Z","Content":"Well done! \n\nRegardless of design or approach the Jool challenge it a lot go work and effort - nice!\n\nI\u0027ve not attempted it myself yet, but have built a few crafts - your\u0027s are quite a build!"},{"CreatedByName":"LtWhiskers","CreatedById":140372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T17:23:27Z","Content":"Sweet ship!

Furthermore was the lander a bit overdesigned for those moons (as it also had to land/return from Vall) which allowed me to be less efficient with my fuel which in turn allowed me to manouvre a bit (this happened on Pol, I only saw on the last moment I landed on a slope, after which I had to burn to a flat area). Moreover I don\u0027t know for how long you played KSP, but after my 1000 hours I developed a sense of when to burn while landing in the dark ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI do agree that lights would have been fancier, but with the ridiculous part count of the mothership I did not want to try.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T22:11:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nigelvn**"}]}
