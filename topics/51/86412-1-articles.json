Well, I decided to go with custom settings, and went primarily ironman. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first casualty was Jeb, on his first flight. He made orbit, but there was a mishap, I forgot to put a decoupler between the capsule and the orbital module.... Thus, the ocean consumed the spacecraft which I could not quite slow down enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodbye, Jeb. You died for Science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, say goodbye to the casualties of your new space program in this thread!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisHale","CreatedById":116537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T06:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started an ironman too. On my Third launch to get to 22km I decided Jeb should take an EVA report in atmosphere so I bring myself to a halt and push him out the door... He went flying away from the capsule instead of hanging onto the ladder and I broke out into a cold sweat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know how but he bounced. I\u0027m sorry for your loss but as soon as I got Jeb home I vowed this would be an unmanned space program until I could build safeties.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T07:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I find rather cool is you can also go Ironman with Sandbox as well. All lost kerbins stay lost. Adds some nice flavor to that mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DevoidLight","CreatedById":60164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T07:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI emptied a pod on my rescue craft to complete a rescue mission, and after I launch it 20 km up I find that Jeb has somehow snuck back in. This was ironman, so rather than restart the mission, or even waste time landing and relaunching it, I instead opted to eject Jeb 30 km over the sea to make room for my target Kerbal.
