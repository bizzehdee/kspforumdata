Final ascent and circularization will be completed with the KR-2L stage.\n\nThe craft will then be fully refueled in LKO.\n\nInterplanetary transfer will be followed by one of two possibilities:\n\n- Optimal - direct aerocapture at Laythe.\n- Alternate - aerocapture at Jool followed by encounter with and aerocapture at Laythe.\n\nBoth spaceplanes detach and land on Laythe\u0027s surface. All experiments are performed. Flags are planted. Spaceplanes reorbit and rendezvous with JEM. Crew and all science transferred to JEM. Spaceplanes remain in Laythe orbit for possible future missions.\n\nJEM leaves Laythe and makes rendezvous with Tylo. Lander detaches from JEM and lands at Tylo. Science and flags. Reorbit, rendezvous, and docking. Outer stage of lander is detached during ascent from Tylo. Lander is refueled and 48-7S engines shut down since they are no longer needed.\n\nJEM leaves Tylo and enters Vall orbit. Undocking, landing, science, flags, reorbit, rendezvous, docking, and refueling.\n\nProcess repeated for Bop and Pol.\n\nFinal undocking and burn for home.\n\nAerocapture and land anywhere at all.\n\n--\n\nMods used: KER and Hyperedit for simulation/testing.\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure that this will be significant overkill for the mission, delta-v wise. I\u0027m hoping that there\u0027s nothing important I\u0027ve forgotten at this point.\n\nI was just about to post this when I realized I still have to add batteries to ensure those big reaction wheels have power.\n\nInput on the mission from the community is welcome.\n\nHappy landings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T21:00:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:00:29Z","Content":"I like! Looks nice and clean. You know, it almost looks like the top section could SSTO, or maybe get close with a bit of help: i.e. launch (vertically) with the turbojets of the two Laythe ships, transition to nuclears and the Rockos on the Tylo lander (they appear to be clear of obstructions and able to thrust) to reach orbit. Then you could do an orbital assembly to the transfer/Jool system maneuver stage, maybe save some mass and cost from the booster section. But certainly, this should work fine as-is."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:07:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You know, it almost looks like the top section could SSTO, or maybe get close with a bit of help: i.e. launch (vertically) with the turbojets of the two Laythe ships, transition to nuclears and the Rockos on the Tylo lander (they appear to be clear of obstructions and able to thrust) to reach orbit.

The 150 tonne mass of the upper section is much too heavy for the two turbojets alone, but you have provided some interesting food for thought.\n\nHappy landings!"}]}
