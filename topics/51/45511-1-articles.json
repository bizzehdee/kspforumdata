The next morning I woke up early, put a pot on, and sat down to redesign the thing before my child woke up. This is the end result, which had about 1km/s more delta-V and was a tad prettier because I hid the RTGs and landing lights behind the engines, and fixed some of the landing gear alignment issues I\u0027d seen. I also added parachutes for atmospheric landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TZZMIQh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TZZMIQh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then decided that 4km/s of Delta-V was enough to get to Duna, land, and get back into orbit, so I thought I\u0027d give that a try. I had a truck in orbit that I\u0027d used on a previous mission with plenty of fuel and RCS, so that would get me back to Kerbin. Filled with romantic images of rocket ships landing on mars, I motored off to Duna during the next transfer window. I set up an aerobrake at 10km, which turned out to be just a tad too low for the craft. Fortunately, I had enough room to burn the engines at full power for a good minute before the parachutes hit. The craft is just too tall to manage in a pinch, so I landed it on its side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M258Y3M.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M258Y3M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, here I was with three Kerbals to rescue and a craft still unproven. Why not Send another craft to get them? This time the aerobrake was perfect, and I set up a nice manual landing within 1.2km. Unfortunately I had no idea how to land this craft yet, so I ended up cratering most of the bottom half. The crew survived, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wiI9x9p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wiI9x9p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I had six kerbals to rescue. Well, the ROCKET SHIP could handle seven at a time, why not send it? NO PROBLEM! This time I quicksaved before landing, which I rarely do, because I was getting sick of sending crews to their potential doom in my attempts to figure out this craft. Three tries later I had her figured out: Full burn from 40km, drop throttle a bit once you hit 6km, once the chutes open full burn down to a gentle 2m/s landing. After that, it\u0027s all terrain (because of how tall the damn thing is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: On one of the tries I went for the screenshot button and accidentally pulled up my landing gear (which are bound to \u00221\u0022) and destroyed one of my engines. My wife had a good laugh at my expense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KbTQnSE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KbTQnSE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lQA2EUc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lQA2EUc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we were down I had Luke Kerman jetpack over to the ship, which took quite some time and was fairly dangerous at any reasonable speed (he took a good faceslide when he reached the ship). The ship was also low on fuel and I had doubts about getting to orbit. I needed a new plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pt7Vpf9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pt7Vpf9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I reached Duna, I lowered the payload to the surface using its own fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5rPKKS0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225rPKKS0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9XxDI72.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229XxDI72.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive seats, fuel, and ample KAS gear. Thankfully I had added KAS plugs onto the ROCKET SHIP so it could be refueled when needed. The first downed craft had a good supply of fuel left over, so I wasn\u0027t worried about how much I\u0027d be bringing down with me; so long as I could transfer it, I was good. Thus, this rover was a fairly reasonable 16 tons including its landing sled. I motored it over to the second craft, which was the furthest, and gathered up the Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nt1aD8A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nt1aD8A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then drove them to the first downed craft, gathered the two remaining Kerbals, and pumped all the filthy lucre out of the remaining tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hLnNn1C.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hLnNn1C.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MiuYjC8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MiuYjC8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VJe6luL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VJe6luL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more trek across the face of Duna and we were back at the functional ship with all Kerbals present and a full load of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/At9wfJN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022At9wfJN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6X3plDC.png\u0022 alt=\u00226X3plDC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe lifted off to rendezvous with the interplanetary truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ph7t0GT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ph7t0GT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI let MechJeb plan the rendezvous nodes and was pretty happy with them ... until the ROCKET SHIP ripped off all of the truck\u0027s solar panels on one side and also knocked out the wingtip RCS port. Sometimes you can be too precise... I\u0027m a pretty damn good docking pilot so I wasn\u0027t too worried.
