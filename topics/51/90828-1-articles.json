The Jool I was carrying the Habitation Modules up into Kerbin orbit, maneuvering was so difficult due to the fact that the Hitchhiker storage units doesn\u0027t have any form of control, and the fact that it was controlled by a tiny probe on the skycrane. I got a Duna encounter on my maneuver node and waited until I can burn. The mistake here was that I used pretty much the least efficient engine out there, the Rockomax Mainsail engines. I ran out of fuel, so I decided to use the skycrane to try and get it into a Duna encounter. It failed miserably, the engines don\u0027t seem to be doing anything (Not even a 1 m/s difference), after a while, the parts beneath the skycrane exploded, sending the skycrane flying towards Dres orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T18:45:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 06:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Potatus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Potatus","CreatedById":128362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T18:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI rethought this, I tried to make the parts lighter by removing the Skycrane and replacing the 3 Hitchhiker containment units with the 4 Mk 1-2 command pods.
