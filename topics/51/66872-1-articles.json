However, I was bought in back to the game by watching hilarious KSP videos(Danny\u0027s ARM video is one of them, obviously). So, I decided to start my save in a \u0027historical space advancement\u0027 storyline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI began roleplaying that my Space Program took place in the second most powerful country in Kerbin, the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://spore.wikia.com/wiki/Fiction%3AKerbin_Federation_of_Southern_States\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbin Federation of Southern States\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. Yes, that page was made by me. As you can see there, their enemy is the \u003Cem\u003EPeople\u0027s United Empire of Pandora\u003C/em\u003E, located on the extremely large continent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started with a simple probe parodying the Sputnik, the Stayputnik(wow, much originality, such good name). The ship consisted of a lifter and a small stage for interplanetary burns - fit with a probe core used to take the stage back to Kerbin - which hauled the Stayputnik probe, consisting of nothing more than the probe core, a small battery, two solar panels and a small antenna. It\u0027d be on Synchronous Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe was set into orbit with no major problems(other than the help of HyperEdit to actually place it in front of Concetia). The main difficulty was \u003Cem\u003Elanding\u003C/em\u003E the thing. I forgot to slap some parachutes in the lifter, and I missed the ocean entirely, so I had to land it softly or else a war would start. Not to mention I was landing in the Empire of Pandora\u0027s territory, to make matters worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately for me, I managed to safely land the mid-stage with no major casualties - in fact, it was very sharp, as I landed with only 1.36 Liquid Fuel left! Touchdown was at 9.8m/s with no landing legs, so I had to rely on the engine - and the SAS to keep it upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EHopefully the Empire won\u0027t mind me having to use their territory as a landing site...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T07:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course not!
