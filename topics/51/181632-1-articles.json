I don\u2019t think Intrepid(name of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u00A0could handle a trip to Eve and back. Could probably land, but then a difficult rescue mission would need to happen for the crew to not have a new home on Eve which I imagine wouldn\u2019t be too pleasant haha. I\u2019d preferably\u00A0have this be an exploration mission, but if anyone can think of any fun use for this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E I\u2019d\u00A0greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance! Oh, and once a mission is decided I promise I\u2019ll post results, success or failure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mars-Bound Hokie","CreatedById":192121,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-24T05:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you\u0027ve established that you can make it to Laythe and back with the Intrepid, you might want to return to Jool for some of the other moons.

Really like the work you\u2019ve done on Dres Mars-Bound Hokie, it\u2019s definitely an idea. I had imagined places like Dres, Eeloo, and Moho\u00A0to be nothing but lumps of rock but they\u2019re worth visiting it would seem. The biggest challenge for sure would be Moho. Before my last mission I had no clue how to execute gravity assists, but after realizing just how much fuel it would take to capture around Jool the old fashioned way, I started messing with maneuver nodes and got pretty good at using the moons to capture around Jool and ultimately get me to Laythe. Guess it\u2019s time I step it up and use planets this time instead of moons? I have an idea brewing about some kind of grand tour. \u00A0I could even kind of\u00A0include Eve if I put some kind of science probe in Intrepids cargo bay and drop it into the atmosphere. Maybe while I\u2019m using Eve for a gravity assist..?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I should have mentioned in my original post. I\u2019m using KSP Enhanced for Xbox one so I can\u2019t use mods at all. Not even for deltav or any of that which is upsetting considering my last game was on my MacBook and I had just figured out how to install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and everything that goes with that. \u00A0The only reason I even have the game on Xbox is because my computer decided to crash and it\u2019s the only way I can play. Stinks it\u2019s such an old version too.. 1.6 looks amazing I feel I\u2019m missing lots of good stuff (like deltav stats!!!)as I haven\u2019t played since 1.4 on computer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
