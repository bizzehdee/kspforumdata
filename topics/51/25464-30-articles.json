Hopefully that works well for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first longterm Laythe crew had FOUR kerbals: Thompbles, Kurt, Aldner, and Nelemy. They we part of my project to set up either longterm bases or extensive explorations of all the bodies of the Kerbol system (starting with Minmus, followed by the very interesting Jool system). That crew was planned to already have gone back to Kerbin a couple years ago, but the massive Kerbol-mega-flares threw off that schedule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou and Emilynn were the crew sent to do extensive exploration of Vall. That surface exploration was slated to be less than a year long, with reusable lander and rovers to be left at Vall for use by follow-on crews (but it was not planned that Vall would be continuously staffed). Their Vall mission was cut short by the Kerbol-mega-flares, and Hellou and Emilynn fled to Laythe. There they were incorporated into the now-extended Laythe mission of the first crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were also extensive exploration missions planned for Tylo, Bop, and Pol (like the Vall mission, these would not be permanent bases, but they would leave hardware in place that could be used by future explorers). Those missions got cancelled by the Kerbol-mega-flares. At least the aspect about sending out kerbals with the mission hardware was cancelled. But the mission hardware for the Tylo, Bop, and Pol explorations got sent out unmanned... and the original Laythe crew was given the choice of doing those missions before returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... Once the Kerbol magnetic activity returned to normal and the replacement Laythe crew was given the go-ahead to start their year-long trip to Laythe (six kerbals now en-route), the kerbals in the Jool system were also cleared to do the off-Laythe explorations. So, Hellou and Emilynn have returned to finish up their interrupted Vall mission, and Aldner and Nelemy went to explore Tylo. After maybe a half year of this, some or all of them will go on to explore Bop (that hardware, as well as the Pol hardware, will be arriving in the Jool system in several weeks, and will be maneuvered into place remotely by Thompbles and Kurt). Then some or all of the extended-Laythe-crew kerbals will stop to explore Pol for a few months before finally heading home to Kerbin (the replacement Laythe crew will have arrived at Laythe by then).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s somewhat confusing when there are several staggered payloads coming and going, and I have activities going on in the Jool system in the meantime (I don\u0027t just launch something to Jool and assume everyone is sitting on their hands while I zip through the year it takes for the payload to get there...because that would be thoroughly unrealistic). For example, after the Bop and Pol payloads arrive, there is the claw-based refueling equipment that will arrive in the following window (which Kurt will test out on Laythe), and THEN the replacement crew finally will arrive at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Over 200,000 thread views.
