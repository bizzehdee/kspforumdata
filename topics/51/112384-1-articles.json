My lander was the last piece to get into space. Sadly the lander alone took 20 parts so that left just 10 to get it into space and to my space station for refueling (150k circular orbit).\n\nLander was extremely un-aerodynamic and cost 21k to launch. I launched it un-maned, which is a good thing because it took 3 tries to get it to space and had no parachute. Docked with space station at 150k with 3% fuel left. Transferred to the Munar orbital station (28k circular orbit) and arrived with 22% fuel remaining. At this point I am down to 60k credits and cant afford to lose this lander (all orbital stations are low of fuel and will need resupply soon). I opt to take my pilot with retrograde hold down to the moon rather then a scientist. She lowers the orbit to 6.5k circular and executes a de-orbit maneuver above the the North East crater. She touches down at 4 m/s on a 15 degree slant which the lander handles beautifully, didn\u0027t even hint at tipping over. Still had a little more then 70% fuel remaining so if I had a scientist I could have hopped to another biome. Ran all the experiments, planted a flag, took a soil sample, crew report, and eva report. Launched into orbit and returned to the Munar space station where I transferred experiments to the return pod. loaded the pod with 15% fuel and burned for Kirbin. Did the most beautiful aerobrake at 35k which reduced ap to 45k which meant I was captured in a single pass.\n\nOutcomes\n\nYear 1 day 42\n\n100k for landing on the moon\n\n208 science plus reports and previous science left me at 258 total science to spend for some nice upgrades\n\nMy scientist got level one (which he didn\u0027t have for some reason.)\n\nStill have enough fuel on the station for 1 more Munar landing, just waiting for a mission that requires me to go down there.\n\nOnly failures of the mission\n\nTime warp hosed me on a rendezvous so I ended up wasting 2 days orbiting Mun playing catch up.

This time was rather ambitious and brought a scientist. Landed in the Munar canyons. came in high because of the surrounding mountains. Preformed the de-orbit maneuver at 6500m. Did not realize how much fuel I had burned. Did a hop to the munar midlands. Attempted to go back to Munar station and ran out of fuel about 1km away drifting away at 2 m/s.

I had put the new science lab in a polar orbit. Then wanted to get Bob out there so I sent him out in a command module trasnporter. Forgot that he needed to go to a polar orbit and forgot the orbit doesn\u0027t rotate with the moon. Half way to the moon I managed to adjust his orbit to make it polar but he had about an 80 degree inclination. Attempted a very eccentric inclination adjustment at the edge of the Munar SOI but ran low on fuel and his pa had dipped into the moon. Spent the remaining fuel to get Bob in a survivable orbit. After this feasco I had one more scientist to put into orbit with the station. Waited until the moon was at the right position and inserted my self into a beautiful matching orbit. Check the inclination...... 179 degrees ......... I had inserted turning the wrong way. Luckily this was a resupply vehicle as well so I have plenty of fuel for the 120 m/s delta-v required at AP. Dock at the station with a decent amount of fuel (not as much as I had hoped) and double my science output."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T13:27:26Z","Content":"Congratulations.

A resupply ship was sent to rescue Bob at a cost of 26k. Little does he know that will be coming out of his pay. I believe I discovered (for my self) you need power on both ships for docking ports to work. Bob was out of juice and I came in beautifully (maybe 20 degrees off) dead center at .2 m/s. Bobs ship went tumbling into space. Tried for 15-20 minutes to dock before I realized the docking ports were not working and it is probably due to power or lack there of. It was ok though the resupply ship had an empty command capsule. Bob just went on an EVA and left the dead ship behind. \n\nThe administration finally loosened their purse strings and approved funding of the new VAB. With the removal of the 30 part limitation it is time to upgrade our Munar Lander. Added Fly By Wire (FBW), a landing light, a battery, some extra boosters and control surfaces. Bob watched the whole thing via webcam at the MSS. Being the most junior on the MSS Bob called dibs on first ride. Launch, refuel, transfer, orbital alignment and final docking went without a hitch. Jeb was super excited about FBW as the ass hat who designed the MSS only gave it 6.56 e/s and 1500 total e. Pro tip 10 e/s and orbit period /3\\*5 total e are bare minimums. For example my 30 minute orbit requires 3000 total e. Boy was Jeb pissed when he found out that you could not target the Sun. He went on an EVA and kicked the FBW. After cooling down he realized you can target Muh which is close enough and gives all panels exposure. Once that was sorted out Bob decided it was time to test out the new features on the lander. He lowered his orbit and made an approach on the Munar Poles (North). Must have been 100 meters away from smacking a mountain at 500\u002Bm/s, but once he passed that the retrograde hold and landing light made his first landing trivial. His only issue was the light needed to be brighter as by the time he saw it on the ground 50 m/s would have been a crash. This was a worst case of a shadow landing. Next he hopped to the Polar Crater then then back to MSS. Bob sure does like to cut it close when he docked he only had 1.16/180 kg of liquid fuel left. Science from the mission topped off the data in the MPL at 497. Looks like those boys are going to be busy for a while. Bob took the duplicate reports back to Kirbin for 205 science and his first shiny star.\n\nThere was one debockle as the captain of our tourism division took off for a flyby of Minimus and left all his passengers on the launch pad. It was not a total lose has he did have some basic experiments to run and EVA reports to collect. He has been suspended without pay pending investigation as to whether any kerlcohol was involved. The NEW captain of tourism promptly left with all his passengers and sober as can be. The engineer(not bill) is now also under investigation as during ascension the pilot noticed the stages were all out of order.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T15:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nich**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:05:52Z","Content":"Well after loads of research it was more likely the port was bugged.... good to know for future reference anyways."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:12:33Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had ports get bugged as well, especially when I disconnect and reconnect or miss docking on the first go and have to try again.

You can land and take off reliably with a TWR (thrust to weight ratio) of about two. I\u0027m not sure what the minimum is, but a skilled pilot using the \u0022constant altitude\u0022 method can land on a TWR closer to 1. \n\nYour weight in kN is the mass of the ship in tons \\* the acceleration due to gravity in m/s2. Kerbin\u0027s is 9.81, Minmus is 0.491, Mun is 1.63.\n\nSo if you want to land on Minmus, a single LV-N engine (60kN thrust) is sufficient for a ship massing up to 60 tons: W= 60t\\*.491=29.5t, 60kN/29.5 = ~2. Around Kerbin that 60t ship will have a TWR of about 0.10. You may want a higher TWR for a comfortable transfer from LKO, or if you need the nuclear stage to circularize Kerbin orbit, but that\u0027s the basics of figuring out how much you need and how much is too much."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:32:45Z","Content":"For changing orbital parameters, you can go with TWR of 0.1, there really isn\u0027t need for more.

With the 140t limit i didn\u0027t have any budget to spare for a circulation stage. Hell I sent the thing up there with only 2/3 fuel and then seent up a refueling ship to top her off before the voyage. \n\nMost of my burns to the Mun and Minimus had been 1 minute 30 secondsish. I was rather surprised when the burn to minimus was 3 minutes 13 seconds. \n\nSo 4 engines is 60\\*4=240kn or 240 kg\\*m/s/s\n\ndelta v was 855 m/s\n\n855m/s / 193 s = A = 4.43 m/s/s\n\nF=MA\n\nso (240 kg \\*m/s/s) = F\n\nM = 240/4.43 = 54.175 kg which which means my ship only ways .054 tons?

Nice to know landing on minimus wont be an issue ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nOh and if the engine takes 1.53 kg/s \\* 4 \\* 193s then I burned 1181 kg of fuel which sounds about right but not right at the same time.

On MSS they were standing outside looking for something new to land on but everything in the orbit seems to have already been researched thoroughly. KSS had reached Minimus and is preparing and scouting for suitable landing locations. Science transmitted back to Kirbin from KSS paid for badly needed Tech to resupply KSS with more liquid fuel. Initial designs appear wobbly but Bill has some ideas Rescued more DAM pilots. Why do scientist never need rescuing? The administration wanted to land KSS on Minimus after some outside sources told them they have more then enough TWR to accomplish this however the engineers were quick to point out the lander and other pods had no way of docking in a gravity environment and would run out of fuel quickly. Finally engineers began development work on the First Munar Base however with out powered wheels this proves to be an interesting task.
