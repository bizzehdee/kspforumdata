If any kerbals tell you that you can buy fried space chicken there, they are not in any way associated with Goomblah Aerospace Industries and should be ignored.\n\nICT-01 Atlas\n\n![3240190.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240190.jpg)\n\nA heavy cargo carrier capable of hauling heavy loads into orbit around any planetary body closer than Jool.\n\nThis image shows it with two fuel shuttles docked, waiting to be released to land and get fuel from the miner(s) on Minmus.\n\n**Currently is helping set up a mining and refueling operation on Minmus.**\n\nMinmus Mining Lander\n\n![3240214.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240214.jpg)\n\nA small mining vehicle as part of the refueling operation on Minmus.\n\nMEaRL\n\n\u0022Minmus Exploration and Resource Lander\u0022\n\n![3240215.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240215.jpg)\n\nPart of an earlier attempt at a mining colony on Minmus, MEaRL performed the initial survey of Minmus to identify ideal landing sites.\n\nIt was originally intended to serve as a miner as well, but due to a design error (No ore tanks!) it is more or less useless at this point, though it is capable of ferrying Kerbals around.\n\n**Currently active as a shuttle to carry Kerbals to and from orbit above Minmus.**\n\n**Inactive:**\n\nMunar Refinery Module Mk. III\n\n![3240177.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240177.jpg)\n\nAn early miner design that is probably outdated and useless at this point, but I haven\u0027t terminated just in case I want to bring it online again. The two previous iterations, on the other hand...\n\nNomad\n\n![3240178.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240178.jpg)\n\nAnother early design; this one was supposed to be a light cargo hauler and orbital tug, with VTOL capabilities for planetary landings. It\u0027s pretty cool, but I don\u0027t really have a purpose for it, as it\u0027s a jack of all trades; KFC already has a smaller, more practical dedicated tug, and with Atlas around to take care of the heavy lifting, Nomad is abandoned on the Mun.\n\nMunar Rover Mk. III\n\n![3240176.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240176.jpg)\n\nThis is for whenever I get bored of launching rockets and just want to goof around in a rover for a bit. This version has an ion engine and some Puff engines for vertical flight, so it can clear pretty much any obstacle it runs into.\n\nDart Ion Transport\n\n![3240277.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3240277.jpg)\n\nDesigned as a pretty cool way to get someplace eventually, the Dart Ion Transport does not currently have any kind of function, due to its incredibly low TWR from only three ion engines. It can go fairly far (in theory), but you would get there faster using only RCS instead of the ions. It was cast out of its home at the KFC as a desperate measure to reduce local part count while the Atlas was being assembled at the station. Now that the Atlas is on the move and lag is back down to manageable levels, it could return to the station, except that I am far too lazy for that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T23:14:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Goomblah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:01:34Z","Content":"Testing how cargo bays respond to payloads clipping through them:\n\n![3242969.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3242969.jpg)\n\n![3242968.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3242968.jpg)\n\nNot very well, it seems."},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T01:43:55Z","Content":"Sent over a new lander and crew to replace the one lost in transit:\n\n![3243874.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3243874.jpg)\n\nI did it with a new cargo hauler with LVNs.

Six LVNs should carry it the rest of the way to Minmus after refueling in LKO. However, the fuel lines are poorly laid out and so fuel drains from the wrong tanks at the wrong time, so I couldn\u0027t even get it to orbit the first time I tried.\n\nI\u0027ve also been practicing flying SSTOs; this one (I haven\u0027t come up with a name yet, haha) can reach LKO super easily now that I know how to fly it; it can break the sound barrier and hit 1400m/s in a 45 degree climb, and is an impressive atmospheric flyer as well, with good maneuverability in atmo and a very high TWR and cruising altitude (it has more intakes than absolutely necessary, so it can maintain sufficient intake air at high altitudes). Of course, it can only deliver a single kerbal to space (and return via a clipped OKTO2), but it\u0027s fun and easy to fly.\n\n![3244718.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3244718.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T20:39:23Z","Content":"I sent some additional engine components over to Minmus to make the return journey from Minmus less annoying for my LV-N cargo hauler (now named the Heron).\n\n![3246612.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3246612.jpg)\n\nI added two more LV-Ns and a Rhino - way more thrust than is necessary, but I plan on using the Heron for my Jool mission, where it will be pulling a lot of stuff with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T21:12:09Z","Content":"You build some impress stuff!

Here\u0027s my planned mission profile:\n\n- Heron will carry a small SSTO for Laythe, some landers, rovers, and survey equipment, and a small orbital tug to aid in space station assembly. Atlas will follow shortly after in the same launch window, carrying mining equipment and space station parts. \n\n- Heron and Atlas will meet up at Bop, and will drop off one of two miners to begin refueling. Once they are refueled, they will move on to Laythe, the final destination for most of the mission\u0027s equipment.\n\n- Heron\u0027s survey module will undock and shift into a polar orbit to scan Laythe for a good landing and mining spot; once it has found a good site, Atlas will drop the other miner to the surface, and Heron will drop its landers and rovers to begin building a land base, using the SSTO to transfer crew if needed.\n\n- Atlas and Heron will also begin to assemble a space station around Laythe, using Heron\u0027s tug and Atlas\u0027 parts.\n\n- Having delivered their payloads, Heron and Atlas will return to Bop for refueling before making the return journey to Kerbin.\n\nI have no idea whether this will all work or not, so I am going to do a test run to Duna and back before heading for Jool.\n\nCurrently, the main items I still need for the mission are the base components, both for the space station and ground base, as well as the rovers. I just recently added a survey module to the Heron that can operate independently off of a Poodle, and the Heron has a small lander with a surface scanning module inside of its rear cargo bay. I can use the same type of mining equipment that I use on Minmus for Bop, and attach a few parachutes to the miner for Laythe. I do need to make sure that the SSTO can dock with the miner so it can refuel, but tweaking port heights shouldn\u0027t be too much of an issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:29:01Z","Content":"I\u0027m making some final revisions to the SSTO, now in its fifth version, seen here docked to the Heron\u0027s new survey module:\n\n![3248380.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3248380.jpg)\n\nSome screenshots from SSTO v3 testing, after a water landing:\n\n![3245620.jpg](http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3245620.jpg)\n\nThe nosecone was destroyed in the landing; I was using the fly-by-wire nose for some reason.

I\u0027m going to have to really start reducing graphics quality to get acceptable framerates...\n\nIn the meantime I will put the Heron in a higher orbit so it won\u0027t be rendered at the same time as the Atlas, which will reduce part counts to manageable levels in any one location, and reduce dV costs slightly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T01:01:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Goomblah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T19:18:08Z","Content":"This is so awesome!
