Unlike Laythe, Tylo has no atmosphere, which means all decelerations must come from the rocket. This results in a lander needing a high delta-v, calculated to be about 6200 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this specific landing situation, I designed a specialized 2-man lander with enough delta-v capability to perform the landing, and still have some left for orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadies and Gentlemen, I present to you the Prometheus TSAM (Tylo Surface Access Module), Mark II:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ssejW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
