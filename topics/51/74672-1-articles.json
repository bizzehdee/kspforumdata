Whatever was before career mode came out), all I was able to do then, and for many months after career mode came out, was play in sandbox. Even then I struggled building things that had enough juice and stability to get me to the Mun and Minmus (don\u0027t even think about other planets!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter having used Mechjeb a few times, I had a really good idea what needed to happen to get me to the Mun, and land there and such but I struggled a lot with insufficient builds and/or insufficient piloting skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would play in Career mode but it would only last a few hours before I would not be able to progress any further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo weeks ago or so I started watching Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest series and paying a whole lot more attention to what he was doing as he was doing it and all the sudden things clicked. I started a new Career save. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of last night I have now launched (w/o Mechjeb!) successful missions to both the Mun (1 manned, 1 probe) and Minmus (twice manned, 1 probe), have launched a \u0027satellite\u0027 on a polar orbit around Kerbin and another around the Mun... I even built my first successful (though a little unstable) plane, that I actually flew and was able to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, have started to assemble a space station at roughly 500km. So far I have two launches to it, one to put my \u0027habitation\u0027 module in orbit and a second run with the 3 person pod to deliver Jeb to his new temporary home and to try my hands at an unassisted rendezvous and docking. It took me a long time to meet with and dock the pod to the station, but I got it done! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up are some escape pods, a science processing module and fueling stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cruciblegaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-09_22-06-29-1024x640.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-06-09_22-06-29-1024x640.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using Kerbal Engineer, Chatterer, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Vanguard Parachute, Procedural Fairings and one of the Atmosphere enhancement mods to make Kerbin look better (Forget the name off hand)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aman608","CreatedById":100178,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T17:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, it only gets better from here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei used to use mechjeb but i have been able to master a hohmann transfer to the mun without using maneuvering nodes so ive actually moved far away from mechjeb and uninstalled it i\u0027m trying to learn how to do everything stock so i have to calculate the Delta-V myself (for me its more fun because its more of a challenge)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T17:13:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by aman608\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EERROR\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Peanut","CreatedById":82721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T23:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must have started around the same time as you, amusingly I have been to many of the planets but still have never successfully docked!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereccommend a trip to Duna or Eve.
