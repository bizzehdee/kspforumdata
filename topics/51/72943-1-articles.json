Here\u0027s the details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntares Colossus successfully lands on the mun and drains an entire kethane field in a single landing. She now carries 144 tons of Keth back to orbit to be turned into few. The TAC balancer lets her move new fuel from the conversion tank over to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrepping for Jool the Orion Cruiser is constructed in LKO. The center core runs on the Ultima Ultra heavy lift system. The design puts 500 tons or more of payload into orbit with a TWR of 4 off the launchpad and a low atmosphere profile. The cruiser required a side trip to Minmus to pick up science for Nuke rockets. The nuke drivers were built in the VAB and flown up to the Orion to dock on 4 plyons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future builds the Spacedock was launched into orbit. This 800 ton behemoth will carry extra fuel, kerbals, and rations with new greenhouses to make it a self sustaining station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-21T05:37:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2014 05:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Transits","CreatedById":104718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T06:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat, that is a very large ship. it\u0027s a really nice design too and the spacedock looks like a real \u0027city in space\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T15:29:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
