But let me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe has a M700 planet scanner. So I needed capture with AP under 1.25 Mm and PE over 25 km for the scan.\u00A0But I had just barely enough fuel. I did a 5 minute Terrier burn for about 3500 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, with PE initially at 10 km ASL. Due to the long burn, PE\u00A0dropped down to 460m AGL as it passed\u00A0the south pole. When the burn was done PE was -6454m ASL. The orbit went\u00A0directly from escaping to sub-orbital. It has an elliptical orbit with World\u0027s First only saying I have initiated a fly-by.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when\u00A0I push PE to 25 km it will have 13 m/s left. Thirteen!
