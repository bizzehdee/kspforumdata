The bad news is it\u0027s been all in a massive attempt to rescue Crew A from the surface of the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132038-mun-to-minmus-accidently/\u0022\u003EAs I mentioned in my report about Luna 10\u0027s mishaps\u003C/a\u003E, my next plan was to attempt to land two ships, Lunar 11 and lunar 12, on the Mun at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, upon landing, Lunar 11 came down at a bad angle and lost it\u0027s engine. I could have simply reverted, but no, I had to do the macho thing and try to rescue the Jeb, Bob and Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I attempted to land an Emergency Crew Return Vehicle (\u0022ECRV\u0022, an automatic version of my direct Assent lunar ship). I was able to drop the ECRV, with some considerable effort, about 12KM away from where Lunar 11 landed. I then spent about three days designing and testing some sort of rover develry system that would be able to get the boys from their stuck command module to the rescue ship. Each and every attempt ended in disaster. Then I decided to just have them walk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I realized how slow they moved, I had to make plan C.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nafter trial and error, I finally had something that world work. The \u0022ECRV Super Heavy\u0022, the same craft with a few tweaks, launched from the bigger and stronger Moho Six booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll said and done, with a massive amount of mid landing course corrections, my final landing... 1.6 KM\u00A0from Lunar 11! Walking distance! almost as good as Pete Conrad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002212717503_10206045297316430_9030087089953\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12717503_10206045297316430_9030087089953387606_n.jpg?oh=92201b64793e57f3505014fc42cc8871\u0026amp;oe=576B6F8E\u0022 style=\u0022width:838px;height:471px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I just need to get the crew to the other ship and off we go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T20:33:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KamenRiderzero1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KamenRiderzero1","CreatedById":158519,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T21:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLHJ9kkFsfk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
