After having a rough landing on Minmus, after landing and receiving the science, KSC pointed out there was no possible way to return with only 7.5 liters/gallons (I don\u0027t know the measurements) of liquid fuel. KSC Left Jeb on Minmus for 330 days! Returning to the mission after bill spotting a lander on a Minmus flyby. 2 Escape attempts were launched to try to get Jeb back to Kerbin. None worked because of KSP\u0027s top rocket builders being on break (Really I didn\u0027t calculate fuel correctly, but that works fine, I hope) KSP gave Jeb a shot at burning strait towards Kerbin in hopes of having part of the orbit in LKO and rescuing the rocket and Jeb when it flys by. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But sadly Explorer Mk2 ran out of electric charge and Jeb suffocated to death. An uncontrollable craft stuck in HKO was terminated by KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for no pictures and a very bad description of the mission report, this is my first post on the forums and I felt like sharing this mission really badly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T12:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoor Jebediah!
