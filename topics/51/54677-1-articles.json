However, I\u0027ve managed to actually build a Duna-capable rocket that may or may not work correctly... until a tragic accident happened. Sorry, but I took no pictures of this incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, we began in a Kerbal Multi Player server spending several hours building the rocket that we shall name \u003Cstrong\u003EDuna 1\u003C/strong\u003E. It has six liquid rocket boosters in Asparagus Staging format. On it, we have crew members Endon Kerman, Bill Kerman and Philboul Kerman. It was a midnight launch, but it was not a problem. The rocket launched and worked wonders towards the surface with it\u0027s exxagerated TWR of 2.26.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses Asparagus Staging, which means that it has Six liquid rocket boosters which crossfeed into each other. In this case, one LRB feeds into another, which feeds into another, which feeds into the main rocket. This basically makes it having two groups of three LRBs who perform Asparagus Staging, helping the main rocket to fire it\u0027s engines while never using it\u0027s own fuel fuel...until the LRBs do run out of fuel, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the rocket was pretty much ascending over Kerbin, and I jettisoned two of the six LRBs after those ran out of fuel. I began to perform a gravity turn at around 8400m, and after some time I went above 10000m. The LRBs continued doing their job boosting the rocket, until I noticed that the rocket\u0027s main engine and the lower fuel tank had RANDOMLY DISATTACHED. Argh. Thankfully I still had two LRBs doing their job and easily lifting the rocket, so I just jettisoned the two other LRBs who had recently ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards, I tried to use the two remaining Liquid Rocket Boosters to raise my Apoapsis up to 200km up in Kerbin, and, assuming they would run out of fuel by then, I\u0027d jettison them and use the middle stage(intended to perform the Kerbin-Duna transfer...but whatever) to circularize the orbit. The rest of this went nicely with no problem, so I just sat there using warp waiting for a Duna transfer window to open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, 48 days later a Duna window finally opened. Quick to not waste time, I set up a node to do the Duna transfer and pushed Prograde the furthest it can(I\u0027m surprised it didn\u0027t snapped out of the manuever node). I was expecting it not to give me a Duna encounter, so I was quite surprised when I saw \u0022Duna periapsis\u0022 on the map screen. I felt like throwing a party(except it would be a party with imaginary friends because I\u0027m a loner in real life). But of course, like everything in life there is a catch, and one of them was that my Duna periapsis was ~18,800,200m high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that wasn\u0027t a problem at all, because my rocket surely had enough fuel to circularize, right?... In reality, my entry was going to be an Aerobrake into Duna, so I wouldn\u0027t need to circularize unless I really wanted to, so all I had to do was to kick the Apoapsis into 15km. However...if you were observant, you\u0027d likely noticed that I said \u0022there is a catch, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eone of them\u003C/strong\u003E was that my Duna periapsis was at...\u0022. The second catch was the reason my mission went horribly wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how it happened myself, or when exactly, but while I was at Map view admirating my sucess, I noticed that the \u0027Resources\u0027 section wasn\u0027t displaying LiquidFuel and Oxidizer levels anymore. Curious, I pressed M to exit map view...and I saw that I had accidentally pressed space and ejected the pod from the main body! \u003Cstrong\u003EARGH!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...mission failed. Thankfully I used HyperEdit to transport the pod to Kerbin, so at least the poor Kerbalnauts didn\u0027t spend 48 days in space on a Mk1-2 Command Pod only to be stranded in there for the rest of their lives. I\u0027m not using HyperEdit to warp me to Duna because it would make that adventure not as fun. The worse thing is that KMP lacks F5/F9, so quicksave is not an option. Well...looks like KSP once again prevented me from going out from Kerbin system. Boy, it sure is desesperate to prevent me from going into other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoral of the story:\u003C/strong\u003E Use Alt\u002BL to lock stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T12:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a few more struts and a few less misclicks should get you out to Duna, so I\u0027d say you\u0027re pretty close!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T13:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FenrirWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FenrirWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESeems like a few more struts and a few less misclicks should get you out to Duna, so I\u0027d say you\u0027re pretty close!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, I was planning to add struts to the two fuel tanks to prevent the lower one from disattaching again, though it\u0027s pretty hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T23:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds to me like it\u0027s not having quicksave and quickload that\u0027s holding you back.

I pointed it straight up and down (as exactly as I could), and used the engine to slow it down on approach. As I get closer to the surface, I\u0027d follow the green x on the navball and try to push it to the center of the blue so that I\u0027d be coming in straight. But when I\u0027m on final approach, I have to concentrate on hovering and coming down gently. So I point it straight up and down again, and this time use RCS translation with IJKL to keep the craft from \u0022sliding\u0022 over the surface. This makes that level of control super easy, allowing me to focus my attention on the throttle. Now I just have to find the hover point where the velocity doesn\u0027t change--and what level of throttle that is goes down as the fuel depletes. So I get the lander coming in slower and slower as I get closer, till I see that shadow and can stop looking at the navball entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan also use RCS translation to adjust a bad landing spot into a good one. Just get your self hovering or descending slowly, then start translating in the direction of a nearby flat surface. Slow your horizontal velocity when you get over it, and then focus on bringing the rocket down.

Put on any landing gear you like. Under that put TR-18A decoupler, FL-T800 tank, LV-T30 Engine. Build a launcher capable of bringing that to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Use the lower stage for most of the descent or however long it lasts--you can use some of the fuel to bring yourself into a nice straight path down, then use the rest in a heavy burn starting at about 50km or so. Shoould slow you down real quick, and then you\u0027ll have plenty of fuel in the top stage to come in for a nice soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I give you this lesson not because I think you can\u0027t land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, but because I think these principles learned here could help on a Duna mission. It\u0027s a technique that has worked well for me, as I\u0027m a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of guy. Learning to interpret the nav ball, understanding orbital mechanics, that stuff is all extremely useful. But I still have to build rockets that I can fly, because I\u0027m not gonna use MechJeb to do it. Thus I get creative with the designs to solve problems I have in handling them. I\u0027ve actually gotten pretty good at landing on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, so I usually don\u0027t bother with RCS on landers.
