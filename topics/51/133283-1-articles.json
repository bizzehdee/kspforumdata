So I\u0027ve been playing the Little Green Men From Mars mod which is in essence RSS but without RO where the KSC has been moved to Mars. I\u0027ve been trying to land on Phobos and actually found it harder than I first thought but tonight I did it so I thought I would share with you Jeb\u0027s view of Mars from Phobos. I thought it was great when I switched on his helmet lights and saw his landers reflection in the visor \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope you enjoy the view......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222i89opl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/2i89opl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way the gravity is almost non-existent there so I dare not move too far or quick.
