After starting over again, I wanted to achieve landing on Mun and Minmus and have a manned rover available for transport. I ran into all sorts of problems trying to come up with a delivery system for the rover and still being able to land the craft. After browsing a bit on KSP\u0027s reddit and looking at the rover \u002B skycrane example craft I had an idea on how to achieve my goal. In the end I came up with the solution of attaching the rover upside down to the landing craft and attaching a skycrane to that. The crane itself supports the rover \u002B lander during the ascent to Kerbin orbit. Here\u0027s a mission summary (with pictures!) of how it worked out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun Mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/oL3e7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/oL3e7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus Mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/SCINz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/SCINz\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
