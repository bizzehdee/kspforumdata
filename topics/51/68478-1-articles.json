I have been fiddle faddling with KSP for about 3 months now, and have always been shortcame on interplanetary travel, all of my science came from the Mun and Minmus until now! I started using sandbox because I know how the game works, and I decided that I would finally stop waddling around with single rockets, and decided to create a rocket in space! Once I created the interplanetary rocket, composed of one lander, a tug, and an end cap, I set off for my destination; Duna, more importantly, Ike. I figured that landing on Duna would be a little bit out of my league at first, and decided, \u0022you know what, let\u0027s go to Ike.\u0022 So I launched at the correct planetary positions (that much I knew how to do) and set off for Duna, I snapped some pics leaving Kerbin, and during the flight for you guys I will probably insert them in this post. Once I got to Duna, I aerobreaked at about 20km into the atmosphere, and got into a capture. After fine tuning it, I dispatched two probes that I brought with me. Funny things: they didn\u0027t have enough electric charge to last them in their decent without solar panels, and half of the landing gears were upside down (FAIL). Brushing that aside, I set up a burn for my lander, after detaching it from the tug, and set out for Ike. After getting into orbit, (easy enough) I decended and landed on the surface, where they stayed for about a year waiting for the next planetary alignment to occur. Just before the alignment, I set off of Ike, the crew of 2 flew back to Low Duna Orbit, alongside the tug, and performed the rendezvous. Once that was complete, I set out for home, and after 2 whole years waiting, I used Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to slow me down, and dropped me into orbit. Once again a roadblock, SOMEONE forgot to pack parachutes! (I blame Jebediah!) So, I quickly built a craft, brought it into orbit, close to the Ike One, and transfered the crew via EVA. Then I simply deorbited the craft, and landed them safely at Sea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, I just couldnt help but post it because I am so happy I finally did something else I haven\u0027t done in KSP!
