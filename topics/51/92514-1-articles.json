The write up is over there. It was supposed to be just a test run, but since all seemed to be working we went ahead and launched. And in my opinion succeeded, without any F5/9 usage - however a glitch in what KER was telling me led me to have to turn on infinite fuel for the return burn from Eve to Kerbin. I hang my head in shame for not noticing that my return ship was consuming 2 or 3X the dV that it should have been, and for squandering what seemed to be a plethora of dV on lazy flying when I had more than enough despite the KER oddity (at least I had more than enough until way too late.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u002245ok6\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
