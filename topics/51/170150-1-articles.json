refused to take part in the first Mun landing after a heated argument over the naming of the mission. \u00A0After declaring that \u0022GL IV\u0022 was a \u0022boring and stupid name\u0022, Jeb proposed the call sign \u0022The Amazing Jeb and his Flying Caboodle\u0022. \u00A0Following an intervention from Mission Control, Jeb and the rest of the crew were replaced at the last minute with new

little more tentative than planned. \u00A0When playing on the PC, I relied on the Better Burn Time mod when on the final approach to a Munar touchdown. \u00A0I had taken the precaution of adding a probe core so the crew would have access to KerbNet, which gives the elevation of the ground below. \u00A0I\u0027m not sure if I added the wrong core, or if the crew where pressing all the wrong buttons, but they were unable to get the required data. \u00A0Thankfully the sight of the Landers shadow helped in the final descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a complete set of science experiments were conducted, samples taken and flag planted, it was time to head home. \u00A0Mindful of the lower then expected propellant margins, a parking orbit of 31km was established before the burns to leave the Mun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and finally to set Periapsis at 34km when re-entering Kerbins

does when changing from an orbital to a sub-orbital trajectory. \u00A0The crew quickly dropped out of \u0022time warp\u0022 and checked the map. \u00A0Sure enough, their trajectory was now sub-orbital and the fear at Mission Control was that they would either fry on re-entry or pass out from the high G loads. \u00A0The main Poodle\u2122 engine was fired for a few seconds as the last of the fuel and oxidiser was burnt, which resulted in a Periapsis of 11,000m. \u00A0Someone on the ground then realised that, as the Generic Lander was designed to dock with an orbital laboratory and only the docking port had been removed for this mission, the craft still had plenty of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant left. \u00A0They were therefore able to
