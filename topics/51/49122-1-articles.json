Between a half-dozen crew reports, an on-surface EVA, sample, one science bay, and two goos (one on the surface, one in orbit) I think I cleared about 430 in total. Added to the ~350 from Mun, and I was able to unlock a lot of what I consider to be essential tools for my upcoming Duna trip. It was really nice to have plenty of science points to work with, after the nickel-and-dime packets you\u0027d get for Kerbin accomplishments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, the design I took to Mun and Minmus is just about enough to make Duna as-is, so I don\u0027t need to do much more.
