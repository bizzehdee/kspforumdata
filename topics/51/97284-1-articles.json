For reference I play without mods, and this mission was done in sandbox mode in vanilla version 0.9.0.705.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for a while I\u0027ve been trying to send a manned return mission from Duna, to various amounts of success. My original attempts were based on the principle I use for munar missions, simply land everything you need to get off the planet on it\u0027s surface. Of course with Duna being decently large and rather far away this proved challenging. Though I did eventually succeed, the craft proved expensive and difficult to fly and land on Duna. With the money based career mode now ever present, this was now a greater concern than back when I started playing (this being done in sandbox was to figure out what I need when I get this far in the new career mode). So taking a queue from real life I decided to leave the main rockets in orbit around Duna, and only land what I needed. I present to you the Kira:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a fairly lithe 557 tonnes, 167 parts, and 306,000 dollars (?) this ship is reasonably achievable in career mode, and has proven easy to fly and efficient. The ship can be downloaded \u003Ca href=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Kira.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. She\u0027s capable of taking a single astronaut to and from Duna, with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here she is all ready to launch (decided to use a launch window planner and discovered day 233 to be the best day to start the mission):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagnificent isn\u0027t she. Well let\u0027s get this show on the road, LAUNCH!!!:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah looks so happy. The outer four engines of this stage are asparagused in and were dropped at nearly 16,000m:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe central engine is sufficient to put the whole ship into orbit and perform any adjustments. I put the ship into a circular equatorial orbit at 121,000m:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome maneuver planning later and I was ready to leave Kerbin. The main engine was dropped off pretty early into the burn, and the Rockomaxx \u0022Skipper\u0022 took over the remainder of the burn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course that\u0027s not a great periapsis, but it a few small maneuvers gave me a nice close peri of 70 km. Once there it was a simple matter of putting myself into a nice equatorial orbit around Duna:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in a circular equatorial orbit at 71,000 m, the Rockomaxx engine was abandoned, goodbye old friend you have served me well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know it\u0027s dark, but I had a great landing spot coming up and had to ditch it. Anyway, with the extra weight gone, it was time to decouple, and leave my atomic engines in orbit under the control of a probe (for later tracking when I have to dock again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, another dark picture, I am ashamed. But at least Jebediah is on his way to the surface. The beauty of this ship is it\u0027s light enough to land entirely under parachute, as seen below, thus saving on fuel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that was exciting! After 257 days, Jebediah is the first Kerbal to land on another planet (at least in my game). Doesn\u0027t he look so proud:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point you can gather a bevy of scientific data form the planet from any of the full suite of instruments on the lander. After you\u0027ve had your fill of Duna, it\u0027s time to plan the return trip. Firstly we have to get back into orbit, so once the engine probe in orbit is close to the lander I fired up the engine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that there is a lot of excess weight, why bother bringing it all back. Time to lose the science module\u0027s and legs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna14.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna14.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch better, and now the ship is light enough that there is enough fuel in the tank to get back into orbit. The next challenge is to dock with the engine probe, but this isn\u0027t terribly difficult due to the small size of the craft. Coming in for the final docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce docked I found myself back in that circular equatorial orbit, which is so good for getting back to Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna16.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna16.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWOOOO! We did it. All right, at this point there are a few options for getting back to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) The impatient method of leaving now, and setting myself up on a collision course with Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Waiting for an efficient launch window, and putting the ship back in orbit around Kerbin before landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell thanks to the magic of savegames I can try both. Firstly the collision course, which I imagine is much to Jebediah\u0027s liking, as he\u0027s been gone for hundreds of days and probably wants to get home and slam back a lot of alcohol as soon as possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna17.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna17.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that\u0027s a big burn. Fortunately I have enough fuel to complete it. Well that little LV-909 is no longer useful, so it get\u0027s ditched around Duna, and I\u0027m free to use the atomic engines for the return burn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna18.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna18.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really love scenes like this in Kerbal. So the trip required a few course adjustments to get myself on a proper collision course, but after a couple hundred days of travel I was heading straight for the surface:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna19.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna19.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then used the remainder of my fuel to slow the craft down a bit before hitting the atmosphere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna20.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna20.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoly, Jeb was coming in hot, but I was able to get the speed down a fair bit with the remaining fuel. After hitting the atmosphere, I undocked and used the remaining parachutes to pull the lander can away from the now spent atomic engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna21.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna21.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few minutes later and Jeb was safely landed at a nice tropical beach:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna22.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna22.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal trip time was 1 year and 65 days. And Jebediah can go home to his family whom I assumed he missed greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, what about our other option, the more elegant flight back into Kerbin orbit. Reloading back to when I was in orbit around Duna, I used a launch window planner to determine the best time to fly back was year 3 day 241. Well, looks like you\u0027re waiting in orbit for a while my little cosmonaut. However, waiting for this day allowed me to dip into a nice periapsis around Kerbin with a fairly short burn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna23.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna23.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this nice easy burn, and some later flight adjustments, I was nice and close to my home planet with plenty of fuel to put myself in orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna24.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna24.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna25.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna25.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven after my orbital burn, I still had a lot of fuel left over, suggesting a similar orbital drop in could be performed earlier than the optimal launch window:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna26.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna26.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here it was a simple matter of choosing a landing spot, firing the engines, and dropping the capsule in the atmosphere to land via parachute:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna27.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna27.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tavarin-photo.com/ksp/Duna28.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Duna28.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it, a successful manned mission to Duna with return trip, done with a simple and relatively efficient ship.
