I probably don\u0027t have the tech for it, but I am trying to land with science and Kerbals and return. The main tech needed that I am missing is the inflatable heat shield or even the largest std one, and most of my designs are based around mitigating this. This will actually be my first atmospheric landing and lift off from playing nearly 440hrs, I am probably nuts for trying it, especially from reading up the difficulty of ascent and the thickness of atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am trying out different parts in sandbox, so as to not have to cheat in career, or risk my precious Kerbals (I am fine sacrificing them in sandbox). In my trials I am cheating things to orbit, or whatever place I need to be to test out various parts. So far I am around 2 weeks or so of casual playing. For now, I will just add my old and current designs with a little bit on each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current progress is, I have a lander with science that can land and take off with a success of around 25%. (Low, I know)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hFL8pYj.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hFL8pYj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am currently still optimizing this part. The Poodles are just to de-orbit when cheating into Eve orbit. The heat shield arrangement is 1. to keep me stable in Eve atmosphere and 2. to protect my final stage terrier from going boom on descent. When in lower atmosphere, it does some interesting wiggling about. This like most of my screenshots is a slightly older version, but it is still mostly the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an interplanetary stage with enough deltaV to get me there (and back when the lander is ditched). Though I have not tested this yet with my current version of lander. Std interplanetary type stage?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Iqe7llY.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Iqe7llY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an earlier version of both the lander and the interplanetary stage, but I don\u0027t seem to have a more recent screenshot. The 2 pods are so I can take a scientist with me to reset\u00A0experiments in Eve space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also managed to get the full thing into Kerbin orbit. No screenshot of this, but I dare say it looks like any other std heavy lifter. It did look like it was going to cost 600k to launch the monstrosity.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am closeish to the full mission and it is looking possible, but really difficult (and expensive).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cant find many screenshots of my failures, but here is my first attempt of something that would escape Eve. I gave this up pretty quickly as it was too heavy and SRBs don\u0027t seem like they are a good idea to haul to Eve, lots of research after this failure. which lead to my current design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EhB0ZwE.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EhB0ZwE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtras, I met my first real Kraken last night, due to issues dumping my top heat shield I quick saved under parachute power, when I reloaded, things started accelerating randomly. I tried to stage to see if this would sort it, and parts ended up heading out of the solar system at 10milion\u002B m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus pictures of my Moho crafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UKnIx1N.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UKnIx1N.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iYwXRrc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iYwXRrc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try and keep this updated and detail my trials and tribulations to be able to achieve it in my career save. I do not want any advice yet (unless I ask for it) as I like to work things out myself and research myself (Hope I don\u0027t offend anyone here, I know you are all awesome helpful people). Once I am done, any advice or constructive criticism for a try in the future will be welcome, or even learning for future missions. Wish me luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I totally forgot to add that I am not using mods, I didn\u0027t use them even when deltaV wasn\u0027t calculated and made a nice spreadsheet to calculate for me. I want to add the graphics mods some time, but I am happy with struggling with the various game play struggles... especially with some of the quality of life changes since I last played.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-23T21:27:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2020 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Theolain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-05T16:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow\u0027s it going?
