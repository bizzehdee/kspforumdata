I decided the moon was kind of boring(all I could get was midlands and stranded kerbals) but now I have decided to go to minmus. my plan is to reconfigure a moon mission rocket, and get it into orbit. afterwards, I am going to set up a manuever node opposite where minmus is equitorially aligned(meaning where it crosses my equitorial orbit) and do the burn. I will then land just like on the moon. keep going down, burn, keep it at about 10 m/s from 500 meters (above ground, not sea level) and go to as slow as possible for under 10 meters\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T20:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends...what kind of launch power are you looking for? I you need any sort of serious heavy lifting, I would highly suggest you use the KW Rocketry. That is what I use primarily as the tanks also have more fuel than stock. If you want to get a simple lander, such as the Apollo Lunar lander, than I would suggest you use the Saturn V from either the FASA pack or the one by OLDD. These are my suggestions due to simplicity of mission. However, I am having a hard time deciphering exactly what you are going for your mission parameters. I could not tell if you are planning to do a direct acsent, in which the ship itself is the lander or going for a Minmus orbit rendezvous in which you would transfer your crew into a smaller lander to carry out the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-15T20:48:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sampa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T01:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe ship itself should be the lander, and plan on using far\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T22:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am using no mods, and have a probe. will post it shortly\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
