So of course, I reacted to this by launching a Grand Space Tour, in which I sent a rocket to every body with a solid surface in the Kerbol system and planted a flag on it. Only a few days after the release of the patch, I finished my task.

Dres is an analog to Ceres, a particularly large body in our own Asteroid belt, that was thought to be a planet once.

Interestingly, this is the same thing that recently happened to Pluto, except it\u0027s part of a different family of objects in the Kuiper Belt.

All of the moons of Jool are tidally locked, and I happened to plant the flag on a side where you could see Jool.

Tylo is, by far, the hardest body to land on, because it has high gravity but no atmosphere, meaning that aerobraking is impossible. I only managed to land after building a modified lander and trying several times. I had no fuel to spare and actually landed so hard my fuel tanks exploded, though luckily my command module remained intact. Tylo itself is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8UXADQACuFiRlVnR2NCQmlqRkk/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomewhat barren\u003C/a\u003E and really just looks like a larger version of Mun.
