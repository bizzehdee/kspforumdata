The first stage was composed of that 3200 4-cluster with two side boosters (2-cluster).\n\n![fOzk0fm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fOzk0fm.jpg)\n\nSecond stage fires. You see the new fairings in place, covering and protecting the part of the stack where my LM is located.\n\n![f50V58O.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/f50V58O.jpg)\n\nHalfway through second stage.\n\n![NFgcVNX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NFgcVNX.jpg)\n\nFairing jettison.\n\n(forgot to take snapshots of arrival at Munar orbit, sorry)\n\n![WLKUa0n.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WLKUa0n.jpg)\n\nLM separating from the 3rd stage which also acted as a braking stage\n\n![P83BA4B.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/P83BA4B.jpg)\n\nLM about to land, nice dust effects\n\n![8BpuChJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8BpuChJ.jpg)\n\nJeb doing a clambering demo\n\n![jv3wIAb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jv3wIAb.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, back at the CSM, Bill checks up on the new fuel cells\n\n![MyHkUpR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MyHkUpR.jpg)\n\nJeb and Bob celebrating their first Mun landing with KSP v1.0\n\n![O9diXM5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O9diXM5.jpg)\n\nGreat shot of LM ascent stage leaving the LM descent stage and munar surface\n\n![nc7doll.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nc7doll.jpg)\n\nRendezvous and docking with the CSM\n\n![Sr1j9g4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Sr1j9g4.jpg)\n\nNearly there.
