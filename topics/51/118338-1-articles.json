Minmus seemed a good choice; easy to get to and not too big. And so I started designing Minmus rovers, and taking them into the mountains west of KSC for testing. But as the rovers got better I realised that I prefer Kerbin. I like the green hills. I like imagining where the towns might be; roads and tracks and farms and factories; busy Kerbals getting on with their lives. So this is my extended test-drive around Kerbin, seeing the sights and visiting a few Kerbals on the way.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Good luck."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:06:33Z","Content":"Wow, quite a trip.

Congrats on your progress so far.\n\u003E BTW, I really like the coffee shop and other buildings you visited. How did you get them there?\n\nI built them in the VAB and then used [thread=37756]HyperEdit[/thread] to move them into location. It took many attempts to find some level ground.\n\nThere were some problems. The table and chairs are prone to exploding because they have a floor of structural panels which has clipped into the ground. I manually edited the save file to move the building back above ground so I could take the picture and drive away. The tower was awkward because HyperEdit does not change orientation, so when the building jumped around the world it arrived upside down. I eventually added some disposable reaction wheels to turn it the right way up.\n\nI would like to use [thread=105247]Kerbal Konstructs[/thread] to place static buildings that are prettier and don\u0027t explode, but I know nothing about this kind of modelling and my artistic skills are limited. Maybe one day."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T22:34:35Z","Content":"While I use HyperEdit extensively to put ships in space and various orbits for testing purposes, and play with their fuel states, and can even totally screw up the solar system, I have no idea how to place a building.
