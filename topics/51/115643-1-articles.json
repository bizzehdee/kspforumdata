All of my interplanetary exploration has been limited to probes that go there, collect science, and are never heard of again. I was probably being a bit overambitious by trying such a complex mission without a bit of practice.\n\nSince I firmly believe that there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 like overkill, I decided to try and run a manned mission on every celestial body in sandbox mode. (Save Eve and maybe Tylo, both for obvious reasons.)\n\nMods:\n\n- Procedural Parts\n\n- MechJeb (I\u0027ll probably be doing most of the actual landings by hand due to my autopilot nervousness, but let Mechanical Jebediah take care of the boring stuff)\n\n- SpaceY because Falcon 9\n\n- HGR\n\n- Atomic Age\n\n- Vanguard Astrodynamics engines\n\n- Kerbal Alarm Clock\n\n- TweakScale: it\u0027s virtually a dependency for both LLL, Interstellar Extended, and my styling sanity.\n\n- EVE\n\n- PlanetShine to see if it makes that much of a difference... e\\_e\n\n- ThermalNuclear for its excellent combined-cycle nuclear engines and naming convention\n\nAnd, for once, I\u0027m not running FAR.\n\nPart 1 (Mun Landing): [Gotta Begin Somewhere](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128406-Going-Everywhere-a-Skrub-goes-Interplanetary?p=2073340\u0026viewfull=1#post2073340)\n\nPart 2 (Gilly part 1): [Unplanned Rapid Heating Event(s)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128406-Going-Everywhere-a-Skrub-goes-Interplanetary?p=2075440\u0026viewfull=1#post2075440)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T16:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**\n  \nCame up with a better title."},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T16:45:50Z","Content":"As an interjectory aside, if you\u0027re going to use EVE and PlanetShine, I\u0027d also suggest picking up Distant Object Enhancer.

Had to run the nuke at full throttle, no limiter, to properly circularize. Even then, it tended to leave Gilly\u0027s SOI when anything was decoupled, docked, undocked, or looked at funny.\n\n![yKpL1kb.png](http://i.imgur.com/yKpL1kb.png)\n\nUndocked and deorbited, the lander bug gets ready to perform an entirely un-needed braking burn. Orbital speed of Gilly is, no joke, 15 m/s.
