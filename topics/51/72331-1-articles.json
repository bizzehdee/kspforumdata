Currently I am using the following mods: Protractor, Kerbal Engineer, Kerbal Alarm Clock and Kerbal Attachment System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my first interplanetary voyage, Jeb, Bob and Bill took \u003Cem\u003EConstellation\u003C/em\u003E to Duna, orbited it and Ike, almost ran out of fuel (This is where I learned how important correction burns are, and how to aerocapture), and safely returned to Kerbin with enough science to unlock half the fourth tier. After successfully landing I did a short mission review and decided on a couple of things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Landing the habitat section is unnecessary. You can fly up, rendezvous, get science, and fly back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Modular construction is a good idea, but the side engines needed a better alignment scheme than \u0022eyeball it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The vessel should be able to transport parasite ships for landing/bases/etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence, the new \u003Cem\u003EConstitution\u003C/em\u003E class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter several entertaining mishaps (one particularly heartbreaking one where Jeb performed a perfect docking from 115 meters out only to not have a docking port installed, another one where the habitat section flexed in the middle on takeoff) we finally go the ship assembled:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, 79 days till moho launch window... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T06:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYikes.
