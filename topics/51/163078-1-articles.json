I\u0027m playing on Hard, and to make it easier to fix the inevitable design mistakes I wanted to troubleshoot the station in Kerbin orbit, before shipping it to Duna all at once. Thrust and irregularly-shaped objects don\u0027t mix well, so figuring out how to do that was a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor (I think) the first time I made a point of taking pictures as I went.
