Well, I used so much part clipping in my design that once things started ripping from one another, damn near every part in my ENTIRE SATURN V REPLICA exploded simultanously. Fortunately, the game was running so slow at that point that I had time to jam the abort button about a dozen times before I saw the LES activate. I was practically holding my breath as I watched the command pod clear the rapidly expanding cloud of shrapnel and burning rocket fuel. In fact, I cut it so close that the LES sheered off at the last moment, just as it ran out of fuel (half a second or so after activation). Fortunately, the command pod stabilized and the parachutes were undamaged. My crew splashed down into booster bay, unharmed. Not before nearly getting taken out by debris escaping the explosion at a very rapid pace.\n\nThis has been one of the most exciting things to happen to me in KSP for some time. I made Jebediah proud!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:52:45Z","Content":"![good-luck-walking-away-from-that-one-in-slow-motion-thumb.jpg](http://www.troll.me/images/ironic-explosion/good-luck-walking-away-from-that-one-in-slow-motion-thumb.jpg)\n\n\\*subtracts Rep\\* I don\u0027t think you\u0027re allowed to draw blueprints anymore, comrade... ![grin.gif](http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/PWI/tigers/grin.gif)\n\nIn seriousness though, pretty awesome you managed to capture the destruction moment-by-moment like that.
