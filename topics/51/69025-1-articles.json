Docked the Lander (now under Bobs guidance) there and deposited the last (central) science pod for a later return to Kerbin. Next built a very similar station around Mun orbit, where I sent up two Science pods with the first module and four Science pods with the second module for it. Then sent up the Return Vehicle together with three more Science pods. The return vehicle met up with the lander again, transferred over its three Science pods and the Lander proceeded to do three jumps on the Mun surface after a brief stop at the Mun station to stock up on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this followed an elaborate process of changing out used pods for new ones, requiring quite a few dockings. Twice. For a total of nine landings on Mun for this mission.

You build a station in a 50-60km polar orbit at Minmus that has 3 main parts: A collection of fuel tanks, a Mobile Lab, and a lander with 4x Goos, 4x Materials, and 1x everything else. You need at least 2 Kerbals to run the Mobile Lab. The Mobile Lab also needs a probe core, some electricity, and enough parachutes to land safely on Kerbin (4 blue chutes hanging out radially on struts will work fine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause all this is in a polar orbit, it will eventually pass over every biome. When a biome you haven\u0027t hit yet comes into range, put 1 Kerbal in the lander and send it down there. When it gets back to the station, have the Kerbal carry all the data from the lander into the Mobile Lab, then stay in there with the other Kerbal to use the Mobile Lab to rearm all the Goo and Material experiments on the lander. Refuel the lander from the tanks on the station. Repeat until you\u0027ve hit every biome or get really bored with the repetition. Then send the Mobile Lab back to land on Kerbin. Profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of tricks to doing this. 1st off, you really want the station\u0027s orbit to cross the daylight side of Minmus. Thus, you usually have to do its inclination change once at Minmus instead of on the way there with the 1st station module. Set it up so the station\u0027s orbit is fairly close to the west edge of the daylight so you\u0027ll have several months to use the station before its orbit ends up along the terminator. Then you\u0027ll have to wait a few weeks before the other side of the orbit gets into daylight, and several months to use the station again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have to rendezvous the various other modules to the core. If you\u0027ve never rendezvoused with a highly inclined target, the only thing to worry about is matching planes with the target, after which it\u0027s the same as normal. It\u0027s really not that hard to do. The main thing is to make sure you get to Minmus going around it in the same direction as the station. So launch the new module as normal and then, while in LKO waiting to do the transfer burn, watch the station on the map to see if it\u0027s going under or over Minmus as you look at it. Then just do the transfer burn (or a midcourse tweak) to go under or over Minmus the same way. Once you get to Minmus, you\u0027ll definitely be out of plane with the target but at least going in the same direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final plane change is a bit different than normal. Forget about ascending and descending nodes. Instead, eyeball on the map where your orbit crosses the target\u0027s orbit and put your node there. Then pull the up or down handle as needed to line your orbit up with the target\u0027s. After this, it becomes just another coplanar rendezvous. The only remaining issue is that because you\u0027re in a polar orbit, you sometimes run into the inability of the camera to rotate past the poles when trying to set up your rendezvous burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T14:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mach1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mach1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow do you exactly do a mission like mine, manned?

Crew and EVA reports can be transmitted back to Kerbin for no science loss. Just strap an Antenna onto your Lander craft. Do bring some good amount of power though, as transmitting data eats electricity fairly fast. Crew reports are easy enough, just collect and transmit. For EVAs\u0027 your Kerbonaut need to re-enter the craft first, then you review reports on your command pod, and from there transmit your EVA report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little \u0022trick\u0022 here, is that to get all the \u0022whilst flying over\u0022 EVA reports, you don\u0027t actually have to fly over anything. Just land at a new biome and do a quick EVA doing nothing but holding onto your command pod, take an EVA report, and re-enter the pod to transmit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, surface samples is another matter, they do need to be brought back to Kerbin if you want to get the full science for them. These get stored in the command pod of your Lander craft as you re-enter it. You can store plenty of surface samples in your command pod. But what if you don\u0027t plan on returning your Lander craft to Kerbin surface you say? If like me have a dedicated Return Vehicle? Good news is, you can transfer science reports stored on one craft to another. Do an EVA from your Lander, whilst still holding onto your Landers\u0027 command pod, right (or was it left?) click it and you get an option to collect reports stored on that pod. Do that, and then move your Kerbonaut over to the Return Vehicle and enter that. Your surface samples are now stored there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for MobileLab, don\u0027t bother until you start to plan a Jool mission. You\u0027ll still lose science by using it, but by the time you start thinking about Jool it doesn\u0027t matter much. For Jool, a MobileLab is not as heavy as all the Science Pods you\u0027d need if doing it without science loss.

But the thing is, most experiments don\u0027t capture all the possible points if you only return 1 copy of them. Surface samples require 2 returns from the same place to get all the points, although 1 transmission followed by 1 return will get about 95% of those points. With Goo and Materials, however, returning 1 copy gets about 70% of the available points, 2 is about 85%, 3 is about 95%, and 4 gets them all. So with them, you need to return 3 or 4 copies. I prefer to return 4 because I like 4x symmetry better than 3x. This is why I say your lander needs 4x Goos and 4x Materials. Everything else you only need 1 of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as you can see above, you quickly get into diminishing returns. Returning 1 copy of an experiment gets you the majority of its points so if you\u0027re willing to leave 10-20% of the points on the table, feel free. But over the long run up the tech tree, those missing points add up, which translates into having to do more missions to complete the tech tree. And seriously, it gets to be a real grind after a while, so I try hard to avoid ever having to go back somewhere I\u0027ve already been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where the Mobile Lab comes in. Mobile Labs have the virtue of being able to hold multiple copies of Goo, Materials, and surface samples from the same place. Capsules do not. So if you only have a capsule, you can\u0027t get all the available points at a location, meaning you\u0027ll either have to waste time going there again or just do without those points which you\u0027ll really miss later when nodes start getting expensive. OTOH, if you have a Mobile Lab, you can cram everything you pick up into it and bring it all home at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this in the end is just a matter of taste. The Mobile Lab doesn\u0027t save you any landings on Minmus; you still have to land and return from every biome. What it saves you is spending time launching and transferring that number of separate landers. With the Mobile Lab, you can totally pillage Minmus with 3-4 launches: station core, lander, returnable Mobile Lab, and maybe a resupply of fuel. You still have the repetition of all the landings but you trade the repetition of identical launches, transfers, and returns for the repetition of docking with the station and transferring data to the Mobile Lab. It\u0027s really a grind either way. But I think you get more quality play time by using the Mobile Lab because less of your time is spent getting to and from Minmus and more on actually acquiring points. Plus, the payoff when you land the Mobile Lab with all the science from Minmus at once is IMHO more enjoyable than bringing back a single landing and realizing you still can\u0027t unlock that 1 node you really want so have to do it all again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T17:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mach1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mach1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow do you exactly do a mission like mine, manned?

Well, what are you going to use the kethane for? Kethane on Duna should stay on Duna, being used only for refueling things that are also on the ground there. To refuel ships orbiting anywhere in the Duna system, you should get the Kethane from Ike. From low Duna orbit, it takes less fuel to go to Ike, land there, and come back to LDO than it does to land and return from Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the Kethane Jet, it works very differently from regular jet engines (besides its ability to operate without O2). Regular jets are limited by altitude with performance falling off gradually as you get higher until they eventually flame out. The Kethane jet, OTOH, is limited by speed. The amount of KintakeAir it produces with its integral intake (and this is the ONLY source of KintakeAir) stays essentially constant regardless of altitude. However, should the speed of the vehicle ever exceed some critical value (which varies with the throttle setting), the KintakeAir instantly goes to zero and won\u0027t come back until the speed gets back below this critical value (which again varies with throttle position).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that the Kethane Jet likes to run at full throttle and low speed, which of course work against each other on most planets. The fact that high speed causes flameout makes the Kethane jet particularly useless as a space launch engine. The only thing it does reliably and well is flying on Eve, where the thick air requires both power to overcome and still imposes a slow speed. In Duna\u0027s thin air, ship speed increases very quickly and the engine soon cuts out. This limits the Kethane jet to use as a VTOL thruster or for boost-glide aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T19:56:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk then.

And about 13 days to go until the Duna Window opens up and a slightly more up-scale mission gets going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, KSC is pondering the option of sending off a couple of unmanned probes towards Eve and Moho for some fly-by\u0027s. Perhaps even to Kerbol - the sun itself. KSC it seem have gotten their mitts on some fancy new propulsion device.
