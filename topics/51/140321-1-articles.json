of discovery today with the launch of Project Zeus, which promises to land a Kerbal on each of the five moons of Jool.\u00A0 Dr. Wehrner von Kerman, Chief Engineer and Program Director of the Kerbin

landing on all five moons in one unsupported mission.\u00A0 We believe we have developed the right hardware to do the job, and testing has already shown that we are on the right track.\u00A0 We also have five excellent astronauts in Jebediah, Bill, Bob, Valentina, and Siesa.\u00A0 They are already hard at work training for the landings and assisting with mission planning.\u00A0 We intend to launch by the middle of next year, and plant our first flag within three years.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027,

budget for Project Zeus, which comes in at \u221A1.5 million.\u00A0 It includes five launches to low Kerbin orbit, where the ship will be assembled.\u00A0 The main component of the ship is Red Dragon, a nuclear-powered vessel with space for six Kerbals.\u00A0 Red Dragon will push three other vessels: the Centaur lander intended for Jool\u0027s moon Laythe, a second lander, named Lucy, which will land on Tylo and Jool\u0027s three smallest moons, and an in-system refueller and tug named Tumnus.\u00A0 This will be pushed out of Kerbin orbit by a kicker drive which consists of the Urlum V core which will also launch Red Dragon.\u00A0 Once in orbit and assembled, Red Dragon will mass just over 700 metric tons.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan

it doesn\u0027t give us any room for a refuelling mission, should it become necessary,\u0022 though he noted that in the extremely unlikely case that astronauts were stranded in Jool\u0027s orbit the

the \u00221.1 Fiasco\u0022, a rather optimistic software \u0022upgrade\u0022 that quickly showed its ugly side.\u00A0 KSC quickly reverted to a previous, much more stable version to run the ships of Project Zeus, but not before losing several experimental vessels.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier,

already eclipsed the \u221A1.5 million budget after at least two prior iterations of the Red Dragon were built and tested -- the latest of which fell victim to the 1.1 Fiasco, which lead to the loss of the two vessels.\u00A0 These same sources claim that after rolling back to a previous software version, all of the crafts had to be completely redesigned.\u00A0 \u0022Some parts became unavailable, and others were incompatible with the old software,\u0022 one engineer said, agreeing to speak on the condition of anonymity.\u00A0 \u0022It turned out that the vessel we had planned to build was simply no longer feasible.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EAccording to a report released by KSC Engineering, Red Dragon will cost \u221A470,690 before launch costs are considered.\u00A0 Kerman plans to use the massive Urlum X launcher to boost Red Dragon into low Kerbin orbit.\u00A0 This launcher consists of an Urlum V launcher with four 5-meter boosters and four 2.5-meter boosters, making it one of the largest rockets ever assembled and flown by KSC.\u00A0 Other components will be launched with the slightly smaller Tylo rocket, a single-stack measuring 3.75 meters in diameter and boasting a single Titan I
