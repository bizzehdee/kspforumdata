Khua decided he needed and highly ranked party to develop Rockets, so het travelled to Kermania where he met doctor W.v.\u00A0Kerman who joined him in the Mission of Creating Rockets and not soon later Werner and Kua started on their first Project called Project K66 which would involve secret rocket Testing and developing Spy Sat\u0027s. a Year later when the Kerbal\u0027s Party of Khina decided to put more funds in the program the propaganda started and they began to build an copy of the Kerbal Space Center located in UKS\u00A0but it would be obvious to see so they builded it near the water and forests so they thought it could not be found. Project K66 made big steps and they almost had their designs ready... but then.. what to launch? the KPOK\u00A0leader\u0027s asked, Well Khua said we are planning on Launching up Spy Sat\u0027s to look on Koviet Union and UKS! The Leader\u0027s of the KPOK\u00A0were pleased by their plans and gave them even more funds! and soon the first Engine Test of the rocket KhangKzeng 1, but in that time period the would just launch a whole rocket to test it... it failed.. the rocket exploded at \u002Bt-50 seconds due to an guidance malfunction. 3 months later the CNKA had finished the second Test Rocket Which they Launched With success it reached orbit but because it had no payload it fell back to earth after 10 orbits. So!!!... the Creation began of the First CNKA Sat which would be getting the name Khang Foo Poo I which would be like the Stayputnik. After the Success of the Second rocket launch the CNKA decided to create more variants to the KZ1 which would get KZ1 A and KZ1 B, but the Development of KZ1 A came in danger because the Rocket Exploded while being assembled killing 76 Khinese Kerbals which stopped Production and Funding Eventually...

They found an\u00A0company out of the Koviet Union\u00A0that would deliver Strato Aircraft which the Khinese would designate as Project 943-K1 they did this as an Millitary name so the Koviet Union and the Kerbal states would not know what it was. the CNKA would also work on an Sat that could be launched on top of the Air launched Rocket..
