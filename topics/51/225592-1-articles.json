Kerbals have been making rockets since the invention of the firework thousands of years ago, and since then the engineering of them was always to see who could make the biggest explosion. It wasn\u2019t until recently that they were realized to be a vehicle that could be used for more than just impressive, loud booms. Kerbals never used rockets for war or anything. War is a notion long past Kerbalkind. No, rockets were nothing more than glorified weather balloons. Before Kerbalkind looked to the stars, they looked to the clouds. Rockets could get higher than your average balloon, and could see clouds in a much fuller view. Data could be delivered more accurately and timely. However, no one quite saw the full potential in these vehicles. No one, other than one particular Kerbal.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qMZtRkE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qMZtRkE.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA Tinny-Tom rocket, one of the earliest rockets, takes off from Woomerang Launch Facility.

Immediately after college, he was off to work for the Kerbin Weather Bureau (KWB). And what would he do for the agency? Build rockets! He was fascinated with them from when he was just a young Kerblet, and now he had his chance to get up close and work on them. However, the more he worked with rockets, the less excited they became. Rockets were stale. All they\u2019d do was go high into the clouds, make it to a certain height, and then fall back down to Kerbin. There was no need to advance or go higher. There was just no need. Wernher was tired or working on the exact same thing constantly, but he lacked inspiration on where to go. That is, until one night, when he was at a coworker\u2019s house. His friend, Goddard Kerman. He took Wernher out to his deck, and invited him to look through the telescope he had planted out there. Wernher looked through, and was amazed at what he saw. He saw the planets of the Kerbolar system, brighter than he\u2019d ever seen them before. He looked towards the Mun, and saw every little crater on the its surface. It was almost like he was floating there, right above it. Then, the gears started turning in his head.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EWhen he arrived at the launch site the next morning, Wernher spoke to Goddard about his experience with the telescope. He told him about how close the Mun felt, how he could imagine himself floating right above its surface, and about his idea. He told Goddard how rockets could be more than just weather balloons, that Kerbals can ride them far into the stars. At first Goddard laughed, and told Wernher he\u2019d been reading too much science fiction. But when Wernher described more of his thoughts to Goddard, Goddard started to take interest. He told Wernher to meet him at his home again that night, and they\u2019d discuss this further. The seeds of the space age had been planted.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E***\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell this came out MUCH sooner than expected. I\u0027ve just had a lot of free time to write. But here it is, the grand return of Beyond! Now, this will start off a little differently from the original thread, as I\u0027ll go much deeper into the story of Beyond and, involve Beyond a little more into the world it takes place in. It\u0027s going to start a little slow, but trust me it will get more exciting. Honestly, I feel refreshed now to play KSP. It feels nice to start over and actually know what I\u0027m going to do. I also have a format in mind for the thread. Instead of a constant, monotonous style throughout the thread, I decided that the format will evolve alongside the thread. The beginning here, about the invention of space rockets and the like, is going to be formatted like a book about space travel. Then, the early days of Beyond will be formatted like a newspaper. A time similar to the shuttle era of the 80s, 90s, and 00s will be styled like an old website, and when get to point comparable to the modern day, I\u0027ll bring back that newsletter format I was using. I promise I will try my best to bring quality to thread (something the old one lacked a lot of).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Kerbin","CreatedById":234323,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-29T16:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are back!
