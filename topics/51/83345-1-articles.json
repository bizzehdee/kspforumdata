This spur-of-the-moment decision was made based on the fact that Jeb was off on some mission involving \u0022much speed\u0022, and \u0022large explosions\u0022, and therefore could not possibly turn this soon to be relaxing voyage into a hair raising death defying experience.

There happened to be a manufacturing error in the 747\u0027s design, however, as the landing lights were installed backwards, making for not only a trickier landing, but making it impossible for the behemoth of an aircraft to grab onto the smaller DC-3 during the night, so the party waits until morning to refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wts5FFGl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wts5FFGl.png\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;--Final approach between two mountains\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1jaOSrhl.png\u0022 alt=\u00221jaOSrhl.png\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;--Backwards landing lights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z0lNcgul.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z0lNcgul.png\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;-- \u0022Did someone call for fuel (and snacks)?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen morning arrives, the crew of the monstrously large 747 simply cannot line up to grab the DC-3 and transfer fuel, as the slope proves too much and results in everything side slipping down, nearly running over Bill! So, the DC-3 starts to roll down the hill, gathering enough speed to \u0022take off\u0022 unpowered, and glide to a flatter area, and land. The 747 on the other hand has no such luck. Instead of careening down the hill, the pilots take it slow, but still manage to break off one of the outboard engines!
