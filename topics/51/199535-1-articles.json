Dunaverse was sent into orbit, officially beginning the first interplanetary habitation experiment of Kerbalkind.\u00A0 The mission was ultimately deemed a success, but it was not without incident.\u00A0 Upon their return, the crew of the Dunaverse was debriefed and their personal logs for the mission were reviewed.\u00A0 In light of the events that transpired during the mission, particular attention was paid to the logs of Raner Kerman, an engineer who had been a late addition to the crew.\u00A0 What follows are her relevant mission logs, the strange discoveries that they document, and the unexpected late-mission event that heavily altered the future of Kerbal space exploration and even the course of Kerbal society

celebrated so far away from home.\u00A0 Over the last few weeks I\u0027ve been further from home than I\u0027ve ever been in my entire life, in fact.\u00A0 And it\u0027s looking like next year\u0027s

I\u0027ve decided that I am going to take the Dunaverse posting after all.\u00A0 This training mission was a great example of not only what can go wrong, but also why it won\u0027t be catastrophic if things do go wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This mission was originally going to have me go directly to Minmus after my solar jaunt, but poor timing put my return in exactly the wrong place.\u00A0 Mission control\u0027s instructions were to aim for the Mun instead, land there, then go on to Minmus, as a launch window to Minmus would be very easy to obtain from Munar orbit.\u00A0 Ultimately it extended my mission by a full 20 days, but the end result is hard to argue.\u00A0 My life support remains almost half full; they were fully prepared for an even more catastrophic mission result.\u00A0 I have ample fuel left too; I could easily land my drive stage on Kerbin if I wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dunaverse_blueprint.png\u0022

our injection burn.\u00A0 Even though the other four modules have already been sent off ahead of us, the boffins are saying that our approach will result in us arriving a week before most of them do.\u00A0 Half the crew is horribly nervous, the other over-excited, and we are all looking forward to finally getting underway.\u00A0 As for me, I\u0027m somewhere between the two, but mostly I just want the burn to Duna over and done with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Karman and I have had some interesting tales to swap while we waited for the burn.\u00A0 We talked about our

idea he likes to write poetry!\u00A0 Valentina is very no-nonsense when she gets focused, but the rest of the time she\u0027s actually a bit of a goofball.\u00A0 Bob is exceptionally quiet most of the time, but if you start talking science with him, he won\u0027t stop for hours; poor Jonbert found that out the hard way, I bet he didn\u0027t think anyone could out-geek him!\u00A0 Bill\u0027s the
