Ok now have enough fuel, time to deorbit and land!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tylo landing simulations done back at KSC showed we needed to start the deorbit burn at 60km and burn the first stage at half throttle. Once done, burn through the second stage at half throttle until within a thousand meters of the surface. Then ramp up the throttle and commence landing. Nice theory but it didn\u0027t go as expected this time. Found that I needed to increase throttle on the second stage quite a bit. The fourth attempt nailed it very well, with more delta-v remaining than expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Jeb and Bob completed the surface operations it was time to leave. The ascent was a bit of a mess. Ended up with a goofy orbit that required bringing the core vehicle up to a 420km orbit. That is where it sits, joined up with the remains of the Tylo lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve now found a huge problem in my design. When the Tylo lander was part of the structure of the core vehicle it had docking ports at both ends. Now it doesn\u0027t, and I don\u0027t have any spare ports (4 ports, 5 landers). Not entirely sure how to save this mission at this point. Might end up seeing if I can get the Tylo lander back to Kerbin by itself. Or might have to do some crazy sort of ferry scheme, when its time to leave the Jool system. For now, it will probably stay in high orbit around Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0022F9\u0022 count is now at 5: one in Kerbin orbit due to unbalanced fuel tanks that made it impossible to steer, three failed Tylo landings, and one more due to \u0022rag doll\u0022 syndrome for the two crew on the surface of Tylo after a successful landing. That was really annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rbP5M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Fortunately the atmosphere of Laythe can give an aerobrake boost and help cut fuel consumption a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tylo lander was piloted by Jeb and Bob.

Rodlong Kerman has the Vall lander in high Tylo orbit, with the rest of the core crew module and other landers. Meanwhile Bob and Bill are in Laythe orbit with the core fuel and engine module. Basically, the plan was for Rodlong to meet Bob and Bill in Vall orbit. Then Bob and Rodlong would conduct the rest of the mission to land on Vall, get some science points, and return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA problem quickly revealed itself during the landing preparations: the lander\u0027s orbit was nearly exactly on the terminator between day and night, meaning the landing will be in twighlight or more likely darkness.

At least that is the plan. At the start of this phase of the mission the crew were someone scattered around the Jool system. Bob and Rodlong were in one ship in Vall orbit. Bill was in the Laythe lander in Vall orbit. Jeb, Sonney, and Derfen remained in high Tylo orbit with the crew module and other landers. Time to get everyone together again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis phase went pretty smoothly. First Bill established himself in an orbit around Jool at 100 million meters, roughly corresponding to the periapsis of Bop\u0027s orbit. Next Jeb and crew left Tylo and performed a rendezvous maneuver (requiring several orbits to get sorted out) to meet up with Bill. Lastly Bob and Rodlong left Vall orbit and also rendezvoused with the rest of the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter resting, refuelling, and packing more snacks, the crew split up again to send a lander off to Bop and another to Pol. Time at the Jool system is getting short, so these missions need to happen in parallel. My \u0022solution\u0022 to the lack of enough docking ports to bring all the landers back together is to have Rodlong pilot one of the landers back to Kerbin independently. This should work. Hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproximately 90 days remain until the transfer window from Jool to Kerbin. Still have plenty of fuel. I think I might have overestimated the amount of fuel required for this mission. But that is better than the alternative.

After more than eight years away the brave crew has returned from a very successful mission to the Jool system. The first step required that the crew rejoin Bill in the core cruise vehicle and then plot a course back to Kerbin orbit. Their return journey was not without a few incidents though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned back in Tylo orbit, the core vehicle didn\u0027t have enough docking ports for all five landers, due to a serious deficiency in design and planning. Very Kerbal. So Rodlong was assigned to pilot a lander back to Kerbin by himself. The lander didn\u0027t have sufficient delta-v for the trip. Which mean the rest of the crew had to meet him on the way back to Kerbin for a refuelling operation. Instead of refuelling though Sonney took a single lander on to Kerbin himself and allowed Rodlong to rejoin the rest of the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second \u0022minor incident\u0022 happened when attempting to drop the final four fuel tanks from the core vehicle. Turns out the various times when using those tanks to fuel other landers the crew messed up and didn\u0027t correctly drain the same amount from each tank. So one tank kept running its engine when the other three drained, which meant the vehicle took off in a very strange direction. Upon tank separation that rogue tank flew off in a crazy direction and everyone was very lucky to avoid any incidental damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally though the crew managed to reach Kerbin orbit, then in turn each lander descended to Kerbin and was recovered for its science.
