Quantum struts proved to be highly useful, requiring only four per side booster to hold on with a single Clampotron Jr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of fuel left after achieving a circular, equatorial Duna orbit had the engineers scrambling for drink coasters (much sturdier than napkins) to scribble on the backs of.

For the central section, the modifications are having to be redone from scratch since someone clicked launch before clicking save. No biggie since the mission requirements have changed so much. Easier to restart from the initial Large Rover Launcher design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s holding things up now is figuring out a way to connect the base of the lander to the top of the launcher, then be able to dock to the same spot for the return trip and topping up the lander\u0027s fuel for landing back at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of our engineers suggested ripping the guts out of an OKTO2 and mounting them around the inside of a Rokomax Brand Decoupler, then welding a Clampotron down inside the middle.

Getting them into orbit atop two of the side boosters will be easy. All five of these are slight modifications of one of the boosters built for heavy Kethane mining Mun rovers. That will provide the security and redundancy to ensure a fully fueled ship for the return flight.

But since they\u0027ll be carrying the scanners and mining landers, they\u0027ll have to be kept instead of dropped when empty as was done in the unmanned flight. On the other hand, they\u0027ll also provide plenty of fuel storage to get going on the way back to Kerbin, then can be cut loose when empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave to assemble this the hard way in orbit.

The test program included descent tests, drilling capability, fully loaded ascent to 45KM orbit tests (had to stack another small tank on top to have enough fuel) and finished up with a transfer to Ike orbit. That was successful but the final test lander somehow impacted Ike (in a puff of smoke, no explosion) when the periapsis was set to 10KM and warped to for circularizing at that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb is also having issues with screwing up orbits by idling the lander\u0027s engines after passing nodes.
