I had read on the forums that the aerocapture window for Duna is 12-15 km. I decided to aim for 13 km. So I burned radially to lower the periapsis into the atmosphere.

Would I overshoot? Or worse, would I brake too much and crash into Duna? My spacecraft carried more than enough fuel to perform an insertion burn in case I missed the capture, but overdoing it would be harder to correct. So I just crossed my fingers and watched the telemetry data (I picture a roomful of over-caffeinated Kerbal engineers nervously watching the data).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn less than 30 s, things went from not experiencing any aerobraking at all to more than 6 m/s2 of drag acceleration (it\u0027s twice Duna\u0027s surface gravity!).

I watched that ellipse get smaller and smaller and smaller ... but then, as the spacecraft climbed, it started to stabilize. And finally, the atmospheric density dropped to zero. Success!!

The simulation comes pretty close: it predicts a final elliptic orbit with a 534 km apoapsis altitude, while the actual final orbit ingame had an apoapsis of 518 km. Not bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered that the slight discrepancy is due to a slight difference in atmospheric drag as computed by my program (vs. what\u0027s reported by MechJeb ingame). The cause is a slight discrepancy in the \u003Cem\u003Eairspeed\u003C/em\u003E conversion from orbital speed. If your trajectory is not exactly equatorial, your airspeed has a slight dependence on your current latitude (and my program assumes an exactly equatorial trajectory). It\u0027s not a big difference, but since drag depends on speed quadratically, even a few m/s off can change your final apoapsis by a dozen kilometers.
