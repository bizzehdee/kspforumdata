The takeoff was tight, because the plane kept on rolling sideways, but it got off the ground without any damage. After awhile of flying over the ocean, between breaking the Lazor system and locking guided flight while on, i got locked out of my navball. I tried everything, but nothing worked. I decided to try IVA, but instead pressed EVA, and Jeb stepped outside. The poor guy didnt even get a chance to grab the rails before he flew into the radiators and got stuck there like superglue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was last spotted over the North Pole.
