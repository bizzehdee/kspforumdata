What never changed, though, was my love for KSP.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I decided the best way to show my love for KSP and make a return to the forums at the same time is with a mission report, as I\u0027ve always loved those.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA video game is about gameplay anyway, is it not? The mission in question I\u0027m posting about is a Science Mode mission. It was a well-planned and fruitful fly-by of Minmus, that of which rewarded me with a\u00A0lot of science points. Everything from ascent to landing was nominal, and I had enough delta-v thanks to using drop tanks (which I would highly recommend if you\u0027re looking for ways to get more delta-v) that,\u00A0by the time I had reached a circular-ish (as in not perfectly circular) low orbit around it, I was eager to attempt to make a landing, but knew that a lack of landing legs might have spelt out stranding Jeb on Minmus, so I decided not to do that. The Experiment Storage Unit\u0027s ability to store science stuff truly came in handy on this mission, because, without it, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to store multiple experiments how you can\u0027t if you don\u0027t have it. That\u0027s how I was able to store eight experiments instead of the lower amount it would have been restricted to. The placement of the ESU indeed made the final re-entry stage taller, but it had no noticeable negative effects, as I had postulated that it wouldn\u0027t.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as water landings go, I actually landed quite close to shore, with an impressive amount of science points to boot. Talk about a successful mission, eh?\u00A0203.1!\u00A0 That is no joke compared to the much more modest numbers that I used to get.\u00A0In fact, the type of stuff that I can do now is what would make the KSP poster me from something like ten years ago as of writing this very impressed about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s moments like that which remind me why I fell in love with this game in the first place.\u00A0As Jeb safely touched down near the shores of Kerbin, I couldn\u0027t help but feel a profound sense of accomplishment. The science points gathered were impressive, marking a significant leap forward in my pictured Science Mode career within KSP.\u00A0Reflecting on the mission in retrospect now as I wrote this post, I can\u0027t help but marvel at the advancements in my gameplay skills since my early days of basic missions done on pirated copies of Kerbal Space Program. This time, every decision felt deliberate and informed, from the choice of using drop tanks for extended Delta-v to the careful management of scientific data with the Experiment Storage Unit. From the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E launchpad, Jeb\u0027s spacecraft soared into the Kerbin sky, its design meticulously plotted to optimize delta-V and fuel usage, hence the drop tanks.\u00A0 And with the precision of a seasoned veteran Kerbonaut, Jeb soared gracefully towards Minmus in his spacecraft, fueled by the aforementioned drop tanks. The decision not to risk a landing without proper equipment showcased Jeb\u0027s commitment to safety and mission success, a decision that later proved wise as he navigated doing science work above the icy landscape of Minmus from a cautious yet cozily\u00A0close\u00A0orbit instead without a hitch, with more than enough delta-V and fuel to spare. The Experiment Storage Unit, smartly integrated into the capsule design, stored a treasure trove of scientific data from multiple experiments worthy of earning nods of approval from the Kerbals at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E back home. Especially from the scientist Kerbals over at the Research \u0026amp; Development Facility.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, and let me tell you about the return burn from Minmus! Funny thing that. Jeb\u0027s was cruising back towards Kerbin, and everything seemed on track, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell,\u00A0the maneuver that was done for that had put me in a unique position that I was not expecting it to \u2014 a slingshot course from Kerbin to the Mun and back!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow... normally, you\u0027d think, \u0022Hey, free Mun fly-by, cool!\u0022 But, nope... not this time \u2014 I had over 100 points of science on board from that epic Minmus trip.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I was not about to risk losing all of that. So, instead, I slammed the brakes, metaphorically-speaking, using a retrograde burn\u00A0and rerouted into a smooth re-entry trajectory instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, it would\u0027ve been awesome to swing by the Mun and back, but science is science, folks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd when you\u0027ve got that much valuable data packed into your capsule, you play it safe.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlthough Jeb may have\u00A0missed out on a Mun adventure, it was ultimately way more worth having those science points safely tucked away than to risk it all. KSP\u0027s all about calculated risks, and this time, caution was definitely the name of the game. Jeb might be a daredevil in space, but I feel like even he knows when it\u0027s time to play it safe for the sake of scientific progress.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway... that\u0027s all. End of mission report story.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0027re reading this, I want to thank you for sharing in my excitement and passion for Kerbal Space Program.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy thoughts that the Kerbal Space Program community is truly something special have remained unchanged, and I\u0027m glad that a lot of you folks are still here.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI look forward being part of the KSP1 community again, as an adult with advanced knowhow now, as well as sharing more adventures with you like this all soon.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m glad to be back, and more than curious to hear what all of you here at the forums have to say \u2014 especially after not having made a forum post before this in so long.
