Before we get started, here are a few ground rules: 1. Bill, Jebediah, and Bob will be used as test pilots only. The missions will be left for the regular, non-immortal kerbonauts. As soon as possible, I will station them on their own private asteroid base. 2. No long-term isolation. If a mission is expected to take more that a few days, there should be at least 1 other kerbal for company. 3. When in doubt, MechJeb! With that out of the way, the first mission will be posted soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
