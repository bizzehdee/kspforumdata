I\u0027ve been taking all the contracts for ferrying tourists into space that I can get, to build up the coffers for some much needed upgrades. Then I see one requiring me to rescue a fellow Kerbonaut from orbit. Sounds tricky, so off to YouTube I go. A couple hours later, I feel like I have a rough handle on it, so I set to building a rocket purpose built for it (thanks quill18 and Mike Aben, you guys rock!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk1 Command Pod\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDual radial mounted Mk2-R chutes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk1 Crew Cabin for the rescued pilot\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHeat shield\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTerrier engine for the orbital stage\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFL-T800 Fuel Tank with a LV-T45 Swivel engine for my sub orbital stage\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEnough solid boosters to get me off the launch pad and up to about 15km or so\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launch, get to space, burn the last of my sub orbital stage fuel and dump that stage. I fire off my orbital stage to establish my orbit, and...nothing. It then occurs to me how much the Mk1 Crew Cabin looks like a fuel tank. /foreheadsmack #1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI correct my...ahem...\u0022design oversight\u0022 and head out again. I establish my orbit only to realize that I had forgotten to time my launch for when my target was in the right position in its orbit. That leads me to make many laps around Kerbin, to bring them back around, warp too fast, grossly overshoot and have to repeat the process (it did occur to me after that I could have just pushed my apoapsis out and minimized the number of orbits required). I have a lot of trouble lining up my intercept point and have to settle for a little over 6km. What the heck, I figure, I\u0027ll give it a shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon reaching said intercept point, I leave map view and start my maneuvers in a little game I\u0027ve come to call \u0022nav ball rodeo\u0022. Seriously, that thing seems to have a mind of its own. Couple that with the fact that I keep fumbling with the controls, hitting the wrong keys over and over, trying to line up the target marker on the prograde/retrograde markers, as I fly past my target multiple times. Finally I settle down, taking a much more deliberate approach, creeping along ever so slowly and closing the gap. \u0022Hey, I\u0027m starting to get the hang of this,\u0022 I thought, just prior to realizing that one tap of the SHIFT key sometimes requires TWO taps of CRTL to reverse it. I\u0027m going to have to start treating it like I do time warping and hammer the stop key like I\u0027m playing that old arcade game, Track and Field. I go to spin about for another approach, and...the ship doesn\u0027t respond. Tap, tap, tap...nothing. I had run out of charge. /foreheadsmack #2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Again. This time I take some tips from one of the videos I watched and add a service bay behind the crew cabin with a couple rechargeable batteries in it and tack on a few solar panels. I also recall that the last time I was actually able to return to Kerbin in this vessel (the memory was beginning to fade by this point), the trip wasn\u0027t exactly smooth with some instability due to my center of mass being a bit too centered. Rather than address the concern in any sane manner, I decide to just slap on another heat shield, upside down on the nose of the command pod. It ain\u0027t pretty, but it works, when you don\u0027t know which end is going to end up pointing forward. Seems like the Kerbal way, as they say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo BACK to the launch pad. BACK into orbit (remembering to time my launch this time), and upon throwing down a maneuver node, nudging the retrograde handle showed an intercept point of 2km. Nice. After some adjustments, I am able to get it down to a little over 200m! That\u0027s with around an 8-degree descending node value (still getting the kinks out of my launch and ascent sequences). I think I could try this another 100 times and not get it this close. Boom, quick save, and away I go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon reaching the intercept point, I see the target about 170m away. I\u0027ve learned by now that the key is slow and steady with minimal control errors - not my forte. Still, I manage the approach fairly well. After a mild fender bender with the derelict pod, I switch to the pod and EVA the pilot, Mirbald. My excitement is building. However, my kerbal isn\u0027t moving. This is my first space walk, so I don\u0027t realize that jet packs have to be activated. I hit ESC, do a quick web search and I\u0027m back in business...sort of. My jet pack is shoving me around like it\u0027s possessed, but I get the hang of it before too long and am able to latch onto the ladder on my command pod. Score! I\u0027m already planning ways to minimize risk on reentry with the additional weight and general ship imbalance. I hit ...and I\u0027m told I can\u0027t enter the command pod because it\u0027s full. W...T...F...?! I try again...and again...as if the game at some point is going to say, \u0022Oh, wait, nevermind. I had that wrong. Go on in, now!\u0022 I crawl around on the crew cabin. No means of ingress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick ALT-TAB and another web search showed me that there appear to be two doors on the crew cabin, but they are ON THE ENDS. Not helpful. The crew cabin is great for space tourism, not so much for a Kerbonaut on the outside wanting in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m starting to sweat, now. It\u0027s 12:30 am and I have to be up at 6:00 for work. Poor Mirbald is stuck on the outside of a rocket hurling through space. A thought occurs to me. Maybe I can access the rear crew cabin door through the service bay. I open the bay doors and get as close as I can, try different angles, but no joy. The batteries are in the way, I guess. In a last ditch effort, I jam Mirbald\u0027s face into the bay and close the doors. Maybe she can ride home in the service bay. As the doors swing shut, her helmet clips through the door, and her body shifts around like she\u0027s going to pop back out. To my surprise the boarding prompt pops up and I smash the key. She\u0027s in!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Kerbal God must have felt I had been through enough, as the reentry was uneventful. What\u0027s more, Mirbald was so grateful, that she decided to leave Research \u0026amp; Development Department and join my crew. The benefits aren\u0027t as good, the pay is lousy and the risk is exponentially greater, if I\u0027m being honest. However, I promised that, unlike her former boss, I won\u0027t leave her stranded in orbit...probably...maybe...well, I promised her that\u0027s not the plan, anyway. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I had tried all manner of clicking on Jeb\u0027s portrait, trying to get him to move to the crew cabin, I later learned that I could have just right-clicked on the command pod and transferred him that way, allowing Mirbald to board the command pod (thanks /u/mildlyfrostbitten for that heads-up). /finalforeheadsmack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-22T21:33:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2024 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 22\u0022\u003EFebruary 22\u003C/time\u003E by Geek.Verve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrect errant bolded font\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-22T21:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Now you can assemble larger craft in orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geek.Verve","CreatedById":232601,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-23T14:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224367991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223799\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221708637369\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Now you can assemble larger craft in orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLol, hardly.

You should end up about 300 m from the target. Repeat firing your engine at the target, but at slower speed like 10 m/s. Remember, the faster you go at the target, the less you need think about the orbit drifting, but you risk not being able to slow down in time. Pack reaction wheels and set the thrust limiter to about 10% for smaller burns within 300 m of the craft.\u00A0 (I don\u0027t really completely understand rendezvous so take my words with a pinch of salt.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-24T01:55:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2024 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 24\u0022\u003EFebruary 24\u003C/time\u003E by Watermel00n\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tony Swallow","CreatedById":229952,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-28T05:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally cool telling the story, complete with facepalms and all!
