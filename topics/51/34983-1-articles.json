So a mission to Moho was being prepared and some factors were taken into account; being close to the Sun, Moho has a (very) high orbital velocity, aerobraking isn\u0027t possible, and the orbit of the planet is heavily inclined ... ! So the KSC came up with this creation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/f53dqg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f53dqg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer-window was already there and therefore the escape-burn began ... ! 3 brave Kerbonauts would go where no man (at least in my game) had gone before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/2yxeq6r.png\u0022 alt=\u00222yxeq6r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the initial burn of between 1500 and 2000 m/s Delta-V the computers calculated the ship would arrive \u0027too early\u0027, or ahead of Moho. A correctional burn of around 850 m/s was needed and after 26 days another 1650 m/s Delta-V was required to match orbital inclination with Moho. The extra fuel-tanks (see first image) where completely depleted and the main tank of the transfer vessel (named Grotesque) was 15% depleted. When entering the SOI of Moho, the relative velocity shocked the crew: 4550 m/s ... ! Returning to Kerbin with this ship was out of the question. The retroburn began early to avoid overshooting the planet and ending up drifting in interplanetary space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/nxubtk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nxubtk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelative velocity was reduced to around 2100 m/s when the fuel-tanks of the transfer vessel were completely depleted.

My strategy is just to completely ignore Moho\u0027s position when I start the transfer.
