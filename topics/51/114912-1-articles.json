Newest save incarnation starts in the 4th post. \n\nThis is now 1.0.4, 64bit on linux. Ckan lists 127 mods at the moment, plus others I added manually. This was always what I wanted to do, honestly. \n\nSo, I\u0027m still working with my original premise\n\n(after a series of disasters, kerbin\u0027s manned space program is shut down, but Jeb and a mysterious benefactor have created a new space center elsewhere on kerbin, from where I will do all my launches. Jeb isn\u0027t telling his team much, but there does seem to have been an alien spacecraft, perhaps secret ancient tech, and a desire for secrecy from the rest of kerbin, be it because manned space programs are outlawed, or just because Jeb\u0027s secrets are potentially dangerous. [Re]Creation of space infrastructure and exploration of New Horizons solar system is planned),\n\nbut I\u0027m going to focus more on the missions and less on specific kerbals or dialogue. Posts below are the original story, mission reports from the new install soon to follow. \n\nEverything that follows in this post is now a bit out of date, but I\u0027m keeping it up so if I ever reach an \u0027end\u0027 of this project, I can look back on it. \n\nGreetings!\n\nI\u0027m starting this story/mission report thread to help focus and share my ideas in a new save, using many mods including the glorious New Horizons Planet Pack.

The story must motivate my missions. I always just unlock tech trees from Mun and Minmus otherwise.\n\n*Fluid Updates and Mod-list changes*, meaning I want to keep playing this save, even if things change or update slightly, instead of the habit I have of starting from scratch with every new release or new mod update. \n\n*Fly ships from IVA using RPM* (and my controller), and fly unmanned ships with kOS scripts. \n\n*Explore new places* without looking up every last detail before I go anywhere. Delta-v requirements will be all different in New Horizons, and there are tons of new places to go!\n\nMost of all: *try new and varied things, and challenge myself to be more creative* with each project, and share what I do so that I can *be exposed to all of your ideas*. Let me know what you think about the format, the story, my ships, etc. \n\nThanks to Squad and all of the mod developers! Also, thanks to my awesome girlfriend who helped me with the story. \n\n**Story:**\n\nIt is nearly thirty years after the first Kerbal reached space. Though the funding for such efforts has all but dried up, die-hard explorers are still reaching into the void, hoping to learn the secrets of long-term space habitation. *Leena Gammara* is the third long-term, manned spacecraft the space agency has recently launched. Their mission: to leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, orbit the Mother-planet Sonnah, and spend several months at Mun, another moon of Sonnah, testing their own health and responses to life in space. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Plus, i wanted to see if i could make a guided return vehicle which could reliably land back at the new KSC, since, in the story, secrecy is a concern. \n\nBasically it goes monoprop-powered glider/return vehicle, fuel, (hypothetical cargo area), fuel, upper stage engine, fuel, lower stage engine. \n\nI had my quicksave all set to test returns from a 100km orbit, and was proud to only slightly overshoot on my first attempt. Most of all I was happy to see that my little glider, even with solar panels, did fine with the re-entry heating. Deadly reentry may not have let those panels through, i\u0027ll have to check...\n\nAnyway, only problem was a terrible glide ratio at low speeds (stubby wings) and a lot of drag (square tail). After some testing I added a few emergency monoprop engines and a safety chute at the stern, to be covered by a decoupler.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/AyX3u)\n\nKerrick looked around himself in amazement while Leonora taxied the vtol plane towards the mission control building. A new space program! They deplaned and approached the building.\n\n\u0022Where is everyone?\u0022 Kerrick asked. Just then he noticed movement overhead, and looked up to see a Kerbal standing on the roof of the mission control building, silhouetted against the sun. A familiar voice called down Kerrick\u0027s name. But, it couldn\u0027t be, thought Kerrick. \n\nThen, the figure on the roof did the unthinkable: it stepped casually off the edge and plummeted down to where Kerrick and Leonora stood. At the last moment, the kerbal deployed his rescue chute and landed nonchalantly in front of Kerrick. \n\n\u0022Jednah!\u0022 Kerrick shouted. \u0022But-what happened to you?\u0022 he stammered. \n\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 Jednah replied, \u0022You\u0027ll never believe the crazy mission I just finished...\n\n\u0022Since we\u0027ve been cut off from our old satellites, we needed to put up a new comms network for unmanned launches. But Jeb is adamant that we keep everything secret, so he decided to put a tiny glider on top of a rocket to make sure I would land back at this space center, instead of wherever my capsule ended up. \n\n\u0022But the rocket was wobbly and my wings kept making it unstable and flipping me over during launch. Eventually, we stole a few jet liner tail fins and stuck them on, and that seemed to work. The problem was, I\u0027m used to launching from the old space center, where the runway faced east! Even with all the fancy new instruments in my cockpit--seriously, it was awesome--I somehow got confused and ended up launching to the west!\n\n\u0022So there I was in a retrograde orbit, but Jebediah being who he is, he just had me level out my inclination on instruments only and go ahead and deploy the satellites backwards! It was all fine until I tried to come home, because I was aero-breaking the wrong way. After everything, I still ended up coming down thousands of kilometers away from the space center! Luckily that was in the middle of the ocean and nobody noticed, but I was really embarrassed when Jeb had to come pick me up in the plane...\u0022 Jedna said.\n\nKerrick cleared his dry throat. \u0022That\u0027s crazy...but not as crazy as the fact that you are alive! Your ship was lost in orbit of Mun years ago! We were all told you were dead!\u0022 \n\nJedna shook his head. \u0022After our systems went offline, we waited almost a week with emergency power. Somehow Jeb got in touch with us, helped us get the ship working, had us land here. Been here ever since.\u0022\n\n\u0022But that was years ago!\u0022 Kerrick cried. \u0022Why did no one tell us at KSA?\u0022 \n\n\u0022I think Jeb should be the one to explain that. All of this is his project. After the ban on space flight, he found some kind of secret backer who helps him pull off this operation. But what I can tell you is that we are not just going out to explore. This all started with what we found on Mun...\u0022\n\n\u0022And what did you find?\u0022 Kerrick asked.\n\nJedna smiled. \u0022Something really cool. Come with me, I\u0027ll show you.\u0022 As the sun set, they all took a [very] long walk to the other side of the space port where Kerrick saw, for the first time, what could only be the recovered remains of an Alien spacecraft.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Usually I line up planes and inclinations, then worry about phasing orbits, but with Aptur it didn\u0027t matter if I was ahead or behind because at some point in each orbit Kerbin will cut just ahead or behind. So I launched into a nearly-matching phase and then worried about inclination and eccentricity. It took a couple orbits, but after two days our crew had achieved the elusive Aptur Capture!\n\nI thought getting to aptur would be the hard part, as the thing is tiny and should have been easy to achieve polar orbit around. But this is when we encountered some strange problems. \n\nFirst, looks like some last-minute adjustments in the VAB had moved one of my comm sats to clip into the orbit scanner. \n\nSecond, our brave kerbals suffered a failure in the robotic arm (read: the cargo bay part had attached to the hinge instead of to the tank above, resulting in a \u0027folding spacecraft\u0027). This prevented the deployment of all instruments except the stock orbital scanner, a huge blow to the mission. But it got worse...\n\nFinally, and someone should tell me if this was a bug or a feature, Kerbin swallowed up my orbit from *inside* Aptur\u0027s SOI.... photo evidence below haha. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

He stayed there for hours while the rest of the team waited, wondering what he would ask of them next."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiber9","CreatedById":144299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:03:04Z","Content":"Kerrick and his team, frustrated by their aborted mission, have barely arrived back at the rogue space center before another rocket is rolled out, but no one seems to know anything about it. Finally, the order comes down from Jeb: Geyser 3 is to launch in a few hours for Mun. Geyser 4 is apparently nearly complete, and will be launched for Serran before Geyser is even arrived at its destination. \n\nAptur can wait. Whatever phenomenon that caused the Geyser 2 spacecraft to be pulled back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI from within a stable orbit of Aptur can be investigated at another time. But for now, Jebediah seems determined to map the other moons of Sonnah. If they didn\u0027t know better, his team might think that Jeb was worried about something. \n\nGeyser 3, and the nearely-identical Geyser 4, have been upgraded from the original design. The previous failure of the robotic arm has been resolved, the floats (which were really just me messing around) have been removed, and additional fuel tanks and life support have been added to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. \n\nEach carries four orbital scanners: \n\n- RADAR Altimetry Sensor\n- SAR Altimetry Sensor\n- Multispectral Sensor\n- M700 Survey Scanner\n\nTheir mission is to remain in polar orbits of their respective bodies until surface mapping is complete. In addition they will test the viability of low-energy transfer orbits from and to Kerbin, as well as communication range and blackout times.\n\nKerbin, on the other hand, can now be mapped using unmanned satellites. So, a few days after the Geyser spacecraft arrive at their destinations, a short, stocky rocket is rolled out of the VAB and launched into a polar orbit. \n\nThe launch goes well, continuing the trend of success at the new space center. Out of the atmosphere, the payload fairing is cast off to reveal the largest satellite yet: a solar-powered Kerbin MapSat equipped with the same suite of scanners used by the Geyser Missions. \n\nAnd finally, with terrain and resource mapping well underway for all three major moons of Sonnah, one more rocket is launched, this time carrying a simple satellite equipped with a narrow band scanner to remain indefinitely in Kerbin\u0027s orbit. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

One morning, as Jebediah\u0027s rogue space center is preparing to roll out another satellite for launch, the warning alarms begin to sound, and the perplexed Kerbals see Jeb running out of mission control towards the hangar. Eventually someone spots the approaching airplane. Spies!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/KfCIm)\n\nAnd so the spy-plane escaped. I had a lot of fun chasing after it for an embarrassingly long time. I\u0027m pretty sure the grapple idea is possible, but eventually I had to stop ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif). I\u0027d love to hear if anyone has attempted something like this. The Interceptor was fitted with a number of parachutes meant to allow the two planes to fall gracefully once the grapple had locked on. Would love to try again some time, perhaps with more similar planes, the speed matching was near impossible. \n\nIn any case, Jeb returned to the space center, but refused to answer the many questions of his team. Many became worried about what punishments they might expect at the hands of the Kerbal government, if they were indeed breaking laws. But Jeb was silent.\n\nThat night, there was an unauthorized landing...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/qfrBg)\n\nJeb went out to meet the new arrival on the tarmac. It was Valentina Kerman."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiber9","CreatedById":144299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T15:17:40Z","Content":"If someday i want to write a ksp novella, there\u0027s no shortage of material. But for now, i\u0027m just going to summarize the story: \n\nJeb and Valentina talk. She has come to warn him that the government seems extremely alarmed by his program. She doesn\u0027t understand it and she isn\u0027t being told everything, because it\u0027s about something more dangerous than just an independent space program. She has come in secret to warn him of an impending attack. \n\nJeb seems to know why the government would attack them. Val is angered and tries to get him to explain. He insists that he can\u0027t tell her yet. He asks her to stay, and to trust him. She says she has to take the plane back or it will be missed, but that she will return soon. She takes off and Jeb gathers his team in front of the astronaut complex. \n\nHe tells them what Val said, and he even admits that there is more going on that just a space program. He offers them a choice; they can bow out now and stay safe, or they can trust him and come with him on a grand journey, exiled in space. He hints that the fate of the whole solar system is in the balance. \n\nNo one chooses to leave. \n\nJeb then lays out a plan of escape: **Operation Launch Everything.** \n\nSome express concern about their ability to build so quickly. Jeb takes them into the VAB, where they stare in shock. All of the equipment they have been using for rocket construction has begun to move... by itself. Something is controlling their production line, turning out parts at an unheard-of rate (Kerbals were already rather fast, after all). \n\nOver the next few days they churn out ship after ship: \n\n(note\\*: I have no idea what I\u0027m doing. I am sort of setting the challenge to not think so hard about getting off Kerbin, and rushed myself in the VAB, to see if we can survive out in space on what I remembered. We will see how it goes:D).\n\nLaunches: \n\n*Spelunker* -- (ignore my misspelling in the game) is a one-man Mun lander equipped with an inline ore drill and designed to mine the mun\u0027s surface. It is the only drill the kerbals currently have. I launched it on a single booster core from the gene kerman lifter, with four BACC solids to extra dv and twr. Launched unmanned. Had some fairing glitches, please ignore...\n\n*ISRU\u002B* -- unmanned launch of 2.5m stack of supplies, ore tank, and ISRU refinery.\n\n*Workshop 0* -- and EPL workship fitted with docking ports. Lack of power generation meant i had to get creative during ascent to make sure I got my Pe out of the atmosphere before the batteries died. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/H2sZB)\n\nMost launches are going into the same plane (about 10 degree inclination due to location of space center). This is the first time I\u0027ve had to worry about launch windows. Makes things extra fun. \n\nThe next morning, Frofurt Kerman is on lookout duty in the observation blimp. He sights an object, coming in fast, and does just as Jeb has instructed him...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/npCWt)\n\nThe blast destroyed Mission Control and the Space-Plane Hangar, but because of Frofurt\u0027s quick action, the Kerbals had plenty of time to evacuate. Shaken, they return to work with more motivation than ever.\n\nMore Launches:\n\n*Geyser 5* -- Based on Geyser 3 and 4, but this time carrying rocket parts and extra tanks for ore, metal ore, etc instead of scanning equipment. The rocket parts were so heavy that I went ahead and added fuel lines to the booster so that the sides would burn out leaving a full center tank. Before I had just had the center throttled down. Chadbur, Jedner, and Jorfrod aboard. \n\n*RegOlMuLan (ROMLan?) (Regular Ol\u0027 Mun Lander)* -- not feeling creative with names. This is a one man mun lander with scanning equipment meant to get more accurate resource data before the drill lands. Launched on a lower stage copied from that stocky satellite launch, plus an upper stage for Mun xfer and three bacc boosters. Standard Fare. Launched without worrying about plane matching and went ahead and burned for Mun xfer. Dudhat is the lucky volunteer to spend lots of time alone in the can. \n\n*Smelter* -- not sure what this part does but in case i need it i put it up there. Lifter was the same as ROMLan but with the boosters and the second stage stripped out. Launched into plane with other craft. \n\n*Geyser 6* -- New design (for this save) mostly based on the SDHI parts plus extra life support and an upper stage. Thing turned out to look a lot like the concept art for the Orion capsule with service module and exploration upper stage. Launched on a single Gene Kerman booster core with Frofurt, Titrice, and Tedgar Kerman at the controls.\n\nAt this point, Jeb just tells everyone to get in a rocket. The VAB seems to not need any help making rockets anymore, so almost the whole staff piles into the next ship. \n\n*Habitation Module 1* -- just a bunch of hab parts and life support. Launched on the same 3-core medium lifter I\u0027ve been using. \n\nThe next launch window sees two launches back to back: one from the Pad and one from the Runway. \n\n*Geyser 7* and *Geyser 8* -- Identical to one another and to Geyser 6 except for the crew, launched only a few minutes apart. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/TvxFy)\n\nThere are now only a few Kerbals left at the space center, including Jeb. They know the attack is coming, and are eager to leave. But Jeb is determined that one final project is completed first. It is taking all of the remaining resources, and he won\u0027t let anyone else into the VAB."}]}
