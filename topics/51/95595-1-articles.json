Basically, this lander can go on exploring a planet (except Eve) and refueling itself for two weeks before it has to return to the main ship. On top of that, it has a really low part count. Only 65 parts!

With FAR and DRE, landing this sucker is no easy task as the rocket has to survive both a brutal reentry at 3 km/s and dynamic pressures of up to 400 Kpa. On top of that, it needs to be able to land on flat ground, or else it will topple over. To survive these hazards, Amenthes has a large 10 meter, 38 ton ablative heat shield and a \u0022feathering crown\u0022 to keep it oriented. After it slows to below mach 1, a parachute deploys and the heat shield is jettisoned. At this point, all 5 main sails will ignite and slow the rocket to a \u0022hopefully\u0022 gentle landing. The Amenthes carries 2 kerbals but it will not descend with them on-board.
