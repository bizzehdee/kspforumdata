Raydrin and Navigator Bob. Bob arranged for a rendezvous with space dock at 75km to refuel and take on the lander carrying the experienced researcher, Jebediah. Jebediah had been in space for months, using the Mun to practice his landing technique. Raydrin said, \u0022I have heard good things about Jebediah, but I understand the extended time in space has taken a toll on him, psychologically.\u0022 \u0022He\u0027s a professional,\u0022 said Bob, \u0022and I have no doubt he\u0027ll come through when it counts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a quick refuel and connection with the tiny lander, Raydrin made formal introductions. Wily old Jebediah introduced himself as the king of cheese, causing his crewmates to chuckle, nervously. Bob made calculations to leave Kerbin using a series of burns at periapsis, to conserve fuel. After a few burns, apoapsis extended beyond the Mun. It took a full day before the next burn could be performed. Trying to break the ice, Raydrin asked, \u0022So, Jebediah, I understand you\u0027re a noted geologist. What are you expecting to find on Ike?\u0022 Jebediah giggled, and said, \u0022Styrofoam peanuts.\u0022 Again, his crewmates gave one another a look and chuckled, nervously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother burn and the Interplanetary Ferry was destined for the space between the orbits of Kerbin and Duna. Bob made further calculations for a burn to encounter Duna, some two months later. The time went quickly. Raydrin and Bob talked about science and philosophy and religion. They invented zero-G games with items around the pod. They watched movies and TV shows that were beamed to them from Kerbin. Jebediah played with his hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the burn came.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s76.photobucket.com/user/willtor/media/KSP/6-15-going_to_duna.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j35/willtor/KSP/6-15-going_to_duna.png\u0022 alt=\u00226-15-going_to_duna.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the next few months, tiny course corrections were made to ensure a good trajectory and encounter with Duna. Bob arranged to put the Interplanetary Ferry inside the atmosphere to use the drag to slow the ship and turn the encounter into an orbit without using very much fuel. This had never been attempted, but Bob had watched a number of YouTube videos that assured him it would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s76.photobucket.com/user/willtor/media/KSP/6-15-at_duna.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j35/willtor/KSP/6-15-at_duna.png\u0022 alt=\u00226-15-at_duna.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob and Raydrin held their collective breath as the red glow of the surface engulfed the ship, which began to shake with the friction. Over the comm, Jebediah sang, \u003Cem\u003EDaisy\u003C/em\u003E over and over again, each verse faster and higher pitched than the last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship achieved orbit with Duna, however, and a second aerobraking maneuver was performed to bring down the apoapsis. This second maneuver also created an encounter with Ike. \u0022Just like I planned it,\u0022 said Bob, confidently. Presently, the Interplanetary Ferry was in orbit of Duna\u0027s moon at 20km. \u0022Time to earn your pay,\u0022 said Raydrin through the headset. \u0022Godspeed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander detached and made an impressively graceful descent. The legs were extended and the lights came on, illuminating the ground below. Jebediah gently set down on the light side of the terminator, extended the ladder, and exited his vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s76.photobucket.com/user/willtor/media/KSP/6-15-landed_on_ike.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j35/willtor/KSP/6-15-landed_on_ike.png\u0022 alt=\u00226-15-landed_on_ike.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaydrin and Bob strained to hear of Jebediah\u0027s progress over the intercom.

Within a few minutes, Jebediah was expounding upon the improvements in DDR3 RAM over DDR2, and the other two crewmembers assumed the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Interplanetary Ferry completed a second orbit of Ike and set its course to escape Duna, using a close periapsis to optimize fuel consumption.

Even with 200m/s, apoapsis is well above the atmosphere.\u0022 Raydrin agreed and the ship came around again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, by this time, periapsis had slipped below 38km, and the orbit decayed rapidly. \u0022Full throttle!\u0022 shouted Raydrin, \u0022We\u0027re losing the orbit!\u0022 A single tear fell from Bob\u0027s eye as he manned the controls. The orbit continued to decay and the ship reached 36km. KSC\u0027s operator came over the intercom, \u0022Your apoapsis is under 75km!\u0022 Bob said, \u0022Ground control, this is Major Bob. Tell my wife I love her!\u0022 \u0022She knows!\u0022 shouted the operator.
