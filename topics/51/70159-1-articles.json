The leaders agreed, and 80 members were selected to head to space. They demanded that a momentous space station be built worthy of housing such devoted worshipers.

It was to be an orbital construction facility with the capacity to build enormous ships. Even completely empty of resources, the beast would weigh over five-hundred and fifty tons, more than double KSC\u0027s prior maximum payload launches. Hundreds of designs and simulations were tested, and all of them failed. The Kult of the Kraken joined in seance and the next day the first successful design was simulated. The Kult claimed it was due to their diligence, when in all reality it was found that the server was running on power saving mode due to the power cable being loose, causing many a destructive frame-skip. The final design was taped and glued together, then hastily sent to space. Eager to get the Kult leaders off-world, KSC enlisted the help of the Devon Supply Group to bring supplies to the massive vessel, and once satisfied the leaders hopped in to a shell made from 5 re-purposed aircraft coach cabins and docked with the station. Victorious, the leaders began their broadcasts to Kerbin, and peace was restored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gP7mh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

With access to a complete, top-notch research, development, and construction facility, the Kult leaders knew that it was only a matter of time before they would be unable to leach off of the vast resources of Kerbin. Their only choice was to slowly begin working on the undermining of the Kerbal leadership, slowly but surely bringing the entire race to their cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first order of business was to establish a more permanent base in the Kerin system. With few aerospace experts on board, the Kult leaders decided a mission to Duna to claim an outpost was in order, and they devised a monstrous machine capable of making the trip as well as roving over the landscape. It was fitted with drilling and mining equipment, kethane and ore scanners, mapping devices, and a small construction pod. Inflatable habitation space would allow some breathing room for the crew of 10.

It was decided that first, they would expand upon their landing site by putting up a few homes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Krakenhome was designed by Freebart Kerman as a welcome and cozy place to relax while still keeping one\u0027s mind constantly focused on the Kraken. Coming in at just over seven tons, it would be the largest construction to be built using the mobile Krabcake\u0027s facilities. This meant it would be a perfect time to test the Seadragon\u0027s counterbalance weight system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince he took charge of the operation, Freebart was the first Kerbal of the Kult to leave the safety of the Krabcake and finally set foot on Dunan soil. Upon inspecting the Seadragon, he noted that it had an access port for filling the counterweight with metal, but the Krabcake didnt have any sort of transfer system installed. Freebart called for a toolbox to be sent out to assist him, and decided to take a nap while they others gathered what he needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe diatom automated rover toolbox was constructed, and several calls went out over the radio in an attempt to wake Freebart. Thinking he was just in a deep sleep, the Kult went ahead and righted the diatom on its wheels before attempting to wake Freebart more forcefully....by dropping the seadragon\u0027s electromagnet on his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing to wake him still, it was decided that the Kult could have a little fun at his expense. Manufacturing a giant claw, Hufred Kerman exited the Krabcake to attach the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cviolent shaking device\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to the seadragon. Several attempts were made to grab Freebart, but the claw passed right through him, as if he were already a ghost. The Kraken was showing itself in full force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHufred planted a flag to mark the burial spot of Freebart, and chanted out in the Kraken\u0027s name. Freebart\u0027s body, suit and all, disappeared in a wisp of smoke. Hufred continued on Freebart\u0027s mission, using the parts from the diatom to fill the seadragon\u0027s counterweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce properly weighted, it was surprising how well the seadragon was able to lift and manuever the seven-ton home. It was set down gently, and it\u0027s solar cells and lights were remotely activated in Freebart\u0027s name. For his services, Hufred was offered the home of Freebart while more were constructed. He got inside, to watch the building of their colony from afar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second Krakenhome was soon set down as gently as the first, and as the seadragon lifted it high the kult felt as if just for a moment, time moved more quickly. But as soon as it started, time screamed to a halt, and the second krakenhome was nothing but a massive cloud above the seadragon, which now swung wildly at the sudden loss of weight against straining servos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodbrett Kerman, the historian in the group, found a reference to the possibility of the number of space-faring parts having to do with the summoning of the Kraken\u0027s rage. Though surely they would try to summon the Kraken itself at some point, now was not the time. It was decided that to better the cause a sturdier launch pad would be built, since it was becoming apparent that seven tons was near the weight limit of the construction pad of the Krabcake. It was decided that their new launch facility would be build upon the sacred ground of Freebart\u0027s grave site, location of the first to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The flag was taken down, as the launchpad would serve as a much better tombstone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Krabcake crawled back slowly as the new launchpad was deployed, the Kult began the work of disassembling much of the unneeded weight and bulk of the Krabcake, reducing it down and renaming it the SLUG, or \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSignificantly Lighter Utility Generator\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Though the vehicle was much faster than it was with the added weight of its original form, the name stuck. Once the process was complete, it was as if the weight of the recycled Krabcake shell was lifted from the Kult\u0027s shoulders as well, as time seemed to move more quickly, and their steps landed much more precisely than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough the SLUG lacked the roominess of its former shell, the Kult still felt as if they now had the room they needed to build a worthy construction site, free from the Kraken\u0027s physics-warping tentacles, at least for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/denm2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Unfortunately, it was soon found that the area immediately above the launchpad appeared to be rather explosive, and every time a root part was placed on the pad it either exploded violently or dissolved in to a fine mist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was decided to take several of the remaining parts from the original krabcake\u0027s construction systems and make a new launchpad with more versatile construction systems to lift constructed components out of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cexplosive air\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 around their feet. Maybe this land has been cursed after all, many of the kult think to themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the help of the new launchpad and the seadragon, a second krakenhome is constructed, and looses but a single solar panel in the moving process. Now that the Kult had a little more room between the two krakenhomes and the SLUG, their gaze was once more affixed to the mountain in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudney came up with a brilliant idea. They could build a blimp that would lift rocketparts and the secondary launchpad over to the mountaintop, for ease of construction! Everyone agreed that this sounded like a swell idea, and with everyone eating sanwiches, a sub themed construction seemed fitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter their lunch, many a blueprint lay scribbled on sauce-stained napkins. Ludney went outside to start construction when he witnessed the large, cursed launchpad vault in to the air at incredible speed. The remaining kult members soon joined him outside, and for several minutes everyone was quiet as the massive launchpad disappeared in to the sky. Several more minutes later, the faint sounds of a massive explosion were heard, and everyone returned to going about their day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction of their new work, Blimpy, went rather smoothly. It was loaded to the brim with rocketparts and helium, then Hubert attached it\u0027s winch cables to the secondary launchpad. Four of the kult members loaded onboard, and Blimpy\u0027s engines were set to full cargo throttle...and they didnt move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReadouts showed that the weight was still several tons too heavy, so the crew began offloading parts. Unfortunately, this caused the weight distribution to be slightly off, and no one thought to shut down the engines, and Blimpy \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbumped\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 one of the krakenhomes, crashing it to the ground. Blimpy then began to gain height, so rocketparts were thrown overboard to continue to decrease weight instead of landing and offloading like a sane team of experts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce airborne and several kilmeters away, the team began to worry that the rolling hills ahead might be too high for their ship to overcome. Attempting to reel in the winches to lift the launchpad had the opposite effect, dragging Blimpy down to impact the hill head-on. Mild damage was suffered, but the team had to push on. They were determined to reach the mountain in the distance. Forgetting that they didnt have the lift to overcome the hill they were on, they met the bottom of the mountain with similar results, lucky enough to release the locks holding the construction pad in place before crushing it under the bulk of Blimpy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStranded twenty kilometers from their landing site, and Blimpy now in questionable flying status, it was debated whether they attempt to proceed with their mission, return home, or call for rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eYa0e\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
