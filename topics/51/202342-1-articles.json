This being a difficult and complex challenge, I decided to jump in at the deep end with the difficulty set to hard, at least as far as Kerbalism is concerned, with only minor tweaks to the settings to reflect the fact that the \u0027plants\u0027 bonus doesn\u0027t seem to be working any more; most of the regular settings are left as they are, but I\u0027m allowing reloads and reverts both to avoid game glitches and to give myself a chance at some practice runs for the trickier landings; landing on the Moon is easier than landing on Tylo due to the much higher gravity and orbital velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the mothership is entirely of my own design, I saw no need to reinvent the wheel when it came to the various landers I\u0027d need to put boots on the ground on every planet and moon in the system, so I took a quick look on KerbalX and found a few promising designs: an Eve ascent vessel, a dinky \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that could be perfect for Laythe. A few minor upgrades were necessary- removing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E equipment, since Kerbalism does its own thing with that and makes it virtually useless as a result, adding radiation shielding and some backup parts in case something important fails and can\u0027t be replaced, and then adapting everything to be lugged around by a single huge craft, requiring some interesting uses of docking ports which should make the design a bit more modular, helping to shed dead weight when it\u0027s no longer needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy pure chance, the upper stage of the Eve ascent craft I found works brilliantly as a lander for pretty much everywhere else, with the obvious exceptions of Kerbin, Laythe and Tylo. With the addition of a single parachute on top for the Duna landing, it\u0027ll work fine for Moho, Gilly, Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Dres, Vall, Bop, Pol and Eeloo. With a good descent stage, it\u0027ll do for getting back into orbit from the surface of Tylo too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe single biggest problem with doing a Kerbalism Grand Tour is Jool. Specifically, the terrifyingly powerful and absolutely vast radiation belts that surround Jool and make its inner three moons incredibly dangerous to approach. The inner belt will mean instant death if you enter it, and extends out almost to Laythe\u0027s orbit; the outer belt is less lethal, but will still kill you if you don\u0027t have a lot of shielding, or even if you do and just stay there too long, and extends out beyond Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DBccwWs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DBccwWs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose radiation belts are driven by solar output and the planet\u0027s magnetic field, so they\u0027re a bit lopsided as the solar wind pushes everything outwards- when it\u0027s closest to the sun, Tylo is right at the very edge of the outer belt and so will have a relatively low level of radiation, making that the best time to land; conversely Laythe\u0027s orbit comes dangerously close to the inner belt when it\u0027s being eclipsed by Jool and even Bop isn\u0027t necessarily safe when furthest from the sun. To survive getting to Vall and Laythe will require maximum radiation shielding, but this is heavy and reduces delta-V by a noticeable margin (though not by nearly as much as it does in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1!). For this reason I plan to have three different variants of that \u0027lander\u0027 design: one with no shielding to land on Eve where any excess weight must be ruthlessly cut to stand a chance of escaping, which will also work for most other planets and moons;\u00A0one with a little bit of shielding to land on Tylo, and probably Moho as well since it has a weird radiation belt going around its equator at low altitude that could be problematic;\u00A0and one with maximum shielding to land on Vall, which I\u0027ll probably carry a second copy of in case of irreparable malfunctions before I get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I\u0027ve spent four days worth of KSP-ing on this, purely doing design and testing work on the main ship, its propulsion systems and the various extra bits that will be needed for this undertaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few screenshots of what I\u0027ve been up to so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JOv3P5d.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JOv3P5d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpoiler alert- yes, yes we will...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022F2B02lR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/F2B02lR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looked a bit like Kerbin rising over the Mun, then Jool showed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZvpmaCV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZvpmaCV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA night flight on Laythe with Jool hanging low over the horizon and Vall lurking at the very top of the image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PbkfBVf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PbkfBVf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Eve ascent craft was fine for the surface to orbit part, but had absolutely no ability to go from orbit to the surface in the first place. Quite a few attempts later I came up with the simple solution of \u0022staple a bunch of big wings to the pointy end to keep it going heatshield first\u0022, which worked better than I was expecting and also means it has some semblance of control via the aerodynamic surfaces, which double as airbrakes too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vI0OiGn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vI0OiGn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne parachute on top and some simple landing legs on the bottom are enough to make the second stage of the Eve ascent craft able to land on Duna too. This kind of reuse is going to be critical to keep the weight and parts count down on this mission. EVA construction will be put to use for this one, another reason to allow F5/F9 since it can be a bit unpredictable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all for now, but I\u0027ll be posting

They have ~2400m/s or so of delta-V each, depending on shielding levels, so will be more than adequate for landing anywhere else- I tested one on Duna and with a single parachute stuck to the top it landed with no issues and made it back to orbit with fuel to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow those, three boosters/space tugs- one of these will do the Tylo descent, another is a spare for that and the third will be used to throw landers around if necessary.

There are three active shields to protect against low level radiation, effective against up to 0.12rad/h which is much more than you\u0027ll get from the sun under normal circumstances, but will do almost nothing at all against the radiation belts of Kerbin, let alone Jool.

They\u0027re colossal overkill in the inner system and by the time I get out to Jool and Eeloo they\u0027ll produce barely any power. RTGs could be the way to go, despite the radiation they emit and the 28 year half-life that will slowly decrease their power output. I\u0027d need about 60 RTGs to produce enough power for Eeloo even after they\u0027d lost half their output, and could attach them to the ends of really long booms to keep them away from the crew section. Those four panels on the core of the ship will be enough to power it anywhere inside of Duna even if one or two fail, then a big cluster of RTGs would provide the power further out with much less mass than those big solar panels and without the risk of part failures.
