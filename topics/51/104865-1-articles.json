It has small rockets and a small engine on the bottom. It has a mobile lab and crew quarters and of course, a command module with a nice view. I\u0027ve decided to term this spacecraft \u0022GMMB-1\u0022 (Germania Mobile Moonbase-One) and the reason for that is because I was doing a alternative history where the Germans won in WWII. Don\u0027t be surprised if you see the WW2 German Flag as the ships insignia (I don\u0027t mean offense to anyone, and if it\u0027s a problem or requested by Mods. I will toggle flag.)\n\nBasically, This is kind of going to be a series and kind of experimental phrase for me so I can workout kinks in bases and what not. Hopefully it\u0027ll work out!\n\n**TESTING PHRASE AND DEMONSTRATION:**\n\n***The Lunar Lander lands on the Moon, a effort to prove that Humans (and kerbals.) can successfully go beyond the bounds of Space. June 17th, 1966***\n\n***The first Human on the Moon walks on to the Lunar surface, a bit clumsily because of the Zero-G. He says to Mission Control, \u0022Beautiful sky, no clouds here. haha.\u0022 June 18th, 1966***\n\n***The flag of the German Republic is planted on the Lunar Surface. The Module prepares to depart from the surface of the Lunar Surface. June 18th, 1966***\n\n**ACTUAL LANDING:**\n\n***The Lunar Mobile Moonbase approaches the Moon for a 15 year Mission to research the Moon and handle research. October 11th, 1975***\n\n***The Lunar Mobile Moonbase lands on the Moon\u0027s Lunar Surface after some time.*** \n\n***--End of Report for now--***\n\nPlease give me some suggestions as to what to put with the base. I\u0027ve made this before I registered here, but so far it\u0027s in it\u0027s first year.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T11:05:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 11:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**\n  \nRemoved images."},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T07:56:14Z","Content":"How about changing your flag?
