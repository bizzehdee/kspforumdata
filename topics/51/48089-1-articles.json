With the help from the newbie thread I was able to group the two Sabre S engines together, and I found the oxidizer component I needed, to at least try the rocket mode. I\u0027m still having a few issues about when it is most efficient to switch from air-breathing to rocket mode, as I wasted the first attempt as my one of the engines had already flamed out and the remaining started me in a flat spin. I was able to recover 3 times from a flame-out and bring the craft back under control. I discovered that I don\u0027t want too much higher than 20,000 m in air breathing mode. I was able to get Spike going over 660m/s in a shallow dive, but I need over 1000m/s to reach Mach 3. I had managed to land her on a beach, but far from the base, I just didn\u0027t have the time or inclination for a return flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ll do some more flight testing before I re-build her with more oxidizer capacity. Maybe I get hypersonic, one of these days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odo","CreatedById":69000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T03:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse turbo engines instead of the basic ones.
