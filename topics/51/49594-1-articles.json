Note that I haven\u0027t done I Mun landing in a LONG time, and I wasn\u0027t goofing around on other planets, I was just barely getting orbit. Everything was going well in this mission, it launched just fine, made orbit at the Mun just fine, and landed awesomely! The landing was the last good thing in that mission... After I got a surface sample, planted a flag, and took the obligatory photo, I hopped back in the lander and though I had PLENTY of fuel. I was wrong. So it was that on this day, Jebediah Kerman took a short sub-orbital hop when attempt to come home from the Mun, and crashed hard into the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Kerpollo 1 design was scraped and will be redesigned from scratch and tested beforehand in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khan_Tiger","CreatedById":58098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T20:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1\u003C/a\u003E A cabin fire during a launch pad test on January 27 at Launch Pad 34 at Cape Canaveral killed all three crew members\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACCommand Pilot Virgil I. \u0022Gus\u0022 Grissom, Senior Pilot Edward H.
