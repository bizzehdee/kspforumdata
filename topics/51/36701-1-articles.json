I am having issues with my fuel lines moving fuel between tanks which honestly I\u0027m having a hard time figuring out. the first 2 section detach fine after using up their fuel, but the final outer layer to seperate just doesn\u0027t want to cooperrate. I would love any tips/suggestion you guys have as I could really use some help on this. Thanks for reading/watching my friends, and thanks for any help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carazvan","CreatedById":73074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T07:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that under high thrust the link between the orange fuel tank and the smaller fuel tank separates on one of the outer engines (that\u0027s why it stars being unequal in fuel usage - you basically lose an engine and it just happens to \u0022stay attached\u0022 because it\u0027s pushing on the base of the orange one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can cut back on thrust to mitigate it slightly but more certainly use struts between top of white 32 tanks and orange tank\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
