Perhaps even first. It was their last day on Laythe, and Macfred decided at the last minute they\u0027d all take a hike down the hill and walk on the shore. Why? Because. It\u0027s the beach. It\u0027s what you do. The whole planet was a beach, endless sand and water, so of course every day was a day at the beach. Of course it was. What else could it be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was hard to believe that this was the first time any of them had been in Laythe\u0027s water, though up to now doing so meant something failed. Badly. Now? Something had gone very right. Almost. It was the beach, yes, but not the beach. Agake didn\u0027t seem to notice. She had waded out helmet-deep to collect water samples. A scientist at work. At work gathering cold, calculated science. The other four still didn\u0027t feel right. Something was off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow could you enjoy the beach in an EVA suit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161106_ksp0690_sunset.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161106_ksp0690_sunset.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it was the last day on Laythe. Why on Kerbin had they waited so long to visit the ocean? Who knows. Some questions don\u0027t have answers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it was over far too soon. Who goes to the beach and only stays there for half an hour? someone in an EVA suit. You quickly learn that yes, floating in the water is nice. Getting out of the water? No so much. Especially when the waves are angry like they always seem to be on this dreadful moon. One wrong splash, one slip, and you\u0027d end up kilometers offshore. Or worse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the biggest downsides of going to the beach in a spacesuit? Bigger than being ragged away by some ocean monster? The mud. Maybe at first it\u0027s not such a problem. Just wade in the water some more to wash it off. And then comes the walk back up the hill. The crawl back up the hill. The slog to get anywhere. Sure, you washed as much of it off as you could, but that water attracted more. And more. And before you knew it your spacesuit was a mudsuit. Mud. Everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it wasn\u0027t the good kind of mud either. This mud was thick and slimy. Would it dry off? Eventually. They hoped. They were still slimy and muddy more than a kilometer later when they reached the top of the hill. They used a few bits of scrap from the ship to peel as much of Laythe off of their suits as they could, but it was a losing battle. Their spaceship was destined to get muddy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rest of the day was mostly just rest and relaxation. Macfred removed the remainder of the excess mass from the LDAV. Mostly this meant the science experiments and other now useless equipment that were\u00A0attached to the lander\u0027s first stage. These bits of scrap joined their comrades on the pyramid. Gletrix helped with the disassembly, Jeb provided moral support. While he was busy doing that, Agake and Thomlock walked to the flag. Agake was in search of the mysterious shadow square, which was nowhere to be found, while Thomlock just wanted to go for a walk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey all made it back in time for the Sunset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161106_ksp0732_sunset.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161106_ksp0732_sunset.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One final sunset.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We hope.

The quiet evening of the ocean moon of Jool was a thing of beauty, something that really touched at the heart of a Kerbal.

No problem. What\u0027s the point of bringing three pilots on a mission if you don\u0027t let them do their jobs? They\u0027d already flown a barely stable aircraft down from space and all around this moon, how hard could it be to sling a shuttle into orbit? He hooked his suit lines into the ship\u0027s and turned on the fans. His suit vented and in no time the rotten smell of Laythe was gone. Mostly. A short reprieve. All that mud? It\u0027ll take them years to clear that out of the ship. The EVA suits were stored and stowed, but the damage had been done. The stench might just be permanent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey waited a few minutes for the Edge of Infinity to drift over the horizon. It was in a high enough orbit that they needed to let it get overhead before liftoff, catching up to it would be easy. Jeb had a crew to rejoin and they had a couple more moons to visit. A quick radio check told him all four of his passengers were ready. All tucked into their gravity seats, anxious for liftoff. Their precious science was stowed safely away, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe brought the three main engines online one by one, giving each switch an animated flip.

He worked the throttle forward until they floated off the sand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Liftoff.\u0022 So long, Laythe.

Weird weird. Everything about this ship was weird. The weirdness was one of the reasons they wanted to use a flight computer for this launch. Thomlock wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d piloted anything to orbit since the Hawk 3-2. His first flight. Usually he was just holding on for dear life. This time was completely different. The LDAV, smooth as it looked, was still not terribly aerodynamic. To make matter worse, the designers, Wernher, Thomlock, et al, had omitted all wings and strakes and other bits. Less mass, easier to land. Less cost. Fewer moving parts. Fewer things to go wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust not easier to take off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese changes meant they had to do a few strange things to keep the LDAV aimed the right way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the airspeed had to stay below 100 m/s until they were out of the lower atmosphere. Easy enough, and they had fuel to spare. Supersonic was right out of the question. Too far into the equivalent airspeed and their little ship would spin out of control. (Thomlock seemed to recall it worked better in Kerbin\u0027s thicker air... for reasons he still didn\u0027t quite understand.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the landing legs had to stay extended. This increased the drag at the rear of the craft, offsetting the drag from its blunt nose and other protuberances. No fins? No problem. We\u0027ll just use the legs instead. The legs would be ditched once they were into the \u0022thin air\u0022 (wherever that was), after which the engine gimbal would be sufficient to offset any lift/drag peculiarities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, they had to keep it aimed absolutely vertically until they were above the thickest atmosphere. The craft was slightly imbalanced, and any serious deviation from vertical would play havoc with its distinct lack of aerodynamic soundness. A gravity turn was one thing, but when you need to stay subsonic and keep your thrust just above the force of gravity, any lean would be fatal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep.
