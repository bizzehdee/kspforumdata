Was my traditional burn to the mun for flyby. \u00A0About 860 delta v. 7km\u00A0passing distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. After just passing the Mun I did a course correction of 130 delta v to send me towards Minmas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Mid course correction of 12 delta v to get my vertical approach to Minmas set (5km passing distance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. A 330 delta V burn after just passing Minmas to again pass it (polar route 5km passing distance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Which shot me back to Kerbin which I hooked around to again intersect the Mun (7km flyby polar route). \u00A0I did a 97 delta V burn at this point to lower my kerbal perapsis to 55k.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. 7 orbits slowly and safely degrading my apoasis reeled me into a nice easy kerbal landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed this without solar panels, on the small sized rockets and boosters and 30 parts over 45 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the tweaks to the planning software are awesome for multiple burns (no twitchy lines that through out calculated burns 40 days later). \u00A0I knew I had 1,445\u00A0Delta V (thank-you excel math)\u00A0and I knew the plan took 1,429.\u00A0 Before I left Kerbin I knew how much the entire burn would be and that I could pass the Mun twice, Minmas twice and do a high pass on Kerbin to boot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
