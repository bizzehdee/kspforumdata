The gravity is heavy enough to hold the ship down, but light enough that you can blast straight up most hills. I would definitely consider using a rover like this to road-trip from biome to biome.\n\nIn the next installment, Dunablab finds a nice, flat landing spot for Gliido--which the spaceplane overshoots by a couple dozen kilometers, Mission Control still not quite believing how thin Duna\u0027s atmosphere really is."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T00:15:44Z","Content":"Next installment: a surface meetup. We\u0027ll leave one Kerbonaut aboard Dunablab, and pick up the rest of the crew for transport back to orbit. \n\nAnyone who\u0027s tried to put a spaceplane on Duna knows there are some challenges. The thin air limits both lift and drag, making it difficult to touch down at a speed that won\u0027t break off landing gear and explode engines. But on the other hand, the light gravity makes VTOL a viable solution. \n\nGliido employs a set of Vernor thrusters arranged around, and close to, the line along which its center of mass will vary as fuel tanks empty. It has enough of them to lift off in Kerbin gravity, so we\u0027re sure to have plenty of thrust on Duna. Regular hypergolic RCS is needed to stabilize the ship in VTOL mode: I find it works best to have the attitude control blocks as far from centerline as possible, so a small bit of thrust gives you the necessary torque to counter the inevitable imbalances. Finally, don\u0027t forget to put the Vernors on an action group so you an disable them--otherwise docking is going to be a nightmare, as you have 4-5kN of thrust in five of six directions, and over 200kN firing whenever you press \u0027K\u0027!\n\nSo anyway here we go--in pictures:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

(800, if I recall correctly). Knowing I would need extra dV to get back to an equatorial orbit, I didn\u0027t incline all the way to 90 degrees, instead aiming for a spot near the south edge of the icecap. And, I missed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). No worries, I did get a landing in a second biome, and this leaves something for my Duna mission to accomplish in V1.0. \n\nHere\u0027s a brief slideshow:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/jCFsT)\n\nSo, what caused the ship to roll down the hill? When it happened I was running Kerbals around on EVA, with time accelerated 4x. I know that sometimes a control input meant for one vessel will steer BOTH of them when those ships have recently been docked. Does the same thing happen between Kerbals and ships? Or was the physics warp simply high enough that the frictional force of wheels on the ground got lost in a rounding error, and gravity won the tug of war?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:05:26Z","Content":"When you physwarp near a ship with wheels, usually the vehicle will roll backwards even if the parking brakes are set."},{"CreatedByName":"Wabbit","CreatedById":110502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:10:07Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had my Laythe rover fall into the ocean with no means of recovery because of that little glitch."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:17:20Z","Content":"Aha, thanks to both of you for confirming that!

View full album](//imgur.com/a/SYMsy)\n\nHad a bit of an adventure lifting off from the surface; while I was distracted taking pictures I achieved Ike escape velocity! But did manage to correct before I got too high, and set up an intercept with Kerbin Maru within one orbit.\n\nFollowing these missions Kerbin Maru is left in Ike orbit with about 1800dV, and the Gliido spaceplane is in LDO with about 1500. Both ships are slated to return to Kerbin on the next transfer window, but by that time I will likely be starting all over again in V1.0.\n\nThanks everyone for your views, and your comments!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T17:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Dilsby**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T21:43:38Z","Content":"Is that Astronomers Visual pack?
