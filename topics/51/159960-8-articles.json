At this point we were in zero gravity mode, as we were free-falling towards the top of the elevator track\u2026 It\u2019s a bit confusing to explain, but for the first bit of the journey, we accelerate at a few G forces for a few minutes to build up velocity, and then we stick to 1g for a bit, and then we\u2019re in free fall for the better part of an hour, letting gravity slow us down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, we\u2019re also being confined to the tower, which is moving sideways relative to a straight up and down trajectory, so there\u2019s some gravitational weirdness there, but it\u2019s mostly unnoticeable. As we\u2019re coasting to geostationary orbit, or kerbostationary orbit as it may be called, there is less and less acceleration due to gravity, so we have to sit on the ceiling for the last bit, accelerating at 1-2 g forces, to prevent us from just shooting on by the end of the elevator shaft. Don\u0027t worry, the elevator is designed for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the tower went up further than that, we\u2019d be flung out by centrifugal force rather than pulled in by gravity. Jeb told me that there is in fact a giant counterweight but nothing goes there, it\u2019s just a giant cable attached to an asteroid or something. You could, in theory, visit it by climbing the cable, but there are very few vehicles that can climb it. Those\u00A0were the old cable climber cars used during construction and for the occasional maintenance project. In the past decade, they had\u00A0only been used for routine inspections and for the occasional tourist visit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u2019m getting off topic. I went up the ladder to the top dome of the elevator car. It was a nice change of scenery, the bottom dome was locked because of some pressure concerns (which would be addressed after it reached the top, where it could be worked on without the threat of falling all the way back to Kerbin), and the middle section was mostly filled with people interviewing or interrogating Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kqvfmFA.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kqvfmFA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAaah, off topic again. So there was a ladder, and I went up\u2026 But up is relative as first off, we\u2019re in space, and second we\u2019re in a pod that changes gravitational direction once every trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, that\u2019s another off topic statement. So is this one. And this one. And yeah I\u2019ll stop now, I promise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe top dome had only a few Kerbals in it, there were two older ladies chatting, and a guy reading something on his tablet with headphones in. All three were belted into their chairs as we were in zero-gee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, magnetic boots. You see them in old sci-fi movies, and they\u2019re impractical for walking because they stick, but Kerbals found a way to computer control them so they can more accurately simulate walking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, for real. That was the last time, I swear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in that dome, stuck to the base of the cabin by her magnetic boots, disguised as a Kerbal, was Evelina, looking down over Kerbin. I took a breath, counted to three, and walked up to her side, immediately forgetting the things that I had rehearsed in my head for the past fifteen minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GmfeJ44.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GmfeJ44.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi,\u201D I said, my voice only squeaking a little bit. She did not respond. She was\u00A0still keeping her eyes fixed on what little bit of Kerbin we could still see at this point. As far as trying to find out what I was supposed to say, well... I probably stood there with my mouth wide open, my mind drawing a blank for several seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, uh... About the, uh, events of the, I mean, on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E roof...\u0022 She continued staring out into space, signaling that she probably didn\u0027t want anything to do with me at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh...\u0022 I started again. \u0022This is going to sound much better in my head, just to let you know... What you said back on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, about not wanting to jeopardize a friendship for the sake of a relationship... I just wanted you to know that I totally agree with you on that, and what you said about maybe liking me but also thinking of me as a great friend and not wanting that to get in the way of that and, well, you know. I share those same feelings. About staying friends, I mean. Especially given what\u0027s going on, you know, with the probable end of the world and stuff.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*crickets*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So basically, what I\u0027m saying is, you don\u0027t have to feel weird or awkward about this or anything, not unless you want to be mad at me... And I think you\u0027re probably not mad at me... Are you mad at me? Are you mad at yourself?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sound except for the muffled conversation between Jebediah and the rest of the Kerbals on the elevator, a few floors down. I turned towards her and got a little bit closer for the next part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, Evelina, you\u0027ve got to give me something here, I\u0027m about to - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, hi, Ethan,\u0022 she said\u00A0as she turned her head to face me. \u0022Sorry, I had my earbuds in, what were you saying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECue internal screaming\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, uhh...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m going to guess you were going to talk about the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, technically I already did talk about it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How long were you standing there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Long enough to say the whole thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh.

I mean, I\u0027m in space!

You\u0027re an amazing person and I feel like we could work either way, but given the, uhh... straining... circumstances, I think we should continue being friends. I mean, um, at least for now, maybe.\u0022 Internally, half of me was relieved that I had gotten it out, but the other half of me tensed in anticipation of her response, so my overall stress level remained the same. And my entire mind was screaming \u0022WHY IN THE WORLD DID I ADD THAT LAST SENTENCE?!?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright,\u0022 she responded. I waited for more. After a few seconds I didn\u0027t think it would come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright? That\u0027s all?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does there have to be more?\u0022 she chuckled. \u0022Introducing artificial awkwardness into the situation won\u0027t make it any better... What little there is is already too much. You agree with me, I agree with you, what more is there to it?\u00A0So, are we cool?\u0022 She held out her hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re cool.\u0022 I reached out with the idea of a handshake in mind, but instead she yanked me off of my feet twisted me around so I was spinning very fast in the air. \u0022AH!\u0022 I yelped. She laughed. In a good way, though. After a second or two I grabbed onto something and managed to stop spinning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Interesting fact, the very edge of the floor is not magnetic,\u0022 she said with a slight smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, wait, something just occurred to me...\u0022 I began.\u00A0\u0022Would playing \u0022The floor is lava\u0022 be more or less entertaining on a spaceship?\u0022 She stopped for a second and thought a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s really interesting, actually. It would be easier to stay off the floor but what if you made the ceiling lava, as well? Or maybe everything except objects of a specific color?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean, we could try it,\u0022 I suggested. \u0022We\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in a spaceship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, there\u0027s other people here,\u0022 she said, \u0022And the geometry of the elevator car is fairly simple, the game wouldn\u0027t be very entertaining. But there are other interesting games one could play on a space elevator.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Like what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The game,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina!\u0022 I said, a bit louder than usual. \u0022Alright, I\u0027ll give you that one, I lost.

She made a move to dodge, but I managed to just barely nick her foot. \u0022Tag!\u0022 I pushed off the base of the bottom of the hemisphere and tried to run around the curved part like a track.

If I remember right, the elevator car diameter is about 10 meters, meaning that the little tiny car on that image was the size of the first stage of the Saturn V. WOW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, looking back on that image, you may notice a spot where the track sections don\u0027t line up. This is normal. The whole section rotates to change which track an elevator car is on, and will also move so the cars can be taken to the servicing area, which this one was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P89kQR5.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/P89kQR5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe car slowed to a crawl, and the stopped a few seconds later after aligning itself with the docking ports on the tower. There was a click, a hiss, and the start of a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You may now leave your seats\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0announcement, but after the first word, everyone stood up and began making their way\u00A0toward\u00A0the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring my journey to the door, I passed under the open hatch to the dome, and looked up at the top of the tower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022utmOfXm.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/utmOfXm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, there you are, Ethan! And Evelina!\u0022 said Jebediah, cheerfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s the news?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I\u0027ve got another collection of fan contact information, and I\u0027ll respond to their messages using my custom personality AI running on a dedicated semi-supercomputer on Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think what Ethan means,\u0022 said Evelina, \u0022Is have you found a ship?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. It\u0027s not ideal, but I\u0027ve found one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes!\u0022 We exited the cabin, but we didn\u0027t have much time to look around before Jebediah herded us into another elevator of sorts, the horizontal type that would move us along R8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How far away is it?\u0022 I asked. The horizontal elevator (which is a bit of an oxymoron now that I think about it) accelerated fairly quickly and took us away from the tower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A few hours, maybe one if we go fast?\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 I said. This \u0022horizontal elevator\u0022 must not be going as fast as it felt. We were still accelerating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Question,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022How in the world do you power all of this stuff? Particle accelerators, skyhooks, space elevators... I haven\u0027t seen anything other than small solar panels on the surface of Kerbin!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, that... I forgot to disable your optical filters for the P system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022P system? Like the R system?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hold on. I can\u0027t disable it now, so look out the window at Kerbin.\u0022 We obeyed. \u0022Now imagine two giant towers, one on each pole, the height of these ring towers. Now imagine there are giant dishes on these poles. Like, Mun diameter dishes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Those are some really big dishes,\u0022 I remarked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, captain obvious.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Originally, we covered Moho in solar panels and beamed it to those dishes, but we don\u0027t do that any more. We built three planet sized lens and mirror systems, really close to the sun, so two will always be in sight of Kerbin in case one breaks. Those reflect highly concentrated light\u00A0to another set of two lens and mirror systems at Sun-Kerbin L5, which focus\u00A0the beams\u00A0onto another system in a high Kerbin elliptical orbit, of which there are also two, both as a backup and in case the beam is eclipsed by Kebrin,\u00A0which focuses it onto either of the new, modified Kerbin polar dishes, which then convert it to power.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 I said. \u0022You\u0027ve got planet sized mirrors to generate your power?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah,\u0022 Jebediah said like it was a normal, everyday thing. Which I guess it was, for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why the complexity? That\u0027s, what, seven lenses and two receivers?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, if you\u0027re going to have one system that your entire planet relies on, that could also melt the entire planet if it aims a\u00A0few degrees off, you want to build as much redundancy into that system as possible. Each system has minimum 5 abort systems and 30 layers of safety systems on every subsystem. If the slightest thing goes wrong, the beam can be diverted to a preprogrammed empty point in space within milliseconds. The prior stage of mirror can divert the beam to miss the faulty stage, before redirecting to another mirror. In an absolute emergency, we can shatter the mirror to prevent it from reflecting towards the planet at all, or rapidly adjust the lens so the beam disperses enough to be mostly harmless.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And those are just the cool sounding ones! Think of it as the way you build nuclear power plants, but with a thousand times the safety protocol.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In theory, at least,\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 asked Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve had several poorly built nuclear power plants.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Well... I\u0027m not an expert in human analogies. Anyway, it\u0027s time to get off the car!\u0022 said Jebediah, hopping up from his seat. In my fascination I hadn\u0027t notice the shift in acceleration, somehow. The door opened into a hallway with several Kerbals waiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Final boarding call, Apoapsis Spacelines flight 439. I repeat, final boarding call.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was ushered into a tube that appeared to connect the large, hexagonal ring section to a smaller circular segment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NSwzZnq.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NSwzZnq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022l6I2elh.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/l6I2elh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022What is this? Where are we going?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahh, I should have told you this earlier instead of wasting time on power generation, sorry for the sudden shock,\u0022 said Jebediah. If he was a human he probably would have facepalmed.\u00A0\u0022Long story short, there are no suitable\u00A0ships at R8, so we\u0027re going to R9.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where in the blazes is R9?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Mun. Also, sorry for the antiquated spaceship, it\u0027s a third generation Ring Runner, one of the last twenty or so in service.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eapologizing\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to me for taking me to the Mun in a spaceship?\u0022 asked Evelina incredulously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, right. This isn\u0027t normal for you, sorry to keep forgetting that. Into the ship, on you go!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me, sir, are you Jebediah Kerman?\u0022 asked the employee standing by the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, ma\u0027am. Here is payment for me and two guests.\u00A0You have seats, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course! This time of the year, always! I never thought I\u0027d get to meet the real Jebediah Kerman! Can I get your autograph? And one for my friend, she\u0027s a really big fan!\u0022 She accepted the payment, as well as the autographs, and let us on. Almost immediately the port shut behind us. We found three open seats in the forward section of the passenger compartment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome aboard the MMTS ActOfGazingVacantlyIntoTheDistanceDuringADramaticSunset for Apoapsis Spacelines Flight 439.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s quite a mouthful,\u0022 I said, wondering why they sped through the title so fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you mean?\u0022 asked Jebediah. \u0022ActOfGazingVacantlyIntoTheDistanceDuringADramaticSunset isn\u0027t a long word at all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You just said, like, 10 words really fast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 said Jebediah. \u0022You mean you don\u0027t have a word for that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you should. Most planets do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Please remain seated for the departure phase of the mission. Attention passengers, on this trip we have been gifted the privilege to transport a VIP passenger. He as\u00A0an urgent agenda. As a result, we will travel to the Mun at Impulse 4 instead of Impulse 2, leading to heightened G forces and shorter transit times. Please brace yourselves. Undocking now.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0There was a click as the ship undocked from the ring. There was also cheering from around the ship at the increased speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224OxRxZS.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4OxRxZS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, Jeb!\u0022 asked Evelina excitedly. \u0022What is this ship powered by? Chemical fuels? Nuclear fuels? Some sort of high thrust ion drive?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022None of those,\u0022 said Jebediah. The ship maneuvered close to one side of the tubular enclosure and began to accelerate forwards, curiously (in away that was both unsettling and really, really cool at the same time) without any sign of actual propulsion.\u00A0\u0022You see, this cylindrical extension to the ring? In human terms, it\u0027s basically a toroidal planet-sized\u00A0railgun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 I asked, \u0022This system is powered electromagnetically?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yup!\u0022 said Jebediah. \u0022The track splits off at one point to an aiming tube, which can move around\u00A0with high precision, allowing us to target the Mun, Minmus, or any planet in the system, although that third option isn\u0027t used much any more.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you can shoot a ship at the Mun and hit a target that can\u0027t be\u00A0more than 25\u00A0meters wide?\u0022 asked Evelina wide eyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sometimes,\u0022 said Jebediah. \u0022This particular model of ship uses Hall effect thrusters for course corrections. All ships using this system are required to have some form of course correction system. Running into the Munar ring at 4 kilometers per second every 10 launches is not a pleasant or financially viable way of doing things.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Initiating 7 g acceleration in 5... 4...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d suggest putting your head back,\u0022 said Jebediah. We both complied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u00222... 1...\u0022\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EInstantly, I felt my weight multiply as I was slammed backwards into my chair, and the ring began flashing by faster and faster. Evelina had a grin on her face, she was clearly enjoying this. I suppose I would be just as enthusiastic as she was if this was my first time going to a moon. Not that I wasn\u0027t enthusiastic, I certainly was. But I also couldn\u0027t contort my face into a smile, due to the acceleration.\u00A0We were basically getting shot out of a gun, after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the hull began to tremble and creak.

Which you should.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn one of the compartments, I found a Whack-A-Kerbal set that was apparently standard issue for this type of ship. It was obviously old and hadn\u0027t been used for a while. I almost invited Evelina and the others in the module to play, but then I remembered that this was Evelina\u0027s first ever time experiencing this... She could spend all the time at the windows that she wanted to. Nevertheless, she asked me about it and I gave her a brief explanation. She said it was insanely cool, but Kerbin took priority.

But she actually looked more dissatisfied than panicked. She was fiddling with the slide latch, and it looked pretty stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh boy,\u0022 I said as I reached to take my helmet off so I could better help her. \u0022Uhh, mine\u0027s stuck too.\u0022 I started to panic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, great.

As it turns out, all of the seats had rotated to facilitate the reverse in acceleration direction.\u00A0The observation deck had a few open seats, mostly because the previous occupants were in the main module, mobbing Jeb even as they took their seats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tiZbxOV.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tiZbxOV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Braking in one minute. If you have not taken a seat, please do so. If you are unable to find a seat, retrieve a pillow from the underside of any seat and lay against the braking wall, head and hands back.\u00A0Deceleration will be exceptionally bumpy do to the Impulse 4 transfer. There will be a slight delay in reaching the station, we are letting our VIP passenger - \u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0There was a lot of cheering at this -\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0022We will be letting our VIP passenger - and guests - off at their destination first. In addition, to speed up the transit, we are coming in in a retrograde direction. Traffic is low, and we are in touch with control.

Thirty seconds later, the MMTS ActOfGazingVacantlyIntoTheDistanceDuringADramaticSunset entered an aiming track, was pushed into a main track, and began decelerating at seven to eight gees, which is not good for a human.

At that moment, Jebediah popped in and sat down (without a chair) next to us, but not before tossing autographs to the other two Kerbals in the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahh, finally!

It comes with multiple cargo bays, advanced nuclear maneuvering engines, and most importantly, one of the few dozen K-drives still in operation, although it is quite a bit more advanced than the old ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How much more advanced?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, the Memories was designed for building space stations around nearby planets. But this? This isn\u0027t just a spaceship... This is a starship, designed for exploring other worlds around other stars, later converted to a ceremonial transport ship, later converted for galactic tourism, now sitting at the docks, unused for quite some time.

Would the presence of weapons just stress them out more? Would the Galactic Council strip him of his title for using weapons? Probably not. Whole planets were making weapons this very instant. Whole planets were being attacked, agonizingly slowly. The council was a mess.

No, he decided. Just like the many mirrors and lenses powering Kerbin, weapons would be another layer of security. Another failsafe. Just in case.

I was bundled in a blanket, my eyes almost unable to stay open. It was the scheduled nighttime on the mission. We had just finished watching Star Wars episode IV, the latest film in our interplanetary movie marathon. It had been going on for several weeks. Each crew member was given a turn at choosing a movie, including the Kerbals. Apparently, Kerbin\u0027s action movie industry sucks. At least from my perspective. Probably because they are so against violence that the smallest acts of evil are a huge deal and are blown up astoundingly in film from a human perspective. The widely held belief that violence should usually not be answered with violence makes most movie plots vastly different than what would be expected from an Earth film.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal romance movies are also very weird.

I wished we had popcorn up here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022First off, not all planets have a film industry. One intelligent species in the Union hasn\u0027t independently developed the steam engine yet and prefers to stay that way. They use borrowed technology to attend the council meetings. But, most developed planets do have film industries. However, we then have to deal with languages and translation... The biggest problems occur with how information dense each language is. That can greatly affect pacing. For example, one language may be able to convey ten times as much information per syllable as another language. Imagine watching a movie at ten times speed, or a tenth speed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who used to always watch YouTube videos at 2x speed, watching a movie at 1/10 speed would be terrible. I might be able to do 3x speed or maybe 4x speed, but no way, not 10x speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then there\u0027s the average length of a movie. The Draftignitarons can live ten thousand Earth years, have huge bladders, and live on a planet which rotates very slowly. Their movies average two Earth days long.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s like, the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe in one movie!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A really long superhero series that\u0027s really popular with the Humans. You might enjoy it, but you probably won\u0027t.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then the Draftignitarons have series as well! One of them has about a dozen good movies! But then there are the Jslans! Poor Jslans... A human could live a hundred Jslan generations. Watching that entire film series could take up a very significant chunk of their lives... Like, several percent!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yikes. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not a Jslan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Jslans are actually some of the happiest known creatures ever. Maybe because of their short life cycle, they appreciate life more than anyone else... And their planet is amazingly beautiful. I almost wish I had been born a Jslan.\u00A0Almost. Anyway, back to films. You think our space disaster films are good? Well, one species has an entire uninhabited planet with a thin, tall atmosphere just for filming things exploding in space. Because of the atmosphere, the orbits decay pretty quickly. And there are also some aquatic species, or even those that live in different fluids, or some that only see in black and white... Some have vertical eyesight, even. All of this makes the transfer of movies very difficult.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is all very intriguing and interesting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, you haven\u0027t heard anything yet!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EY, it appears we have a very strange occurrence.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EElaborate, X.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWe have found a way to increase efficiency invading Galaxy 1487135521-A382.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd our simulations have not discovered this?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThere was a 99.99 percent chance that additional simulations would not predict an outcome with a better energy used to energy gathered ratio.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESo why did you run more?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA very unlikely occurrence within that 0.01 percent has happened, leading us to explore the possibilities, as there was a 60% chance for energy gain.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EVery well.

And there were\u00A0at least twenty locks keeping it shut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI asked Jeb about it and he said \u0022Hopefully we won\u0027t need to open it but I think we will.

How did they manage that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Reusability, refueling, and turnaround. They made giant nuclear powered spaceships which would aerobrake at Jool and Kerbin.

Going through Jool\u0027s radiation belts, using cheap, dirty nuclear engines, and long stays on Laythe were not good for the tourists. Or the staff. Or the colonists.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ouch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s why the Kerbals never colonized or terraformed\u00A0Laythe. They are looking at building a giant radiation shield, but they have more pressing matters right now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbals are that sensitive to radiation?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. Apparently Laythe would almost be safe enough for colonization by humans.

She smirked and turned her disguise off for a fraction of a second. \u0022Evelina! We\u0027re not supposed to do that!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, I thought you thought my face was beautiful.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When did I say that?\u0022 (Not that I disagree!) We were about to continue when Jeb\u0027s voice came over the intercom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina and Ethan, please be advised. We are approaching our destination.\u0022 I knew it had to be coming soon. Once we had turned around to start slowing down I knew we were about halfway through our journey. Still, it caught me off-guard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you going to tell us where we\u0027re going yet?\u0022 yelled Evelina to the microphone on the other side of the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just look out the window,\u0022 Jeb said. So I stood up and looked out the window. Sure enough, far in the distance, there was one star that appeared to be steadily growing larger instead of flashing past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MyFWRVt.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MyFWRVt.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Big surprise, it\u0027s a star,\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And we\u0027re the first humans to see this star up close!\u0022 I said, my eyes glued to the window as the star drew ever nearer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Entry will be extremely bumpy,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022Please hold onto something.\u0022 This statement seemed odd to me, given that the only bump there had been on the entire trip was when we turned the ship around.

I thought we were doomed, it felt like riding an extremely fast, old wooden roller coaster.\u00A0Throughout this, the star\u00A0got bigger and bigger as the gravity ring spun around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ApE0ZRu.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ApE0ZRu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s beautiful!\u0022 Evelina\u00A0managed to shout over the roar (which was subsiding), despite being pressed against the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gmFJy7r.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gmFJy7r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we shot past the star. I was concerned for only a fraction of a second before I realized that we were probably going to a planet around the star, and sure enough, there it was, a tiny dot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in about two seconds it went from a dot to...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PDjzKJU.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PDjzKJU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qkl9O0S.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qkl9O0S.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dQhin1P.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dQhin1P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the ship stopped, along with the vibration. The K-drive was visibly cooling off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvelina and I were shocked for a few seconds. Eventually I managed to say \u0022So I guess we\u0027re not the first humans to see that star up close, then.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Welcome back to Earth!\u0022 said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wha... Why are we here?\u0022 I asked, while also looking out the window. It was the first time I had seen Earth from this perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All in good time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And didn\u0027t you cover the entire planet in purple Jell-O?\u0022 I asked. \u0022That I had to walk through for like two weeks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022False. We covered the entire solar system in purple Jello-O. We just upgraded it, it\u0027s pretty clear now. We\u0027ve also invented a device which will unfreeze a 100m-ish diameter sphere around the ship. So we can still move around\u00A0and stuff. Actually, hold on a second.\u0022 The K-drive started up once more, changing our orbital direction significantly. A few seconds later it was off again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hKb69Ad.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hKb69Ad.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Congratulations, you are now the first humans in a polar orbit around Earth.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, so what was the big disturbance near the star?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022Was because we were going too fast for the Jell-O bubble generator to keep up, meaning that we basically just rammed through the Jell-O at several times the speed of light, which wasn\u0027t really good for the ship. Or the Jell-O. Or spacetime integrity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It doesn\u0027t seem like the phrase \u0022Several times the speed of light\u0022 should be good for anything!\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I realize you\u0027re awestruck by the view, but I\u0027d appreciate if you would get up to the control deck.\u0022 Evelina and I managed to tear ourselves away from the window and go up the ladder that led back to the core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bsZhR4w.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bsZhR4w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EqfNXC6.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EqfNXC6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Alright.

In Kerbal it sounds menacing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That doesn\u0027t tell us anything,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a very small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E designed to be able to explore most atmospheric worlds. But in order to fit that functionality into such a small space,\u0022 he began opening the door, \u0022We had to build some... dangerous... technology.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming form the people that store antimatter like it\u0027s gasoline,\u0022 I pointed out. The door was open. It led to an airlock. We all stepped in and Jeb shut the outer door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The ship that I am about to show you has a large amount of liquid hydrogen, a nuclear reactor, an unshielded direct cycle nuclear ramjet, and an unshielded laser induced inertial fusion engine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You had me until the fusion part,\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh boy. So you know how a nuclear rocket works, right? Well, instead of using fission to heat the propellant, it uses fusion. And spews neutrons all over the place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022And - \u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If I have to spend three weeks telling you how it works we\u0027re not going to have time to save the galaxy! Anyway - Once I open the other side of the airlock, we\u0027ll be irradiated as I turned the reactors on remotely to save time. I\u0027ll have at most seven minutes to get into the cockpit, which is shielded by the nuclear reactor, before I experience significant damage. You two will be fine unless you take an hour.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enuclear reactor\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is the shielding?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, there\u0027s structural stuff in there too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And the seven minutes is \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E these heavy suits?\u0022 Evelina asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know what, let\u0027s just go. Go through the cockpit to the passenger compartment. Obviously I\u0027ll be the pilot.\u0022 With that, he opened the hatch and we found ourselves in the dark cargo bay of the Legacy II.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225U2aMRg.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5U2aMRg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow...

Opening bay doors. Undocking.\u0022 There was a long clang. \u0022And, jetting forward.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What kind of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E does this thing use?\u0022 asked Evelina. \u0022Meta-fusion, hall effect, quasi-stable quantum whatever? Maybe even antimatter?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, just normal hydrazine.\u0022 There was a thump as the DAAWEV hit something. \u0022Oh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J68Sv7j.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/J68Sv7j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t tell me that this thing won\u0027t fit!\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They got it in here somehow, I can get it out.\u0022 There was some worrisome scraping and clanging as Jebediah fired the thrusters.

Wyvern, it is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here goes nothing,\u0022 said Jeb. We waited earnestly for something to happen\u00A0for several seconds. \u0022Err... Technical difficulties with the inertial fusion system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What sort of - \u0022 There was a sudden roar from the back of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220o8W14W.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0o8W14W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There we go!

This thing shouldn\u0027t melt, the DAAWEV - or Wyvern - is\u00A0coated in an extremely heat resistant paint.

That and the heat gauges. Jeb, as if reading my mind, said \u0022It\u0027s been forever since I\u0027ve flown one of these, I forgot that it\u0027s more of a brick than a plane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can you land it?\u0022 asked Evelina. Jeb turned around (somewhat disconcertingly as he was flying us through re-entry), looking somewhat offended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, I am Jebediah Kerman. I can land anything!\u00A0I landed a particularly aggressive moon once!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You meant to say \u0022On\u0022 a moon, right?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pssh, landing\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eon\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0moons is easy. Landing moons is quite a bit harder.\u0022 I began to ponder how exactly one would land a moon on something before I was interrupted by the craft suddenly spinning, causing the g-meter to raise dramatically. It reminded me of my first spaceflight, on the so-called \u0022Hype Plane,\u0022 all those months ago, mere hours after the Kerbals had abducted all of humankind...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FHW1hhS.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FHW1hhS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, good news and bad news,\u0022 announced Jeb. \u0022The thermal paint is intact. Mostly. But due to unexpected turbulence, probably due to the fact that only a 100 meter diameter sphere around the craft is not jell-o, we\u0027re going to fall short of Kirtland. But we do have an infinite range jet engine, so we should be good. We can get there at the amazing speed of three kilometers per second. We\u0027ll just have to irradiate some more air.\u0022 There was a loud bang. \u0022Ah, that was the ladder exploding.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You mean melting,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I\u0027m pretty sure it exploded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why do you need to build a ladder out of explosives?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wBsRh4r.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wBsRh4r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s just slow down a bit so we can cool off.\u0022 I agreed with him, that seemed like a good idea. After a one or two minutes of deceleration, the Wyvern was now \u0022just\u0022 supersonic. Jeb leveled out. \u0022Okay, firing up nuclear ramjet. To Kirtland!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then nothing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Err...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We seem to be having a lot of technical difficulties today,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022When was the last time this craft was flown?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A few decades if we\u0027re lucky.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And when was the last time it had maintenance?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I may be a galactic representative and one of the best pilots in the galaxy, but I don\u0027t know everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait... Are we stuck here now?\u0022 I asked, beginning to panic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No! Well, maybe. It\u0027s probably an easy fix, the reactor is working, just not the engine. I think. I wish Bill was here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean, worst case scenario, we\u0027re stuck on Earth,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022How\u0027s that going to be different than the first decade and a half of our lives?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hope you like Grape Jell-O,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not actually Jell-O, you know,\u0022 clarified Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, what now?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We land and try to fix it. I mean, really, what kind of a question is that? It\u0027s sort of obvious, if something mission critical is broken, you try to fix it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you have tools?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh...

A second later, the sky cleared in an instant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How did you do that?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002214exLNS.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/14exLNS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve told you several times, if I explain every single bit of technology we\u0027ve invented, we won\u0027t have time to save the galaxy.\u0022 The Wyvern stopped a few dozen meters from the strange obelisk. \u0022Alright, the reactor is in standby mode, so you should be fine to exit the craft. At this point you should be able to hug it and not receive a lethal dose of radiation for at least a few hours.\u0022 Jeb opened the hatch and air flooded in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a poetic moment. Despite having been back to Earth once before, I had not breathed the air, as it had all been Jell-O. And it would have been extremely poetic if I had gracefully climbed down the ladder, gazed around, and taken a deep breath of the fresh, warm desert air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept the ladder had exploded so I fell onto the sand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ow!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, right.

Evelina and I followed him closely behind. It was at this point that I noticed a few small buildings, and a fence in the distance. It\u0027s a miracle we didn\u0027t hit the fence on the way down, actually... Why hadn\u0027t we spotted them on the way down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere appeared to be two plaques on the obelisk.

To the ones who allowed them to be used. To the ones who supported it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s generally agreed that the bombs saved more lives than they took,\u0022 I said. I instantly regretted taking the conversation in that direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At the time, most experts thought Japan was not going to surrender without a massive invasion. The bombs are thought to have scared them into finally surrendering.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And how many lives would this invasion have taken? A hundred thousand?\u0022 said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Many hundred thousands at the best.\u0022 Jeb gasped.\u00A0\u0022Millions at its worst. Vastly more than the quarter million lives taken by the bombs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys, are we really having this discussion\u00A0now?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if they were going to lose anyway, and\u00A0suffer mass deaths, why didn\u0027t they surrender or talk it out?\u0022 asked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because they believed that surrender was a terrible thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, maybe they thought that they\u0027d be treated the way they treated their enemies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And how was that?\u0022 I was about to list off all of the terrible things that the\u00A0Japanese had done, but I stopped myself. However,\u00A0I could feel that Jeb sensed that I didn\u0027t want to say them because they were so terrible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys! Please! Just stop,\u0022 said Evelina, \u0022We can go on and on about the atrocities committed by humankind. And we can agree that the world would be an infinitely better place had none of them happened, but unfortunately, they happened, and we\u0027re stuck in a world where they did happen, and we\u0027re trying to deal with them. In dealing with each of them, we were faced with several options - and here, we were in a situation with no right answer. We had to choose between several evils.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And Jeb, we\u0027re going up against The Species, who can be said to be the\u00A0ultimate force of evil. You said it yourself, you want to have weapons by your side.\u00A0 And here, the allied powers\u00A0were up against an enemy force that would stop at nothing to destroy them. You condemn their solution, yet embrace it yourself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s... That\u0027s different. The bombs would be like bug bites to The Species... Not even that... Would they? Would...\u0022 He collapsed to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had never seen a Kerbal cry before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m such a hypocrite,\u0022 he sobbed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No right answer,\u0022 he continued. \u0022How could the evil required to warrant such evil exist?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, Jeb. But here, it does.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And nobody thought to stop them? Nobody thought to talk it out?

It needs doing, and maybe it will distract me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here\u0027s the kni - I mean, uh, multitool,\u0022 said Evelina, holding out her Swiss army knife.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you offer me another weapon!\u0022 shouted Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just because it can be used as a weapon doesn\u0027t mean it was designed as one,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022The Wyvern would be a weapon far worse than anything humanity has built if you used it correctly.\u0022 Jeb stopped climbing and considered, before shaking his head, defeated,\u00A0and pulling out his one tool, a screwdriver. He began opening a\u00A0panel on the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bring me my helmet,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022And get yours. If I have to go deeper than one layer it could get dangerously radioactive, despite the reactor being in standby mode.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger,\u0022 I said, continuing to feel\u00A0terrible for having brought the whole thing up. It wasn\u0027t my fault, I tried to tell myself. I didn\u0027t cause the Wyvern to have landed here... Although I had spotted the obelisk. I hadn\u0027t fought the wars... I hadn\u0027t built the bombs. I hadn\u0027t killed anyone. But why did I feel so bad? As if I had done all that stuff, although it had happened many decades before I was born?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fuZD9x2.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fuZD9x2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, compartment one is open. I\u0027m running diagnostics... What idiot put the diagnostic checker inside of the engine... I\u0027m looking around in here and I can\u0027t see anything out of the ordinary... Oh. Never mind, it\u0027s just a fuse.\u0022 He popped the old one out and put a new one in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Really? Just a fuse?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should be,\u0022 he said.

Or do you just want to get out of here?\u0022 I asked.

I...\u0022 He turned and walked towards the cockpit. Five seconds and he was inside. Seven and he was strapped in. Eleven and the gear were down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb?\u0022 I asked, walking towards the Wyvern. I had taken my helmet off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Take this,\u0022 he said, tossing me a small metal device. \u0022It will keep the Jell-O away. Don\u0027t touch the Jell-O or you might get stuck in time and we may not be able to rescue you. I will be back in a few hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But Jeb, I - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Gi7vbkc.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Gi7vbkc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a loud noise as the direct cycle nuclear ramjet roared to life. The hatch clanged shut and I ran for cover, as my helmet was off and that thing was spewing radiation, but the only cover nearby was Evelina. Fortunately, I had the sense to go for my helmet instead of hiding behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IiDZ49p.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IiDZ49p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tljx2Nk.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tljx2Nk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Wyvern gained speed, and after a short distance, took off, circled once, and then took off like a bullet, travelling... northwest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FxGzuot.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FxGzuot.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There he goes,\u0022 said Evelina. Neither of us said anything after that for a while. The Wyvern disappeared over the horizon a few minutes later, followed by a trail of orange longer than the radius of the unfrozen bubble - meaning that the Wyvern left a visible line behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short while later we talked and agreed that based on direction, he was probably going to Japan. At a speed of 3 kilometers per second, we worked out that it should take him 2-ish hours (estimating distance, neither of us knew geography too well) to fly there and back, plus some time to look around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTen hours later he still hadn\u0027t shown up. We made a guess. He saw what happened there and decided to see whatever else he could.\u00A0Morbid curiosity is a real thing, and he had a jet with infinite range.\u00A0There was no way to know where he was going, but one could guess. He was about to see with his own two eyes the aftermath of all humanity had to offer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCambodia. Poland. Iraq. Berlin. Stalingrad. Nanjing. Korea. Vietnam. New York.\u00A0Of places like them, there was certainly no shortage...\u00A0We figured for an hour at each, and travel. When all the places we thought he could have traveled to ran out, we figured for two hours at each place. We slept (a bit difficult in a hot desert where the sun doesn\u0027t set due to the whole planet being frozen in time), tossed rocks, fiddled with our suits, played endless games of tic-tac-toe in the sand, made towers, talked... And ran out of things to do. I would have worked on my journal, but I had not brought my Kpad down from the Legacy II, and it would surely be dead by now anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the second time we slept, Evelina complained of lightheadedness. I noticed it, too. To test my theory, I ran around for a bit and found myself exhausted after just starting. I realized that, because of the limited size of the unfrozen sphere, we must be slowly using up the oxygen inside it. It was a problem that could easily be fixed by picking up Jeb\u0027s device and walking a bit. What couldn\u0027t be fixed was our complete lack of food and our dwindling supply of very old water contained in the\u00A0suits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter maybe three days, who knows, into Jeb\u0027s journey, we spotted the orange streak returning... From the East this time. After circling once, he landed and pulled up next to us, switching off the Wyvern\u0027s jet. We walked up to it, and Jeb exited the craft, letting go of what remained of the ladder,\u00A0falling to the sand. He made no effort to get up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gGFpZ2a.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gGFpZ2a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb?\u0022 asked Evelina. He did not respond for several seconds. But eventually he sighed, and spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think I understand now.\u0022 He\u00A0sat up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb - \u0022 I began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hush. The existence of the Galactic Union was built on the ideas that violence, even retaliatory violence were the ultimate evil, and that all violence can and will be prevented, without additional violence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, I - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But somehow, we have never had to deal with the idea - the fact - that sometimes the growth of evil cannot be stopped without evil, and that\u00A0evil can grow into a large force that cannot be reasoned with, never in a million years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um\u00A0- \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We did not know about the fact that such evil can exist. That\u0027s why we\u0027re so unprepared for it. Because we don\u0027t believe it can exist. It shouldn\u0027t exist. Nobody in their right minds would want it to exist. But it can. And does.\u0022 He stood up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vM0xnG1.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vM0xnG1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But it\u00A0exists.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, you heard me right! It, somehow, despite the good tendencies of almost every single intelligent being known,\u00A0exists!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And as Evelina said, sometimes there is no right answer when going up against an unreasonable force.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We need - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Were humanity\u0027s violent responses towards violence right?

I am not saying that they were right.\u00A0And I wish I could forget all I have seen... More atrocities than I thought could be possible in this galaxy. There is a memory erasing device available... But there\u00A0is a human saying. \u0022Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u0022 And because of this experience... I believe I now have a better sense of what we lose and gain each time we may attack The Species. I thought I was ready for this war before. But I wasn\u0027t. I\u0027m still not ready now... No one in their right mind could ever be ready for a war, especially one as big as this one... But I am as ready as I will ever be now.\u0022 We both waited a few seconds to make sure he was done with his proclamation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was an amazing speech,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I agree with you, Jeb,\u0022 Evelina said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But can we get some food now?\u0022 I asked. Jeb\u0027s face turned from one of dramatic solemnness into one of concerned disbelief in about zero seconds flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, shoot! How long have I been gone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Three days, maybe?\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022Human days, not Kerbal days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am so, so, sorry. Here,\u0022 he said, pulling some rations out of his pocket. Evelina and I attacked them without mercy. Jeb watched us wolfing down the rations for the better part of a minute. \u0022How did you manage to get those open... I never can!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hunger will do that to a person,\u0022 said Evelina, talking through a full mouth.\u00A0Jeb grabbed one for himself and tried to open it, without success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahh... I left the opener in the Wyvern.\u0022 I took it from him, but since I\u00A0no longer super desperate, I found myself unable to open it as well. I passed it back to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here,\u0022 said Evelina, passing Jeb her Swiss Army Knife. Jeb held it for a few seconds, examining it. He fiddled with several of the attachments, observing their every motion, before selecting one of the knife blades and gently slicing open his ration bag. He closed the knife back up, held it up to the light, and passed it back to Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It seems like a very useful tool, indeed. I may get one at some point.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, back to orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. We\u0027re going to Kirtland.\u0022 I was surprised at this. Jeb must have noticed my expression, as well as Evelina\u0027s. \u0022Only because the species is so powerful that in comparison these weapons might look like toys. And this is not a decision that I make lightly... But it is a decision that must be made.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well...\u0022 I began, at a loss for words.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No right answer,\u0022 Evelina said. \u0022Sometimes, the only way to peace is through the fire\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe held up his ration bag. \u0022To peace.\u0022 We held up our bags as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To peace,\u0022 I repeated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To peace,\u0022 Evelina finished. We touched our ration bags to each others.\u00A0And then Jebediah brought both of us into a very strong bear hug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, let\u0027s get out of here,\u0022 he suggested, \u0022And never speak of this again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Time to steal some nuclear weapons,\u0022 I said. \u0022Quite possibly the only time in human history anyone\u0027s had a good enough reason to do so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One small problem,\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What now? Is there something else I haven\u0027t seen? Something else I haven\u0027t considered?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, no.
