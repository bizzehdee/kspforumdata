A gilly sample return, a lander on eve, a permanent manned orbital space station in eve equatorial, and transfer stage recovery is planned. This is quite exciting! 8 Kerbals are going boldly, and ~5-6 will remain at the new eve station, which will form the core for ongoing efforts culminating in eventual sample return missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stole a few design ideas from the community. Particularly, the transfer stage was taken conceptually from a Bronco Interplanetary Tug design on spaceport. It is so pretty, and it handles like a dream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECritical notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt current payload weight, I\u0027ve got 930 dV in the ejection stage, and an additional 4000 dV on the transfer stage. The ejection is going to get me pretty close to eve as it stands, without even having to burn the primary stage too much. I\u0027ve got two more docking ports on the side of the ship, so I can probably launch and dock two more missions. The gilly return and eve probe will probably return enough data to fill out all but the peskiest of my tech tree. I\u0027m considering some additions to the space station, but I don\u0027t want to bork the center of mass on the ship and complicate the ejection burn. Dumping all the mass at eve and returning with just the lander and maybe command pod should be pretty easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments and suggestions for additional missions are requested!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HVeDh5Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HVeDh5Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ean additional view without annotation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gNzXKbYl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gNzXKbYl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally proud of this mission.

Unfortunately, this made moving it around rather annoying: I can hang it off the side of the transfer stage, where it wobbles to and fro under acceleration. Because i\u0027ve never gone to gilly before, I built a little transfer stage with plenty of gas on the sidedrop tanks, similarly equipped with a bicoupled twin docking ports.
