My goal was a return from Slate, a large moon of Sarnus included in the OPM mod, the only Sarnusean moon I have not done a manned landing on. There was much auto-loading this day.\n\nThe Hades I rocket only cost over half of my entire accumulation of credits so far.. \n\n![DCD0E73515584346E9E80B83E110C29FF52F20D3](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447330979165445309/DCD0E73515584346E9E80B83E110C29FF52F20D3/)\n\nMy Rocket uses parts from the Space Y heavy lifter pack and weighs in at 5,500t, has an initial thrust of 131.4MN, and has around 16,000 m/s of delta V.
