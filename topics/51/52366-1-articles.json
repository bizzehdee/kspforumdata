I ended up literally having almost exactly enough to get into an aero-capture orbit. As of now I am in an elliptical orbit (AP 950k PE 200k) and all 4 Kerbals are safe and even have a lander to try out later. But I have zero full for the Nuke engines and I have no way to get them home so my thought is to send a fuel barge out there next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have learned I could have put less RCS tanks and a single larger liquid full tank which would have helped. The engine module is undock-able so I could just build and send a new one, great advantage of module construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RGsh0lG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RGsh0lG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow have others solved this problem?
