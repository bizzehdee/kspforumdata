We had an incident with one of the Whack-A-Kerbal spheres taking out a window. We had to wear spacesuits until it was fixed. I\u0027m told this stuff happens pretty often with the Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, where was I? I was onstage just told that I was going to get to explore an alien planet and its five moons on board a ramshackle ship that isn\u0027t even finished yet - and I was launching in just a few hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, naturally, I fainted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA while later I woke up outside, lying in the grass (is it laying or lying? I have no idea). I remember opening my eyes and seeing the stars thinking I was still on Earth. Still half asleep, I subconsciously tried to locate the big dipper. When I couldn\u0027t find that, I thought to myself \u0022That\u0027s odd,\u0022 and then tried to find Orion. I failed, and then tried to locate Venus. Obviously, it wasn\u0027t there. I started to wonder why I was outside. And why the moon was so freakishly big. And why there was a giant building to my left. And why there was a strange girl who looked oddly familiar -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, you\u0027re up!\u0022 said Evelina.

So, what exactly should I be doing right now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022According to the instructions Jeb gave after you passed out, you should report to that weird arc-shaped building - the \u0022Astronaut Center\u0022 or something. You need to get a spacesuit, and a whole bunch of other things. You launch in less than two hours, so you should get going. Oh, and also, you should call your parents.\u0022 Right. I had completely forgotten about them. Stupid me. Whose parents would let them go to another planet at the age of fifteen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you want to show me the way there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry, Ethan,\u0022 she said. \u0022I was voted in as Capcom for the launch.

However, I don\u0027t think that applies as I\u0027m going to be on a spaceship and you\u0027re CAPCOM.\u0022 She chuckled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I will surely miss you! Godspeed, Ethan. Bring me back a moon rock!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which moon?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, any old moon will do.\u0022 she moved forward - and she hugged me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re one of those popular jock kids, then you\u0027re probably saying \u0022So what? I hug and kiss hot girls all the time.\u0022 But, hey, my name is Ethan Edwards. I am the biggest nerd in my entire town, and to date I have only ever been hugged by four girls, including Evelina. Never been to a dance, never been on a date, never kissed a girl. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAccording to my guidance counselor, I have low self esteem. 9 times out of 10 when I walk past girls I like in the hallway I open my mouth to say something and then never say anything. Then as soon as I round the corner I facepalm and mutter \u0022coward\u0022 and \u0022idiot\u0022 under my breath. When it comes to that sort of stuff, I am utterly pathetic.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this is big for me. Unfortunately, I would not see her for another few years. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ECoward. Idiot. I should have done more.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry. I completely derailed my thrilling outer space adventure story to tell a sad love story that is only relevant to one person. My hand hovers over the \u0022delete\u0022 key. I have already tried to write this part once before and, in my opinion, neither of them turned out well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, who cares. I\u0027m leaving it in. I spent a good hour and a half writing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, back to the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I said goodbye to Evelina, I walked over to the astronaut complex. The Kerbals there were very kind and considerate. My spacesuit was made quickly, and they stuck me in a centerfuge for a few minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interesting part was the packing. I was allowed a few personal items on the trip. The Kerbals sort of scanned my brain for what I would want most (even though I could have just told them) and ten minutes later they presented me with the coolest synthesizer I\u0027ve ever seen. Because mass and volume were limiting factors, you couldn\u0027t take an actual bulky synthesizer... so, in the space of ten minutes they designed and 3D printed a super thin one with a touch-screen keyboard that would roll up into the space of less than a paper towel roll. It also had over 9,000 sounds loaded into it... I can\u0027t imagine needing that many, ever! My synth back home had only 200!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, I would have an actual grand piano installed in the ship, but, let\u0027s get real. That\u0027s never going to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of my time spent in that building flew by quickly.

Although she had concluded it was indeed somewhat hilarious, one of the points of this mission was to eliminate political boundaries. Hence, stick the most politically and racially diverse people in a capsule and see if they can work out their differences. This outburst was the opposite of what was supposed to happen. The Kerbals themselves had a policy to completely ban anything related to negative aspects of politics (Section 2.2B of the Official Laws of Kerbin) and it was a rare time that Valentina got to witness anything like this.

It\u0027s certainly been a while. As in, I launched from the surface of Kerbin exactly 100 days ago (400 Kerbin days). It must be something, all ye schoolchildren, beginning school while the sun is rising at 6:00, watching the sun set at 9:00 through the windows of your skyscraper schools, going onto the balcony for lunch at 11:30, watching the stars swirl by, entering the school as the sun rises again at 12:00, and riding the elevator back home as the sun sets dramatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, that\u00A0must be really cool.

I don\u0027t remember. But, anyway, you could have just looked up the Kerbpedia entry on \u0022Whack-A-Kerbal,\u0022 but since you insisted, I\u0027ll explain it here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first ever game of Whack-A-Kerbal took place onboard Duna Expedition Seventeen, when one of the docking ports broke during the transfer from Kerbin to Duna. Pilot Johnbury Kerman went on an EVA to retrieve the faulty magnets while replacing them with new ones. As he entered the airlock, he accidentally hit his head on a beam, spilling all of the magnets around the cabin. Most of them stuck together, or to the walls, but after the dust cleared, in the center of the ship, two magnets were spinning around each other. The other crewmembers were like \u0022Oh, that\u0027s cool!\u0022 and then Podfred took a magnet and a paperclip then made the paperclip orbit the magnet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo hours later, the crew of three were taking turns throwing paperclips, bearings, and various other metal objects at a cluster of docking magnets (that formed a \u0022star\u0022) trying to make them orbit it. Some sources say that almost 45 objects orbited that first star before Harfurd tossed a spoon into the mix, which hit a few paperclips, knocking them out of orbit, creating a chain reaction which destroyed the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter they had the mess of paperclips stuck to the walls cleaned up, they arrived at Duna and\u00A0completed their mission, not really thinking about the game they had created. When they were back on the return journey, however, Harfurd cannibalized the lander\u0027s engines (which were an experimental prototype using weird magnetically driven turbopumps) and stuffed those magnets inside of a ransom stayputnik lying around (I still don\u0027t get how you would have a random space probe lying around) and made a large \u0022star.\u0022 He set this inside the cockpit of the lander, which he had stripped of all magnetic material. He brought the other spherical docking magnets into the room, and three boxes of paperclips (red, blue, and silver). At that point he invited Podfred and Johnbury into the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Note: The following is my own wording of the\u00A0events. For the actual transcript, check the Kerbpedia entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the Moho did you do to the lander?\u0022 asked Johnbury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I made a game!\u0022 replied Harfurd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But we were going to give the lander to the space museum of Kerbin!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Oops. We may as well play the game now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, how do you play, Harfurd?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Podfred, you are red, Johnbury, you are blue, and I will be silver.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But I hate the color red!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shut up, Podfred. It\u0027s literally in your name. PodfRED.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, what do we do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022See this pile of nine docking magnets? These are the planets. Everyone take three. Good. Now, we will take turns setting them into orbits around this stayputnik thing here.\u0022 It took several tries to get them all into stable orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, what now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We take turns throwing these paperclips into the system. If you get three paperclips on a planet, you win that planet. The goal is to win as many planets as possible. I\u0027ll sta-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But I want a moon!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, why don\u0027t these planets have moons? And why are they all so huge?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bro, I made this in under an hour. You want moons? Go get those bearings!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, then.\u0022 Five minutes later, five of the planets had moons. There was also three dwarf planets because some of the bearings missed. One other planet had been knocked out of orbit by one of the \u0022moons.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, now can we start?\u0022 asked Harfurd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure!\u0022 said Podfred, throwing one of his red paperclips into the solar system. It curved around the third planet, before hitting and sticking to the first planet. Then, Johnbury threw one of his. It slingshotted out around the ninth planet and left the system, bouncing off of the capsule wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHarfurd then took his turn. He nailed planet four with his paperclip right away. The play continued for about three more cycles, the astronauts thoroughly hooked. Then, Johnbury\u0027s paperclip hit the moon of the third planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, can you capture moons?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t see why not.\u0022 Gameplay continued until Harfurd had captured Planet Six. The next turn, Johnbury, who had two paperclips on Planet Six, landed a third.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, who gets Planet Six? We both have three.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. Interesting question. Maybe it should be whoever has the most?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then the game could go on forever.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, uh, what if we remove the planet once someone gets it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But it\u0027s so satisfying to watch the planets orbit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, what if, uh, I don\u0027t have any ideas. If we put a light and computers in each planet and moon - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Computers the size of a baseball? That will never happen!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, whatever. For now, let\u0027s of whoever gets it first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what if I was to steal it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Careful, words of war will get you kicked out of the space program, Johnbury.\u0022 The trio continued to argue for quite some time before settling on the placeholder rule that whoever had the most on each planet at the moment that each planet was won would be the winner of the planet. Johnbury ended up winning, controlling four of the eight planets, and two of the moons, and one of the dwarf planets. Unfortunately, one planet and two moons were left unclaimed because the crew ran out of paperclips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was interesting! What should we call it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. Space Conquest?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Magnetball?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbol Space Program Race?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh, all good names. None of them feel right.\u0022 All of a sudden, the ship\u0027s computer beeped and startled Johnbury, who jumped out of his seat (metaphorically. You can\u0027t really sit in zero-gee) and slapped Podfred in the face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ow!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my gosh, I\u0027m so sorry , Podfred!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You just whacked me in the face!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hehe. You \u0022Whacked-A-Kerbal.\u0022\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hehe. Why does that sound so fu - Wait a minute... That\u0027s it! Let\u0027s call it \u0022Whack-A-Kerbal!\u0022\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s a bit of an odd name, but I think it would work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. It does have a nice ring to it. Whack-A-Kerbal it is!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, what do we do with the solar system now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have an idea!\u0022 shouted Podfred as he grabbed a spare docking magnet and hurtled it into the system. It threw several of the planets out of orbit, and one moon went into a retrograde orbit before smacking into another moon and then into Harfurd\u0027s face. One of the planets was thrown alarmingly rapidly out of the system - and through the\u00A0hatch connecting the lander to the command section. A shattering sound was heard as Planet Four hit the forward cupola window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew spent the rest of their mission without the luxury of being able to exit their spacesuits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they finally got back to Kerbin, they met with the Board of Space Exploration, who gave them the go-ahead to take a more refined version into space for Harfurd\u0027s next mission to Space Station #30. Rather than paperclips, small metal balls were used (about the size of a BB). The spheres of the planets also varied in size. A simple resource system was added, meaning players could launch ships at any time, removing the turn-based nature of the game. This led to more exciting and dramatic gameplay. Later that year, Podfred joined the crew with a new planet that contained a battery and motor - an electromagnetic planet. This could be used to vary the gravity of the planet or adjust the position and orbit of the said body. A miniaturized version was used in a few games as a colony ship, until a version was made where, using radio, the user could alter the shape of the magnetic field produced by the object, leading to accurately movable planet sized mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the beginning of the year after that, a version was sent up which included advanced maneuverability in all of the planets and moons. This system was computer controlled. Unfortunately, the calculations took so much processing power that 95% of the station\u0027s computers had to be used for a single game. One day, some genius decided to see what happened when you set the global gravity multiplier to SQRT(-1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor \u003Cem\u003Etotally unrelated reasons,\u003C/em\u003E Space Station #30 experienced a rapid unplanned depressurization that same day. Whack-A-Kerbal was not played again for a few decades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this hiatus, a millionaire had heard about the game and wanted to play it for real. His name was Emperor Pennyroyal. Yes, that was his actual name. He was not an emperor, but his first name was \u0022Emperor.\u0022 He was one of the last Kerbals on Kerbin to not use Kerman as his last name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmperor Pennyroyal contacted a lot of engineers and told them about the game and how he wanted it to be played. By this time, computers had been miniaturized to the point where they could fit inside of a marble-sized object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe modern version of Whack-A-Kerbal consists of the aforementioned spheres, ranging in sizes from basketball-size to BB-sized, any number of control panels (one per player), and an accurate laser grid system. The grid system is basically a collapsible square or circle that fits on a table (or floor) that shoots invisible lasers out (or with a slight red tinge for coolness) of its entire area as to pinpoint the positions of the planets, moons, and ships. All of the spheres marble-sized or larger were fitted with a microcomputer, magnet (some electromagnetic, some just magnetic) and a tracker to further pinpoint position. They also light up to represent the owner or the status of the celestial object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the ships are represented by the BB sized spheres. They are just metal that can be affected by magnetism. They each have an electronic tracker and a light, however. The way ships are steered is by networking all of the other planets\u0027 computers together with the ship\u0027s main computer. Within miliseconds of a control input, the computer can calculate how to manipulate the magnetic fields of the planets to have the desired effect on the orbit of the \u0022ship.\u0022 another feature Pennyroyal added was the ability to launch ships from planets and moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPennyroyal played it in space and then was rendered unconscious when he was hit by a planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rules have changed very little from then until now. If there was an instruction book in English, it would go something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESETUP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGive each player a control panel and place the laser grid on the playing surface. Make sure there are no strongly magnetic objects near the playing area. Do not insert face into the laser grid at any time. This may result in blindness due to the fact that the laser grid is a non-deadly laser. Also, you probably don\u0027t want to get hit in the face by a baseball sized chunk of metal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you may set up the system you are playing in. there are two ways to do this - using a preset, or creating your own system. To play with a preset system, simply select one from the game menu on a control panel, lay out the stars, planets, moons, and asteroids needed onto the laser grid, press the ARRANGE button, and watch as the computer controlled electromagnetic spheres arrange themselves into a stable system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, each player chooses a color to represent their ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECREATING YOUR OWN SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many ways to do this, but the most common way is to first take the star, or stars, set their name and gravity using the control panel, toss them onto the laser grid, and adjust their orbital parameters with your control panel until satisfied. Then, select the number of planets and moons you would like to play with, and place them into the desired orbits manually. You may name these worlds using your control panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGAMEPLAY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECONTROL PANEL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour control panel is the interface through\u00A0which you influence the game.

You accomplish this by launching various ships, either by hand, out of your control panel, or off of planets, to arc around other planets. Each celestial body has a certain amount of resources, and you can build mines on each body (as well as other buildings) to gather these resources. These resources may be used to build said mines and ships.

After the action has been completed, the rest of the players vote on how impressive it was. If it was extremely impressive and game changing, then the player may be granted a 1.5x resource multiplier. If he/she manages to de-orbit a star, then a 5x multiplier may be awarded.
