F. Kerman\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, sending a single mission to Mun and Minmus together makes a lot of sense. Once you are on Mun orbit, you can spend 250 m/s to get back to Kerbin. Or, you could spend 200 m/s to go on a Minmus intercept, where you can circularize with 50 m/s. Then you drop a lander that can go down and back with 350 m/s, and finally 150 m/s wil see you home. So, you can visit both moons by adding just 25% extra deltaV to a Mun mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, even trying just for Mun is not trivial without adequate means.

This is a horrible lander. It is tall, thin, narrow, with small landing legs. It doesn\u0027t even have solar panels. And if you are not thinking that, you should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I didn\u0027t have much choice. I only had limited tech. I had 190 science, and I had two priorities: docking ports, to get the \u0022docking manuever\u0022 and \u0022build a space station\u0022 achievements, and they required 90 science alone, plus 45 for the prerequisite tech (\u003Cem\u003Eon the plus side, that prerequisite also gave me the science jr, for moar science\u003C/em\u003E). And second, I needed a Terrier engine, because you try making a low cost Mun mission without a dedicated last stage engine. A Spark would have been better, but that was too expensive. Anyway, there was no chance to get niceties like solar panels, or better landing legs, or fairings. I tried to get a wide base by more exotic designs, like this one\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sBCXrMj.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/sBCXrMj.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(yes, it has 4 stacks, but only 2 engines.

So, thin lander will have to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I needed an orbiter. The lander would spend all its fuel for landing and take off. I needed an orbiter that could tow the lander the rest of the way. And the whole would be rather heavy. Also, I needed more batteries, and with the 30 parts limit it was a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end I came up with this design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228hDTB0M.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/8hDTB0M.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not clear from this angle, but the three bosters on the bottom are not attached with decouplers. They are just stacked side by side. So I have the 3 boosters for the start, then I ditch them and I use a second booster to get suborbital. In all this process I have virtually no control, so I made sure to keep pointing in the right direction by adding fins on both the first and second stage (\u003Cem\u003EI could have used a Swivel, but it was more expensive\u003C/em\u003E). And then it circularizes using the fuel from the upper tank, the one attached over the docking port, that it will - of course - ditch before docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormal rockets discard stages from the bottom, but that requires using a new engine, and increases cost. Why not ditch stages from the top? Maybe for fear that they will crash over the ship? Seriously, have you seen the pieces of junk I\u0027m trying to fly? If we were ranking the possible causes for catastrophic failure, \u0022hit by the top tank\u0022 won\u0027t even make it to the top 10. But the total cost was less than 25k (\u003Cem\u003Eincluding the lander\u0027s launcher, which was actually a sane design\u003C/em\u003E); the 170k I had available would seem a lot of money for this mission, but I had to upgrade the launch pad, and I had to upgrade the tracking station and mission control if I wanted manuever nodes. By the way, this is the only launch system where I did not painstakingly recover every single piece of hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying this thing to orbit wasn\u0027t easy \u003Cem\u003E(it involved restarting the flight several times. Sometimes the lateral boosters would spontaneously detach in the launch pad).\u003C/em\u003E Managing a rendez-vous with the tracking station at level 1 also was a bother (\u003Cem\u003Eit involved reaching orbit behind the lander, putting apoapsis and periapsis a couple km lower, and then wait\u003C/em\u003E). Once they were within 100 km range, though, I was able to select the lander as a target, and then I could get a better rendez-vous by following the target on the navisphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I docked the lander and orbiter (\u003Cem\u003Eand exchanged crews, which netted a bit more money\u003C/em\u003E) I used that money to up the tracking station. Still mission control was level 1, so I could not set up manuever nodes. How do I time my burn to reach Mun precisely? Three ways: eyeballing, save scumming, and correction manuevers. As soon as I got to Mun, I upgraded mission control too; there\u0027s no way I could eyeball a Mun-Minmus transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had Bob in the orbiter to refresh the science experiments, and Jeb in the lander because landing without a \u0022hold retrograde\u0022 function was already hard enough without giving up on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E entirely.

Like Marco Polo, it\u0027s going to visit faraway places and come back after a few decades. Then I thought, this thing has nuclear engines, Marco Polo didn\u0027t.

A single small lander can explore all the small worlds out there, except for Tylo and Laythe. Instead of sending one ship to each of those places, I could send one single ship, saving on the cost of having to launch a new one every time. And going from Duna to Jool is cheaper than going from Kerbin. And once you are at Jool, again going to Eeloo is cheaper than coming back and sending a new mission to Kerbin. And if I can make a single large ship, I can use the efficient nuclear propulsion without worrying about costs - or about how to recover it after every mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, that\u0027s the general plan. Have a mothership. With nuclear engines and plenty of fuel. Have a small lander attached to it. Figure something out for Tylo and Laythe. Get good antennas, because I can\u0027t afford a relay network. And find ways to manage it all within the 30 parts and 140 tons limit. And find ways to get all that stuff in orbit on a tight budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo.

The payload is easily 20 tons, though I learned eventually to stretch it up to 25. The twin boar engine has a high resistance to impacts, so I can get away with less parachutes and no rocket assisted braking. In fact, the main problem is the rocket tipping and crashing the fuel tanks; to prevent that, I put the parachutes asymmetrically so that it would land tilted and fall gently on a side. It works perfectly on water, sometimes it fails on rough terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has 14 parts, but if needed I can skip the reaction wheel and the batteries, going down to 11.

I can also remove the ground stabilizers and one parachute, though I will have to reload the launch a few times because it may flip randomly before I even turn on the engine. With one less parachute it will only survive with water landing and some well-timed rocket braking. But it\u0027s 8 parts. And if the payload has a docking port, I can use the docking port to connect to the launcher, and skip the decoupler. If I have a few spare parts to add I can put some solar panels on it so I don\u0027t have to reload if I accidentally leave \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E on.

A few early models exploded because I forgot to autostrut everything and the payload started swinging, but after I worked out the kinks, I never had a catastrophic failure, and I most often make a perfect launch at the first try. This is the only vehicle I developed for this challenge that I would actually use in a normal career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t found a way to reliably land it with precision besides save scumming.

I will put a parachute on it, because I will land it back to Kerbin eventually for all those \u0022we came back from ...\u0022 achievements. Since I have it, I can also use it on Duna. So the greater fuel budgets I will need are 1700 m/s to get down and up from Vall, or to get up from Duna after landing with parachutes (\u003Cem\u003Ethe map says 1450, but a large lander will have horrible aerodinamics\u003C/em\u003E). 2000 m/s is a good target for deltaV.

The three fuel tanks on the bottom are horrible for flying in atmosphere, but I needed a large base to land this thing upright, or I\u0027d be unable to leave. The docking port in front, and the various instruments jutting out, are also horrible. The fins are needed to keep this thing flying straight - though they double up as landing legs. unfortunately, with low part limits and low technology, that\u0027s all I could come up with.

This stage was too heavy for the launcher, so I had to send it half empty. I filled it with the spare fuel I had in the other launch vehicles; one ton here, half a ton there, I managed to complete Marco Polonium without needing a dedicated refueling mission for the landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince this thing is so heavy (\u003Cem\u003Earound 50 tons\u003C/em\u003E) I can\u0027t wait to get to Jool and get rid of all this mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn retrospect, I made a mistake; I should have added a decoupler after the lander\u0027s command pod.

The reliant is lighter and has more thrust. And a well-made ship won\u0027t need gimbaling because it will be stable on its own.

Furthermore, the swivel has a higher vacuum Isp; even at Laythe sea level, it is equivalent to the reliant. So, the extra weight is compensated by higher efficiency. Even better, the previous lander had huge fins to keep it stable. The swivel will stabilize the rocket, so I won\u0027t need fins anymore. I\u0027m actually saving weight. And parts count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd since I can afford some spare parts and Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is challenging, I decided to sacrifice 100 kg to put a cargo bay, and put all the science instruments in it.

And visiting Duna when going back also is not too expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first attempt then was to reach Jool directly. This turned out to be the wrong idea, because of the little problem of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

And adding more engines is not an option. Sure, I can raise my apoapsis first. But to reach Jool I need a 2000 m/s burn, and at least 1000 m/s must be done when on an escape trajectory. That\u0027s a 15 minute burn, and no way around it. I tried, and I ended up spending some 2500 m/s for the whole thing. I also studied gravity assists, but unfortunately Kerbin, Duna and Jool are never aligned (I gave up after reaching 15 years). I also checked Eve, but a gravity assist from it would pull my apoapsis up to 20 million km, still a far shot from Jool. Not much to be gained there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried going to Duna First.

I was trying to find gravity slingshots that would help with it, making a flyby on the first approach only to meet Duna again on the next orbit with a lower intercept speed. And while I was experimenting with that, and trying various ways to help with some aerobraking, I discovered that I can actually get a full aerocapture at the first pass! I dipped down to 22 km, I lost 600 m/s, and I didn\u0027t even start overheating anything! I think I\u0027m falling in love with Duna. It\u0027s perfect! Its atmosphere is thick enough that you can do aerobraking, aerocapture, and even use parachutes with just a little bit of rocket braking at the end, but it\u0027s thin enough that it won\u0027t be a huge obstacle when you want to leave.

Even the Marco Polonium itself, when you get down to basics, is just a command module with some engines, with two landers and a bunch of fuel tanks strapped to it.

You may have heard that Dres does not exhist, and it is just part of a big conspiracy.

It is an unremarkable planet. It has some nice canyons, which are nonetheless much less nice than the Mun\u0027s one. I still have to drive my favourite rover through Dres canyons, but they look like they don\u0027t compare. And it\u0027s goddamn expensive to reach. You can ignore its orbital inclination when you get an intercept on an orbital node (\u003Cem\u003Eindeed, the only places in the orbit where it is somewhat less expensive to get an intercept\u003C/em\u003E) but you still need to pay that as injection deltaV. And then, when you leave Dres, you again will have a high inclination compared to anything else. And there is no atmosphere to aerobrake, and it\u0027s also too small to use for gravity assists. But if I want to complete my tour of the outer planets, I have to go there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least I have enough fuel left; even though I discarded the last fuel canister in leaving Eeloo and I only have the main tank left, now that I\u0027m down to 40 tons of mass, the Marco Polonium runs very cheaply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OpHSes0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/OpHSes0.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TURnoUk.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/TURnoUk.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here I am in Dres orbit, barely below the escape speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U7pcMS4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/U7pcMS4.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a lander on the planet and up again is so unremarkable I didn\u0027t even think to take pictures.

I can get an intercept for Duna much cheaper than I can get for Eve. In Duna I can enter orbit completely by aerobraking, and this will conveniently match me to Duna\u0027s orbital inclination and speed. I can fix whatever remaining inclination from a highly elliptic orbit. Then I can orbit around Ike with a fairly low cost, and when the transfer window comes, I can fall back on duna and use it to slignshot away, again for a relatively low cost. It\u0027s much cheaper than going straight for Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to reiterate, I love Duna.

And of course, during the Kerbin transfer window the direction I should have left was completely different. With too few fuel to try tricks, and not enough motivation to look for gravity assists, I decided to brute force the problem.

I still have to drive my favourite rover through Dres canyons, but they look like they don\u0027t compare. And it\u0027s goddamn expensive to reach. You can ignore its orbital inclination when you get an intercept on an orbital node (indeed, the only places in the orbit where it is somewhat less expensive to get an intercept) but you still need to pay that as injection deltaV. And then, when you leave Dres, you again will have a high inclination compared to anything else. And there is no atmosphere to aerobrake, and it\u0027s also too small to use for gravity assists.

I can fix whatever remaining inclination from a highly elliptic orbit.

An elliptic orbit is great to leave the planet, but only if you can burn prograde near periapsis. And of course, during the Kerbin transfer window the direction I should have left was completely different. With too few fuel to try tricks, and not enough motivation to look for gravity assists, I decided to brute force the problem. I did my periapsis burn and managed to cross Kerbin\u0027s orbit on a node.
