But these are serious undertakings so I want to know what I\u0027m getting into and maybe land at an Easter Egg or 2. Thus, before Kerbals themselves leave home, I\u0027ll learn how to get them there and find good landing spots with an opening salvo of ISA MapSats. But even this has to start small so my first efforts so far have only been in the Kerbin system, although I have 2 more probes parked in LKO waiting on upcoming launch windows for Moho and Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause this is a sort of mass-production batch of probes, I\u0027ve developed a standard MapSat design and some standard rocket combinations to sit it on. The core of the program is the MapSat 3000, so named because it\u0027s got 3000dV on the probe itself and just an INSANE TWR. Because of this, the MapSat can reach and achieve a good, high polar orbit at Mun, Minmus, Eve, Duna, Ike, and Dres, all by itself once a reasonably small booster lifts it into LKO. It only needs a bit more juice to get to Eeloo, but Moho and Jool required a substantial transfer stage, which in turn requires a monstrous ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the probe naked and faired. Note the info displayed by Kerbal Engineer without the fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KP8DiFo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KP8DiFo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JFP1akr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JFP1akr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe consists of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbodobodyne QBE core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA MapSat dish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2x OX-4W 2x3 solar panels (just for show--dish doesn\u0027t use power)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry SA-1 fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x Rockomax 24-77 engines, only 2 of which are actually needed most of the time (disable the others with right-click).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fairing is KW Rocketry 1.25m parts, below which is a stack of 4x FL-R25 RCS tanks and 8x KW Rocketry RCS clusters. Note the stitching struts between various pieces don\u0027t line up vertically with any other stitches--it\u0027s stronger this way. The fairing and the stitching are because I use Farram Aerospace, which likes long, tall rockets. This gives them a huge moment of inertia, which means you require RCS to point them in the right direction before you pass the circularizing maneuver node on the way up where the tailfins no longer function. I lawndarted quite a few rockets figuring this part out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. And all this means there\u0027s a lot of sideways force applied to the skinniest part of the whole rig, so it needs all the stitching and sometimes some diagonal bracing to the side boosters as well to keep the payload from snapping off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GDLzMZV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GDLzMZV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the standard ascent stage under the standard payload, capable of reaching all the aforementioned destinations. It\u0027s just the stock adaptor (KWR\u0027s don\u0027t seem to work for me) with 2 of the KWR big fuel tanks and the 4-barreled KWR engine under it, and 4x stitching at all joints. With a carefully flown ascent trajectory tailored to FAR\u0027s atmosphere, this rig will reach 80km LKO with about 500-600 delta-v to spare which can be applied to the ejection burn. I prefer to eject from 80km because the lower you are, the faster you\u0027re moving, which helps with the ejections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: If you look closely, you can see there are only 4x RCS clusters on this one. This was actually the prototype and it worked, but just barely, so I gave it more RCS and it worked better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prototype in 80km LKO with enough juice in the big rocket for most of the ejection burn to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Sv2eWiZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sv2eWiZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, enough about hardware, on to the action. The MapSat 3000 is a real sportscar. Its TWR is so high that the calculated burn times are always less than 5 seconds. That\u0027s 5 seconds at full throttle, but I\u0027ve never found the need to open the throttle more than 2 or 3 taps on the shift key because it accelerates too fast to control if you do more. That\u0027s with all 4 engines working, which is why I usually disable 2 of them for even finer control. So, while Kerbal Engineer says it only has 41 seconds of burn time, in practice with the engines just idling and 3000 delta-V in the tank, you\u0027ve got a LOT of maneuvering you can do. Especially if you\u0027re smart about when you burn, which minimizes the delta-V needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, polar orbits are extremely easy to achieve around other bodies (different story at Kerbin). When you\u0027re about 1/2way to the target where you\u0027ve already got an encounter, do a burn up or down so when you go by the target, you\u0027re as close to polar as you can get. Just a few m/s is usually all you need for this, as opposed to maybe a few hundred if you wait until you arrive. Like in the pic below, going to Mun, the burn to switch from a 0^ inclination approach to instead make me come up from the south pole at about a 65-75^ inclination cost me all of 2 delta-V. Even counting what I burned during ejection, I\u0027ve still got over 3000 delta-V in hand and the final orbit is already well on the way to being established, even with a decent periapsis of about 250km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/36PM3Os.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002236PM3Os.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I entered Mun\u0027s SOI and not a moment later, when I could see better what I was doing but was still as far away as possible, I did the final inclination tuning, getting just a hair shy of 90^. Then all that was needed was to circularize the orbit and voila:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KidcSiS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KidcSiS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s Jeb\u0027s abandoned roving lander still orbiting Mun there. Anyway, the MapSat still has about 2850 delta-V in the tank so once it gets done mapping Mun, I\u0027ll see if I can move it over to Minmus. But while it\u0027s very cheap in delta-V to get INTO a polar orbit when arriving at another body, you might have to pay a lot to leave it. We\u0027ll see. That\u0027s a low-priority mission. Right now, the focus is the other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it happened, the 1st launch window to open up once I started this project was for Moho. You really need to stand on the brakes coming into there, which means the MapSat 3000 needs a transfer stage. And the weight of this means a MUCH bigger ascent stage. But I had 20-odd days to get the thing into orbit to wait for the window, which gave me ample time to have numerous spectacular launch failures \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Sadly, I don\u0027t have any pictures of those, but I do have a pic of the finished product, my biggest rocket to date that\u0027s flown successfully. So I call it \u0022\u003Cem\u003EGot my Moho Workin\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. It weighs in at 217 tons on the launchpad. But for all that, it\u0027s just a big ascent stage. All that leaves Kerbin is the standard payload with a nuke engine and small tank under it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WKWUHhH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WKWUHhH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, despite a flawless launch, I totally bungled the ejection. By the time KSP adds an Oort Cloud to the Kerbin system, this probe will be out there to map it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. But that\u0027s why I\u0027m sending probes, not Kerbals, for my 1st interplanetary missions. Anyway, the replacement is already in orbit ready for another try in 29 days, but next on the schedule is a Duna window. But that uses the small, boring standard launch vehicle you\u0027ve already seen so I\u0027ll cut to the chase on that one when it\u0027s time comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, the 1st planet I mapped was Kerbin, which was an adventure in itself. Being an ignorant noob, I didn\u0027t realize it took a LOT more than the standard 4500m/s to do this, so I littered Kerbin\u0027s northern hemisphere with the fragments of failed rockets. I must have had 10-15 epic fails from all causes: total instability, inability to turn in the right direction in a vacuum, weak structure, overheating, etc., all before I even realized I didn\u0027t have near enough delta-V, and then I had another 5-6 fails before one finally succeeded. But all this was before I developed the MapSat 3000, with 3000 delta-V in just 1.75 tons. No, the Kerbin probe weighed about twice as much and only had enough juice for minor orbit tweaks, so all its thrust had to come from stages, which made for some rather large rockets. Here\u0027s the successful version on its way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gLVTntc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gLVTntc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was this experience that led me to rethink my whole probe design and come up with the much more effective MapSat 3000. MUCH less rocket needed with this thing. Give it a try if you don\u0027t already have something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T21:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was expecting to have half the Kerbol system mapped by now but I kept running into a problem. I\u0027d get a MapSat in Kerbin orbit and it would just drop dead on me just as I was about to do the ejection burn. I had no idea why and this kept happening over and over. Finally, after asking around, I discovered I was running out of electricity, so I added an RTG to the MapSat 3000 and this time is worked (stupidly forgetting I could have shed the fairing and opened the solar panels). So here\u0027s about my 8th try to burn for Duna finally leaving Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W50kYJ8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W50kYJ8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of all the ejection failures, the window was closing rapidly so by the time I finally got this figured out, the window was closing rapidly so the burn took more delta-V on both ends, plus I wasted some with unnecessary mid-course maneuvering. Thus, it was going to be a question of whether I could actually get into Duna orbit. But in the meantime, I did get my polar orbit set up relatively cheaply while still a long ways out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fAx1QKU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fAx1QKU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time for the do-or-die capture burn. Rather less fuel than I was expecting to have by this point in the trip.... I suppose I could have aerobraked but the original plan was to have way more delta-V than I needed so I wasn\u0027t going to bother with that.
