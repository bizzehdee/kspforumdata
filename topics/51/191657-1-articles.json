From space. We\u0027re not the only Kerbals to have emerged recently (surprise) and other programs have also been flinging Kerbals up to the black. Trouble is, they haven\u0027t worked out how to get them back down. So, I headed over to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and asked the hardhats to throw something together. I ended up with a Hitchhiker slapped on top of some rockets, with a decoupler taking the brunt of reentry followed by a smaller, proper heat shield. It worked. Had enough deltaV for two pickups. We sent a smaller can up for the third, using an OKTO model probe core to pilot. The missions themselves were rather unremarkable, unless you count the narrow fuel reserve margin we cut for the first reentry. The Strays were a bit worried about seeing all of 16 meters per in the tanks, but we managed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VHFSafc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VHFSafc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new kids agreed to join up, sending Ops into some sort of... weird cackling fit. After a bit, and the newbs slowly backing out of the office, Ops explained to me that these new recruits would be assigned to the boys as a team of six, two of each specialty, and assigned to the first long-service spaceship. Either my disappointment was obvious or Ops had anticipated it, because he quickly added that he needed me Kerbside, being the more levelheaded pilot. He also said I would be the first to command the third generation of that line, at which point it would be self-sufficient!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xn3AsUt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xn3AsUt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boys returned and were introduced to the Strays.

We ended up being able to research the tech for the long-service vessels Ops had planned. Even skipped right by the theoretical first generation since we got a command pod that can directly control probes. Right now me and Ludwin are sitting in that pod in a 151x148km orbit above Kerbin, waiting for the lab, habitation, and propulsion modules to be sent up. The first stop will definitely be Minmus, since it hasn\u0027t been explored yet and the nearest interplanetary transfer window is 107 days away, and that\u0027s to Moho.

Well, the science we\u0027ve gathered and the research resulting from such have led to some pretty significant advances in propulsion, docking, comms, and more.
