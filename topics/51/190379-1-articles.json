It was the largest private rocket developed to date, developed by the Kerbomax corporation, a merger between Rockomax and Kerbodyne.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, technically just the rocket propulsion\u00A0divisions of the two companies. The original constituent companies had produced mainly military equipment, including notably intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with rockets intended for space exploration. For... Reasons... The rocket propulsion divisions were no longer needed. The plan was to shut down both divisions, but the workers\u00A0protested.\u00A0In the end, a compromise was made. Rockomax and Kerbodyne would have nothing to do with the new company. No funding, no contracts, few facilities. Just the over eager workers who loved rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for why the divisions had been shut down... Well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n===\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThroughout the 1960s, tensions between the Socialist Confederation of Kerbal Nations and the Unified Kerbal Provinces were rising rapidly, with no end in sight. In 1962, the Island Airport Missile Crisis significantly increased tensions between the two nations, with one nuclear missile launched towards the UKP. A miracle happened that day, with ace pilot Jebediah Kerman managing to heroically shoot down the missile. Somehow, there was no all-out retaliation, and after that there were de-escalation talks. The talks failed and tensions continued to rise, both nations at their throats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth nations attempted to best each other in everything imaginable, including spaceflight. This is where Rockomax and Kerbodyne come in. They both worked together on the massive Jool V rocket, intended to launch Kerbals to the Mun and back. The program experienced a\u00A0setback in 1966 when the crew capsule for Kerballo 1 caught fire on the launch pad. Fortunately, the three astronauts survived thanks to the quick reaction of the ground crews, although they were left with burns, some major.\u00A0No major modifications were made to the capsule, mainly just the addition of a fire suppression system.\u00A0and Kerballo 2 launched with Kerbals on board. Many flights happened. Many of the Jool V flights were far less than successful, and there was major concern about the spacecraft itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, on March 30, 1968, Jebediah, Bill, and Bob Kerman strapped themselves into Kerballo 9 and blasted off towards the Moon for the first ever Kerballed lunar landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalfway through their transit to the moon, there was a spark. Like Kerballo 1, the capsule caught fire. The suppression system activated, but the fire had already done its job. All of the oxygen had been rapidly used up, and none of the astronauts had their spacesuits on. All three perished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SCKN attempted to take advantage of this failure by launching Alexei and Valentina Kerman towards the moon on the third launch of the massive K-1 rocket. The launch failed and the whole rocket exploded. The launch escape system would have saved their lives, had one of the solid rocket motor casings not failed, causing the breakup of the escape tower...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were plans to push on with space exploration. However, in August of 1968, the unthinkable happened. In the early morning, 1,000 SCKN nuclear missiles were launched towards the UKP with no warning. The UKP responded likewise, launching a barrage back at the SCKN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it turns out, a computer error had led the SCKN to believe that the UKP had launched first, and they believed that they were the ones retaliating.\u00A0The leaders of the two nations had not spoken for years, but they spoke over phone, realizing their mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth sides had publicly claimed that the missiles had no self destruct systems, but that was not accurate. The UKPs missiles disarmed and hit the ground with no detonation... Except for three errant missiles, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The SCKN\u0027s missiles detonated high in the atmosphere, wiping out most of the electronics on the entire planet, except for two missiles, which continued on their planned trajectories, also killing hundreds of thousands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe incident, known as the Doomsday War, sent the world into crisis. Tensions between the two countries increased even higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1969, the leaders of the two countries met. They did not discuss peace. They did not discuss reparations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey agreed to an immediate ban on ICBMs and nuclear weapons, and anything deemed more powerful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was good news for the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was now no need for long range missiles, and due to the abysmal economic and social state of the world, no need for a manned spaceflight program. Only a few basic launchers were kept around for satellite launches. The rocket propulsion divisions of Kerbodyne and Rockomax were no longer needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n===\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new company did not have much success at first. Once the reality set in that the work would be hard just to keep the dream of spaceflight alive, many people quit.\u00A0There was no way they could obtain funding or personnel\u00A0to build rockets like the Jool V, so they set their sights on simpler goals: A rocket that could be competitive in the satellite launch market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could not get the money for this. Given the state of the economy, they couldn\u0027t even get money for a spare chair. The company declared bankruptcy in 1970 and the assets were sold off to an anonymous buyer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix years later, the world had stabilized significantly. Things were not back to normal, but they were close enough. Tensions were still high, but nothing had come from it. The anonymous buyer attempted to restart Kerbomax. A few dedicated workers showed up, but much of the knowledge on how to build rockets had been lost. The company was able to secure a few investments, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1979, the Ateli-3 rocket was launched into suborbital space. In 1982, the Peace 2 rocket reached Low Kerbin Orbit with 10 kilograms of soil from all available countries on board. Nobody had a use for a 10 kilogram launcher, however. Kerbomax, still practically on a life support budget, needed a bigger rocket if they ever wanted to be profitable. An investor they got, in the form of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s dying father, who wanted to see his son\u0027s dream come true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings us to today - July 18, 1985.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w1jzMfu.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/w1jzMfu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman\u0027s father had sadly passed away before he could see the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTriumph 1 was powered by an LV-T45 engine with two solid rocket boosters. The second stage was powered by a LV-909. The third stage was a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FlKHCdQ.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FlKHCdQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the thrust to weight ratio of the first stage affected the guidance software significantly, and the dummy payload did not reach orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbomax had a few satellite launch contracts, but only for after a successful launch. They did not have the money for that second launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this story isn\u0027t about Kerbomax. It\u0027s about those who bought the second launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AtukIGP.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AtukIGP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJanuary, 1986. The second flight of Triumph, this version called the Triumph 1A. This was he first flight of a boilerplate \u0022Limitless\u0022 spacecraft, developed on a shoestring budget by the Starhouse Foundation, a small team of dedicated engineers who had set their sights on long term Kerbal spaceflight. Initially, they existed to try to convince the government to get back into manned spaceflight, but after the tragic Kerballo program, there was pretty much no way they would. The government gave the company a small sum (by government terms) to never bring up the issue again. But the government goofed... They had just unwittingly paid for the beginnings of a new age in space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that money, the Starhouse Foundation planned to kickstart the development of a space station, a crewed vehicle, and a resupply vehicle. The initial money would not be enough for even one launch of their planned spacecraft, however, as the government owned launch vehicles were very expensive. The entire project was downsized, to be based off of Kerbomax\u0027s Triumph rocket. The money would just barely cover the first unmanned launch\u00A0of the two man Limitless capsule. After that, the foundation would hopefully receive investor funding to proceed with their plans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022volelPI.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/volelPI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLimitless Test Flight 1 took a lofted trajectory due to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E concerns.

The capsule splashed down very hard, damaging several critical components, dislodging a few hull panels. It sunk to the bottom of the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were numerous flaws uncovered during that mission, the most pressing being that landing was not survivable. This scared away most of the investors, leaving only half of the money required for a second test flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen interviewed by the media, Albrecht Kerman, one of the wealthier\u00A0investors said \u0022I will not sink a single cent into that program unless they can prove that it is safe, and I don\u0027t think that will happen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if they make it safe?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then I\u0027ll eat my hat.

One of the most important changes was the addition of a small amount of rear habitation space, including a sixth docking port at the rear of the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022ruGXqQJ.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ruGXqQJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeeks later, the first crew (2 civilian pilots) were launched to the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022XLTAd0s.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XLTAd0s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPolar orbits necessitated longer rendezvous times and more aggressive maneuvers, and this mission took the two crew higher above Kerbin than any previous mission by the Starhouse Foundation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the rendezvous was not nominal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLimitless 5 began braking too late, and rammed into Rainbow 2 with significant velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022kh9Y81G.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kh9Y81G.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were visible cracks in the station, and one of the solar panels on Limitless 5 was broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022rbVdRVP.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rbVdRVP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few frantic minutes, the crew docked with the forward port on the station. The news was not good. The station had completely depressurized following the collision. It could not be entered, and repair to a pressure vessel had never been done in space before. The next mission also had a mandatory air force payload on board, so there was little room in the next Melody for a patch kit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, with some creative engineering, both payloads were squeezed into the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022O4jUK1L.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/O4jUK1L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis came at a cost, however.

Nevertheless, it was at the station, as a continuation of the Air Force\u0027s early experiments, only this time, experiments would not be against metal plates or dummy satellites.
