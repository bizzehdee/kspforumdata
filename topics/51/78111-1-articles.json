I could have easily opted for an LV-909 for its higher ISP, or an LV-T30 for its lower mass. However the contract to test the engine in flight effectively paid for the engine, and it was the best choice for the ascent profile to orbit I made use of anyways, due to its thrust vectoring (which was highly necessary to maintain control under the strong aerodynamics forces acting on the rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a brief word about the ascent profile: what was THAT, some of you might be asking...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you just witnessed, was the full glory of body-lift with Ferram Aerospace Research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough this was not an original part of the design, I quickly realized when running a few launch-revert \u0022simulations\u0022 to determine what Thrust Limiter I would have to apply to my SRB\u0027s to reach the target speeds for my contracts at the target altitudes (a REAL space program would have talented engineers who would simply be familiar with the mathematical formulae to determine such frivolities, but *I* was left running \u0022computer simulations\u0022 since I\u0027m not an aerospace engineer) that the flattened shape of the vessel when turned with the axis the SRB\u0027s were placed on parallel to the ground was perfect for generating \u0022body lift\u0022- aerodynamic lift experienced by even relatively non-aerodynamic objects, such as rockets and the fuselages of jet planes (though normally speed has to be quite high- as with my rocket- or the fuselage well blended into the wings of a plane, for this effect to be significant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, with sufficient speed, my rocket was able to hold much of its weight up with lift, rather than with gravity- enabling it to achieve orbit despite its rather shallow ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was not the *optimal* ascent- but it allowed me to efficiently fulfill three separate contracts for testing rocket parts at low altitudes and high speeds. There was simply no way to achieve these speeds without a very shallow ascent and high TWR- any vessel ascending vertically would have either been moving too slowly when passing through this altitude range with a low TWR, or much too quickly by the time of reaching this altitude with a high TWR. And since I was using SRB\u0027s, there was no way to simply throttle down or turn off the engines of a high-TWR craft so as to reach the proper speeds/altitudes with a vertical ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA plane would have worked too- but I don\u0027t have the tech nodes necessary for supersonic flight with jet engines yet (some of the test speeds were supersonic), and the basic \u0022Swept Wings\u0022 available to me at this point are not only rather unstable at supersonic speeds with their default sweep (though I could always angle them into the fuselage with Shift\u002BClick- sacrificing some of the wing area and thus lift, for stability), but would really require a powerful rocket-plane to reach the desired speeds anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I was going to use rockets for my propulsion, and I was going to be relying on lift to fight gravity, I figured why not do it in a badass and unconventional way?
