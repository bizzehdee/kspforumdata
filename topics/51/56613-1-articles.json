We managed to get 25 science from a few EVA reports, surface samples, and other stuff that we forced our kerbals into dangerous situations to retrieve. Despite that, we were determined to see our design work, and so we did. On the ship\u0027s second launch, it ascended up through the atmosphere to 90 km above the surface, marking kerbal kind\u0027s first trip to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KyFfPzrh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KyFfPzrh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways impatient, Jeb burned downwards to make the ship get back earlier.
