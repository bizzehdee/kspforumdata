Just a regular launch and then I burned for the Mun. I arrived at the Mun with a periapsis of 9.8 km. Got my self into a low Munar orbit. However I have a bad communications network around the Mun. So I had to wait 5 months to all the probes to align. Once the probes aligned I started the landing burn. I didn\u2019t have long as the probes moved fast. After 10 minutes I was 4 meters above the surface when I lost communications. The craft feel and Boom! The landing equipment broke but the rover was fully fun cation all and in one piece. I explored the nearby craters and used the robotic scanner to scan some rocks. Soon I will drive the rover to Munar a rover that ends it\u2019s mission when the solar panels broke. The rover is over 100 km away so it might take a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003EStatus: Fully Functional, All Dqiupment is Safe, Landed on Mun, Mission is 68% complete, life expentancy: at least 30 years\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-17T17:34:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2021 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Dr. Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-17T14:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223927603\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613537418\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207217\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Dr. Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I had to wait 5 months to all the probes to align\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit would have been faster to just launch a new comms\u00A0network.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-17T17:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#d35400\u0022\u003EARelay:\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#d35400\u0022\u003ERelay Probe, Satellite, Mission: 56 years\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nARelay is a relay probe launched from Woomerang Launch site.

This is not the first time I\u2019ve made an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTo\u003C/abbr\u003E and made it to orbit however. Before I get to why I announced this I will tell you the beginning. First I made the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I launched from the run way and kept a rather high pitch. Just 10 meters or 0.01 kilometers from the end of the runway the plane swept up and it flew like an angel (I\u2019m just tying to say it easy to fly). I kept a 43 degree pitch for about 4 kilometers and pitched to a 25 degree pitch. Keeping the pitch for a long time I gained speed up to 2,345 m/s just 45 km above \u00A0sea level. I had a very efficient gravity turn and I got it not orbit just using 2 nuclear engine aboard the plane. However since I launched in the evening the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was at night by the time I got into orbit. I had plan to land back at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (being my first time). \u00A0After waiting 5 hours in orbit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0was faintly in some light and it was in the morning. I burned retrograde and entered the atmosphere. I kept a -9 degree pitch amazing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Thank goodness the craft didn\u2019t blow up. Looked like the Kraken let me survive. After keeping the angle for about until I reached 3,00 meters above sea level i realized I was going to fast. Pitching up and down I started to loose emended speed. However the landing would be awful. During rentry my allotment was off from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I could land on the runway. I had to fly around and make some really sharp turns. I almost hit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Oo. That gave me chills. However I finally pitched up to make a loop. I shutdown my engine and fell. I rotated the craft and reignited the engines and faced the runway. I had put the lights and gears on. Soon I finally touched the Runway surface with the wheels. Success! It was the first time ever I had landed on the Runway. I quickly braked and the mission ended. Woo. What a flight. Jebidiah and Bill were relieved. The long 6 hour mission ended. And I built and landed my first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EStatus: Fully Functional, Reusable, Not Broken, Crew Survived, Mission Succesful\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
