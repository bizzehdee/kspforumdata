The objective is to relocate a 600ton-asteroid from a 13.000km orbit around Eve to a low Kerbin orbit (because some administrator decided it would be way easier to study the thing in LKO). Also, this is my first mission that will lead me out of Kerbins sphere of influence \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Constraints and Planning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Mission restriction: The asteroid may not enter any atmposphere (or must be protected with a large heat shield during atmosphering maneuvers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Mission optional goal: Recover a three-man-crew orbiting around Eve (this is the crew of the botched \u0022Roche Expedition 1\u0022 mission, whose failure made the administrator come up with the great idea to bring the asteroid home). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I want to do the mission in one launch, with only stock parts. My heaviest lifter can launch 200 tons to LKO. To see if this is even possible, i made some quick calculations with a spreadsheet calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The final stage captures the asteroid (with a stabbing device that comes with the mission). If i understand the delta-V-maps which i have never used before, it takes about 1310 m/s to escape from Eve LKO (reduced by 500m/s for the 13000km orbit), 80m/s to intercept Kerbin and another 950m/s to establish a low orbit around Kerbin assuming no aerobraking. Total return dV requirement: 1840m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 1840m/s with 10 atomic drives, 600 tons of dead weight and the rest fuel would require 165 tons of fuel. Bringing that to Eve would require more 30 tons of fuel, and we have not jet counted anything else (fuel tank dry weight, command pods, stuff, snacks, RCS etc), and have no fuel for Eve operations. Well, scrap that, back to the drawing board\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 1840 m/s with ion drives requires about 30 tons of fuel. Great! Oh wait, we want to push 600 tons of dead weight. Even if i bring 60 Ion engines, we could only accellerate at a whopping 30kN/600ton= 0.05m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 (or even less if counting engine\u002Bfuel\u002Belectricity support mass). Not going to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Aerobraking! Lets remove most of the 950m/s for Kerbin LKO establishing from the equation (and remember to bring a big shield for the precious rock). 1000m/s with 6 atomic engines and 30 tons of stuff =\u0026gt; 90 tons of fuel. Bringing that to Eve with 1000m/s remaining for asteroid rondevouz operations =\u0026gt; 40 tons of fuel.

Almost 1 full X-32 fuel tank remained from the launching stage, which granted me some unplanned \u0022free\u0022 dV. I learned a lot about interplanetary travels that i did not know before. Who knew that the delta-V map assumes ballistic (non-homann) transfers for Eve? These require a somewhat different launch window. And those mid-flight plane-alignment burns for Homann transfers really stink (370m/s for those tiny 2.1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination? come on!) Oh, and while escaping Kerbin can be done with just 850m/s and a Mun gravity-assist, that does NOT mean that it\u0027s just 80m/second from just outside Kerbins SOI to Eve. Anyway, after countless tries of fiddling with maneuver nodes and consulting various KSP travel calculators, i got the EIVAARRK with Scott Kerman at the helm on a ballistic transfer to Eve with an encounter sheduled in about 40 days. Even without the asteroid, turning this 200-ton-hulk without RCS takes forever, and the accelleration is not that great (1000m/s in 10 minutes). I split the escape burn in three parts to increase the accuracy of the burns (and to practice splitting a long burn, since with the asteroid attached this ship will accellerate at less than 0.5m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2EujHVH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222EujHVH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Report Part 2: Eve Arrival, Aerobraking and Crew Rescue\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0v138taxezp8axd/Roche_Part2_Eve_Arrival_CrewRescue.wmv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVideo (download for higher resolution)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some minor in-transfer course corrections totalling in at about 30m/s, Scott reaches Eve and does two rounds of aerobraking. The final plane alignment took about 75m/s, pushing the Apoapsis back out to 13000km another 500m/s. Scotts decouples the small crew rescue craft, collects the three stranded Kerbals (its Bill, Bob and Jeb!) from their disfunctional command pod and heads back to the main ship. Someone forgot to put RCS thrusters on the ship (duh!), so re-docking is handled by Jebediah, with Bill, Bob and Scott watching from command seats on the main craft.

The shield is decoupled, Bill examines the Asteroid in EVA to find the stabbing spot. Scott carefully aligns the ship into stabbing position, and goes in for the kill. The docking forces eject the Scott and Bob (and one of the 4 shield ports), which suffer a Kraken attack but eventually reccover and return to the ship. Jeb arrives with the shield and undocks the rescue craft. Some minutes later, the shield is docked in position, and we are ready for departure. According to the data readouts, the combined craft has about 1100m/s dV remaining, which should be enough for a comfortable return to Kerbin.

One long 15-minute burn (about 600m/s) puts the EIVAARK with Roche on an intercept with Kerbin. Some minor course adjustments direct the ship into Kerbins atmosphere for aerobraking at about 32km. The shield works perfectly, the one missing docking port makes not much of a difference. A second round of non-scorching aerobraking at 42km bring the Apoapsis down to 175km.
