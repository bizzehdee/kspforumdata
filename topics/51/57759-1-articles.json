The plan is to mine kethane and send the converted fuel up to the station, then to refuel interplanetary spacecraft from there. Also this is a test run for a base on Duna, or potentially another planet/moon. The name is from the battle cry of my Scottish clan (clan Buchanan).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using the Modular base pack (I think thats the right name). The base is still under construction, and the station parts are in orbit above Minmus, waiting for assembly. I will rearrange the base once mode modules have arrived. More to come...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA error I realised once in space, is that the solar panels on the trusses are spaced too close together, they extend OK but look a bit wierd as they touch each other. Once on station I will only extend the inner and outer panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis project bought to you by BaSA (Buchanan and Son Aerospace)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RJYUH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

First, I send a long tunnel segment for the base to Minmus, unfortunately when I was constructing it in the VAB I built it upside down, with upwards firing rockets for landing. When trying to enter Minmus orbit, I forgot the rockets were facing backwards and burnt prograde rather than retrograde \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E The segment is now leaving Munmus SOI for a Kerban orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I successfully landed a methane refinery on Minmus, then whilst attempting to maneuver it into position with the transporter rover, tipped it on its side.

Other modules arrived, including the Kethane drilling unit, the Base Control Tower, and the Hab module. After assembling for a crew photo atop the Control Tower, Jeb was busting to try out his shiny new kethane drill. He promptly got to work supervising from the Control Tower, while the others got stuck in to a case of Kerban Ale that Ribhat had sneaked onboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb discovered that the power demands of the kethane drill far exceeded the base\u0027s power supply, so he got the Kerbal Engineers to \u0022soup up\u0022 the next Tower of Power that is currently in transit to Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile in Minmus Low Orbit, a fuel pod for the station arrived and docked with just enough RCS fuel to spare.
