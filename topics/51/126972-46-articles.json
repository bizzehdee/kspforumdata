It was still very early in the morning, before sunrise, but Rosuki knew Gene wouldn\u0027t show up today. No matter how much she wanted him too. No, Gene Kerman had no idea they existed. They had just gotten back on their feet from the last cycle when another hit. One day your friends and coworkers are there, the next they\u0027re gone. Their new Gene was still out there somewhere.

Their new \u0022boss,\u0022 Cartina, had backed down from her self-appointed bosshood. It was one thing to try to run your own program, an entirely different thing when kerbals who have done it many times before turn up out of the blue. Now Cartina was just there to help with the public outreach. The easy tasks. And she was still on this council of Jonbald\u0027s. Continuum. A council reduced to four members, having recently lost their chief designer, their first astronaut, and their flight director.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs usual their first act in the new cycle was for Jonbald to get the tracking station working. He had the network lit up in no time at all. Still no word from her crews at Jool, same as before. (Still no word form the others, either. Eve? Duna? Who knows. Rosuki could only hope they were all ok.) The records in the box recovered from the M\u00FCn was still there, and those were the first bits they downloaded. They had hard-wired the memory in those boxes. Burned the data directly into the gates that stored it. Read-Only. Permanent. Rosuki wondered why nobody had tried it before. And then she realized.

They had built it and the other new space center buildings using plans the monks had brought them. Same plans as before, just somehow preserved. As usual the buildings were financed with the Funds delivered by the Kerbin World First Record Keeping Society. Record Keeping. Regular as clockwork, that lot. Always showing up with snacks and money just when they\u0027d reached some new high. Orbit Moho. Land on Eeloo. Dock in Laythe Orbit. How did they know? Many times the representative would show up within moments of them bringing the tracking station online. Arriving out of nowhere. Seemingly instant travel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like the monks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was no great surprise then when Munlin greeted Orsby, their World\u0027s First representative, just as he\u0027d greeted Jonbald: With a bow and a smile. The World Firsters seemed to know everything about everything. How could they know there were spacecraft around Laythe? Even the network failed to pick them up. No, these monks really seemed to know everything. Most of them were in a space program at one time or another. Even Archibald had been to the M\u00FCn with Rosuki and a couple others. He\u0027d claimed to have been a spacekerb in the distant past, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt made sense to her now. It was only natural the monks, these space veterans, would set up a records organization to both finance and reward future endeavors. Run by their order. With access to all of their records. Records that went back who knows how long. Records that somehow persisted. She considered calling up Archibald to ask how when the Chromium 1 pulled her attention away once more.

Rosuki wanted to resurrect the older Sonata or Cantata launcher, but the local fab shops were both unable and unwilling to build the parts they needed. So they started over. This new rocket was a simple design, inspired by a mid-sized \u0022home grown\u0022 booster Munlin had described to them. The worker kerbs had called it Titan. A titan that was now screaming its concerto as it raced towards the heavens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sonata parts hadn\u0027t been the only things the local factories refused to build. NERVAs also landed on the \u0022no can do\u0022 list. Rosuki had a design for the Jool return ship stuck in her head. Something she\u0027d worked out with Wernher. Her Wernher. The old Wernher. And it needed NERVAs. A few of them, at least. The nuclear materials for which had been rejected immediately. The shop foreman hadn\u0027t minced words about it either. \u0022The RTGs, yeah, we can do that. Simple. Any numbskull can shove blutonium into a tube. But these here fuel rods? Highly enriched blutonium? Ya can\u0027t just whip that up overnight. That\u0027ll take time. And money.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoney they didn\u0027t exactly have. So they were a bit stuck. A few contract later, and perhaps. By then it might be too late though, so Rosuki gave the go-ahead to start the refining process. She still wanted her crews back, even if the Continuum as a whole was only concerned with its two big issues: Communications and Off-Worlding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the second stage was done. Mission Control erupted into applause as the telemetry showed the craft had entered a safe parking orbit. 245km by 130km. It took a few moments for Rosuki to realize this was the first time any of the kerbals had launched a rocket, let alone placed something into orbit. This type of over-the-top celebration was something she\u0027d almost forgotten after such tasks became routine. Best to let these new kerbals celebrate. They\u0027d earned it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161210_ksp0020_cr1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161210_ksp0020_cr1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfterwards the Cr-1 burned its way into Keosynchronous transfer. Inefficient, entering a parking orbit like this, so Rosuki made a mental note to change the ascent of the rest of the satellites. Direct ascent to KTO. At least the second stage had been programmed to deorbit itself with the fuel left over, but that could be accounted for without the waste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few hours later and the first of the Chromiums was in its intended orbit, looking down at them judgmentally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161210_ksp0025_cr1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161210_ksp0025_cr1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey launched two more Chromiums over the next several days, each placed roughly 120 degrees behind the previous. These small satellites used their four omnidirectional Communicatron 16s for uplink and cross-talk, while their two mid-sized relay dishes handled downlink or communications with other ships. They didn\u0027t add much network capacity, but the older Neons still worked quite well. The new Chromiums were just insurance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second and third used the revised launch profile. Instead of a parking orbit, the Concerto launcher placed them directly into Keosynchronous transfer. The second stage would fall back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere while the satellite would burn into whatever orbit it needed. The same was used by the Chromium Heavies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Chromium Heavies, decked out with the largest dish they could find, would allow them to talk to the Argon and other satellites in deep orbits. To make room for the large dish, they had to move the two smaller relays to the bottom pf the craft and double the satellite\u0027s fuel reserves. This added mass also required more fuel in the launch vehicle, accomplished by just adding a larger tank to the second stage. Simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just like that, Chromium Heavy 4, 5, and 6 were also overhead, though not looking quite as judgmental.

No need for the uber-long-range dish, but the would need the extra fuel. So the design reverted back to using the two mid-sized relays on the top of the satellite, and added two more smaller relays to the side. Three of these were planed for both of the larger moons.

It must have seemed surreal to the crews in this new space agency, to reach the M\u00FCn after only seven launches. It wasn\u0027t like they\u0027d tried to keep the existence of their old space program a secret from them. Quite the opposite. They knew going into this that there was a crew orbiting the M\u00FCn.

And that they\u0027d have to program in the circularization burn now, as there was no guarantee they\u0027d be able to communicate with the Cr-10 once it was at its perch high above Duna\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did this happen?

His early design for the off-world station where they would move the program administration. It was Rosuki\u0027s idea, at least at first, but one which Jonbald had embraced fully.

Something had told her that Jonbald had been responsible, some hunch. It was Jonbald, afterall, that had worked to hide the Forgotten all those years ago.

I discovered the source of my \u0022let\u0027s accidentally send a Minmus probe to Duna\u0022 issue. If you stage and then change focus away from a ship during the middle of a planned burn, the \u2206v of the maneuver resets back to what it was at the start of the burn. I\u0027m not sure how long this bug has been there, but I\u0027m 100% certain it didn\u0027t work that way in 1.0.5. Explains why my first Minmus relay ended up about 600m/s over its target velocity - that happens to be just how much was left in\u00A0the second stage of the launch vehicle before it relit in Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow this happened: The LV-10 Concerto launcher has a guidance unit in it, a bit of a holdover from my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E habits. (Needs sufficient avionics for the tonnage, etc.) So, to avoid creating \u0022debris\u0022 that\u0027s marked as a probe, I was switching back to the just-expended second stage, marking it as actual debris, and then switching back to the satellite. Doing that is what tripped me up, as it \u0022reset\u0022 and added another ~600m/s\u00A0or so to the burn\u00A0that I didn\u0027t notice until it was too late.

The conversion to KerbNet communications seems to have only partially worked. While some craft can talk to the network, namely those launched in 1.0.5, many of my older satellites that had been working under RemoteTech (using the ModuleRTDataTransmitter and whatnot) suddenly stopped working. Three of these were the antiquated relays in Minmus Stationary Orbit.
