Is it doable? Well I did some math - engines will require 6.19 units of liquid fuel every second, there is 6800 units of the stuff onboard, which gives burn time just about 18 minutes. It takes aproximate of 11m30s-12m to get Jool intercept. In other words, in this configuration ship should have 3200m/s of dV is it enough to reach stable orbit 100km above Laythe...?
