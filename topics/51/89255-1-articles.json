I\u0027m just going to put up a lot of things over there on the purple planet to make it easier to explore in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese effort are split up into 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Probes. I will place multiple unmanned spacecraft into orbit \u0027round Eve in order to fully understand the space around the planet before i send people there. Along with that, there will be several surface ventures that will be very ambitious - polar landings, water landings, mountain landings, lowland landings, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Manned outposts in orbit of both Eve and Gilly. Refueling stations, science stations, stations with a lot of crew, you name it. There will even be surface refueling stations for when i start exploring the surface with crewed landers and bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Full-scale surface invasion. I will conquer Eve once and for all with hundreds, possibly thousands of Kerbals!
