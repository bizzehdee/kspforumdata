I liked the character enough that I brought him into Voyage, although the name is originally from an unrelated Minecraft Let\u0027s Play series.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How much do you want to hear?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How much time do we have?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, good point. So there I was - Just an ordinary cow out on Planet Pock! Oh, to be ordinary again... On Planet Pock, with the wonderful green continents, blue riv-ceans, brown mountains, pink forests... That was centuries ago, I barely remember much of my life, only that I missed it... But then one day there was a giant meteor. Probably more like a moon, honestly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A moon just came out of nowhere?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well probably not, but I\u0027m not into astrology, how would I know?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Astrology? I think you mean - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, right, Astral Projection. ANYWAY, I saw the meteor moon thing coming... I named it Ted. And then I realized that Ted wanted a hug, but unfortunately he\u0027s so big that I was like \u0022Oh no, Ted is gonna kill us aaaaalllllll!\u0022 and ran to my shed to escape Ted.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why the shed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, what instead?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you tread ahead to the shed to escape Ted.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why the shed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see, I had this wonderful plan! I had TNT in my shed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why should I know? Anyway, I quickly assembled a makeshift TNT powered rocket.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In such a short time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, it wasn\u0027t much to look at. I made a metal cylinder, stuffed it with TNT, slapped some random yellow triangles on as fins, borrowed a steering wheel, slapped a nose cone on, and tied a chair to it. But, before I could finish it, a spark from my lamp lit the fuse without me noticing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Random yellow triangles?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re more concerned about him having random triangles than building a makeshift rocket in several minutes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So anyway, I was tied to the rocket, and it took off as I was looking through my tool box. It yanked me up into the air rather violently, but that was for the best because Ted gave Planet Pock a hug right then. Everything went all explodey and when I looked back, Planet Pock was gone.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m so sorry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I miss it sometimes, but I\u0027ve had centuries to come to terms with that. Anyway, so I\u0027m out in space, and - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How high was the gravity on planet Pock?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, maybe a tad under a g.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How could you have possibly reached space on board a rocket powered by TNT?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I dunno. All the scientists say it was impossible.\u00A0 But they say a lot of things about me are impossible. Anyway, so I\u0027m out in space, I\u0027d just managed to climb in to my seat, when I see a crack, and the rocket straight up EXPLODES. So now I\u0027m REALLY out in space, alone, and I bounce off of this random satellite - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did Pock have a space program?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope, but I\u0027m fairly sure I bounced off a satellite. And then, after that, I faceplanted into a moon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And survived?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well I\u0027m here, aren\u0027t I? Stop interrupting! To my left I see a crashed UFO, and then I fell into this hole and fell for five minutes... I land in a pile of cheese, and meet these green aliens who give me this translator!\u0022 Galactus showed us the translator around his neck. \u0022Able to translate into any language. They seemed to know all about me already, and told me that in order to save my planet, I need to find the Magic Boulder.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh yeah, I think Jeb told us about that briefly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But before they could tell me more, the aliens went to the bathroom to vomit. Apparently they are actually red, but turn green when they need to throw up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Freaky.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s exactly what I thought! So they say \u0022We are the defenders of the cheese moon\u0022 or something and tell me that the Magic Boulder is a work of the ancients that allows the user to travel through time. Sort of.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, don\u0027t we have time travel technology already?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, yes, and no. Half of the people say \u0022Hey we should use it\u0022 and the other people say \u0022Hey we shouldn\u0027t\u0022 but the \u0022Hey we shouldn\u0027t\u0022 people just use their time machines to undo everything that the \u0022Hey we should\u0022 people do. Which isn\u0027t much, it takes exponentially more power to go back through time a ton, trips very far back would require far too much energy. ANYWAY, all that is moot because I would later find out that the Boulder\u0027s time travel technology is very, very limited, it\u0027s less \u0022Time Travel\u0022 and more \u0022Bring a destroyed planet back from the dead into the present\u0022 or something like that. The details are very, very sketchy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The boulder, however, was well hidden, they said. They tell me that on the planet below there is this pig named Phil the Pig who can help me. They also tell me to fear the Yhugoslavakianos.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t know the Yugoslavians had a space program.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, Yhugoslavakianos, not Yugoslavians. So they tell me I can use their escape cannon. To get into it, I had to use anti gravity, and then I got fired to the planet below.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You survived a planet explosion, a rocket explosion, bouncing off a satellite at orbital speeds, crashing into a moon, falling into cheese, and launching from a cannon in the space of under an hour?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Closer to half an hour.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I HAVE NO IDEA!\u0022 he cackled. \u0022So anyways - Sure you don\u0027t want any nachos? No? Ok. So anyways, I re entered the atmosphere and landed in a parking lot, next to a fast food restaurant. I\u0027m kidnapped and taken to some sort of farm, where I coincidentally met Phil the Pig. What are the odds?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably not good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So I tell him I\u0027m looking for the Magic Boulder, and he says that he had information but lost it on the planet Mycelium. So you know what we did?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We built another rocket!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Was it with a more sensible fuel?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope, still TNT. But hey, at least we had a windshield this time! Phil had an Anti-Lab below the farm\u0027s barn, and we got to work on TNT 02.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anti-Lab?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s like a lab but it sounds cooler! There were a number of upgrades over the last one. It was more structurally sound, had two integrated seats, we switched the fins from random yellow triangles to curved blue sheet metal spikes, and we painted flames on the front. Five zentongs later, we were ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have a question.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How would we launch without being noticed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, that was not my question.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Glad you asked, Phil pressed his volcano button.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that a codename?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, it\u0027s code for \u0022That button that raises a giant fake volcano from the underground.\u0022 Very convenient.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How would that help?!?!?!?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Distraction!!! So we were about to launch, and then this giant several hundred foot tall green alien with eyestalks shows up, rips off a giant chunk of the giant fake volcano and shouts \u0022OALBOALBOLABOLABOLABOLACHIA!\u0022 and starts towards the barn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why was he there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have no idea! So we got in, lit the fuse, and launched! Control was a bit dicey at first, we blew up the barn and did a loop the loop, but flew right through the chunk of volcano in the alien\u0027s hand!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes! I was very glad we added a windshield.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You couldn\u0027t have made it far, TNT can\u0027t have a very high specific impulse at all!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well we made it pretty far, and I\u0027m glad we did. That was a GREEN alien, remember? Imagine the vomit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what happened after you crashed back down?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you mean? After we launched, we flew past this gas giant with an ice moon, but we were running low on TNT so we stopped at a gas station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There was a random gas station that sold TNT out in the middle of nowhere? You made it to another planet with TNT? AGAIN?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There were two gas stations, one was cheaper! So anyway, we got supplies, and they upgraded us to Premium TNT free of charge! We also got a GPS.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They have GPS in space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Galactic Positioning System. So then we flew for a bit, and ended up at Infinity City, a giant space city, where we stayed at a hotel. Then we went to Nelson\u0027s Military Surplus Store, he\u0027s a cool dude.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Military? I thought nobody else was violent!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, I know what I saw! They all think I\u0027m crazy, but well... I mean I guess I\u0027m pretty crazy... But I know what I saw, alright! So we refueled there, got some rocket launchers, and crossed the Infinity line!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s kinda like a wormhole, but more liney. But then, we were attacked by space pirates!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There are space pirates? Isn\u0027t the galaxy supposed to be peaceful?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Again, I know what I saw, I swear! Luckily, those rocket launchers came in handy. But then we noticed we had a stowaway, Franny the Frog!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So Galactus the Cow, Phil the Pig, and Franny the Frog now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Those are all human animals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well obviously not. Evolution often trends towards similar designs...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Intelligent frogs?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes! So she is like uber smart and fixes up the ship for us, and makes some improvements. I don\u0027t remember the specifics, but I think that she was able to get the specific impulse up to like 900 or something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For TNT? Impossible!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oi, this was Premium TNT! So then we get to talking. Franny the Frog tells me that her homeworld was destroyed by those Yugo guys, and joins us on the quest to find the Magic boulder so we can restore both of our planets.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This sounds like a comic book a middle schooler would write.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we get to Mycelium, and it\u0027s this giant planet with brown terrain, some blue oceans and rivers, a giant war-torn wasteland, and this GIGANTIC mushroom that leads up into space, with a city beneath it. The legend was that this mushroom was created by the Great Wizard Ladstini eons ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...A war torn wasteland?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know what I saw, I\u0027ll say it again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So much war... So the humans... Aren\u0027t unique in their ways of violence?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean, they\u0027ve found four others.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But we\u0027re at several already!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I. Know. What. I. Saw. Anyway, major design flaw, TNT 02 has no landing gear. And we ran out of fuel. So we skid across the top of the mushroom for a few minutes, not slowing down much, before plummeting off the side into the war torn wasteland. We survived, but poor TNT 02 was wrecked... HOWEVER, we ended up crashing near the site of a buried relic. We dug for a bit, and we ended up finding this ancient golden mushroom with an inscription. It said that it was Ladstini\u0027s research on the Magic Boulder, but the actual stuff was untranslatable, it was such an old language! So we were going to find a translator.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s sensible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022BUUUUT then one of those red aliens from the cheese moon from earlier shows up in a weird rocket and says \u0022Hey we\u0027re actually the bad guys, give us the relic\u0022 and apparently Franny is actually their queen! She steals the relic, threatens us, and leaves with those guys, who actually turned out to be the Yugo guys. So now we\u0027re stranded in a war torn wasteland, with no TNT, no relic, and apparently the mushroom monsters come out at midnight. Then, this giant sphere with the words \u0022Depth Sphere 3\u0022 or something shows up in the sky, no idea what happened to the first two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Death Star?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the hell is the Death Star doing in reality?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know what the Death Star is?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, it\u0027s like the best known superweapon in all of human fiction.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OH!!!! THIS IS BIG! So Franny\u0027s device also pulled from human fiction! And this was thousands of years ago\u2026 so\u2026 Future fiction??? Wait, I\u0027m getting ahead of myself... So later we found out that Franny and the Yugos had come up with this device that could gather all of the greatest villains from fiction and history in one spot, in reality. There were hundreds, but there was this \u0022Dark Invader\u0022 dude who built the Depth Spheres, and maybe a green clump of moss in a trash can, I don\u0027t remember.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Darth Vader and Oscar the Grouch?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Prime Evil! And she gathered them all in an attempt to take over the universe!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait... Like The Species?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, nothing like The Species. So they try to fire the Depth Sphere, but it doesn\u0027t work. Anyways, we\u0027re stuck on Mycelium, surrounded by junk, and then we see this volcano.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Another volcano?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. So, we are like \u0022Hey we could use this as a cannon to get back to the city\u0022 and we build a spaceship cannon projectile out of old war machines, mainly a tank and a mecha, but then we find out that this volcano is actually extremely powerful, and it launches us SUUUPER far. Like the mushroom cloud from the volcano ends up bigger than the giant mushroom from the city. A lot of the lava reached escape velocity!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s also impossible!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well obviously not. But we were on a sub orbital trajectory So we waited until near apoapsis and fired shells out of the tank cannon to circularize our orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well at least it\u0027s more sensible than TNT!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Meanwhile, Dark Invader is building more Depth Spheres in pocket dimensions but they keep failing, so Franny goes to Trash Moss for plan B. By this point, we found a space station. We met a guy who traded us the tank for a spaceship, and a promise that we restore three more worlds when we found the boulder. By complete coincidence, it was an extremely high tech, advanced TNT rocket, with seats just right for us, that looked the same as the other ones stylistically.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is an awful lot of coincidence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So anyway, Dark finally got the Depth Sphere working after like 80 thousand tries, and tires to destroy Mycelium, but the laser beam hits a giant mirror at a mirror shop, ricochets for a while, and destroys the Depth Sphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you see... I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t know?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I must have had some memories erased at some point... The next thing I remember, Phil is breaking me out of some place, and then it explodes and whatnot. He fills me in on what he remembers, basically, there was a lot of battles, lots of adventures, and when I got out of it we were on TNT 12. Franny\u0027s empire was crumbling, we retrieved the artefact, and apparently the translation said that Ladstini was somewhat fascinated with the boulder himself, apparently it was extremely, extremely old. It was a legend in his time! We had also found Phil\u0027s old notes, and a few other leads. The boulder, it seemed, had the power to restore planets at any phase of their life, or a mixed phase, but the planets had to be destroyed or disfigured. A curious being known as \u0022The Sentinel\u0022 also supposedly watched over it. But really we weren\u0027t able to find out much more.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No location hint?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Minor hints, but they were mostly speculation and led nowhere. Also, we never found Phil\u0027s planet again. We couldn\u0027t even find Mycelium again after a certain point. So Phil and I went on more adventures, trying to find the boulder... But after a certain point, well...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We gave up.\u00A0 Phil left the crew somewhere around TNT 200 or so. Last I talked to him, he was extremely depressed. The man had lost everything. Many years later, after I had been unable to even locate Phil\u0027s star system, I found the Galactic Council. I told them all I knew, but they were far more excited about \u0022Hey a new species! Let\u0027s make him a representative!\u0022 than finding the boulder. They all think I\u0027m either crazy or a comedian putting on an act.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So nobody believes you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What part of the whole story I just told you sounds believable?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good point... So wait. You found the council very late on? The Yugos weren\u0027t part of it? Nor was Franny?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope. We thought they could have been in the uncharted portions of the Galaxy. We still haven\u0027t charted everything, but we\u0027ve checked most of it and haven\u0027t found much.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did you find anything at all?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we found you lot. But no Pock. No Mycelium. No evil frogs. No Depth Spheres. No Phil. No Infinity Lines. Nothing. They still humor me, I guess, and at least act like they are seriously considering my stories... Do you believe me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I figured. But please remember... I know what I saw. I am sane. Maybe not perfectly sane. But sane. Alright?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can believe that.\u0022 Evelina nudged me and passed me her tablet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n===\u0026gt;[\u002B] Galactic Union of Planets Species Report 743\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] Subject: Pockian Cow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] Subject: Galactus The Cow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] Author: Dr. Frimiltun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On First Contact: On (DATE) we came across Galactus The Cow adrift in space in a tiny, slender rocket known by Galactus as TNT 396. Despite no prior known contact, we were able to converse with him thanks to a translator on the subject\u0027s neck. First contact went very well, with responders describing Galactus as goofy and funny. The responders were initially extremely alarmed to see what appeared to be weapons on TNT 396, however, these were said to be for \u0022asteroid defense\u0022 by the subject. Galactus was taken in for questioning and TNT 396 was taken in for inspection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On TNT 396: Rocket was approximately thirty meters long, three meters in diameter, with a dark red body with stripes, black fins, and a black nose cone with crimson flames. Galactus commented that he was going through a \u0022Goth\u0022 phase when he painted the rocket. The rocket featured three seats, all open to space, rudimentary controls, and fairly ancient computer technology. The propulsion system was hybrid. Long distance travel was achieved via a form of anti-trilithium Alcubierre drive. Deep space steering was accomplished by sub-spacetime control fins using interactions with the Higgs field to directly steer. This is not a novel concept, but has not been developed in Union space due to lack of perceived need. Medium range travel was accomplished via a compact fusion reaction engine (which also provided spacecraft power) fueled by any available liquid. Short range travel was achieved using stick-shaped explosive devices. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E capability was given by thrusters using a sticky, yellow, surprisingly tasty goop known by Galactus as \u0022Nacho Cheese.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Galactus The Cow: Galactus described a long journey that had taken him from his destroyed homeworld, Planet Pock, through many inhabited worlds, memory wipes, wars, and betrayals to The Union. We speculate that such a collection of civilizations may remain undiscovered in the Uncharted Arm of the galaxy. (ADDENDUM (DATE): Further exploration has proved that this is almost certainly not the case) For the full account of Galactus\u0027 story, please refer to Galactic Union of Planets Species Report 734.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Truth: Galactus has described several actions along his adventure that are nearly or completely physically impossible. These include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Launching a makeshift TNT powered rocket on an interplanetary journey\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Surviving several unsurvivable falls\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Launching a second makeshift TNT powered rocket on an interstellar journey\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Experiencing several one in a billion coincidences which conveniently advance his story\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Encountering several violent spacefaring species\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Surviving in a vacuum indefinitely\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] Surviving being shot out of a volcano powerful enough to change a planet\u0027s orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n///[\u002B] For the full list please refer to Galactic Union of Planets Species Report 735.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] As such, most experts have concluded that Galactus\u0027 story is almost certainly a partial or complete fabrication, although such a fabrication is likely not on purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Galactus\u0027 motivations: Galactus\u0027 homeworld, Planet Pock, was allegedly destroyed by an asteroid or moon impact. Galactus seeks the mythical object \u0022The Magic Boulder,\u0022 an ancient artefact that supposedly has the ability to restore planets via travelling through time. His adventure has been almost entirely focused on locating this boulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Evidence: No evidence of most aspects of Galactus\u0027 story have ever been found. There are no star systems in the Galaxy identical to the one supposedly housing Planet Pock. No evidence of the Magic Boulder\u0027s existence has ever surfaced. No evidence of the described series of advanced civilizations has ever surfaced, despite years (ADDENDUM (DATE): Centuries) of searching. Several logical inconsistencies have also been found in his accounts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Evidence II: However, some evidence exists. The existence of Galactus The Cow himself proves that his species exists/existed and that Planet Pock likely is/was a real place. The translator around Galactus\u0027 neck is extremely advanced, many times more advanced than our best translator technologies, and is currently impossible to replicate with known manufacturing techniques. If Galactus is to be believed about the state of Planet Pock\u0027s technological progression, they did not have the technology to construct this device. This, and the existence of the advanced systems on board TNT 396, is strong evidence for the existence of at least one additional spacefaring civilization. Therefore, with the evidence that does exist, it is impossible to completely refute Galactus\u0027 claims.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Theories: The leading theory is that Planet Pock once did exist, and was destroyed, leaving Galactus as one of the last, or the last survivor, eventually rescued by an advanced civilization. Emotionally distraught from the destruction of his homeworld, and aided by potential memory wipes or possible memory inhibiting drugs, potentially related to hospitalization, he made up an adventure, a fantastical adventure, in which he was the hero, determined to save his people. He invented the Magic Boulder and Phil and the Yugos and most of his journey in order to cope with loss and give him hope. Galactus believed this adventure was real, and acted as such, exploring in whatever ship he could find in a vain attempt to locate the supposed Magic Boulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On Anomalies: It is impossible to tell without a full dissection, something not possible until after Galactus\u0027 death (and we made him functionally immortal), but there is a minority belief within the scientific community that Galactus The Cow may be a quantum linked being, with power over a small part of reality, being able to alter the laws of physics within reason unless measured. This seems to roughly mirror the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The more precisely the anomalous effects are observed, if they exist at all, the less powerful they are, usually down to the point where they are undetectable. This would explain how he can survive long falls and how he can breathe in a vacuum, his amazing luck, and the unreasonably high effectiveness of any ship he pilots. However, due to the nature of these anomalies, these effects can never be directly measured. (ADDENDUM (DATE): Further minor inconclusive evidence of quantum linking has been observed in individuals who have survived the use of high numbers (over 30) of IC Emergency Translocation Devices (Commonly referred to as Illasticonian Crystals). However, Galactus claims to have never seen or heard of this technology or anything like it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] On The Origin of Galactus The Cow: It is speculated that Galactus The Cow may have originated from (REDACTED). However this is impossible as neither TNT 396 nor any of the TNT series rockets that Galactus recalls have the technology necessary to (REDACTED).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u002B] In Conclusion, much of what Galactus says is demonstrably false. What little grains of half-truths exist hint towards at least one possible additional unconfirmed civilization, however no additional evidence supporting any of his claims has been found. While he may possibly have severe trauma and brain damage, his intentions are peaceful, therefore I recommend that his status as a representative be maintained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(ADDENDUM (DATE): Representative Jebediah has taken a great interest in Representative Galactus. The two have become allies. Perhaps they have been able to discuss their similar experiences, namely the horrifying sight of an inhabited planet exploding. It is great that Galactus is fitting in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So... Galactus is an SCP?\u0022 I whispered to Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe... But as much as I want to believe him... I don\u0027t think I do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The story just seems too fantastical... If there was an evil frog with thousands of Death Stars, and dozens more civilizations, I think the Union would know about it. And he couldn\u0027t have come from very far away, not with the tech in his ship!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah... I wonder... Will we ever know the truth...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright you two,\u0022 Galactus announced. \u0022We\u0027re just about here. I\u0027ll try to sneak you in... I can\u0027t promise anything after that. If the meeting goes well, I might be able to evac you... But you\u0027re probably on your own, just to warn you. Good luck, main characters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Galactus, it is an honor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Likewise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Behold, the Galactic Council Chamber!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002278.50\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022PeATC0o.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PeATC0o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow... That\u0027s kinda... Underwhelming.\u0022 I observed. And it was true... Compared to the megastructures on Kerbin, Illasticonian cityscapes, Merosian space station, and beautiful Jslanian mountains, this station seemed to look dated, and like it tried to appear grand but fell a bit short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You expected more sci fi? Sorry, kids! This thing was built millennia ago, at the conclusion of the Great Interstellar War, it\u0027s ancient history. This is pretty much the oldest spacefaring vessel still in service.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...They kept a spaceship running, above a black hole, for thousands of years?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And they think I\u0027m crazy! You know, it might even be older than human civilization, I\u0027ll have to check... It was built back when we didn\u0027t know what we were doing, and retrofitted to keep up with modern tech. Gotta say though, it\u0027s quite nice having a cool ancient traditional meeting site\u00A0like this. There\u0027s all that poetic stuff about having utter destruction above and below, showing the fragility of life and how it must be protected and blah blah blah... But really I think they just wanted an excuse to make a cool space station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s so...

Imagine how awkward it would be if they found giants next and built the station too small! Everything in there is overbuilt, to accommodate all manner of species. And all that tech in the back, we can\u0027t easily replace it, so we\u0027re stuck with the non-miniaturized versions. It doesn\u0027t take three kilometers worth of stuff to sustain orbit around a black hole any more, but it did back then.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What exactly is that stuff?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, an engine, a power collection device, a whole smattering of gadgets that allows us to orbit FTL and not have time go all wonky, devices that allow nearby ships to do the same, life support systems, radiators... But anyway, the details can wait. We\u0027re going in. Those handles on the side are the docking arrays, and the council chamber itself is inside a smaller sphere inside that larger sphere up front.\u00A0I have absolutely no idea what you plan on doing, but I\u0027m going to dock near the front end on the right hand side. From there I can get you into the air vents, I\u0027m uploading the files to your tablets.\u00A0Just make sure to use the right ones, this one species breathes sulfuric acid or something like that.

This is generally worse towards the beginning of the story because I know better now. One of the biggest things I\u0027d change if I ever get around to a second draft (which requires finishing the story lol) is making the technology make more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I\u0027ve been working on recently is\u00A0making K-drives, which I\u0027ve stated to be \u0022not infinite energy machines\u0022 into something that\u0027s not actually an infinite energy machine, despite being an in-universe analogue to a glitch that is literally an infinite energy machine and behaving exactly like an infinite energy machine. My very bad explanation from a few years ago doesn\u0027t really hold together much, so here\u0027s my attempt at an explanation that makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe basic idea is that K-drives are just really good batteries combined with a way to convert potential energy directly to kinetic energy (and in later versions, back again at high efficiency).\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is done against a reference \u0022background field\u0022 so there is a zero energy level as to prevent infinite energy being extractable. This combined with a few other technologies allows for an effective FTL drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following explanation kinda makes sense with what is already written, but not completely, and will require some changes in the second draft (if it ever exists).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially, K-drives are the brute-force method of FTL. They\u00A0rely on three or four key technologies. The first is essentially a capacitor/battery capable of safely containing enormous amounts of energy. The second is a device that will allow efficient conversion between this stored energy and kinetic energy\u00A0(in both directions) via interactions with an unnamed, unmoving, universal background field. The third is an admittedly technobabble set of \u0022Muon beds\u0022 or \u0022Tachyon beds\u0022 or both (I forget which one I\u0027ve used, I probably used both) that allows for either (I haven\u0027t decided yet) shifting local lightspeed forwards or backwards so that you can still accelerate as if you were stationary, so you can accelerate efficiently and surpass C without actually surpassing C, OR doing something similar but only around C, and once you are past C you can accelerate as normal (in essence, bringing you over the light speed \u0022wall\u0022 or asymptote). The fourth technology is an inertial dampener of sorts which eliminates the local effects of acceleration. However, these are quickly replaced following the development of field-thrust\u00A0type K drives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, there\u0027s also something that allows them to avoid time dilation and/or possible time travel when exceeding light speed, but that is something nearly every sci-fi universe has to have so I won\u0027t bother trying to technobabble my way out of it, as its been done so much that people rarely\u00A0bother explaining it any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA history/explanation of K-drives:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbals discover a new extremely rare material, called K-material (I don\u0027t have a name yet, maybe Krakenium?), somewhat early on in their space exploration pursuits. It is discovered to be a very awesome battery (Early on in the story I mention humans somehow having the best battery tech but that\u0027s stupid, forget I said that, I wanted to take it out long before I thought of this).\u00A0So awesome, in fact, that it could safely store essentially but not quite infinite amounts of energy. Most of it is found naturally discharged, but some of it contains a huge amount of energy (energized K material). It is used as a general power source or very good batteries early on, in many applications. However, eventually the Kerbals discover a way to interact with a background field of sorts that permeates throughout all known space. This technology is extremely expensive. By pushing off this background field (essentially a road of sorts) they can convert stored energy into kinetic energy fairly easily (acting like a tire on the road). However it needs a lot of energy. Generators are too big/heavy. The only known stuff capable of containing this energy in a compact space is K-material (Antimatter could also be used, but this was before widespread use of antimatter as a storage medium).\u00A0Because of this, and the whims of the scientist who invented it,\u00A0the propulsion tech took on the name of the battery and not the engine.\u00A0It can be charged up using high-energy\u00A0ground based power sources and then be launched on a spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, it\u0027s worth noting that the whole galaxy is moving relative to the background field, so if you tapped the brakes, per se, you would appear to accelerate away from the planet, but only until you reached zero velocity relative to the field. So not an infinite energy machine, but it could be essentially used as a near infinite energy machine\u00A0if you could make one big enough to, say, convert the kinetic energy of planets into usable energy. However, that comes way later and isn\u0027t very practical. The first Proto-K Drives just braked and were shot out of the solar system, but had to deal with tons of waste heat from the braking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly K-drives are first tested on probes, and can only accelerate at a tiny amount, and are very jittery. This jitter is because part of the engine runs on keeping two devices (referred to as plates) a set distance from each other, the distance correlates to acceleration. Acceleration increases\u00A0exponentially the closer the plates are together, meaning it is very distance sensitive, causing vibrations with the slightest distance change. Later tech will improve this vibration. This subset of K-drive tech is known as a \u0022Point thrust\u0022 K-drive because the thrust is produced essentially at a single point, where the thrust is then transferred to the rest of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, the tech gets to a point where enough thrust is produced to essentially make torch ships (capable of a sustained 1g or more) and those ships are used for interplanetary transport (although a lot of it is still done using existing tech, which is probably some variant of nuclear fusion but I haven\u0027t detailed their exact history so I don\u0027t know exactly). The trip isn\u0027t exactly comfy, though, with that vibration. At this point, K-drive tech isn\u0027t seen as FTL-viable, it is basically just a really good \u0022conventional\u0022 propulsion system. If you managed to pack enough energy into it to get close to light speed, you would of course, be stopped long before light speed due to diminishing returns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs K-drive tech got better and better, acceleration increased too, and the only limit was how much the Kerbals could sustain. This limitation was lifted\u00A0when basic inertial dampeners were invented, which could be powered by the conveniently located uber-battery, allowing the craft to accelerate very quickly without negative effects on the payload, although the vibrations were still felt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, an essentially magic battery would have epic uses commercially, if not for the fact that, due to its rarity, it was incredibly expensive. This limited development into use of K tech outside of space travel significantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, K tech was starting to get so good that another problem started to emerge. The Kerbals were having a lot of problems generating the power necessary to power all of these K-drives. At this point, when slowing down relative to the background field, all that energy was simply dispersed as waste heat, and the ships ran out of fuel eventually. This energy requirement may be behind the Kerbals\u0027 construction of that giant solar power system.\u00A0This all stopped with the development of\u00A0\u0022closed loop\u0022 K-drive technology. Previous K-drives were \u0022open loop.\u0022 Closed loop K-drives could recapture energy from the field when slowing down instead of having it all go to waste. Initially the efficiencies were low, but over time it went up to some arbitrary very-close-to 100% value. If we go back to our \u0022wheel and road\u0022 metaphor, this can be thought of as regenerative braking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis solved the energy problem for the time being. All the Kerbals had to do was charge up K-material, and then it could essentially last forever in a spacecraft, needing only occasional recharging due to imperfect conversion or ship power requirements that were not directly related to propulsion. Spacecraft still had a \u0022max speed\u0022 where the batteries got empty, but this wasn\u0027t an issue, as with current battery levels that speed could approach the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, now kinetic energy could be transformed into usable energy very easily. This prompted the development of very large versions of K-tech, designed to capture energy from the kinetic energy of large asteroids and small moons (maybe planets as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, a problem started to emerge. Thrust is determined by the distance between two plates. If they got too close and too much energy was absorbed or discharged at once, the K-drive would simply burn itself out and become unusable. However, as K-drives were becoming more robust to withstand this energy output, and the plates got closer and closer together to extract energy on planetary scales, weird things started happening. It wasn\u0027t practical to contact the \u0022background field\u0022 on a large surface area, and was usually unnecessary, so it was done on a small surface area. Unfortunately, it was discovered that above a certain energy-per-second-per-area value, if the K-drive was strong enough, it would permanently rip the background field causing all sorts of side effects, and of course, leading to no thrust. However, this phenomenon is localized, and because the galaxy is moving, the tears fly away quickly and are easily trackable and avoidable. Increasing K-drive surface area on the background field side was never really solved, so extracting energy from planets couldn\u0027t be done quickly. This also limited the size and acceleration of K-drive ships, although with gradual tech development this limit was expanded and didn\u0027t really come into play much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this point K-drives were always made at least slightly weaker than the background field on purpose so they would always fail before the field failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the breakthrough that allowed FTL travel, Muon beds and/or Tachyon beds. The explanation for those is far up there, I don\u0027t have much more to say on that. Basically they ensure that you avoid the lightspeed asymptote and can keep accelerating like no speed limit exists. After some experiments (and of course something to avoid possible time dilation/travel), the first FTL flight is undertaken, and Kerbalkind begins branching out to nearby stars. The first K-drive ship Jebediah uses around Pol is one of these early FTL-ships (although it has likely been upgraded over time, why else would it have a cloning bay and that high acceleration).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there were two new problems that emerged in that early interstellar era.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If you want to get further than the nearest stars in any reasonable amount of time, you need a LOT of energy. To get to other stars\u00A0in a reasonable time you need to travel many times the speed of light, which requires many times the power of a fleet that can just go at twice the speed of light or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Kerbalkind could not produce enough energy to fuel more than a few ultra-high speed K-drive ships a year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 and 2 wouldn\u0027t be a big problem if the \u0022energized\u0022 K-material mentioned earlier didn\u0027t exist. However, most of Kerbalkind\u0027s supply had been used up by that point in domestic and scientific applications. No problem, just explore and find a bunch of the pre-energized stuff!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Energized K-material, and K-material in general, is extremely rare in the universe. The relatively high concentrations in the Kerbol system were just flukes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was a big problem, as now the total energy stored by the Kerbals (plus the extra generated each year) had to be split between a bunch of K-drive projects (and also running the planets). Making the ships as light as possible was also a priority, as that would reduce the energy required to go fast. It was a tradeoff between fleet tonnage and ship speed. Eventually, more energized K material was found outside the Kerbol system, but this was rare. Exploration begins to find more energized K material and extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometime into this exploration era, the field-thrust K-drive is invented. While they could not increase the area of contact on the \u0022background\u0022 side, they did find a way to increase the area uniformly on the \u0022real\u0022 side. They found out how to have the engines, instead of producing a tiny point-thrust, to produce a field thrust, a bubble of acceleration. Every atom in the bubble is evenly accelerated, which essentially (finally!) solves the vibration issue, also making inertial dampeners obsolete, usually only used as a backup system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalkind\u0027s biggest goal at this point was to find life outside the Kerbol system. The ISS Legacy II comes in here (the second K-drive ship in the story, the one that fell into Jool). Several life-seeking ships were built, taking up the majority of the energy allotment. After a long time searching, they eventually found Meros (the explosion of which I do need a better explanation for) but we all know what happened there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this time, a very experimental new technology emerges, \u0022Field Vector Thrust\u0022 K-drives. Instead of the thrust direction being fixed, like a non-gimballed rocket engine, the acceleration direction can be altered without turning a ship. It isn\u0027t usually amazingly useful, but can be in some scenarios. The number one priority is studying how it works to see if it can also be done on the \u0022background\u0022 side. This never happens, or at least not for a long time, though because of what happens next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, around this time, the Kerbals are found by the Galactic Union, and they are integrated. The Union are shocked that they didn\u0027t find them earlier on. Many species are found right after their first FTL trip.\u00A0The reason this happened is because K-drives don\u0027t emit highly visible signatures like most other forms of FTL do, hence why they are used to try to evade The Species.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, the Kerbals learn how to build more elegant, energy efficient FTL engines using different tech developed by The Union. Almost all development on K-drives stops immediately because they are far more expensive. However, the tech is studied by the Union because it is actually far more advanced than the Union\u0027s own K-drive technology, because it\u0027s only practical to develop on planets that have K-material accessible on, which are very rare. Existing K-ships, however, even old ones, benefit massively from Union tech because now, even more energy is accessible. Acceleration remains the same, but top speed increases because the amount of energy in the batteries was not limited by battery capacity but by the amount of available energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the rarity and expense of K-material,\u00A0 K-drive technology became obsolete (but many existing ships continued operating because most of the cost is up front and not in upkeep), and existing K-material is used occasionally as batteries due to its near infinite storage potential.

Four tiers of 25 seats each, separated by glass walls and force fields to keep the atmospheres separate, each with their own pressurized walkway. These four tiers rotated at various rates to simulate various levels of gravity, and were extravagantly decorated. There were seats of every shape and size, with people of every shape, size, and color. There were at least two liquid-borne species, four with wings, and one that appeared to be a traditional \u201CRock Monster.\u201D Only about half of the seats were full\u2026 Wait\u2026 No\u2026 Where was the Jslan representative?!?!?!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhew, fortunately, far away in the corner, was a Jslan.

Suddenly, however, there was a green and black flash of light (how do you even make black light?) as the representative from The Species teleported in, just beyond our field of view. I opened my mouth to gasp, but Evelina quickly covered my mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI see you have provided a chair,\u201D boomed the strange entity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was the least we could do,\u201D replied one representative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSuch a shameful waste of energy.

Anyway, we shall proceed\u2026 I shall present the surrender offer planet by planet, all conditions. All who refuse will fall, like the other dozens in your galaxy who already have.

This was for one representative!

However, due to our sudden and unexpected entry into a gravity field, we crashed through a vent and landed smack dab in the middle of four very surprised aliens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou!

The bridge had massive windows, which showed the swirling disc above and the gaping void of the black hole just barely below. There were a few main screens, most of which were playing a live feed of the council meeting. There were also a dozen or so stations, with thousands of switches, knobs, levers, and buttons.

Everyone gasped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept for \u201CLad.\u201D He just said \u201CHey, I used to have one of those. Olives. O-Lives. Humans have cool food. Nice shades of purple.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis, Representatives of the Galactic Union, is an exercise in futility. This is the only existing key to an Alchrosite Quantized Distortion Barrier. This technology is billions of years ahead of your best efforts. Even with the entire might of the entire Species, it will likely take us another 23.573 million years to find a way to break through the barrier without this key - Obviously not worth it for the resources of a single planet. Check for yourselves\u2026 This barrier currently surrounds Jslan. Destroy the key, and Jslan can live in peace until they inevitably run out of resources and perish.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon hearing this, and after confirmation from a communications device, the Jslan, in a rare fit of desperation, lunged towards the key, but was repelled back with a force so great, that they were thrust straight through a glass panel and force field separating the oxygen filled chamber from the ammonia filled seat of another representative. Both were in need of severe medical attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd for all of your stubbornness, you are too scared to help.\u201D The Species member manipulated the key. \u201CIt now surrounds Vya.\u201D The Mandaluvian Representative sprung out of his seat in a fit of rage, drew two hidden laser blasters and charged the key. He was struck down by a bolt of energy after only three harmless shots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDafagn, weapons are not allowed in the council chamber!\u201D shouted one representative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou all disobeyed too!\u201D Dafagn screamed in agony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow about Quiiiiznuvia?\u201D That world\u2019s representative detonated several bombs, causing many representatives to cower in fear, to similar effect. A few ran for the exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.

You have only succeeded in the slaughter of your own leaders,\u201D boomed The Species Representative. \u201CAnd now, for planet Aelfirn, you will slaughter more!\u201D Another alien, wielding odd swords, attacked the key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re right, this is silly.

That can\u2019t possibly be the most energy efficient way to use our planets\u2026 They are just stalling them, waiting for us to decapitate the galactic government and wipe out all resistance\u2026 We just waltzed right in here to the sight of a button that does exactly what we - no, they - want! Evelina, we need to get out of here! Away from the button! Now!\u201D We both took several steps back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we should probably put the cover back on the button first,\u201D Evelina said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSwords, how quaint,\u201D said The Species Entity. \u201CYou all cower in fear, refusing to help, say it is pointless, and without fault, when your planet is up, throw everything you have at it, killing your own in the process. So selfish. I will show you a universe without selfishness. Now, will the Representative of Ihm succumb to selfishness as well?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, Lad re-entered the room on his hover-chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDarned Garvi-brashters\u2026 Oh, I forgot, if you see Galactus, tell him this is from me.\u201D He tossed an envelope towards us\u2026 I reached out to catch it, but it missed horribly. I watched as it tumbled through the air past Evelina, who also failed to catch it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe both looked on in horror as time seemed to slow to a crawl. \u201CNOOOOOOO!\u201D We both shouted. The envelope spun, circled, and hesitated slightly, before diving down, straight for the button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt hit dead center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI grabbed Evelina\u2019s hand and squeezed my eyes shut, but nothing happened. A few seconds later, I opened my eyes. A short sentence had appeared on the main screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you sure? Press again to confirm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhew. Haha! That was close,\u201D I said as I chuckled in relief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother explosion went off as another Representative failed at saving his world. This shook the room, causing another part of the vent to fall. When it landed on the pile of debris, it catapulted a piece of rubble directly towards the button. I didn\u2019t have time to do anything else but shout again as it once again hit dead center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E sure?

As a way to prove the might of The Species, they put a shield around the Jslan solar system, one that, if they are telling the truth, even they can\u2019t break. In the center of the council chamber they put a key, and if someone could destroy it, their world could live in peace forever\u2026 The Jslan was injured in the attempt. The shield moved planets many times, and nobody was able to destroy the key.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDid you destroy it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.

The key has almost certainly been destroyed.\u201D I pretended to be shocked. In reality, I knew exactly as much as he did, if not more.

Nevertheless, we should be ready in case they do.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou mean we\u2019re stuck here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell\u2026 Yes.

Someone up there managed to save one planet\u2019s worth of people, which is more victory than we could have ever reasonably hoped for. We can stop fighting. We can stop stressing. We can stop keeping secrets. We can stop being mad. The invasion\u2026 None of that matters any more. I mean, we have to deal with being cut off from the galactic supply chain, and being confined to just the resources in the Kerbol system\u2026 But we are safe. And as long as the Representatives survive, maybe the rest of the plans will work out, and maybe they can be safe as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026 So you said no more keeping secrets, no more being mad\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.

In these ponderings, we have found truth and deception - deception of the self. For many hundred years we have lived in denial of the truth, praying to the Gods above and below that it not be true. For all the analysis of the scientists and discoveries of the explorers and the ponderings of the philosophers, they all point to one thing, and it doesn\u0027t take a genius to figure it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince the conclusion of the Great Interstellar War, ten more species have been discovered, nine of whom were discovered via signatures emitted when they undertook the first voyage in a spaceship utilizing a Fate Drive (formerly known as a Star Drive), one of whom was encountered by chance. \u00A0At this rate, eleven species (counting the two Founding species) have discovered FTL travel in six hundred and fifty Ziquunodian years. That is roughly one species every sixty Ziquunodian years, give or take due to the small sample size. Given that the universe has more or less looked the same for well over a billion years, it is highly improbable that the Founders were the first ones. So, where is everyone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy that logic, over a billion years, nearly seventeen million spacefaring civilizations should have come into existence, more than enough to make a Galactic Union a million times over. And yet in our explorations, we have found no union. In fact, the only time so far that two somewhat advanced FTL capable civilizations have met was at the onset of the Great Interstellar War.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only known possible explanations are that we are the first (unlikely) and the existence of a Second Great Filter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUntil recently, the answer was unknown, only speculated upon and denied. However, thanks to the efforts of the Explorers, we have now discovered no less than seventy two high-confidence worlds with more being discovered every year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Fate Drive is by far the lowest-tech form of FTL, but as everyone knows, it is also the most dangerous, as it is one of the few forms of FTL that project in reality, meaning any ship travelling sufficiently fast possesses the kinetic energy necessary to destroy a planet.. The Founders knew this almost from the start and made efforts to upgrade to a Class II FTL technology as soon as possible. However, this truth is much less universal than it was thought. None of the nine Fate capable successor species were aware of this fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd neither were the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nForty-three of the seventy-two high-confidence past-life candidate worlds have been determined to be destroyed in a Fate drive accident, with the others all falling to some First Great Filter cataclysm.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDiscarding Species discovered via signatures (telling us where to look), the ratio of dead species discovered to live species discovered is a shocking seventy-two to one, and the one was discovered by the sheer coincidence if it being located near a site of scientific importance. The real number could be, and very likely is, much worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBased on current estimations, somewhere between 100 and 1000 intelligent species are thought to inhabit the galaxy at any given time. Thus, under the best reasonable circumstances, with 5,000 intelligent species, and only 5 million dead worlds, there would still be at a minimum one thousand dead worlds for every live one. One thousand forgotten cultures, one thousand forgotten lifetimes, one thousand stories, all for just one to be remembered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut it gets worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOur current FTL signature scanning equipment cannot reach the next nearest galaxy just yet, but our long range FTL communications system would be theoretically capable of sending as well as detecting sufficiently energetic signals to and from the nearest 200 or so galaxies. This is an advanced technology that requires significant effort to develop and would not be available until well after Fate Drives have been phased out.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have, as of yet, received no response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you cloned the current Union, sent it back ten million years, and killed it, we would have long since discovered its corpse.

It is played on a \u201Cboard\u201D of spherical electromagnets and iron spheres. These can orbit each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you are probably asking, \u201CHow is that possible? Magnets have two poles, so orbiting is weird and maybe impossible!\u201D I thought that too, but apparently Kerbals found out how to make magnetic monopoles long before they even got to Duna, and we still haven\u2019t figured out how to. As for how they do such a complex solar system using only two polarities of magnets, it gets weird, and there are limitations, but computers and variable electromagnets deal with most of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the goal is to take over every planet, destroying your opponents in the process. This is done by launching ships (tiny metal spheres with lights on them) of various types (each planet has a launcher embedded in it which is computer controlled), which are built with resources which are gathered by buildings. And the resources/buildings are computer controlled, and are what the player can decide to build on each planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this is a combat game, made by the Kerbals. Don\u2019t ask me how that happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the strategy is obviously what to build and in what order to do stuff. The skill is how to launch the ships so they can gravity assist to the right places (although they do get a small amount of compressed air or magnetic interaction to be used for course corrections). But the thing that makes the game so awesome? The actual Whack-A-Kerbal functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s a button everyone has on their dashboards, the Whack-A-Kerbal button. You press this and exclaim \u201CWhack-A-Kerbal!\u201D right before you plan to do something epic. Based on how that actually ends up working, the other players can decide how epic that was and give you a temporary resource production multiplier - so while winning is great, it is advantageous to win in style. The button is called that, because, in the first ever game of Whack-A-Kerbal, one of the Kerbals accidentally got whacked in the head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tournament will be nine games long, as is tradition, with each taking place on a different board. The winner of each game will get eight points, second place seventh, etc. all the way down. And whoever has the most points at the end of the tournament wins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame 1 happened yesterday, on a very unique custom map we created. The game is set up in two separate hitchhiker modules, separated by the open hatch. On one hitchhiker module, the magnets are set up like in the Kerbol system, and in the other one, like the Solar system. The Kerbals started in the Kerbol half and the humans started in the Sol half. Within the systems, we chose our starting planets in a random order (in future rounds, the people in last place will choose first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the starting locations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill - Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob - Laythe\u003Cbr\u003E\nValentina - Duna\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah - Eeloo\u003Cbr\u003E\nJack - Earth\u003Cbr\u003E\nMarie - Europa\u003Cbr\u003E\nMe - Oberon (moon of Uranus)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlonya - Titan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my starting strategy was to very quickly get to a moon of Neptune, and maybe also to Pluto, get a ton of resources from all of those moons, and rush research, sacrificing defense in favor of a stronger late game. I was going to lie low and be non aggressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree\u2026 Two\u2026 One\u2026 Start!\u201D shouted Jebediah from the other room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk first off, I\u2019m going to say,\u201D said Jack, \u201CIf you so much as touch Phobos, you die.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s weird, nobody took Mars,\u201D I responded as I launched my first colony ship towards another Uranian moon, and my second colony ship on a long trajectory to Neptune (we each started with two). I used my starting resources to set up mines on Oberon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMars is cool and all, but rings are cooler,\u201D said Alonya, who had begun hopping around on the moons of Saturn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, no!\u201D shouted Marie. We looked up at the board towards Jupiter. Marie\u2019s colony ship had missed its target and was now on an elliptical orbit with a periapsis somewhere around Venus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent piloting, Marie! One small step for Man!\u201D said Jack as he landed on the Moon. \u201CI\u2019m going to Mars now, by the way, so don\u2019t you even - \u201C Marie\u2019s errant colony ship hit Mars. \u201C - try.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI totally meant to do that,\u201D said Marie. My factories were complete, so I began sending out colony ships to the local moons. My other colony ships had arrived. Several minutes passed, as the humans didn\u2019t want to make the first move. I took this opportunity to advance my research significantly. I now had the production capacity and know-how to construct Tier 7 combat ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhack-A-Kerbal!\u201D announced Jack suddenly as he launched a massive invasion fleet off of Kerbin, headed towards Mars. Due to the nature of the game, half of the ships missed, but the other half connected, and after a short resistance by Marie, Mars fell to Jack.

The last major unclaimed body was Mercury at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey! I see you!\u201D said Alonya.

Bob followed shortly after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCareful, we don\u2019t got no planets!\u201D Jack said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal has gone on a rampage!\u201D Bob reported. \u201CI don\u2019t got any planets!

Don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m going to take Pluto.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COi, Pluto\u2019s mine!\u201D I responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COooh, things be getting spicy!\u201D said Jack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFight!

The two bodies collided and were now considered inhospitable, although they still orbited. \u201CIf I can\u2019t have Pluto, nobody can!\u201D My fleet of warships was now in a highly elliptical orbit. Bob ended up landing on a moon of Saturn instead, and begun fighting Alonya.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COoooh, that\u2019s got to be, what, 1.5x?\u201D Marie asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust you wait,\u201D I said. \u201CIt\u2019s not over yet!\u201D Pluto\u2019s corpse fell into the solar system, passing by Jupiter, throwing a few of its moons out of Jupiter\u2019s sphere of influence. I had intended only for it to hit one of them, but Ganymede got ejected from the solar system entirely and actually flew through the hatch over to the Kerbol system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, that\u2019s worth at least four,\u201D Alonya said as Marie chased her moon through the hatch to see what would become of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYesss!\u201D The wayward moons kept causing havoc within the inner solar system, just as I had planned. I used my insane 4x production multiplier to launch a fleet of tier 8 warships, which I used to attack Earth and Mars, eliminating Jack from the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow am I the first out?\u201D He said. \u201CI took over Mars, and Bob has been hanging out for the past few minutes with like two ships left!\u201D Bob\u2019s two ships, out of fuel, immediately crashed into Neptune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, at least I\u2019m not last!\u201D joked Bob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGuysguysguys!\u201D said Marie as she came back into our half of the game, followed shortly by Ganymede, which she had managed to gravity slingshot back towards the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Alonya and I asked at the same time. We heard a shout from the other room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBill has been eliminated, and - Ethan, what happened to the solar system?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, those moons definitely wreaked havoc.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyway, I\u2019m in no fighting condition. Val and Jeb have allied, and are preparing a Solar invasion force!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlonya, alliance?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou bet, Ethan.\u201D We launched a defense fleet into solar orbit as Marie circled around on Ganymede, not being able to do much. She caught a gravity assist off of Uranus and entered the inner solar system. \u201CSIKE! WHACK-A-KERBAL!\u201D she shouted as she launched a huge invasion force from her one planet and took over the now undefended inner solar system - up to Mars - with no resistance. We agreed on a 2x for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, I didn\u2019t see that coming. You\u2019re going to pay for that!\u201D I shouted, moving my defense force to attack Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t lying, though!\u201D Marie said with a wicked grin. At that moment, Jeb and Val came through the hatch, grinning. I could see their invasion fleet following in short order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhack-A-Kerbal!\u201D I shouted, as I redirected another moon towards the hatch. This severely disrupted the fleet, at the narrow choke point, crashing many of the ships, but they just kept coming. \u201CHow do you have that many ships?!?!?!?!\u201D I asked, bewildered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI got the crashed alien ship on Laythe event!\u201D cackled Jeb as he attacked Uranus and Neptune. \u201CNOOOO!\u201D I shouted. They were going to win, but if I could outlast Marie and Alonya, I could come in third. I took the remainder of my fleet and attacked Mercury, as Marie and Alonya attacked Jeb and Val. Alonya died first, shortly followed by Marie, and then me. I came in third.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, not bad for the first game of the tournament,\u201D I said. \u201CMan, that event needs to be nerfed, it is so overpowered.\u201D Jeb and Val then had a huge epic final battle, involving the repositioning of several planets, but I can\u2019t do it justice, you are just going to have to watch the video! Val ended up winning, though. I\u2019m quite satisfied with my 6 points, however, and the Kerbals obviously have the advantage of having a ton of experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that was great\u2026 I think we are mostly back to business as usual up here. We\u2019ve mostly been able to stop moping around. A welcome change. It feels normal up here, again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n========== Ground Ethan\u2019s Private Journal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days ago, I saw my parents again!!! I could go on for pages and not do it justice, so I\u2019m going to give it time to sink in and talk about it in a future journal entry. But today\u2019s big thing - I went to school!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd - Oh boy, you won\u2019t believe it. Thank you, Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first few classes, I got so, so many \u201CYou look just like Ethan!\u201D comments, but it went mostly alright, and I didn\u2019t forget as much as I thought I had, except in Math, where I had forgotten pretty much everything\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my next classes was basic exogeology, which I was a bit confused as to why it was on the schedule, but hey, I could always change it later, right? First off, it turns out, Dimitri is in the class. I didn\u2019t even know he went to this school, and he shares a class with me! This must be why Jeb put me in here! I walk in, he excitedly waves, introduces me to some of his friends, it\u2019s going great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I sit down next to him, and then the teacher, Mr. Brockhart, walks in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood threvening, everyone,\u201D he said. Threvening? Did he mean evening? I\u2019d have to look that one up later. \u201CWelcome back to Intro To Exogeology. Today we will be continuing our discussions about Odnuforp Crater. But first, we actually have two new students today, so, Jonathan Stuart, everyone here already knows who you are\u2026 And the other one\u2026 Appears to be absent\u2026 Weird. Anyway, Jonathan, what do you know about Odnuforp Crater?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CChill out, it\u2019s his first day here,\u201D said Dimitri.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COdnuforp Crater, on Bop, is a crater filled with spherical rocks which were created after an asteroid impact, causing rock to melt and freeze in midair. It is notable for being the location of the Bop monolith, and therefore, the location of the landing on the Voyager mission.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is correct! You certainly know your stuff!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CBecause I was there,\u201D\u003C/em\u003E I wanted to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyway, we\u2019re going to talk more about impact dynamics today, and the asteroid itself - \u201C And at that point, the door opened again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry I\u2019m late,\u201D she said. I turned my head towards that familiar voice and broke into a grin. Dimitri\u2019s jaw dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo way,\u201D he whispered. I have a class with\u2026 With\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh yes, class, this is our second new student, Evelina Lindstr\u00F6m! Welcome to Intro To Exogeology! I think there\u2019s a free seat somewhere. Ah yes, there\u2019s one next to Jonathan! We hope you feel at home here!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh believe me, I will!\u201D she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n========== Space Ethan\u2019s Private Journal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe announcement is tomorrow and I don\u2019t know how to feel about that. The Kerbals wanted to wait a while before telling us, just to make sure the barrier wasn\u2019t a fake, and that it would indeed hold long term. They didn\u2019t have to wait a couple months, but, hey, I\u2019m not in charge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome people wanted to wait until after the landing of the Voyager, just to offer a nice sense of finality to this, but it doesn\u2019t look like we are going to be getting that. I think they want us to be a positive thing to look forwards to after what, frankly, will be a tremendous shock. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone will take \u201COkay so there are these evil aliens who are taking over the universe, but we somehow managed to win, and you\u2019re never going to see Earth again, and oh by the way we\u2019re going to turn aging on again\u201D well at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I really want to go back to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy life, especially Ground Ethan\u2019s life over these past few months, has been, quite frankly, amazing. It felt great to be, well, normal again. On Kerbin, everyone, and I mean pretty much everyone, is cool to be around. It\u2019s so peaceful. So beautiful. So fun. I\u2019ve hung out with tons of people, went to so many different things, and I have had a total blast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, yeah, maybe all of the kissing has biased me\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, like, my old life couldn\u2019t hold a candle to this, and I think many other people feel the same way. This is pretty much a utopia. Here, nobody has to worry about getting through the day, as the Kerbals have constructed a society which is almost, but not quite, post scarcity. Nobody goes hungry, nobody is thirsty, nobody gets sick, few hate, many love, borders are gone\u2026 Everyone is, for the most part, content, and even happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSending us back to Earth is probably the more disruptive option at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, yeah\u2026 Tomorrow, the world is going to change\u2026 Not sure if for the better, or the worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey figured out the de-cloning machine, but I have no intention of using it until I\u2019m safely back on Kerbin, as I would not give up my Kerbin life to be whole again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days ago, the Emerson rendezvoused with us. No good pictures, it kinda hung out behind the ship most of the time, but you can kinda see its solar panel sticking out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qDetS2T.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qDetS2T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I can see Kerbin again now.

Against the most powerful foe in the universe, a tiny portion of the galaxy survives and just abruptly goes back to normal? And, come on, this has to be part of their plan\u2026 I\u2019m beginning to think they want to keep us here. Maybe putting us here was the least energy intensive method to keep us from disrupting them? But that wouldn\u2019t make sense\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut why do I want more? I have so much, and the Humans and the Kerbals are living in safety and in peace and in harmony. I have it all, and yet I want more\u2026 Why? Am I really that selfish?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, it\u2019s just about the end of our Voyage\u2026 The end of our adventure\u2026 And we don\u2019t have the answers.

However, the sailors of the galaxy had only moments to behold the utter beauty and chaos as the station\u2019s systems failed one by one, and it drew ever closer to whatever laid at the center.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhat happened next, cannot be described in this language, or any for that matter, so an allegory - or, a parable, if you will, must suffice instead. This is not what happened, but nonetheless can be useful.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EImagine, for one second, you are the God of this universe. You spent eternities crafting the laws of physics, creating the structures of the universe in their spectacular and utter beauty, only for your creations to cleverly devise ways to exploit all that you have created. First bending matter, then light, then molecules, then atoms, and then, the fabric of spacetime itself, and beyond - far, far beyond. Having to keep up with them to prevent their exploits from getting out of hand is getting annoying. Remember that time they found a hole in quantum mechanics that you tried to BS your way out of by inventing the \u201CQuantum Spectrum\u201D which led them to finding out how to make four and a half different types of warp drive? A hastily thrown together solution will cause so much trouble in the long run. So when a massive space station filled with the latest and greatest universe breaking, physics shattering technological wizardry began hurtling towards the one place in the universe where the laws of reality cease to function, requiring tons of effort to find out how it might work without introducing any new exploits, and it has already been a long day and you just want to go back to designing flowers again, you might hesitate for a moment, although a long while for them, and end up just saying \u201Cscrew it\u201D and give it a boost back to where it game from, as you aren\u2019t paid enough to deal with stuff like that.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you find this, someday, and by some odds you aren\u2019t The Species, hello. I\u2019m Ethan Edwards, as you have probably gathered from the rest of this. It is highly unlikely that I will survive the next 24 hours, and it could happen at any moment. This could be my last journal entry. I\u2019ll take the journal with me but I will leave a copy here. If this cuts off in the middle, follow the Neutron Stars, assuming they haven\u2019t been moved or deleted. But this is what happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*BANG*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a dark flash of intense white and purple light, then a bright flash of black light, however in the worlds that works, and then - I literally can\u2019t describe it with words, the inside of a black hole. I mean, surely people have been in black holes and lived to tell the tale with all the technology they have these days. But I do not possess the words to describe the beauty and the horror.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd terrifying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple seconds later, after a lot of shaking, we just kinda popped back out of the black hole, right in orbit, with whatever I had turned off operational again. Then a solid two seconds passed in silence, with me and Evelina just staring at each other in shocked silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry, I must have sneezed,\u201D Lad said. Instantly hundreds, if not thousands of alarms began blaring at once. They popped up on the screen too fast for me to read them. The station shook, and one loud electronic voice began shouting \u201CEVACUATE! EVACUATE! STATION UNDER ATTACK!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut the front window I saw what could only be a Species battle fleet beginning to fire upon us. I glanced at the screen that showed the council chamber itself. The representative from The Species vanished, along with the Key to Kerbin. So it hadn\u2019t been destroyed\u2026 All this effort for nothing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station shook again. Evelina grabbed my hand and began pulling me towards the exit. I began running along with her, but then had a realization. I broke away and ran back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CETHAN! What are you doing, we have to go!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have to get the letter!\u201D I shouted, running back to the control panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust come!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe monolith showed me!\u201D Which was the truth. A weight I had finally been able to lift off my shoulders. The monolith\u2026 compels you to keep certain things a secret until it becomes relevant, even if you do not fully understand it\u2026 I have no secrets left now, such a relief. But whatever I saw in the black hole completed my understanding\u2026 And it was telling me I needed that letter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSparks erupted from the walls as the station took another heavy hit. There it was, on the floor. I reached over, and snagged it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, as I turned to run, a shot hit the massive windows at the front of the control room, shattering them, depressurizing the room and sucking me violently out into the cold void of space. I briefly looked back and saw Evelina clinging to a support. I looked at the station and saw a massive ship pull away from the docking array, shielding many smaller ships from the onslaught of projectiles from The Species\u2019 battlefleet. I looked down, and saw the supermassive black hole beneath me draw ever closer. I looked at the letter, and realized that the monolith, somehow, thought I should die, and that whatever was in Lad\u2019s letter to Galactus must remain secret forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COh well. That was fun,\u201D \u003C/em\u003EI thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then someone grabbed my arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked up, and there he was, Lad himself, that sleepy, frail old man, gripping my arm with the strength of a thousand tigers and lions. \u201CI\u2019ve got you!\u201D He shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut who\u2019s got you?!?!?\u201D I tried to shout, in vain, as, well, sound does not travel in a vacuum\u2026 But how did I hear him then??? Lad pulled me, flying through space, at an absolute velocity of faster than the speed of light, back through the shattered windows of the space station, grabbed Evelina, and then\u2026 somehow\u2026 phased both of us through the nearest door into a portion of the station that was still pressurized. I dropped to my knees gasping for air, holding my ears as the pain from going from 1 atmosphere to 0 and back again in less than 15 seconds was too much for me to bear at that moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho\u2026 Who are you?\u201D asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShush. Get my letter to Galactus,\u201D he said with a sly grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother alarm began blaring. \u201CSTATION INTEGRITY CRITICAL. LOSS OF SUSPENSION IMMINENT.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI believe that is my cue, stand back!\u201D he said, pulling out what appeared to be an Illasticonian crystal, but glowing orange, and with many other small gadgets attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, wait - \u201C Evelina said, but it was too late. Lad crushed the crystal and instantly disappeared, accompanied by more of those strange beams of black light. The energy pushed us both back against the nearest wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell then. No time, let\u2019s go!\u201D shouted Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere!\u201D I managed through the pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnywhere but here.\u201D She helped me up, clutching her own ears in the process. We began running through the corridors, as many other aliens did the same. We blindly followed them, and eventually burst through double doors that led into the Council Chamber itself. It was mostly vacated, but was burning. The bodies of several dead representatives lay strewn around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy eye caught Jebediah Kerman on the stage. His eye caught mine. He was lying down, bleeding, near where the Key to Kerbin used to be. I ran over to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo time!\u201D Evelina said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe has a ship.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEthan\u2026 Of course.\u201D Jeb managed. Apparently our disguises had stopped working in the chaos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome on, Jeb, we\u2019ve gotta get out of here!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course it\u2019s you, who would appear to me at my death\u2026 It\u2019s usually Val, or Xanth, or The Last Merosian\u2026 I tried, Ethan, I tried\u2026 I used every single last crystal\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSnap out of it, Jeb! You\u2019re not going to die, and I\u2019m really here!\u201D Jeb sat up, with an annoyed look on his face, purely out of bewilderment and spite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI said not to run off, and you did so much more than run.\u201D Another huge explosion rocked the station. \u201CI\u2019ll be mad at you later. Pick me up, get me to that door right there.\u201D We both grabbed an arm and walked him out of the burning room. I noticed Representative Kareen of the Jslans, slumped over in the corner. I quickly ran over and tucked her (well they have like four genders or something so that may be the wrong word, sorry to assume) under my other arm. She looked up at me and said nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe exited the council chamber. Jeb directed us to a pod. The moment we were seated, along with several others, it accelerated to a blistering speed. Jeb programmed a destination, and we were there in under 30 seconds. The doors to the pod opened, and we ran out into a massive, multi kilometer long docking array, with ships departing left and right as more and more of the station\u2019s systems failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout time, Jeb!\u201D shouted an eight foot tall, yellow, small headed humanoid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CXanth, I told you to leave without me!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COptional, I have clones.\u201D He spotted Evelina and I. \u201CThis is ponderous. Please, allow me.\u201D He scooped up me, Jeb, Evelina, and Kareen and put them under one, very strong arm and began sprinting down the hallway. \u201CA pleasure to meet you, Ethan Edwards, I have heard much about your exquisite exploits.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you always talk like - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA robot? It is simply my fear response. I am quite like the Kerbals conversationally under normal circumstances.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry, that was probably offensive.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNone taken.\u201D Another alarm blared, as the station began to roll to one side. A shot hit one of the ships that were parked directly in front of us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh. That was our ship,\u201D said Xanth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNever fear, Galactus is here!\u201D said Galactus as he raced down the hallway in what looked like a large go-kart with a race car engine. He stopped by us, we got inside, and he put the pedal to the metal and took us down another few berths until we arrived at his TNT ship. \u201CYou all have space suits right?\u201D But it was too late, for another shot had broken the ship away before we could enter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNO!\u201D shouted Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy nachos!\u201D shouted Galactus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease, get on!\u201D shouted someone from the ship next door. Xanth scooped up Galactus under his other arm, along with another alien he came across along the way, and dove into the small transport ship, which undocked and fired up its engines before the doors had even had time to seal properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe small ship darted away from the Galactic Council Chamber with a roar. I looked behind us, out the rear window, as the station, under heavy fire from at least a dozen Species ships, broke into two, then three, and then more, and then slipped chunk by chunk into the black hole. Suddenly the ship\u2019s engines whined, and the ship began to creak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo!\u201D shouted the ship\u2019s pilot, a short, red alien with six arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe docking guider beam focusers are destroyed!\u201D reported the copilot. \u201CWe\u2019re gonna fall in unless we get the FTL online NOW!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt isn\u2019t charged yet!\u201D shouted the engineer. \u201CI told you we should have replaced the triquantum bearings!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe could do a Fate jump,\u201D suggested the pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo it,\u201D said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRepresentative Jebediah\u2026 But that\u2019s illegal!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is an order.\u201D Several buttons were pressed, many levers were pulled, and I tried to find something to hold onto. I spotted one Species ship to our right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGuys, The Species is firing on us!\u201D I shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEmergency FTL in Five\u2026 Four\u2026\u201D a shot connected, but it was a glancing blow. \u201CNOW!\u201D The pilot slammed three of his fists down on a red button and the small ship jumped to beyond light speed. Stars flashed by, but only for a few seconds, before it stopped. We were now decently far away, but I could still see the accretion disc of the black hole through the rear window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb, you could have killed a planet!\u201D shouted Kareen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, Kareen, you don\u2019t understand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh I understand perfectly fine!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKareen, talk to your clones.\u201D She stopped for a second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...Oh.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CXanth, Evelina, and Ethan, you too.\u201D Xanth froze. Evelina looked puzzled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CHey ground Ethan? Space Ethan?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E I asked. I received no response. \u003Cem\u003E\u201CHello? HELLO?

No response. \u201CCalling Dagnard\u2026 Calling Jslan\u2026 Calling Erdwa\u2026 Calling Kerbin\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy God,\u201D said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is the Union Transport Ship TRS Logius, transmitting on all channels. If you are there, and are able, please respond.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, we picked up several responses, but only from the other ships who had just escaped the Galactic Council Chamber and were in a similar predicament.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2026 What happened?\u201D asked Galactus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing good,\u201D grunted Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we have at least five to ten minutes until the legal FTL is ready,\u201D announced the pilot. \u201CWe might be safe for now unless The Species decide to smite us\u2026 So we can catch our breath and try to figure things out. First off, you guys aren\u2019t looking too good\u2026 Tsian?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve told you multiple times, I am not a medical doctor, I have a doctorate in quantum material sciences from the Vya Scientific Instructoratorium. I faint at the slightest paper cut and have not so much as touched a stethoscope.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re one of the leading theorists on Illasticonian crystals, or whatever, you should be able to figure out how to put a bandage on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEthan\u2026\u201D said Jeb. I turned to face him. \u201CWhat were you two doing there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell\u2026 That night we said we were kissing\u2026 We actually went to the orbital ring, got cloned, and stole a spaceship. We know all about Meros, in fact\u2026 Hey, hold on a second, where did it go?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHere,\u201D said Evelina, as she held up the diary of The Last Merosian. \u201CI knew you\u2019d misplace it, so I took it myself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight. Jeb, you can have this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou were there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt the same time as you, and by the way, the whole Meros thing was not - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s not get into that right now, I\u2019m already emotionally exhausted enough.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo\u2026 Ok. And then we crash landed on Jslan, met Kareen here, and then they fixed us up, and we tried to get to the council meeting with the idea to do something unexpected, to mess up their plans, as that seemed fairly climactic, and Galactus helped us in\u2026 We made our way to the control room, and, well, uh\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEthan, you\u2026 You maniac. You didn\u2019t!\u201D said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was him, not me,\u201D said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re not going to like this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou tried to drop the station into the black hole, didn\u2019t you?\u201D I took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D I braced myself for the inevitable onslaught from the four Galactic Representatives I had just attempted to kill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t think of that,\u201D Kareen said. \u201CAnd I probably would have done the same. I near about killed myself trying to save Jslan\u2026 And now it\u2019s gone. All hope.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI threw every Illasticonian crystal I had at that key\u2026\u201D recalled Jeb. \u201CAnd when that failed I threw myself at it. And to no avail.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWow, that key must really have some error protection, then,\u201D mused Tsian, the scientist. \u201CWithstanding that many crystals\u2026 Even from afar\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo you did try to destroy the station\u2026 But it didn\u2019t work\u2026 Although you did get The Species to attack, somehow,\u201D said Jeb. \u201CSo how many guards did you have to kill to get to the control panel?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, actually, we fell through the ceiling and then the guy in charge said \u201CGet back to work!\u201D and pointed us towards a panel,\u201D responded Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat? No way Resik\u2019nan would do that!\u201D said Xanth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho is Resik\u2019nan?\u201D Evelina asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe guy who was in charge!\u201D Jeb said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook, I never saw any Resik\u2019nan. In the big seat in the middle of the room, there was this old frail guy named Lad up there, he was in charge,\u201D I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere are no chief controllers matching that description,\u201D reported Xanth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, so this is going to sound crazy, but when that room got blown up, I got sucked out into space, he literally \u003Cem\u003Eflew\u003C/em\u003E up to me, grabbed me, and dragged Evelina and I straight through a wall, like, we phased right through it, and then he popped an orange Illasticonian crystal and vanished!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk, so it had to be a lot of people you killed for you to make up something that ridiculous,\u201D said the pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m not joking!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can\u2019t just fly around a black hole like Superman!\u201D said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs the resident expert on Illasticonian Crystals, I can confirm that they do not come in orange,\u201D said Tsian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo without proof, we can conclude you are lying, you are a human after all,\u201D said the pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey!\u201D snapped Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have proof, though\u2026 I think.\u201D Everyone looked at me as I pulled out the letter, now slightly burnt. \u201CHe gave me this. It is for Galactus.\u201D I looked at Galactus, and his eyes widened. He gently took the envelope from my outstretched hand and carefully opened it up. A dull black rock fell out as Galactus pulled out several sheets of a paper-like substance. We all watched with bated breath. He read it and then looked at me with shock and awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou met the \u003Cem\u003EGreat Wizard Ladstini?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was him?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDear Galactus The Cow, you may find these useful. Sincerely, The Great Wizard Ladstini.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe rest is gibberish! I have been trying to contact him for centuries, if not millennia, and he apparently only thought I was deserving of two sentences, a small rock, and eight pages of gibberish!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho is he again?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA scientist turned wizard. He is said to have created the giant mushroom on planet Mycelium, among other epic feats, and has conducted extensive research on the Magic Boulder, which is, of course, why I have been trying to find him! With how far ahead he is of everyone else, and at the rate he was progressing, he\u2019s doubtless practically a demigod by now!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, likely story, Galactus,\u201D snorted the ship\u2019s engineer. \u201CWe\u2019ve all read your little comic books with all your fantastical stories.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COi! I know what I saw!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGuys, chill,\u201D Evelina said. \u201CGalactus, can we see the gibberish?\u201D The letter was passed around, and nobody could make heads or tails of it, that was, until, we put it in front of Tsian. His eyes widened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTsian? Are you okay?\u201D asked the pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy Crail,\u201D Tsian whispered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne of the holy grails of my field\u2026 The Anticonian Transposition Equation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe what now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was merely theoretical, but I see\u2026 And it is so\u2026 so\u2026 beautiful.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, but what does it do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo if we detonate an Illasticonian crystal, it teleports a local amount of matter to a random location, with the particles spread out at a random distribution around that random location, depending on the quality of the crystal itself\u2026 But we\u2019ve long suspected the existence of so-called Anticonian crystals, that can essentially reverse the process, teleporting some amount of matter with a particular distribution from a random point to a set point.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, a recall device?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely. And it has long been suspected that the way in which the crystal is detonated determines that location. The equations for normal Illasticonian crystals are far too difficult to derive in a reasonable amount of time, but those for theoretical Anticonian crystals are thought to be much simpler.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn theory?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, now? In reality. With this equation I can calculate exactly how to detonate an Anticonian crystal to target any point in space for retrieval based on the size of the crystal\u2026 But the quality component appears to be missing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, assuming you had an Anticonian crystal, you could manipulate it in a way as to teleport an object from any point in space to the location of the crystal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely! While this is groundbreaking, it is also completely useless without an Anticonian crystal! And the only problem is, as everyone knows, Anticonian crystals do not exist!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, it is not useless!\u201D declared Galactus The Cow. \u201CDon\u2019t you see? This is irrefutable evidence that I\u2019m not crazy!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt could be a trick by The Species,\u201D said Xanth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrue,\u201D said Jeb, \u201CBut it is worth looking into.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait a second\u2026\u201D I knelt down and picked up the dull black rock that had fallen out of the envelope. I gently held it between my right index finger and thumb, holding it up to one of the lights on the ship. It was about two inches long and had a slight shimmer to it. \u201CDoctor Tsian\u2026 Say that, hypothetically, Anticonian Crystals did exist. What would they look like?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNonsense, Ethan, that is much to large to be one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHumor me. How could you tell if it was one?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019d need a diquantum scanner at minimum.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHere,\u201D said Xanth, handing over his triquantum scanner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou are getting worked up over nothing!\u201D said Tsian. \u201CIt\u2019s a rock! Illasticonian crystals of all sorts are scarcely bigger than the tip of a pen!\u201D Nonetheless he scanned it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...It appears I have much to learn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, that\u2026 That\u2019s an Anticonian crystal?\u201D asked Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot only that\u2026 Its structure appears to be perfect. I cannot find a single imperfection anywhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd that equation without the quality component\u2026 Will it work on crystals of perfect quality?\u201D Xanth inquired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have only just laid eyes on this equation, but\u2026 I have no reason to doubt that. Excuse me, I must lie down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, one more thing,\u201D said Galactus. \u201CThere\u2019s a back side.\u201D Tsian turned the last page over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are those?\u201D asked the copilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpacetime Coordinates.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt could be the directions to his research on the Magic Boulder!\u201D shouted Galactus. \u201CI\u2019ve been trying to find it forever! With all of the information he has collected, I may be able to see planet Pock once more!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere exactly do the coordinates point?\u201D asked Kareen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo a location approximately half of an observable universe away, about that way, in about four hours and fifty seven minutes.\u201D Tsian pointed in a random direction towards one side of the spaceship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell I think it is simple!\u201D Galactus proclaimed. \u201CYou, Tsian, run the equations for that crystal at that point in spacetime. In five hours, we recover whatever, or whoever is on the other end.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHold on, we only just found this. It could be a trap,\u201D cautioned Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, hold on,\u201D Tsian said. \u201CEthan\u2026 You said that Ladstini had an \u003Cem\u003Eorange\u003C/em\u003E Illasticonian crystal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe sure did!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo there\u2019s a third type! Nobody, not even the craziest of the crazy, has even theorized that there could be a \u003Cem\u003Ethird\u003C/em\u003E type of Illasticonian crystal! Don\u2019t you see how groundbreaking this is?!?!? If only the laboratories on Zeitri had not been destroyed, this could usher in the seventeenth great scientific era! But... Who am I? What am I, but useless!\u201D he cried. \u0022All my life\u0027s work... And it was all ignorantly incorrect! Oh, how very blind I was, but now, for the first time in my life, I can see!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not now, Tsian!\u0022 urged the copilot. \u0022Not in front of three representatives!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, guys\u2026 Good news, bad news,\u201D reported the engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D asked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich one do you want first?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe good news.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnother ship that escaped the council chamber and is equipped with a diquantum telescope has reported that Kerbin is indeed surrounded by that shield thingy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes!\u201D shouted Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut\u2026 We didn\u2019t destroy the key!\u201D I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe didn\u2019t?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey teleported away with it!
