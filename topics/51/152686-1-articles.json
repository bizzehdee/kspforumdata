The feeling in the air of the \u003Ci\u003EZephyr Kerman\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0was always a little tense on a landing day with the rookies alway suprised by the lack of constant work to do and the veterans looking as if this was just another day on the job. But today was different for the veterans. Jeb took a quick look around and found the same expression on both Bill and Bobs faces. A grimace with just a hint of a smile, no doubt caused by the fact that they were completing the kerbaled exploration of the solar system today. But when he got to Val, he found that she was already looking at him. They both smiled, and Jeb felt the little square container in his pocket press against his leg. He remembered being caught by Gene when he shoved it in his duffel bag on launch day. That sure had been a interesting conversation. His thoughts were disturbed when the centrifuge spun around to face Eeloo, the rock that would launch Jeb the other\u00A0orange suits into kerbal history as the first kerbals to set foot on every celestial body in the system. Joining\u00A0them where rookies Mayzee and Anzer kerman. The message came from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, they were go to start pre-landing procedures. The rookies were exited by this and leaped to the lander, only to find the assigned checklists containing \u0022make sure all of this importand stuff is on\u0022 The rest of the crew headed to the lander except for Bob, who headed back to the lab to transmit the last points of science. Suddenly, The kerbs at the lander heard Bob scream in terror. \u0022OH KRAP OH CRAP OH KRAP OH KRAP!\u0022 The entire crew rushed to the lab to see what was wrong. Bob was frozen, his eyes fixed on\u00A0the window in front of him. He was staring at Eeloo, and at first Jeb coudent make out what was so scary. but then he started to make out edges. Edges of gaint chunks of ice, and no doubt a shotgun blast of tiny ones, the results of a cryovolcanic event that would change Eeloo\u0027s surface forever. Headed strait for them. \u0022EVA SUITS!

Jeb was done first, and started to make his way towards the bridge. If there was any hope of the crew surviving, Jeb needed to get the \u003Cem\u003EZephyrs\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Egiant LV-N \u00A0transfer stage facing into the onslaught. he put the gimbal coordinates into the computer and started firing the engines. they had to reduce the relative speed as much as possible. The ejecta was on them in seconds. The engines were the first to go, and the hypervelocity hail started eating its way into the Mk3 tanks at the rear. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was doing all it could to hold orientation, but the monoprop tanks were already heavily perforated and were loosing fuel fast. jeb\u00A0had sealed all the internal doors, and from the bridge spotted the rookies Anzer and Mayzee finally making their\u00A0way back from the airlock. It was at this moment the the airlock lost pressure. jeb looked on in horror as Anzers faceplate was hit from the side, removing almost all the glass from his helmet.\u00A0the venting air put him\u00A0in a violently fast backflip\u00A0and the entire\u00A0crew heard Mayzee screaming over the common band. Mayzee was trying take cover behind some life support equipment in \u00A0the corridor, but this was soon penetrated and Mayzee kerman was hit multiple times in the body, and the penetration of her pack fuel pushed her past\u00A0Anzers dead body and out a broken window into space. When her suit turned around, all Jeb saw was a red splattering on the inside of her faceplate. Jeb wrenched his eyes of his fallen comrade, and looked around at his ship. He did not like what he saw. He watched a section of the centrifuge separate from the rest of the ship and float away. he listened in on the comms, and heard both Bill and Bob yelling back and forth, but no Val. Jeb panicked for a second, but then switched to the band 657, the secret channel that only he and Val knew about, and sure enough Val was already there, breathing heavily. \u0022Val? are you alright?\u0022 jeb asked into his mic. \u0022Jeb!\u0022 Val cried. \u0022i\u0027m in the lander. I can see the entire ship from here and Jeb, its really bad. The entire transfer stage has almost been completely slagged, Jeb. The hail is gonna get to the reactor soon. You need to get Bill and Bob out of the lab before it goes!\u0022 Jeb relayed this information to Bill and Bob, and then brought up the module map of the ship. He dispatched the same orders to the prospector rovers, the manned rover, and the survey sat. He armed the docking magnets and preformed a final power down of the ships bridge. \u0022its been a pleasure, sir.\u0022 Lenny, the ships AI said as Jeb signed off. He met Bill and Bob in the main corridor. \u0022I have a plan. We all need to get to the lander.\u0022 Jeb switched to 657. \u0022Val, can you confirm the undocking of all probes?\u0022 \u00A0 \u0022Uhh, yes. But what are you doin-ohhhh.im\u00A0arming th-\u0022 \u0022I already did. just wait for us and lets get out of here before the reactor is hit.\u0022 The trio was almost to the lander when a stray hail cloud slammed into the tunnel. Jeb saw blood splattered on the wall. Between the pressure from the hail hitting the rear and the now weakend tunnel the hallway broke into two and\u00A0the lander started to drift away slowly from the rest of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The solid fuel chemist","CreatedById":158384,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-05T14:09:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nummmm....you guys are welcome to reply and give first impressions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The solid fuel chemist","CreatedById":158384,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-08T04:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColdness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was all there was, just coldness.

What had happened? Why hadn\u0027t Jeb made it to the lander with the rest of-...His crewmates! Oh what had happened to them?! Jeb felt the little square box in his pocket\u00A0and his heart painged in his chest. Forever trapped in his jumpsuit pocket, inaccessible through the material of his suit. Destined to haunt him forever of the life he could have had. Jeb got up. Somehow, miraculously, He had landed safely on the surface of Eeloo. He noticed a new email sent to his suit. Upon opening it, he found a video file of Gene. He was in mission control, and was looking very somber. \u0022This is a message to any survivors of the Z\u003Cem\u003Eephyr Kerman.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EWe have been looking for you guys for over a year now and Well, as horrible as this sounds, We cant afford to look anymore. The public all thinks your all dead, and there pressuring us to move on. Mortimer is already mad and if i continue to spend any more on rescue efforts he can take emergency control of the program. But the guys in RnD came up with a last-ditch plan to save you if your suits take you out of medical hibernation.. first they developed the tech to provide this one way communication with any EVA suits in the general area that we point the dish at that we are using to talk with you right now, then sent a K-OS program that would land you on the surface. This message should get to you a few seconds after the program kicks in. Were hoping that when the program throws you into the snow, the temperature will put you in cryosleep so we can come back to look when we have more funds. I\u0027m really sorry, guys. I wish we could have done more. I wish I\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ecould have done more... Gene put his head in his hands. We were so close. Kerballed landings on every celestial body without a single loss of life. I guessed we just pushed the frontier too hard. If you wake up.... Well then I guess we failed. The video suddenly cut out. Jeb tried to process what he just saw. It was too much.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECryosleep?\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EBut how long was he-Oh no. Oh no. Jeb had just glanced at the mission clock in the upper left corner of his helmet and he didn\u0027t dare look back up there. but his eyes betrayed him.

It then proceeded to revolutionize space travel, explained in detail the optimal way to terraform every terraformable body. Duna was officially recognized as a individual political state only a few years after. Eve soon will be too, although for now it remains a mess of kerbin affiliated colonies. Dres\u00A0is a glorified shipyard, its business is creating terrarium. And anywhere else isn\u0027t really worth mentioning, but you can take a guess. A few cities, a grand plan, and some people willing to do anything to achieve it. Eeloo is one of those places, just without the plan. we have the means to grow the economy, our ice is in very high demand. We just need to find a way to stop people from stealing it. War in\u00A0space is a very finicky thing, at least on the surface anyway. It becomes a\u00A0more possible in orbit where you can have navies, essentially. But the smaller you go, the more brutal it gets. on kerbin you can eject if your going down. in space, the highly explosive fuel that your ship runs on will do that for you. for infantry, a flesh wound becomes a death blow. And tanks... Best not to talk about those.
