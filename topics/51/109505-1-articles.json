Today at the opening ceremony for Nessa, the new space agency, Jebidiah Kerman personally pledged that we\u0027d see a Kerbal, likely himself, in orbit by the end of the month. Posing in the picture are the pilots, engineers, and scientists behind this bold new inititive \u0022Project Mercury.\u0022 Jebidiah (27) and his brothers Bob and Bill (35 and 32 respectfully) have been pushing for this program for some time now and will be in charge of overseeing Mercury at every step.\n\nBefore winning this prestigious contract, Jebidiah was a test pilot for Rocketdyne where he was known for frequently pushing test planes well beyond the red line. Rocketdyne formally terminated Jebidiah\u0027s employment after he set a new world altitude record by trying to climb out of the atmosphere in a supersonic test plane. The plane was ripped apart, but rescue teams found young Jeb sitting sitting in the highlands amidst burning degrees and smiling much as he is in the picture above. Flying back-up on Project Mercury will be young Valentina, 24, who said earlier that she \u0022has high hopes of beating Jeb to space since he\u0027s liable to put himself in the hospital long before the real work get\u0027s started.\u0022\n\nLeading the engineering team for Mercury is Bill Kerman (35). Bill has been hard at work developing the engines and reaction wheels that will be necessary tools in getting kerbals to orbit. Working hand in hand with his younger brother Bob they have developed the Mercury Capsule - an airtight control pod theoretically capable of surviving the inferno of re-entry and splashing down gently into the ocean. Tomorrow they will be testing \u0022Little Joe\u0022 - an unmanned atmospheric rocket containing a boiler-plate of the Mercury capsule.\n\n---\n\nBill: Alright gents, you can leave her here there.\n\nBob: Wait! Before you run off get up here and help me link up these fuel lines. We want to be ready to fuel Joe here up before the big show.\n\nThe ground crew looked up at Bob as he balanced on the back of what was, basically, a giant bomb that would fly only because it would - in theory - only explode in one direction at a time. They shrugged.\n\nBill: Its okay, you guys run off, I\u0027ll get it.\n\n![reI9iWHl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/reI9iWHl.jpg)\n\nBob: You did a good job on the lines here, she\u0027s a beauty.\n\nBill: No where near enough Delta V to make it to orbit.\n\nBob: Oh come on, don\u0027t be so sour about it. I mean, she\u0027s like the ones we used to draw on the walls while we stared up at the stars.\n\nBill: Yeah... Boy did we ever get the principles of aerodynamics wrong. Remember the one with the dinner plate in the front and the skinny neck under it?\n\nBob: Give me time and I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll make something like that work one day, with the lasers and everything.\n\nBill: I\u0027d rather make sure we get to space ourselves. ... did you remember your earplugs?\n\nBob: Earplugs? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Why do I need - \n\n![fi4FJwkl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fi4FJwkl.jpg)\n![hDhPM4cl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hDhPM4cl.jpg)\n\nJeb: Hey.... ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\n Wait a second!

Nessa celebrated its first suborbital flight and subsequent recovery today with each proud member of the team trying to get half as much recognition as the now infamous Jebidiah Kerman - First Kerbal in Space! Jeb proudly announced that there would be a line of merchandise made available to commemorate his historic achievements. When asked about whether this new line of merchandise would include detailed models of Mercury herself Bob Kerman only responded that it would be a welcome revenue stream but that he needed to discuss things with his brother in private first. \n\nDespite the celebrations Bob and Bill Kerman seemed is less the high spirits. Nessa Test pilots Mary and Val were willing to comment that they believed the brother\u0027s disgruntled appearance was due to under performance of the Redstone lifter when compared to their initial estimates, but sources closer to the brothers have indicated that it might be trouble in paradise. \u0022Even getting Jeb into orbit wouldn\u0027t leave enough space between his ego and his brothers for things to cool down tonight,\u0022 A Nessa scientist said, off the record, \u0022It was suppose to be their night to be on top of the world, but Jeb\u0027s never been able to turn down a camera.\u0022 Now with the Mercury Orbit tests coming up, this reporter is left wondering whether cooler heads will prevail over physics, or will egos turn this ambitious endeavor into disaster?\n\n--\n\nBob: Guidance is go. Recovery, standing by. LES is green.\n\nBill: Copy that. Retro?\n\nVal: Go flight.\n\nJeb: Go?\n\nBob, Bill, and Vall: No!\n\nVal: Why\u0027d you let him back in that thing?\n\nBob: He slept in it.\n\nVal: What, really?\n\nBob: Yeah. I went to check it this morning and he was strapped in and making vrrrrrm noises while playing with the stick.\n\nVal: Awake?\n\nBob: Nope. He was sleep piloting.\n\nBill: Focus.\n\nJeb: Go?\n\nBill: T Minus 15.\n\nJeb: Go?\n\nBob: All indicators are go.

Can you make it possible for me to do that?\n\nBob: I guess so. Bill?\n\nBill: Not with the Mercury can, we\u0027ll need a bigger system to carry, preasurized gasses...\n\nVal: Well especially if I\u0027m going to walk on Mun.\n\nJeb: Oh! Oh! Me first! Me First!\n\nBob: Atlas isn\u0027t anywhere big enough for something like that.\n\nBill: If we could get two ships to meet up in orbit, you could move stuff from on to the other... even combine them together.\n\nBob: I\u0027ll start doing the math.\n\nVal: That will be *MY* program.

I want you to add 10 more m/s to the burn which will put you about 9 kilometers off Gemini 1 after a full orbit. Then is the tricky part.\n\nBob: She won\u0027t have enough fuel to close that gap herself and dock.\n\nJeb: She won\u0027t.

The Lads, and Lasses, at Nessa have done it again folks. Above are Bob Kerman (35) and Valentina Kova (23) Posing with their still sizzling Gemini Capsule only a few hours after touch-down. Gemini was aiming for a water landing but, according to sources at Mission control, \u0022Young Miss Kova was a little over energetic with the retro-rockets.\u0022 Both Gemini capsules touched down at a thrilling 8.9 meters per second after several orbits around Kerbin including many world firsts. Valentina Kova has become the first woman in Space, the first kerbal to ever go on an extra-vehicular activity while in space, and the first pilot to perform a docking maneuver in space. \n\nBob Kerman, lead scientist for the Agency, was personally in charge of the EVA suits the astronauts wore during their mission and for the special magnetic docking collars used by this ships. Both of these Heroes of space exploration are pictured here next to the Gemini 2 capsule though only Bob spent the entire trip in Gemini 2. His initial pilot was Mary Ride, who swapped vehicles with Valentina while their ships were docked. Also involved in the Gemini project was Astha Currie, head of the Agencies medical department who was aboard Gemini 1 to monitor Valentina\u0027s vitals during her landmark EVA.\n\nIts should be hard to imagine how these wonder-kids will top this program. Instead Jebidiah has already started giving interviews about the project\u0027s newest program. \u0022I\u0027m sure I speak for everyone in the agency when I say: You ain\u0027t seen nothing yet! We\u0027ll put a Kerbal on Mun by the end of the decade! We choose to do this thing at this time, not because it is easy... but because it is Awesome!\u0022 Standing next to Jebidiah was Bill Kerman, chief engineer of projects Mercury and Gemini whose only comment was, \u0022We\u0027re going to need a lot more people, and money. Lots of money.\u0022 The new project, called Apollo, will begin with the development of a new line of rockets- The Saturn rockets will first propel scanning satellites to Mun and then, later on, kerbals.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T14:27:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by loch.ness**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:43:19Z","Content":"I loved that Star Trek reference on the Joe launch.

While officially the space agency \u0022Nessa\u0022 still has its doors open, most financial analysists believe that inside the tune is very different:\n\nO Budget! My Budget! our hopeful trip Begun;\n\nThe ship won\u0027t e\u0027en get a rack, before the audit has begun;\n\nThe Engine bells I hear already are exploding,\n\nWhile follow eyes the steady pod, the pilot grim and daring:\n\nBut O Abort! Abort! Abort!\n\nO the bleeding lines of red,\n\nWhere on the floor my Budget lies,\n\nFallen cold and dead.\n\nCurrently no one at Nessa will comment on the soaring costs of their new Apollo program, or on how they are raising the money. Earlier today a new Solid-Fuel Rocket, the Little Joe II, was launched to test the Launch Escape System of the Apollo program. The test went smoothly according to mission control and a Apollo Command Capsule Boilerplate is being prepared for a full test later on. Despite early successes with Mercury and Gemini, there is growing apprehension about the space agency\u0027s race towards ever greater accomplishments. Many are wondering if a major disaster isn\u0027t just around the corner.\n\nVal: Bill, do we have Budget issues?\n\nBill: What? Where did you hear that?\n\nVal: I read it in the paper.\n\nBill: That hack Kitman again?\n\nVal: Yeah.\n\nBill: Figures. Did you know we were his first story?\n\nVal: Really?\n\nBill: Yeah. Kid won the Pulitzer for his coverage of Mercury and another one for his coverage of Gemini. Then the critics came down on him for not being objective enough.\n\nVal: He started writing poetry in this own.\n\nBill: Really? Let me see. ... Ha! Not bad actually. Maybe we should try to hire him for PR?\n\nVal: Poach him from the Post?\n\nBill: He\u0027s obviously not cut out for Newspapers and we could use a formal poet going forward.\n\nVal: Not Kitman. I\u0027ll keep my eyes out.\n\nBill: Sure thing. Oh and Val. Tomorrow we\u0027re launching the Munar Survey Satalite. I\u0027ll need you to double check to programed course.\n\nVal: Wasn\u0027t that Jeb\u0027s job?\n\nBill: ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nVal: ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) Yeah, I get it.\n\n---\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It flew more like Val had coded it than you had.\n\nJeb: What\u0027s that suppose to mean?\n\nBob: It didn\u0027t over-thrust, it lined up a beautiful free-return trajectory, and it didn\u0027t crash.\n\nJeb: Ah, so it was no fun. Yeah that was more like Val\u0027s flying but I\u0027ll do that stuff too if it means I get to fly to the Mun.\n\nBob: I\u0027m impressed little brother, you\u0027re finally growing up.\n\nJeb: Sooooo. Point out on the map where I\u0027m going to land.\n\nBob: Can\u0027t do that yet. It\u0027ll take at least a month to pour over the data, and besides that you\u0027re going to need to compete with the other pilots for the real landing mission.\n\nJeb: Val and Mary? Okay, I\u0027ll give you that Val is going to be hard to beat but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve got Mary bang to rights.\n\nBob: With our new budget and the sheer scope of this mission we\u0027re expanding a bit.\n\nJeb: Whose the competition? I wish to know what to put on their gravestone?\n\nBob: Gravestone?\n\nJeb: Or condolences letter when I get their place on all future missions. For a pilot its pretty much the same thing.\n\nBob: Well our first new recruit is Edan Lovell but he mostly goes by Ed. He\u0027s due to arrive shortly before Apollo VII is scheduled.\n\nJeb: I get to fly it?\n\nBob: Its going to be you, Val, and Mary. We want to see each of you try your hands are the RCS controls while in orbit.\n\nJeb: Goooood!\n\nBob: Alright, well if you don\u0027t mind I\u0027ve got alot of numbers to crunch.\n\nJeb: Sure, sure. See you at the inspection?\n\nBob: Wouldn\u0027t miss it for the world. \n\n-----\n\n![s2G2Thll.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/s2G2Thll.jpg)\n\nBill: Alright Jeb. What do you think of my Magnus Opum?\n\nJeb: I think that\u0027s a terrible name for a Rocket.\n\n![MC7k7Vjl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MC7k7Vjl.jpg)\n\nBill: I mean my masterpiece.\n\nJeb: I LOVE it! I will call it the Munatic.\n\nBill: No.\n\nJeb: Sure why not?\n\nBill: We\u0027ve already named it a Saturn V.\n\nJeb: The lifter shall be call the Oedipus because it is complex.\n\nBill: It\u0027s a Saturn V.\n\nJeb: The Lander we can call Volio.\n\nBill: Okay, I\u0027ll bite. Why Volio?\n\nJeb: Because it is my Munar Adventure Lander or MAL. Wasn\u0027t Malvolio that helpful guy in that sad love story we went to see at the theater the other night?\n\nBill: That was Benvolio. Malvolio was the unhappy servant in the play we saw last christmas. The one you kept laughing about for twelve whole nights.\n\nJeb: Oh yeah. It was funny because she was dressed like a guy and he thought he was...\n\nBill: I remember. We were planning on calling it the LEM, Lunar Excursian Module. Munar isn\u0027t a word.\n\nJeb: I like MAL better.\n\nBill: Happily then, I get to name things.\n\nJeb: The Command Module I shall cal the Sigmund Freud!\n\nBill: That\u0027s it. Your naming privledges are revoked!\n\nJeb: Thou hath wounded me MAL-volio.\n\nBill: Tempt me and I won\u0027t just \u0022land\u0022 you.

Jeb is up there near the controls.\n\nBob: So is Bill.\n\nVal: Then we\u0027re fine.\n\nAstha: These engines are going to put out a whole-lota force.\n\nVal: Here\u0027s hoping.\n\nMary: Will 5 engines be enough? The IB we used for the satalite had 8.\n\nVal: Yeah, but it had to fly at half thrust most of the time.\n\nBob: This one will still be at 80% thrust most of the time. we have five engines in-case there is a problem with one.\n\nAstha: Safety first? Did Jeb loose his vote on agency policies.\n\nBob: He never actually had one. Bill and I were very careful to make sure that was the case when we drew up the charter. It says we are required to listen to his oppinions and weigh them accordingly.\n\nVal: That\u0027s very clever. How long do you think it will take for him to figure it out.\n\nBob: That depends on when he starts reading the papers we give him.\n\nVal: You\u0027re probably safe for a long time yet.\n\nBob: I wouldn\u0027t be so sure. He\u0027s alot smarter than he looks.\n\nMary: How much smarter?\n\nBob: Jeb can be absolutely brilliant when properly motivated and an opportunity to walk on the Mun is *Exactly* the sort of thing that would motivate him.\n\nAstha: Really? I\u0027m looking forward to seeing that.\n\nVal: Hmmm... I might actually have competition. Alright then, its a race. Who will be the first of us to fly to the Mun, and then walk on it.\n\nMary: I\u0027d rather be second.\n\nAstha: Why is that?\n\nMary: Because that way whatever terrible thing that is waiting to go wrong already would have.\n\n----------\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Rokaw\n\nWhen we talk about the Kerman brothers and space, history is usually being made. Today was no different. Valentina Kova, Jebidiah Kerman, and Mary Ride broadcast a 30 minute long program from space. This historic broadcast marked the first time such a feat had ever been accomplished. The crew of Apollo Seven will be spending three days together in the Command and Service Module, a box smaller than the average bathroom, and subsiding on dehydrated snacks. The astronauts seemed in very high spirits today, breaking out into karaoke during their broadcast. Hopefully they\u0027ll be ready for the cameras when they get home.\n\nBack at Mission Control there is a bustle of activity going on with as a new Saturn V is being built. Apollo VIII is being busily planned and the team is already deep into their training program. None of the three astronauts on Apollo VII will be joining the landmark mission to Orbit Mun. Piloting this mission will be ex-military aviator Edan Lovell. Apollo VIII\u0027s chief mechanic will be Katlina Borman who was the lead designer for the Apollo programs RCS system. The mission\u0027s scientific adviser will be Malcan Anders. Anders is working on the communications systems to attempt a live broadcast from Mun\u0027s Orbit. There are no plans for a landing on the Apollo VIII mission. The earliest a landing attempt will be made is Apollo X, assuming funding does not run dry before that.\n\n![fZ4Sjs6l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fZ4Sjs6l.jpg)\n\n---\n\nDay 2:\n\n![0N18ORjl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0N18ORjl.jpg)\n\nBill: Will someone please explain to me why Jeb is poking around in the service module.\n\nVal: He\u0027s on a time out.\n\nBill: That isn\u0027t helping.\n\nVal: Well, you can watch your tone or we\u0027ll talk once you\u0027re feeling better.\n\nBob: Seven this is Bob. Bill never feel\u0027s better and he only has one tone: annoyed.\n\nBill: That is *NOT* true.\n\nBob: Sorry, I fogot about \u0022really annoyed.\u0022 Val... why is Jeb on time out.\n\nVal: He kept trying to ignite the SM engine all through the night so see how fast he could get it going. Didn\u0027t get any sleep.\n\nMary: Ah... ah... ACHOOO.\n\nVal: And Mary\u0027s sick.\n\nBob: Bad?\n\nAstha: No. We\u0027ve been monitoring it. Just a small cold.\n\nBob: Make sure we get protocols in place to catch it earlier next time.\n\nBill: Good thinking. I\u0027ll appreciate you to note that I am not saying this in an annoyed tone.\n\nElilina: Whats that on your face boss? Its... scary.\n\nBill: Its a smile! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nElilina: Oh, now it looks much better.\n\nBob: ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Try not to leave him in there too long.\n\n----\n\nDay 3:\n\nMary: Achoo!

Our first landing of this capsule. We haven\u0027t tested with the helmet either.\n\nBill: We don\u0027t know if you\u0027ll be fine when the parachutes open without your helmut.\n\nMary: And I\u0027d rather not be starting as sneeze until they get the door open.\n\nAstha: Its your neck Mary.

Looks like there are trees out there. Go and see what you can find for food.\n\nBob: There\u0027s a bag of chips in the supplies.\n\nVal: We keep the supplies for when we can\u0027t do hunting and gathering.\n\nBob: I don\u0027t see how this is suppose to test who is best suited to survival on Mun. There won\u0027t be any trees, nuts, or berries to find there.\n\nVal: Probably for future missions to Duna and Eve. See who is ready to live as a hunter-gatherer eating only purple plants.\n\nBob: Its highly doubtful that there is any life on Eve, let alone life we could eat. If there is anything it will probably be silicon based and have to communicate by carving cryptic phrases like \u0022No Kill I\u0022 on the ground using its own immense body heat.\n\nVal: Thats an oddly specific idea of what lives on Eve.\n\nBob: Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll bring the laser guns after I finish inventing them.\n\nVal: Right, you check through the supplies for anything useful and I\u0027ll try to set up a radio tower to communicate with the KSC.\n\nBob: Oh! A bowtie!\n\n![6WbQwB4l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6WbQwB4l.jpg)\n\nVal: Oh no. No, no, no... you put that back.\n\nBob: uh uh! I wear a bowtie now.

These three pioneers are the first to ever orbit another celestial body. Their names will be lost as soon as someone else lands on that body, for the moment they are the most famous Kerbals in the world. Edan Lovel was the mission pilot, his hand on the wheel the whole time to keep the ship in its smooth, circular, orbit. Katlina Boreman was the mission commander, overseeing the first ever repair mission done on EVA to patch a minor fuel leak. Malcan Anders was the communications expert. These three are going to be celebrated like heroes for the next month.\n\nApollo IX\u0027s crew will get no such hero\u0027s welcome on their home-coming. That mission, flying soon, will be a simple orbital test of the Lunar Excursion Module\u0027s systems and will not leave low Kerbin Orbit or LKO. The real fun begins with Apollo X, whose crew is still a mystery, which is rumored to be the first landing attempt. Rumors from the very top of the KSC state that the mission commander role has already been filled by the single most qualified kerbal on the premises. No two sources seem to be able to agree on who that is though. We here at the Post are excepting it to be none other than Jebidiah Kerman who was the first kerbal in space and has flown in the largest variety of rockets from the program. Its hard to imagine what criteria would make someone else more qualified to command the first Munar landing.\n\nFull albums:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The flight surgeon will okay mission commanders and they\u0027ll pick their teams. I\u0027ve even got her working on back-up teams incase we have another training exercise like Mary had.\n\nBill: I was going to give this flight to her, but she\u0027s still recovering. So, it\u0027s time.\n\nBob: You\u0027re trying to figure out if I\u0027ll try to block you\u0027re landing once you\u0027re up there.\n\nBill: Will you?\n\nBob: I\u0027m not going to dignify that with an answer. Unlike some people here I do my job. Like many people here I also enjoy it and have fun doing it.\n\nBill: I should go get strapped in then.\n\n![1fApS23l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1fApS23l.jpg)\n\nJeb: Mission control, this is Apollo Ten.\n\nBob: I read you Jeb. What is your flight designation? I\u0027ve got a note that all current flights should have a dignified name.\n\nJeb: Our CSM will be called Ecks... you know, like the letter.\n\nBob: X. Okay... and the LEM?\n\nBill: Eagle.\n\nJeb: I was going to go with Y myself.\n\nBill: The Eagle... I want the newspapers to say \u0022the eagle has landed.\u0022\n\nBob: Eagle. Got it. Pre-flight is looking good. Get yourself strapped in and get ready.\n\nVal: CAPCOM, all guidance systems are go.\n\nKatlina: Recovery go.\n\nMalcan: Communications and computer systems are opperating at expected levels.\n\nEdan: Mal, its okay to just say \u0022go.\u0022\n\nMalcan: With Jeb behind the wheel that seems a problematic strategy.\n\nJeb: Its okay Control, This one I\u0027m doing right. If I\u0027m good I get to walk on Mun.\n\nKatlina: Its almost scary how well he\u0027s behaving.\n\nVal: Bill\u0027s got the ultimate carrot, he doesn\u0027t need the stick until they\u0027re on the way back.\n\nBob: Ecks... I\u0027m not calling you guys X.\n\nJeb: Okay, how about - Columbia?\n\nBob: Now we\u0027re talking. Columbia, you are GO for launch.\n\n![FP9edWgl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FP9edWgl.jpg)\n\nJeb: Go!

Get yourselves on a free return trajectory.\n\nJeb: Roger that. Astha, can you crunch those numbers and confirm with Val, I\u0027m going to prep LEM extraction.\n\n![i8vOctil.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/i8vOctil.jpg)\n![F3ML8F3l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/F3ML8F3l.jpg)\n\nAstha: We are on a Free Return trajectory now control.\n\nBob: We confirm that Columbia.

Its safe though, Henzer said it was beautiful.

I\u0027m not sure about the ascent-stage\u0027s thrust to weight, we tested it with backup engines that we removed.\n\nJeb: If you removed them it was because the TWR was fine - besides its the same configuration nine had.\n\nBill: There are alot of craters down here... I don\u0027t trust the suspension.\n\nJeb: Get back in your seat and let me fly!\n\nBill: How\u0027s our fuel?\n\nJeb: We\u0027ve got tons - if anything its too much.\n\nBill: We\u0027ve never flown the LEM in lunar orbit... can you rendezvous? You\u0027ve never rendezvoused before...\n\nJeb: I\u0027ll got Val and Bob in my ear, its fine.\n\nBob: Eagle come in.\n\nJeb: This is eagle.\n\nBob: While I hate to say this... everything is looking perfect on this end. Take her down.\n\nBill: We should do more tests!\n\nJeb: Sit down!\n\nBill: What\u0027s that blinking light?\n\nJeb: Its fine. Sit, down... I can\u0027t focus.\n\nBill: You can\u0027t focus?

Isn\u0027t Val going to be your pilot?\n\n![pfLbePpl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pfLbePpl.jpg)\n\nBob: Yeah, she is. We\u0027ve been training together too long now to change that up this close to the launch. A different problem has come up and we need you back here at the KSC.\n\nJeb: You\u0027ve got a pilot. Val\u0027s pretty much as good as I am, I mean, I\u0027m still better, but she\u0027s as close as you can get without being me.\n\nBob: Well, you are definately more modest than her.\n\nJeb: I know!\n\nBob: I don\u0027t have any missions for you to Pilot right now Jeb... actually that\u0027s why I need you.\n\nJeb: Nothing for me to pilot. Look I\u0027m about as awesome as a Kerbal can possibly get, and I know that, but I\u0027m a pilot. If there isn\u0027t anything for me to fly: what do you need *me* for?\n\nBob: We need you to be CAPCOM for Apollo 11.\n\nJeb: Me?\n\nBob: Yes.\n\nJeb: Not Bill?\n\nBob: You aren\u0027t the only one whose trust he lost with that stunt. The ground crews aren\u0027t working with Bill right now. Katlina took over as head engineer for the time being, but she doesn\u0027t have the experience in Mission Command to be CAPCOM for something like this.\n\nJeb: I don\u0027t know.\n\nBob: Jeb. Apollo X should have landed on Mun. Your ascent was perfect, your free-return is going to be in text books. Your lunar approach was exactly right. With your help Val can do as well as you did and we *have* to land this one or there will not be another mission.\n\nJeb: Wait... say that again.\n\nBob: The wigs are threatening to pull all of our funding. We have 1 full Saturn V already built and no Roots to make a new one with. If we don\u0027t land this mission we\u0027ll have lost Mun.\n\nJeb: Because of Bill?\n\nBob: The press was all over the \u0022failure\u0022 of 10 to deliver on the promise of a Mun landing. There have been a dozen accusations that we\u0027ve faked our program using models on strings in front of pictures and telescopes.\n\nJeb: That\u0027s ridiculous. If we were doing that we\u0027d have already managed a Jool flyby.\n\nBob: Edan also said he\u0027d give up his seat on Apollo XIII for you if you could save the program.\n\nJeb: Tell him we\u0027ll talk about that after I save it. I was already going to come back as soon as you said you needed me Bro. I just have one request.\n\nBob: Yeah?\n\nJeb: Bill isn\u0027t allowed in Mission control for the duration of the mission.\n\nBob: Titha has him duct-taped to a stall in the Admin\u0027s bathroom. She brings him meals and stands guard with a crow-bar. We started it to make him shut up about you stealing his boat, but we all voted to keep him there until Apollo eleven gets home.\n\nJeb: Right then. Get the launch prepped.\n\nBob: Will do. Thank you brother.\n\nJeb: Just you make sure it is a Kerman who steps foot on Mun first. I like Val same as the next guy but the three of us started this program. She\u0027s as much a part of the heart of it as we are... but she doesn\u0027t have my last name and it will make it harder for me to edit all the history books to say I did it first.\n\nBob: ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) First you get us landed, then we\u0027ll worry about whose boots touch first.\n\n![zbDEulDl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zbDEulDl.jpg)\n\nAstha: Mission Control, I\u0027ve finished strapping in our crew. On my way back.\n\nJeb: Okay, I\u0027ll introduce you when you get here.\n\nAstha: Huh?\n\nJeb: Okay everyone! I know Bob told you I\u0027d be running this mission. The truth is though that awesome though I am, I\u0027m also impulsive and think of risk as something more to be laughed at than actually considered. My brother Bill is, how have I heard it put... a very narrow nozzle. Explosive, unpleasant to stand next too, but absolutely essential for getting us off the ground. Still, Bill broke our trust and we can\u0027t have him back in here yet. So Edan and I found someone we trust to do the job that needs doing better than either of us could while we contribute in the ways we best can.

Once you\u0027re back in Val and I will transfer to the LEM and get ready for de-orbit.\n\n![wDrl5Del.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wDrl5Del.jpg)\n\nJeb: Control to Falcon.\n\nBob: This is Falcon, we\u0027ve separated from Enterprise and are lining up for our de-orbit burn.\n\nJeb: Send me your numbers.\n\nVal: Transmitting. I\u0027m going to land on top of that radar blip you saw.\n\nJeb: Val, do you have any idea what the odds off...\n\nVal: Never tell me the odds!\n\nJeb: Yeah, sorry. Don\u0027t know what I was thinking.\n\nBob: Get us lined up and count us down Control.\n\n![NHREiHCl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NHREiHCl.jpg)\n\nVal: Jeb, I\u0027ve got visual contact. It looks almost like a structure.\n\nBob: With all the craters we\u0027ve seen its likely to be a freak occurance, a natural formation of harder rock that survived by chance.\n\nVal: It looks like a cube.\n\nBob: Well... I...\n\nVal: A giant cube.\n\n![EfZBumPl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EfZBumPl.jpg)\n\nBob: Maybe the Kraken does play dice with the universe?\n\nVal: Looks more like a block.\n\nBob: We\u0027ve found one of the building blocks of the universe?\n\nJeb: I neeeeeeeeeeed pictures!\n\nVal: Bob, you are not going to believe what I saw. We\u0027re just a few meters off from it.\n\nBob: Control, please note the time. We are on the surface of Mun.\n\n![F7a60Bol.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/F7a60Bol.jpg)\n\nGene: Alright, we\u0027ve got our remote cameras set up, tell mister Rokaw he\u0027s getting a live feed.\n\nMalcan: Roger that. Jeb, give Bob an count of 2 minutes.\n\nJeb: Got it.\n\nB. Rokaw: Ladies and Gentlemen what you are looking at on your televisions as home is a live broadcast from the surface of our closest moon. Bob Kerman and Valentina Kova are in the vessel you see on your screens now. Ms. Kova piloted the Munar Adventure Lander \u0022Falcon\u0022 during the mission today.\n\nBill: Lunar Exursion Module! Lunar Excursion Module! Titha... let me out... he\u0027s getting the name wrong!\n\nTitha: Not letting you out bill, he\u0027s just reading the notes Jeb left him.\n\nBill: ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif) let me out noooooooow!\n\n![RIbKaIsl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RIbKaIsl.jpg)\n\nB. Rokaw: I\u0027m getting word that Mission Control has given permission for an EVA or extra vehicular activity. Control specialist Jebidiah Kerman is directing the mission\u0027s commander and chief scientific ad-visor, Bob Kerman, to exit onto the ladder. \n\n![660a1nPl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/660a1nPl.jpg)\n\nWe can see Mr. Kerman exiting the vehicle now. He is going down the ladder slowly. The reduced Gravity on Mun along with the movement-restrictive suits make it slow going.\n\n![BCt9wbul.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BCt9wbul.jpg)\n\nMr. Kerman is at the foot of the ladder now, just inches away from the surface of Mun. We are getting live audio from the mission now.\n\nBob: Control, do you read. The ground is covered in what looks like, a type of powder.\n\nJeb: Right.\n\nBob: Its very still, Up close it looks soft, but it seems to get hard further out.\n\nJeb: Roger that Bob, bring back some samples. Now, do you want to take that next setp?\n\nBob: Yeah, just trying to think of what to say.\n\n![q8F80Wgl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/q8F80Wgl.jpg)\n\nBob: One small step for--\n\nVal: Booya! Never tell me the odds! Woooooo!\n\nB. Rokaw: The quote appears to have been \u0022that is one small booya, never tell me the odds.\n\nGene: pst! say this.\n\nB. Rokaw: Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there was a very odd glitch with the radio, the quote was suppose to have been, uh, I mean actually was \u0022That\u0027s one small step for a Kerbal, one giant leap for kerbal-kind.\u0022 Though we all distinctly heard a booya in there somewhere.\n\nGene: thanks.\n\n![z4Fq83Pl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/z4Fq83Pl.jpg)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Booya!\n\nI personally try to imagine those parts being said by Tom Brokaw or Walter Cronkite. I crack a smile imagining Cronkite despondently add \u0022We all heard a booya in there\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Love the story!!!\n\u003E By the way, are there more parts to come? Because i\u0027m very curious how you would form the apollo 13 mission\n\nI definitely plan to do Apollo 13. Edan Lovel (namesake of Apollo 13\u0027s commander) was going to be commanding it but he\u0027s promised Jeb that mission. \n\nA brief shot of what I have planned out is this:\n\nNext entry - Apollo 11 returns home. New funding comes in and the program is saved, some new members join the team. Modifications begin to the LEM (now permanently renamed \u0022MAL\u0022 for Apollo 12\u002B. \n\nApollo 12 will be bringing KIS containers with the parts needed to build a Rover and a ALSEP package on Mun for additional exploration.\n\nApollo 13 - I need to work out much detail I plan to go into though I hope to be able to re-watch the 1995 film and set up scenes lining up with it. I plan to do several entries for that mission because it should be fun to write. I\u0027m not sure how, but I want to set up a cloud of debris and something explody for the big boom moment.\n\nAfter this the group will decide that they need an intercept crew on stand-by in-case this sort of thing happens again. - Cue Skylab 1.\n\nEventually they\u0027ll go to Minmus as well and I\u0027m hoping to eventually get Duna and Eve missions and possibly even more distant fly-bys. I want to at least send a probe out to Plock - though I\u0027m not sure it would ever get out there. (An apollo/constellation style mission to Tekto would be awesome - and of course a Eeloo-pa Report)... but all of that is getting ahead of me.\n\nnext play session I get is Apollo 12 and hoping that mission goes smoothly."},{"CreatedByName":"B-STRK","CreatedById":126119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T07:11:58Z","Content":"\u0022One small booya, never tell me the odds\u0022\n\nWHY DIDN\u0027T YOU KEEP THIS LINE, ROKAW? That line was beautiful. How could you succumb to evil bureaucratic censorship?\n\nBut really, welcome to the Mun! And congrats on reaching *the* milestone of ALP!\n\nWhich means soon, you get to launch your Skylab! (And I sit here, somewhat envious that I\u0027m not in a position to launch my Skylab yet ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )"}]}
