the past few months I\u0027ve been trying to visit and return from Eve.\u00A0 I\u0027ve successfully landed my vehicle on Eve a few times, but haven\u0027t managed to get back to\u00A0orbit for one reason or another.\u00A0 It\u0027s a tricky balance of competing interests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/sdF1Pgi\u0022 rel=\u0022external

terminated on the fuel tank that the mining drill was attached to.\u00A0 It might also be because in extended position the drill went below the heat shield, but I\u0027m hoping this was not the case, because I didn\u0027t account for that in my latest ship...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLatest ship:\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/3uh4cRx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELatest Eve Ship - Imgur\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0It\u0027s a bit ugly.\u00A0 The trusses were necessary because the vehicle was flexing too much in the middle during Kerbin take-off.\u00A0 As a matter of fact, it was quite difficult to fly even in this configuration, which was successful in getting to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext I\u0027ll refill this guy in orbit\u00A0and re-use the lowest stage to get me to Eve and then brake into orbit and then land.\u00A0 Hopefully the drills won\u0027t explode during Eve EDL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think they designed the game to make returning from Eve that do-able.\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t the first thing on their minds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m doing this in sandbox
