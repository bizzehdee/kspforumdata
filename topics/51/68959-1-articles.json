It\u0027s early days so nothing high-tech is available yet and I\u0027m grinding my way through Mun and Minmus biomes about 1/2way through the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my previous career games, I\u0027d always avoided the Minmus slope biome but this time I decided to break the monotony of the career grind and go for it. I mean, it\u0027s Minmus. I\u0027ve been there 1000 times. How hard could it be? And so Bill was sent there to find the steepest slope along his path and land there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYLUUr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7126/13769622033_50fdae51ec.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769622033_50fdae51ec.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich he did, no problem. Ladders aren\u0027t necessary on Mun or Minmus so I\u0027ve never bothered researching them, and Bill just jumped out and floated lightly to the surface where, without taking a step, he grabbed a handful of rocks and planted his flag. Then he had to get back in the lander, so he turned to face it. But as soon as he lifted his foot, he started sliding down the hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYNJTw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/13769978564_98a35f5749.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769978564_98a35f5749.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere he went, walking forward but sliding backwards.

I wasn\u0027t worried and thought this was pretty cool, and was lamenting I can\u0027t record video. No biggie, I thought. I can just hit the jets to get back up to the lander. And so I didn\u0027t notice Bill was slowly accelerating, until his feet went out from under him.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYLUpD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/13769620363_a93779deea.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769620363_a93779deea.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....and then there was no stopping it. Bill began slowly rolling down the hillside. And continuing to accelerate. Soon he was bouncing high and tumbling at extremely high RPM while not moving very fast over the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYLUsz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/13769620533_fd7cf2f01c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769620533_fd7cf2f01c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeriodically, Bill would touch the ground and go bouncing off rotating in a different direction at a different speed, either faster or slower. Sometimes he bounced so high I was afraid he\u0027d get into orbit....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYLUBc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3693/13769621033_cc46345e15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769621033_cc46345e15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....but he always came down again, usually face-first as here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after probably a couple of minutes of real time, the ground leveled out near the edge of a \u0022lakebed\u0022 and Bill eventually skidded to a halt. I zoomed out to get a better view of how far he\u0027d travelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYNJod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/13769976864_eef2f5176c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769976864_eef2f5176c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn appreciation for the steepness of the hill can be gained by realizing the ship landed at about 1500m elevation. Bill lost nearly all that altitude and thus moved about 2200m horizontally. Most of this was the final skid at the bottom--he travelled essentially both sides of the triangle instead of taking the hypotenuse. Yay SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce his head stopped spinning, Bill dusted himself off, fired up his jetpack, and began the long trip back to the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/mYNHSy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7426/13769975144_50935fcbf0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213769975144_50935fcbf0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong the way, an idea began forming in his head about exploiting this location for recreation. He could have lots of fun kicking Jeb down this mountain repeatedly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Bill got back to the lander.
