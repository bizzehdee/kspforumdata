And I did those in in 0.90. This is my first plane landing in 1.0.0 without parachutes.\n\nSo, let\u0027s start. We leave off in a space program in a science save with 0 science and 1 Jeb stranded on Minmus from a half-sucessful landing attempt. I am not good enough at the game to be able to construct a rocket capable of landing *and returning* with my limited tech. So what do I do? I bring out my science plane.\n\nMy science plane is named Airplane 2 (which is not a nod to Airplane (the movie)) (and also because the first one I built had an outdated cockpit), and man is it awesome. It is meant to biome hop on Kerbin and... that\u0027s it. I had used it for one more mission before this (and tried another but it took too long), but it was headed for the mountains. Destroyed? I would have never flown the mission if the answer was not no. Parachuted down? Yes, unfortunately. But this... this mission was going to land normally. Kod help us all.\n\nThe pilot of the plane is Bill Kerman. It is sitting on the runway, barely moving. I know the space program depends on this mission, so I am tense. This same feeling gets me to activate the standard stock jet engine on the back of the plane. It hums, coming to life; andddddd WE\u0027RE OFF! The plane lifts itself up into the air as gracefully as a dove, and flips over 180 degrees slowly, again with grace. I am heading for the desert on the west cost of Kafria (the continent where the KSC is located) to hopefully get some untouched science. Now I am allowed to not tell the part in between the takeoff and encountering *those* mountains because nothing of interest happens in between, so yeah. Bill\u0027s plane comes across the mountains blocking his path; and instead of just going above everything, he was gonna fly through a low section of the mountain like a boss. Skip another boring part of the story. My heart is racing as I turn the plane, getting closer and closer to the sea. It makes it out ok and I am relived. However, the worst part is to come.\n\nI enter physics warp x4. I am at about 4,000 meters in the sky. I point my plane down... and done with warp. Woah, I\u0027m really close to the ground! I pull up as hard as hard as I can. I DID IT! I landed a plane normally! WOO-HOO!!! So, I get all the science I can, and I recover Bill and the plane. 45 science! That was *just* enough to unlock the node I wanted! Yay! So, for saving the space program, Jeb, and himself, he gets a glamor shot next to the plane that did it all. (The chutes on the back were not used.)\n\n![jBeJEPq.png](http://i.imgur.com/jBeJEPq.png)\n\nI hope I have pleased you guys, and have a good day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T21:15:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:18:27Z","Content":"Right now I am doing my Minmus rescue mission thanks to this plane landing.

Touching down on the runway and rolling up next to the hangar is a great feeling (especially since most of my aircraft are terrifying to land). Well done! Now land and return missions within Kerbin\u0027s SOI are within reach."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T13:21:41Z","Content":"Sticking a landing in the middle of the runway is still the best feeling in this game."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T19:29:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sticking a landing in the middle of the runway is still the best feeling in this game.\n\nOh no, I made it sound like I did it on the runway!
