Of course, no sane Kerbal has ever believed such claptrap. I mean, they can see Mun pretty good with telescopes and travelers\u0027 tales of it have always agreed with ground observations. But another continent on Kerbin? Preposterous!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the tales persisted in Kerballore and popular culture soon became filled with totally lame mass-market novels and video games set in the fabled \u0022Land of the Dawn\u0022. Eventually a respectable Kerbal scientist had enough of this rot and decided to prove once and for all that no such continent existed. To this end he designed a jet-powered boat by the simple expedient of taking a blue wrench to the wings and tail of a standard seaplane. Then he threw a couple of unimaginative Kerbals in it and told them to head east until they ran out of fuel, then swim back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMyoPjr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oMyoPjr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the JetBoat began its myth-busting odyssey, thumping and skipping over the waves at about 105m/s. Within 11 minutes, even the top of Airbase Island had sunk beneath the western horizon. And other than the odd piece of booster and the floating hulks of ditched SSTO failures, the crew saw nothing but blue water for a long, long time. Kerbol set behind them, the stars started coming out, and eventually the Sacred Strut appeared along the ecliptic to hold the heavens together. And there was still no land in sight, but the fuel gauges were still reading well over 1/2 so there was nothing for it but to continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/353vRE7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022353vRE7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then, unbelievably, at T\u002B49 minutes, a bit of land appeared fine on the port bow. And it refused to be just an island. Instead, it grew into a massive headland fringed by steep cliffs, with lowlands stretching off behind it as far as the eye could see. There was no denying it; they was the mythical Land of the Dawn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n8iAuAe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022n8iAuAe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERounding the headland, the crew found a gentle slope on its NE corner and, 54 minutes after leaving KSC, rolled up onto the beach using the powered rover wheels inside their boat\u0027s pontoons. They got out and reflexively planted a flag under their headlights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then they contemplated their situation. They still had 2/3 fuel so could return to KSC. But their boss would surely fire them for making him look like an idiot. But OTOH, they might become heroes of the popular culture and even feature in future lame books and video games, and become rich. Or they could stay here, at least until the snacks ran out. All they could decide to do was sleep on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before they turned in, they figured out how wide the ocean is. (54 minutes) x (60 seconds/minute) x (105 meters/second) = about 340km give or take (depending on where you measure). Yay SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T08:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice write up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T09:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood job \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E by the way, the cockpit cam looks hilarious.
