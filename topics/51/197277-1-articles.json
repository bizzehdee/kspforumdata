This will be a milestone in Kerbal history and our civilization first try to go outside the boundaries of our atmosphere and finally explore the universe, starting of course from our near space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe endgoal of Ascent is to put an artificial satellite in orbit and demostrate that we can do that, paving the way for all future space explorations and investigations.

Last sitrep were more a copy/paste of the same information that I\u0027m posting on either the website and on Twitter, and honestly this seems really redundant to me. So considering that the KSP forums are a \u0022friend space\u0022 I thought that maybe it\u0027s better to use this medium as a safe harbor where I can talk \u0022out of the fiction\u0022 about my plans, the general progress and everything that is not posted nor explained already. Maybe I\u0027ll split in topics each entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral status of the project\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment I\u0027m very happy with the result. I manage to get to a pace that allows me to take everything very easy. I still have not identified a way to use a standardize time, meaning that the output in the fiction is different than the time in game. For example, I\u0027ve done some missions in game in two consequent days but I reported them on the fiction having a longer span, to give a \u0022breath\u0022 to the fiction itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile this paradox can work while I do a timed/single day mission, it could be difficult in future when I will work on longer missions. I plan to find a solution along the way, but at this time I\u0027m trying to avoid \u0022fixed time\u0022 or dates in the fiction stuff, also to avoid potential \u0022we\u0027ll do that tomorrow\u0022 and the next day being unable to updated due to being bogged down with real life events.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn game I\u0027ve completed around 10 missions, so I have a slight advantage over the fiction. I plan to keep this advantage over time, maybe more, but at the moment I felt moving faster in game could potentially be disruptive (I\u0027m thinking for example of the recent addition of a map server, it would have been cool to record more telemetry from my first launches and visualize their path, but at that time I had no clue that I ended up with this additional cool tool).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying also to gave more importance to each assets I build in game, this is something that bothers me because I don\u0027t want to have thousands of rockets/planes and not give enough space to each one of these, or worst, not justifying their construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe website\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve expanded a lot the website since I started. It\u0027s quite a mess honestly because I wanted to rely 100% on free systems (since last time I paid for a domain and a hosting for one year and ended up shutting everything down after a month) so I used a Blogger account and I just create a template from scratch, leveraging on Bootstrap. As you may imagine, there is a lot of unorganized HTML, CSS and JS but at the end it works and I believe it\u0027s looking good right now.\u00A0 I\u0027ve added some heavy HTML customized pages like the Assets and the Kerbonauts and for edit them I essentially change them in VS Code and then copy paste to blogger. I will add some more stuff there over time but again I don\u0027t want to rush.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding the news section there, since Twitter is the place where I post daily news, I plan to add a little more exhaustive articles when importat event will happens. Maybe also a weekly, daily report on operation, but definitely it would look like more a general database for the fiction rathern than a news site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe mapserver\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn these days I also worked on what I call KAIA (Kerbal Aerospace Institute Atlas) which is nothing more that a google-map alike for Kerbin (for the more dev oriented, Leaflet relying on tiles generated from Sigma-Cartographer, everything hosted on GitHub pages). At the moment I\u0027m still understanding\u00A0how to use it at best, most likely I will add specific missions and launch informations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m adding in seconds a link on the first post of the topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe fiction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, let\u0027s talk about the fiction. So at the moment the KAI focus is on two different projects, Aero and Ascent. Both are essentially \u0022foundation\u0022 projects, one for building up fictional knowledge about aeronautics engineering, the other for doing the same with space exploration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Aero I just rolled out the X-1 Aerojet, an aircraft (inspired by the Me-262) that would\u00A0represent the first step of experimenting with jets. On top of it I plan to release multiple specific variants for different uses.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTalking about Ascent instead, I think now at a \u0022V-2\u0022 phase in terms of technology, where experiments are\u00A0like \u0022lit this candle and see how far it will go\u0022. The first rocket is a solid propelled one, also with no reentry options other than crash. I plan to evolve this design with parachutes, test a liquid fuel variants and generally having the KAI focused on understanding how rocketry works and makes consideration about rockets aerodynamics, propellant and derived capabilities. Of course reaching space is very near (just launch fast, it will get there somehow right?) but the challenge will be to control these rockets and use them in an\u00A0intelligent way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn game I decided to use just vanilla parts, to have a unified look and without mods like TweakScale (to add some challenge). I really like use mods but I think that at this point KSP is very mature and allows to do essentially everything without modded parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m relying instead of mods for both visual and informative purposes, like Engineer Redux, Scatterer and so on. So things that doesn\u0027t really affect a possible craft file that I will generate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also evaluate the use of KOS. But I believe it could be really overkill as I believe it will have me taking too much preparation on each rocket development. I\u0027m planning to use it anyway for telemetry data, for example taking a ship position over time and reconstruct it\u0027s flight. I already have an halfway baked script with all kinds of telemetry there. Along with KOS I will certainly use Graphotron, which automatically plot and prevent me to export/import into Sheets/Excel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that for today we\u0027re set!

This weeks were crazy in terms of RL work, so I had to slow down a little the progression of the game to better accomodate an healthy lifestyle (already hard-tested due to the global pandemic) but nonetheless I\u0027m proceeding and funnily the slow-down process gave me some sort of feeling of \u0022natural\u0022 progression of the events... meaning that it felt more right to having the KAI spending time at the engineering table rather than launching missions over missions in sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s look at this report topics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#3498db;font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EGeneral status of the project\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally bought a DNS name: kaero.space, I was hesistant at first after I was worried in spending money and then at some point abandon the project like I did several times in the past, but at the end the cost is very small (even compared to what I spend on steam regularly, for example) and I really like that fact that I can now point to a single domain rather that having blogger, github etc...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs mentioned before, I proceeded slowly compared to the beginning but also because most of the stuff I wanted are already in place, so now I can focus more on the evolution of the fiction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn Twitter I post daily information and stuff. I don\u0027t have many followers, maybe in future I will publish this fiction links on other media (like Reddit) but I don\u0027t want either to bother people too much because if I can say that I\u0027m happy with the outcome, I could certainly do it better (like writing better.. english is not my mother tongue and given the fact that I have to write a lot, mispelling and convoluted phrases are very common unfortunately) so I\u0027m waiting to have much more stuff before \u0022marketing\u0022 the KAI.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNevertheless, I do love the feedbacks that I\u0027m receiving and even a like makes me happy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end I can say that I don\u0027t have at the moment big ideas for the near future, as I said everything is in place to move further with the fiction\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#3498db;font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe website\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe website is coming up nicely, the more things happens in the fiction the more it seems lively. As I said it\u0027s quite dull from a pure development perspective but the platform (Blogger) doens\u0027t give too much room for fancy stuff (or, to say better, I don\u0027t like the idea to spend too much time on its technology, quite old style).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlan for the near future is to add a couple of new sections like a \u0022book of records\u0022 and a page dedicated to explain what the hell that website is and maybe listing the mods actually in use. Xmas time will probably gave me some time to improve also existing pages (some of them, like the About KAI, are quite dull)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#3498db;font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe mapserver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKAIA is quite complete, I added the capability to hide or show the markers and labels on the map plus the capability to plot lines of coordinates in the [lat,lon], [lat,lon], ... format that I already tested to came up with the flight path of the Aero-4 mission. The coordinates are gathered through kOS that saves them every second (it\u0027s enough, I don\u0027t feel the need to go more grainy) on a text file on disk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I added geographical features label. These are not very easy to write up as essentially they are HTML canvas layers put on top of the map, but the effect is quite cool and the naming itself is a good fiction stuff that made me came up with the Explora program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#3498db;font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe fiction\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, the fiction, which I believe is proceeding the right way. We moved from solid to liquid to now multistage rocketry and at the same time planes\u00A0are being developed. It feels a natural progression and as I said the fact of\u00A0not conducting missions everyday gave some much needed realism touch. It\u0027s funny that in this way even if I need to take some breaks it works well too by assuming that the \u0022KAI engineers\u0022 are working on new stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the game, as I mentioned I introducted kOS but only for retrieving telemetry data and I\u0027m a bit worried that the upcoming KSP update may break compatibility with some mods. I will probably need to wait a little before transitioning and eventually do some testing. The thing that scary me most is to lose compatibbility with Kerbal Konstruct that I used to have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on steroids. Let\u0027s see, I will keep my finger crossed as not being able to follow up with new patches is something that I don\u0027t really like, especially missing cool content like the one that will be introduced (repairs, new visors, etc..)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll right I think that\u0027s it!
