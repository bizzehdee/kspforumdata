The hopper ship was in manned and had a probe core. The Ox Stats were only on one side so when I got to minmus the ship was facing the wrong way and lost all power during time warp. Not wanting to revert I jetpacked a Kerbal from the minmus base and actually managed to catch up to the ship as it limped by. With almost no jetpack fuel remaining, he got inside and refuelled. Then he got out and pushed the ship to orient the panels toward the sun. I couldn\u0027t believe that crazy plan worked. \n\nThing is, I know better and normally save some power by turning off a battery. Just forgot to do it.

If you\u0027re transferring to Moho from a higher orbit then your craft is overtaking the planet. Usually you want to capture into a prograde orbit. If you are overtaking, then the prograde side of Moho is the one facing away from Kerbol.
