The shuttle appeared to be a bad mistake, fuel from all side tanks had to be moved into the small central tank by hand all the time, it had no own power source and pitiful batteries, anyway, the crew was stranded in the station. Three Orange Suits and two Grey. The scientist was taken to Minmus, the rest had to wait for a return trip.\n\nSo, today I built my first SSTO plane. Creatively named SSTO-1; my line of failures of getting to the orbit with turbojet and LV-N ended when I included a good old Poodle, with enough thrust to keep me in orbit and enough ISp not to use up all the fuel. I equipped it with a passenger cabin for this flight, but it could take a cargo bay instead... or actually, two.\n\n![u3Syaf7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/u3Syaf7.jpg)\n\n![NEBpHVS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NEBpHVS.jpg)\n\n It required some fancy trajectory to get to orbit: rise to 10km, level the flight, gain speed until some 800m/s, then pull up, to escape the atmosphere at above 1000m/s. I\u0027d switch the rocket engines on at about 20km.\n\nIt seems the idea worked, it was even a bit over-engineered; I had good 2000m/s of delta-V left when in orbit, and a plenty of oxidizer still left.\n\nWell, I set the course for Umbrella Station, at its 1000km orbit. I set up an almost-perfect rendezvous, and executed first burn (2 minutes 39s!) with the lv-n to 0.1m/s precision. I warped to a minute before the rendezvous, and began braking.\n\nWell, duh, I\u0027d never get some 300m/s difference before getting waaay away from the station, luckily I still had a lot of oxidizer. Poodle activated again, and I ended braking when 1,4km from the target.\n\nAt leisurely 10m/s I approached the station, picked a free docking port and began docking. It went amazingly smoothly until the clamp failed to catch correctly. Attached loosely by the nose, I kept swinging to and fro in hopes the clamp would catch properly at last. Good half a hour of trying to align myself perfectly perpendicularly to the station.\n\nAt last, after a more rapid maneuver the joint broke off. I backed off a bit and docked again... and it caught at once. And right on time. My vernor engines had some 10 units of oxidizer left. (still plenty of liquid fuel, but dock something this big without RCS!)\n\nBTW, seen these three headlights? They make docking a breeze. Each shines a different color, white in the middle should be where the port is.\n\nAnd when everything docked to the station switches its lights on...\n\n![RdZYROc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RdZYROc.jpg)\n\nAs for what you see: the big fuel depot on the left. A rescue tug next to SSTO-1 on the right. And three escape pods. The crew wasn\u0027t exactly stuck, it\u0027s just that the pods are single-use; one fits three kerbals, and provides bare necessities to reach Kerbin and land safely.\n\nWell, crew exchange. My pilot would stay, to kerb the station. The rest would return. Crew transfer function refused to work as usual, so I had to EVA the kerbals one by one. Refuelling, not that it was needed. (actually, it caused a lot of trouble; I didn\u0027t load up any oxidizer, and oxidizer tanks sit in the back; the plane lost stability.)\n\nThe kerbals were ecstatic about going home. The flight back to the orbit was uneventful.\n\n![k4jlZY2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/k4jlZY2.jpg)\n\nQuicksave before reentry. Good that I did.\n\nThe first three or so attempts ended in a disaster. The plane would flip, spin out of control and break apart.\n\nThen I got to moving fuel from rear tanks to half-empty front ones. The plane didn\u0027t lose stability. It lost the crew cabin to overheating.\n\nI began balancing frantically transferring fuel and keeping the plane flight path level, not to dive into deeper atmosphere. I succeeded getting out of flames at 30,000 only to be destroyed by them at 20,000.\n\nThen I remembered that I took four drogue chutes, to make sure my landing path is short enough. Oh well, I moved two to a separate stage, deployed them, then began moving fuel, then stabilizing flight, then... somewhere around 25,000m I lost the rudder. The whole big fin just exploded. Why this? I\u0027ll never know.\n\nI \u0022cut\u0022 the two parachutes, and without rudder, but at stable speed, 20% throttle, I began crawling to KSC. Last jump over the mountains, and trying to fit into the runway...\n\nOf course I missed the first approach. With engines roaring, I flew about the SPH building. Then another from the sea. Then from land. Then from the sea. I touched down, but moving too fast. The nose of the plane went far up for some reason, and I had to press full throttle not to flip over. Once again, mountains, once again the sea, each time either getting too late to land safely or getting some obstacles in my path.\n\nAt last I approached from the mountain side very slowly, descending really slowly too. And in the last meters, I stalled. Crash, explosions. Desperate, I was about to abandon the game, when I saw the whole front of the plane was still rolling!\n\n![0yoi9pi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0yoi9pi.jpg)\n\nSingle Stage To Orbit.

I don\u0027t have RAPIER yet.\n\n2. It has worse ISp than Poodle in vacuum. (also worse in atmosphere than Turbojet, but with the numbers taken by the jet engines, who cares?)\n\nAlso, surprisingly, Poodle is considerably lighter than RAPIER (even lighter than a turbojet!) and provides twice as much thrust in vacuum. The only actual disadvantage is its size... and not being a jet engine. The need to carry a turbojet alongside negates most of the benefits (although if you forfeit the idea of SSTO and e.g. discard 4 out of 6 turbojets as they sputter out (you REALLY don\u0027t need that much power for reentry) , that might be a little different)\n\nI guess RAPIER would be better - for the simple reason four RAPIERS would provide all the functionality of six turbojets and the Poodle, at 87% the ISp (but as I wrote, I was left with plenty of fuel on the orbit, so the 13% ISp sacrifice isn\u0027t much), and lower mass (8 tons vs 12.55 and all infrastructure to fit 6 smaller and 1 big engine). Well, it all boils down to some 1500 science points I still need to get there.\n\nAnyway, my current plan is a \u0022fully recoverable 2STO\u0022 - somewhat similar to SpaceShipOne - a \u0022carrier stage\u0022 with a bunch of jets and a Poodle (or maybe something stronger - actually Rhino\u0027s ISp is only 10s less than Poodle!) that gets the craft into \u0022almost orbit\u0022 (some 100m/s short of it), and the actual \u0022plane/shuttle\u0022 that can travel the universe and land on a landing strip (with help of 2 turbojets). The idea is that finalizing the orbit with the \u0022shuttle\u0022 should take short enough that I should still be able to bring the \u0022carrier\u0022 safely to the ground before it enters the magical 22km vanishing altitude. And the \u0022spacecraft\u0022 wouldn\u0027t carry all the oxidizer tanks around (only enough for Vernor engines), and all the dead weight of start mass."},{"CreatedByName":"GehringGame","CreatedById":145675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:55:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022fully recoverable 2STO\u0022 - somewhat similar to SpaceShipOne - a \u0022carrier stage\u0022\n\nI would be interested to see what you come up with. I\u0027ve built a couple of space planes that launch from carrier planes before, but I\u0027ve never managed to recover both stages. I usually just treat the carrier plane as a big disposable wing.\n\nMy last version (which I don\u0027t have a screenshot of) used a turbo-jet powered wing to cruise at Mach 3 at 20 km, then the small rocket plane decoupled and boosted into orbit. The problem is I didn\u0027t design the wing to fly on its own so it became unstable after decoupling and broke up from aerodynamic forces."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T01:37:40Z","Content":"It came out monstrous. It needs a lot of work yet.\n\nI got the plane to orbit. I recovered some parts of the first stage, would have more if I took more parachutes. But it was cutting it way too close. I didn\u0027t get the plane into a safe orbit before I had to switch to the stage. I switched a little too late, airbrakes failed to prevent one of the \u0022arms\u0022 breaking off. Then the plane was at 55,000km when I switched back to it; again, an aerobraking altitude. Still, the concept is sound. I just need to make the stage more lightweight, base it off Poodle again (currently, it\u0027s Mainsail) and get the turn towards orbit perfected; the moment the plane stops gaining speed horizontally and starts a very fast climb. Currently, I lose good 300m/s doing it."}]}
