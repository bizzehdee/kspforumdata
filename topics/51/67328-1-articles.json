An additional consideration was sunlight: since Sentar is so far from the sun, solar panels will barely work at all, so all modules have to be powered by batteries or RTGs. Sentar is uncharted territory, with no one (as I\u0027ve heard) ever attempting this before. I\u0027d rather not try for minimal mass on this one. First step is to build all of the modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst is the drive section. With 8 nuclear engines and weighing in at almost 200 tons, this is what will get my crew to Sentar. Or more precisely, two of them. Yep, this is going to be a big ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S6INoa0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S6INoa0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the lander. This universal lander will be used on all moons except Thud. It\u0027s relatively lightweight, has good delta-v, and has the small science modules on top. This one has solar panels since the design was already made before the mission began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XDUTFn5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XDUTFn5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XDUTFn5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait, you ask. Doesn\u0027t Sentar\u0027s moon Ringle have the same gravity as Tylo? The lander doesn\u0027t have enough delta-V! The solution: drop tanks. The parachute ones will help with the atmospheric landings on Skelton and Erin.

(Apparently Planet Factory\u0027s atmosphere info in the tracking station is wrong for Sentar). After a few \u0022simulations\u0022 run on the ship (quicksaving and quickloading), it was determined that the correct altitude was just under 110 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zYf0vJq.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022zYf0vJq.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zg2JXrc.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Zg2JXrc.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerobrake was gentle, producing no flames nor high g-forces but allowing the ship to slip into a stable orbit.
