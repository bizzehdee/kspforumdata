Below is an old favorite of mine, \u0022The Leopard and The Tree\u0022. I wrote it with a philosophical point in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contented snores of man, beast, fish, and fowl fill the jungle as the night draws on\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC CRASH! The death knell of a mighty tree resounds throughout the foliage, yet nothing stirs. The dust settles as the sun rises through the canopy, awakening an obese old leopard. Grumbling and groaning, it heaves its titanic bulk out of its den to prepare for the hunt; it rolls along, not only aware of even the slightest twitch in the underbrush, but of the significant traction that it gains by exhaling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe leopard, yellow and smelly as a fine cheese, sees a rat scurrying across the jungle, and, huffing and puffing, it gives pursuit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the rat, both terrified and disturbed, makes silent double time as it zips under the tree that had fallen that very morning. With the mouse speeding through the ever narrowing gap between the rotting timber and the forest floor, the leopard almost has a stroke as it barely squeezes its podgy hindquarters under the log. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet ere obtaining its quarry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC it halts! For by peering through the entrance to the mouse\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s burrow, it glimpses the mouse clutching its family, weeping horribly, and bemoaning its untimely death. Unable to swallow its morals and its dinner, too, the leopard departs and vows to become a vegetarian. Forever more, it sullenly eats berries, nuts, and shoots, and as it waxes nostalgic for doubly-deep fried cream of condor it cries into the vast and endless jungle with a thin and lonely voice that falls unheard as it strikes the brush:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat am I? A leopard? Yes! I have long, piercing claws, razor sharp teeth, and a coat that strikes fear into the heart of every animal in the jungle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve finally shed those pounds. Yet leopards eat meat, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve sworn it off; thus, if I am not entirely a leopard, what am I? A muskrat? No. A snake? Hardly. If I am not exactly any animal in the jungle, then perhaps I am a vegetarian leopard. Yet how can I be such an oxymoron? Vegetarian leopard? Ridiculous! It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s like saying tasty tofu or scrumptious salad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC no, I cannot define myself so. Besides, if I can say that I am a vegetarian leopard then I can also say that I am a housecat with huge teeth, claws, spots, and pressing need for anger management!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a note, Jeb, Bill \u0027n\u0027 Bob are currently stranded in orbit around the sun because I got the phase angle wrong.
