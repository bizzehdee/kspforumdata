Hardly an original idea, but I wanted to gain some experience with interplanetary journeys. I set out from Kerbin when the transfer window was nearly open, and waited a couple days in orbit getting the maneuver node correct. I got up using my standard launcher type. Basically I used my Duna Dillydallyer (which nobody knows about) which can get to duna with plenty of dV to spare. It can get into a good Laythe orbit with ~600m/s left. I have no pictures of it, but it consists of a 3-Kerb crew capsule with parachutes, an RCS system, a medium 2.5m tank with a quad-coupler on the bottom. Under the quad-coupler are four flt-400s with nukes under them for efficient interplanetary transfer. On top I slung the Space Truck MK.2 and its parachute module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI burned for Jool at the window, for about 3 minutes. Then, I was off! I had to do a tiny mid-course plane correction, but otherwise I had lots and \u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E of fuel. I aerobraked at Jool for an orbit about halfway between Jool and Laythe. Once you are in prbit, getting to Laythe from Jool is no harder than getting to the Mun from Kerbin. It is actually easier, because Laythe is bigger and has an atmosphere. I came in for another aerobrake at Laythe, then shifted my orbit to roughly circular at 70km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chose my landing zone- a large island with some wierd dark crater features. This island was called Rayrod Island, bnamed after Rayrod Kerman, the first Kerbal to ever set foot on Laythe. His one-man capsule, now a historic landmark, is on the other side of the island. Rayrod is still there, and he lives off a little garden he made.The Space Truck came down on the beach about ~50m from the water\u0027s edge. Luckily it didn\u0027t land in the water; it didn\u0027t have the RCS that other models for airless moons did. I landed at about sunset, but luckily the Space Truck is RTG-powered. I did some quick roving around before sunset, then warped to day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Mack2247/media/image.jpg3_zpsqdyjcbgz.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/image.jpg3_zpsqdyjcbgz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.jpg3_zpsqdyjcbgz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Truck flipped over wih its crew inside\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Mack2247/media/image.jpg2_zps3z7mmthn.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/image.jpg2_zps3z7mmthn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.jpg2_zps3z7mmthn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDriving at night\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Mack2247/media/image.jpg1_zpsmgv73ogn.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/image.jpg1_zpsmgv73ogn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.jpg1_zpsmgv73ogn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn awesome Laythe sunset.

You want to get a flyby that is in Jool\u0027s atmo. Not too deep, but enough where you think it will slow you into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get a rough close-ish encounter with Jool. Quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In the middle of the path to Jool, burn straight up or down on the navball to change your inclunation until you can get equitorial. Once you are happy, wuicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Time-warp to Jool\u0027s SOI. Once you are inside, quicksave and set up a maneuver node near you. Mess with the prograde and retrograde markers until you have the apoapsis you want to aerobrake with. Do not quicksave! First, test the aerobraking trajectory to make sure it works. If it does, and you get into orbit, quicksave. If not, F9. Make sure to burn at apo to lift your periapsis out of the atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now getting to Laythe from here is about as easy as getting to the Mun.

Be wise with Delta v, because you can\u0027t waste any. Use planetary transfer calculators to know when Jool and Kerbin are alined, and use Kerbal Alarm Clock so you can send multiple craft in one transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-DMSP\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
