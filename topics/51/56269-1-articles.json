Came up with the idea of making a north pole station here. There are also interesting effects when walking around it, and standing right on top of it causes a weird camera glitch where the view turns upside down. It\u0027s also cool to watch the sun go around. Amazing that the entire earth turns around one tiny spot\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T21:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo those black texture seams the precise location?
