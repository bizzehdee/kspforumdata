So, he contacted Jeb.\n\n(Bzz. bzz. bzz.)\n\n\u0022Jeb? Hello?\u0022 Jorlock said.\n\n\u0022Jeb\u0027s here, whatcha need?\u0022 Jeb said.\n\n\u0022Kerbalkind has set foot on Kerbin\u0027s two glorious Moons, why can\u0027t we go to other planets in the Kerbol System? Like.. DUNA! Duna, the intimidating, dusty, cold planet. Should be similar to the Mun, in fact. It DOES have an atmosphere though..\u0022 Jerlock rambled.\n\n\u0022Yeah, I\u0027ve wanted to goto Duna. I mean, we\u0027re mapping it with satellites, why couldn\u0027t Kerbals go there?\u0022 Jeb said.\n\n\u0022Exactly.\u0022\n\n\u0022But,\u0022 Jerlock continued, \u0022how massive will the Duna-bound rocket be? What will we bring? Rovers? Bases?\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know. But it will be big. With boosters.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sweet. I better set foot on Duna.\u0022\n\n\u0022I already have plans, Jerlock.\u0022\n\n**PART ONE: CH 2:** Let the planets align\n\nJeb quietly took in the new Pool added to the Astronaut Complex, and decided it would be a great time to run over what would be needed for a Duna trip.\n\n![20C327B7C8298F5B9EA899770B22FC9483B434E2](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/708526305125208859/20C327B7C8298F5B9EA899770B22FC9483B434E2/)\n\n\u0022Hmm..\u0022 he quietly said to himself, \u0022I\u0027ll need engines, fuel, a lander, other stuff, ehm..\u0022\n\n\u0022Maybe we can.. assemble in orbit.. but we need things to be right.. the planets to align.. simple enough\u0022\n\n\u0022HEY GUYSS!
