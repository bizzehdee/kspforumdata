Generally regarded as the most difficult of all planets to return from, the best I have done up to this point is to land a probe on the surface, as I didn\u0027t want to risk stranding a Kerbal there. \n\nOver the last few days I decided that it was about time that I overcame this particular challenge, and set about constructing a lander that was up to the task. Once the lander was built, the next step of the program was to design a mission around it. I finally decided on putting a couple of boosters on the lander to help launch it to orbit around Kerbin, and then refuelling it before sending it off to Eve. As I currently don\u0027t have a station in orbit around Eve that could be used for refuelling or to provide a return craft, I also decided to send a support vehicle that would be used to bring the pilot back to Kerbin. The lander\u0027s main engine would be used in addition to the interplanetary engines to minimise burn times for the transfer, so a refuelling rig to top up the lander at Eve before it started it\u0027s descent to the surface was the last craft to be commissioned for the venture.\n\nThis is the mission :\n\nThe Eve lander, with jumbo tank boosters, at launch from the KSC.\n\n![eve01.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve01.jpg)\n\nThe lander in LKO\n\n![eve02.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve02.jpg)\n\nOne of the refuelling rigs waiting for launch. 6 of these were required to replace the fuel used by the lander getting to LKO and a 7th was launched to go to Eve\n\n![eve03.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve03.jpg)\n\nRefuelling the lander in LKO\n\n![eve04.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve04.jpg)\n\nThe support vessel on the launch pad at KSC\n\n![eve05.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve05.jpg)\n\nThe excess fuel remaining in the last refuelling ship was transferred in to the support vessel \n\n![eve06.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve06.jpg)\n\nThe support vessel establishes an orbit at Eve\n\n![eve07.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve07.jpg)\n\nThe Eve refuelling rig approaches the lander in Eve orbit to top up the tanks\n\n![eve08.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve08.jpg)\n\nThe lander finally starts its descent\n\n![eve09.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve09.jpg)\n\nThings are all going to plan so far\n\n![eve10.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve10.jpg)\n\nHaving transferred internally from the command capsule at the top of the lander to one of the cans at the bottom, it was a relatively short step for Jeb to pop outside and plant a flag\n\n![eve11.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve11.jpg)\n\nHaving shed the boosters and supplemental tanks, the core of the lander still has a long way to go to achieve orbit\n\n![eve12.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve12.jpg)\n\nWith most of the weight of the lander now left behind, things are still looking good\n\n![eve13.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve13.jpg)\n\nThe last stage of the lander, complete with it\u0027s pilot, is just about to shut off it\u0027s engines having achieved orbit\n\n![eve14.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/eve14.jpg)\n\nA successful rendezvous and docking sees Jeb reunited with his mission support buddies.
