All components were lofted to orbit via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane and assembled there. After that, I raised the orbit to around 550k, where I refueled and sent it on its way. The craft was not suited for aerocapture, so I braked the conventional way. I dropped a probe on the shallows of Eve, then parked into Gilly orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only major issue I had was that the heaviest spaceplane I built -- to loft the booster and refueling modules -- flips out of control on re-entry, even though \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is well ahead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E empty (and with all remaining fuel pumped to the forward tanks). I was able to regain control at very low altitude and wrestle it to a near-intact splashdown, but something\u0027s clearly not right with it... or, perhaps, 1.2-pre aero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot nearly a million funds as completion reward, and will max out my tech tree what with all the science the lab is churning out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGallery:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/DgqBZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/DgqBZ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHighlights:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yoZuKtQ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022yoZuKtQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PtKrNNT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022PtKrNNT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H9dJSsZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022H9dJSsZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bLPP3Re.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022bLPP3Re.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
