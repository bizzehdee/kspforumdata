It wobbles when the engines fire but the twin snr. docking ports seem to provide enough strength to hold her together. As for efficiency, kerbal engineer suggests that an object with that mass, fuel and engine layout should have about 10000m/s of delta v (so refuelling is already planned) but I\u0027m skeptical after taking it on the first leg of its journey. Two Kerbal heroes, Scott and Kurt, were killed during construction when their ascent stage flew out of control. Though their pod successfully ejected it was hit by the spiralling lifter stage and the 2 were killed instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Pegasus left Kerbin with 8 Kerbals onboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tykshL0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tykshL0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite guzzling a ridiculous quantity of fuel our Kerbals arrived at Eve in good spirits. Unfortunately things just went wrong after that. I aimed a little high with the aerobrake and didn\u0027t achieve capture as intended. My navball glitched and seemed to be onboard a completely different ship as it just kept spinning and pointing all the wrong ways. The ship held together fine on the aerobrake but as it left the atmosphere it entered a spin, that in map mode I was unaware of due to the navball glitch. So I fired the engines unaware of the spin. Now as I\u0027ve said, the ship wobbles whenever the engines fire, with the spin it sheered one of the engine block\u0027s docking points from the tanks. Jeb managed to fly the increasingly unstable ship into a highly elliptical orbit by eye but it looks like some deep space repairs are necessary. I\u0027m not willing to rely on just one docking point. So our Kerbals are now looking forward to a 6 month stay in the Eve system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QL4XnTB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QL4XnTB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no manned Eve lander as a returnable lander would have required too many parts for my laptop to manage, it\u0027s already struggling with the 336 that the Pegasus currently has. There were however two Rovers, named for my dead Kerbals Scott and Kurt. Scott landed fine at an altitude of 1500m. Kurt suffered a parachute failure (another glitch, despite fully deployed parachutes it was still going 30m/s) and ditched in the ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F84Zv9a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F84Zv9a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing up next, a Gilly landing while our intrepid explorers await their replacement engine block.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brapness","CreatedById":73986,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T12:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it seems our Kerbals\u0027 luck isn\u0027t getting any better. Initially upon detaching the Gilly lander, I forgot to check its fuel tanks, which were empty as I hadn\u0027t disabled crossfeed. The design of both landers is such that although they have RCS ports, to cut down on weight they have no RCS tanks. Instead a tug-like probe With an RCS tank docks first with the lander and then with the front of Pegasus. So having done this and refuelled the lander I undocked again and this time the tug\u0027s docking port simply tore off - despite half a dozen successful tests of the design. Fortunately the Kerbin-Eve transfer window hasn\u0027t passed yet, so I can send a replacement tug, along with a replacement engine block.

The new engine block combines both the engines and the primary fuel tank into one piece, which made it harder to launch, but should cut down on parts and reduce flex. It is however missing the 2 large solar arrays the original had due to an oversight, so it will have to rely only on the four 1x6 arrays, until a secondary fuel tank is attached. It\u0027s here that Pegasus\u0027s design really began to shine through.

Again I surprised myself with the level of redundancy I had unwittingly incorporated into the lander design. Especially when landing on an ultralight object like Gilly or another small moon, the light lander has considerable delta-v capabilities. Orbiting Eve the wrong way proved only a minor inconvenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after the ill-fated Eve section of the tour, the much changed Pegasus is finally ready to depart. In 40 days the Moho transfer window will open and barring anymore catastrophes Pegasus will set off. The plan is for the secondary fuel tank to meet them in Moho orbit.
