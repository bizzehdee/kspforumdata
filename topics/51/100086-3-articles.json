Now THIS is the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me while playing Kerbal Space Program. (And this is from the guy who managed to ram his mapping satellite into the Statue in front of the desert Pyramid Complex...while the satellite was in orbit, and, presumably, the Statue was not. Sort of like how your spaceplane can accidentally run into the VAB while the spaceplane is way out over the end of the runway...only more so.)\n\nAnyway. These freaky things happen when I\u0027ve been playing KSP for an extended period (which used to be maybe half a day...but now may be an hour or so), and the game is apparently about the crash. But sometimes mayhem ensues first. Textures go wonky. You can hit things that aren\u0027t where they are. Controls fail to respond. Stuff like that.\n\nSo, on Duna, Aldner Kerman just returned from an exciting mission testing the DunaDog ion plane, and he was ready to get out of the ship. So I clicked EVA.\n\nSuddenly there were **TWO ALDNERS** flying off away from the ship, tumbling end over end. They bounced to a halt a distance away from the ship. Both were fine. Both claim to be Aldner. Double-U Tee Eff??\n\nI mean...transporter accidents can cause this kind of thing. But just getting out of a cockpit?\n\nThe game did indeed bug out after that, refusing to return the the Space Center. When I restarted the program -- still two Aldner Kermans.\n\nI\u0027m almost afraid to have them touch. What if they annihilate the universe? Wait...no, no...they are both standing on Duna, so neither one of them could be antimatter Aldner. Besides, if that was the case I would have expected them to fly off in opposite directions.\n\nPicture of the weirdness...not that you can tell anything from the picture. I guess I\u0027ve had enough KSP for the day.\n\n![qr3mQQ2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qr3mQQ2.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T03:48:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T04:21:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Suddenly there were **TWO ALDNERS** flying off away from the ship, tumbling end over end.

An ion-energy pulse was released, interacting with the closest organic matter of significant density: Aldner. Any number of unpredictable effects could have ensued. In this case, it seems a recombination event has occurred, with Aldner impressing his molecular structure onto nearby matter. This has resulted in, what appears to be, an exact duplicate of the Kerbonaut. Whether his complex brain chemistry was replicated perfectly has yet to be seen, but, for now, we must accept that there are two, real, Aldners.\n\n(I\u0027ve been watching WAY too much original Star Trek lately)\n\nEdit: RIP Nimoy. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T16:24:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JumpsterG**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T16:24:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I looked at the file...
