Here once a week I will publish a Journey Extraordinaire chapter which would be a part of a series of chapters. These series will (hopefully) no longer than maybe 4 to 6 chapters long. I am still using Gamelinx\u0027s planet overhaul so things will stay pretty. The collective goal of the Journeys Extraordinaire is to do everything which I haven\u0027t done before. There will be an Asteroid Station, stations around other planets, SSTOs to other planets, and many other things I haven\u0027t done yet in KSP. Below is an introduction to a couple of reoccurring characters.

My mother was tired of having raucous sons, so she vowed to name the next baby, Ally. The name must have worked because I have been accepted as the physiologist for Freedom 1, the first interplanetary mission ever!\u00A0I am so excited to be on this mission. As the Freedom 1 has a massive nuclear motor, it is likely to partial irradiate the crew. It is my job to make sure our kerbonauts don\u0027t get sick on the job and also make sure they don\u0027t suffer from too much radiation poisoning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want physical description, I am on the smaller side but my hair really does add to my height.

My name is Stable M. Kerman, *Takes a bow*, the most important crew member for this mission. I am the pilot of the Freedom 1! This was only because I am the best pilot that ever walked the flight deck. I was an ace in the Kietnam War who transferred over to the kerbonaut corps because I wanted to be the fastest kerbette alive! In this mission we will reach unbelievable speeds of up to 5 kilometers a second. 5 kilometers a second! That\u0027s travelling around Gaia in 80 seconds! Unbelievable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlly might have made a couple of rude comments about my facial features.

If any of those fails, then our mission will be terminated. So I have a heavy job on my shoulders without having to deal with two crew members which could have been chosen for better cohesion.

We just have 8 Kickbacks strapped to the side of the Freedom.

The Freedom has a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1:05 and 9,000 m/s in space. We have calculated that the exit burn to Olu\u0027um\u00A0will be roughly 1,750 m/s, then the breaking burn at Olu\u0027um will be negligible because of a gravity assist with Fume, Olu\u0027um\u0027s largest moon, will get us an easy orbit. So once we reach Olu\u0027um\u0027s orbit, we will have roughly 6,000 m/s, with 2,000 m/s for the burn back to Gaia, means we can easily visit every single moon and moonlet orbiting Olu\u0027um.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is the scientific benefit of going to Olu\u0027um.\u0022 Bill asked Ally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlly replied in a monotone voice, \u0022Olu\u0027um is a protostar orbiting at roughly Jool\u0027s orbit. We haven\u0027t ever observed a star system with both a main sequence star and a protostar. It will be our task to look at the star and the moons and moonlets orbiting it to enhance our predictions at what our solar system used to look like.

He drowned in the ice which preserved him.\u0022 Ally spoke, her eyes still wide in shock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey both stared at the limp body in the pod. Stable broke the silence, \u0022What are we going to do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlly stayed silent. Then she turned to a button on the wall. Her breath began to condense in the dropping temperatures. She hit the button. The pod made a whirling sound. Stable moved away from the pod. The cyro-pod began to freeze over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ll....we\u0027ll keep him frozen until we get back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But the extra mass...\u0022 Stable protested weakly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0026amp;#%@ the extra mass. He just died.

I\u0027ll stay in the garden module.\u0022 Ally walked through the hatch into the garden habitat. Stable floated in the now cold space. She shivered, partly with fear. She would be infamous now. She let a crew member die. She was completely and utterly responsible, at least in her eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a sigh, Stable climbed through the hatch separating the deepfreeze module from the command module. Stable sat down in the pilot\u0027s chair. She looked down at the buttons and flashing lights that covered her console.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dang it.\u0022 she muttered to herself. She breathed in deeply, calming herself. She then glanced upwards. Space stared back at her. Thousands of stars filled her small window. She could see faint nebula and even a glimpse at other galaxies. The glory of the cosmos awed her. Maybe they would be able to push through. They had to. If they failed, kerbal kind would never venture beyond Kerbol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat night was a restless night for the pair of kerbettes on the Freedom. Stable dreamed\u00A0of micro-meteorites smashing into the nuclear reactor, tearing it to bits in seconds. Ally dreamed of cold, hard, icy, white places....very similar to the poles of Gaia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that long night the two met in the command module.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have to keep going. We can\u0027t allow Bill\u0027s death to slow us down. We need to reach Olu\u0027um.\u0022 Ally punched her fist as a clarification. Ally unlocked some vault of character from Bill\u0027s death. Now instead of being timid, she changed to the opposite mentality.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright. I agree. We will both stay awake during the transit.

KSP was the first game I\u0027ve ever bought, and due to me being 11 when I bought it I didn\u0027t really know what I was doing and the only thing I could play it on a was a Windows XP laptop that got 2FPS with a 4 part rocket, so most of my KSP experience early on consisted of watching other people play the game and browsing the wiki... So I never really got that \u0022exploration\u0022 feel. I went to each and every planet knowing everything about it. BUT... Going into your planet overhaul I on purpose limited my knowledge of anything I might find, and I didn\u0027t even install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E (I might, later, though).

Even as I entered orbit I did not know how many moons Gaia had! I went to the one that looked like the Mun (again, not knowing what it was called) and saw orange spots and I was like \u0022cool, I\u0027ll check those out!\u0022 and then I got closer and realized they were oceans, maybe lava!

Its insane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re insane.\u0022 Val answered back irritated, \u0022Why do you always have to do something. You aren\u0027t coming down with hyperactivity, are you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No! Why do you call me those things?\u0022 Jeb asked surprised.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, you have literally not stopped talking. You have even talked in your sleep. You have also written at least a hundred of your terrible poems and sent them back to Kerbin. You have at least a dozen drafts of half-a-dozen novels you started and never finished. You have kept yourself busy all the time we have been gone.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething snapped inside Jeb. He strapped himself into a chair and sniffed. Val looked unconvinced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned around, tears floating in his eyes, \u0022Val. You know why I keep busy?\u0022 He didn\u0027t wait for Val to answer, \u0022Val, we are floating in a tin can, flying faster than any kerbal alive AWAY from Gaia. There\u0027s a reason its called Gaia. Its paradise. I keep busy, I try to make you and myself laugh, but I long, yes I long for Gaia. I\u0027m homesick. I know you aren\u0027t, but everything I have known and loved is back there. I just can\u0027t face it. What if we don;t come back. What if we die along with the Freedom 1\u0027s crew? What if....what if.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTears floated away from Jeb\u0027s cheeks. Val felt a tumult of emotions inside her as well. She pushed herself over to Jeb and hugged him, her eyes also filling with tears.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know, Jeb. I know I\u0027ve been a little hard on you, but that\u0027s how I dealt with the stress. I don\u0027t understand why they picked us. We literally were almost thrown out by our scores on homesickness, but they kept us on. They are testing us Jeb, lets not give in and lose. Let\u0027s live up to their expectations, shall we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded slowly, \u0022Thanks, Sis. I don\u0027t know what I would do without you.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal smiled a little, and hugged Jeb a little tighter, \u0022Same here, Bro. We...we must be each other\u0027s anchor. We must keep each other\u00A0in reality.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal released Jeb. Jeb wiped his arm across his face and then breathed in deeply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I just want to see blue again.\u0022 Jeb say cryptically.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10 days later the rendezvous burn was about to begin.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In 3!\u0022 Jeb bellowed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In 2!\u0022 Val screamed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1!\u0022 Jeb yelled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022FIRE!\u0022 Val hit the red button.

Val put a little bit of thrust towards the Freedom.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How are we going to dock to the Freedom?\u0022 She asked, \u0022We aren\u0027t receiving any contact from it. I hope nothing bad happened.\u0022 She looked over to see no Jeb. She unstrapped herself and then pushed herself over where Jeb used to sit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything looked to be in its original place. A note stuck to the wall read, \u0022I\u0027m going to greet the gals in the Freedom, which is garbage.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal took the note off the wall and shook her head. Why did Jeb attempt at rhyme in every single note he wrote? She didn\u0027t know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, Jeb was half-way to the Freedom. After a little while he grabbed onto the ladder of the command pod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe knocked on the command pod. No one answered. He moved to a greenhouse, and then bust open the door with a crowbar he brought. Everything was sucked out, but luckily no kerbals came out along with the plants. He then moved into the greenhouse and shut the door. After looking around in the dark, he found a re-pressurization button.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pushed the button and air rushed back into the greenhouse. He waited five minutes, and then unscrewed his helmet. He breathed in a massive breath. The air smelt cold and musty. The lights flickered back on. Jeb then pushed himself to a door in the wall. He opened it and then entered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe entered an old command-pod model. The Freedom was the best tech of its day, but no longer. A sleeping kerbal sat in the command pod, strapped into the captain\u0027s seat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb coughed, and then he announced, \u0022No need to fear for Jeb is here!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe waited for the results expectantly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbette shook herself and then turned to look at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything about her looked tired and exhausted. Jeb felt his heart go out to the poor crew member of the Freedom.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m Jeb, I came with the Valkyrie to come and rescue you. I just need to get the ship up and running in order to start docking.\u0022 He smiled at her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing works.\u0022 She shook her mangy hair, \u0022Nothing, electrical charge is all gone. We\u0027re running on the reserves, but we don\u0027t have nearly enough to last a few more minutes.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe spoke in a monotone voice, exhausted beyond recognition.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where\u0027s your other crew member?\u0022 Jeb asked anxiously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She\u0027s sleeping in the green house below the one you came in.\u0022 the kerbette replied in the same toneless voice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aren\u0027t you Stable Kerman?\u0022 Jeb asked, struggling to keep the conversation going.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I used to be called Stable. I used to be a pilot. Now I am just another kerbette attempting to survive in an electrical starved spacecraft. I\u0027ve been here for 7 long years, and I can hardly remember what Gaia looked like.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb felt tears coming to his eyes. Stable almost forgotten the blue skies and the rings of Gaia, and here she was still living. He would have died, rather than forget Gaia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know if I want to go there. The Freedom has been my home.\u0022 Stable slowly looked over the dimly flashing red lights covering the pair of consoles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb strapped himself into the seat next to Stable. He looked into Stable\u0027s once stunning face sadly. She once had a life outside of the space program. Now her life was in space, literary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stable, you want to go home. You want to see the blue sky of Gaia. You want to see the rings of Gaia floating above your head, ah so beautiful.\u0022 Stable stared back at Jeb, not fully comprehending the words.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Blue? What is blue? The only colors are grey, green, yellow and red.\u0022 She reached back two years in the past in her memory, and then added, \u0022and purple.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Blue is the most beautiful color in the universe.\u0022 Jeb looked around to find an example of the color. There was none.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Blue is the color of water, the color of an atmosphere.\u0022 Jeb looked into Stable\u0027s eyes, and then grinned as he said, \u0022Blue is the color of your eyes.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStable rubbed her face, and then looked in the window. Her green reflection stared back with blue eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe smiled, and then laughed, \u0022That\u0027s what blue looks like! Its....so beautiful.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemories flooded back to her. Memories of a blue planet. Memories of a blue sky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe started the cry, memories of her parents flashed before her eyes. Memories of family and friends. Memories of tearful good-byes, for she didn\u0027t know when she was coming back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stable, I\u0027m sorry.\u0022 Jeb apologized, seeing the tears in her eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whatever your name is,\u0022 Stable smiled weakly as she blinked away tears, \u0022Don\u0027t feel bad. These....these are happy tears.\u0022 A fresh burst of them gushed out of her eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled warmly, \u0022Stable. The Valkyrie is waiting to dock. We need to be orientated correctly for the docking to occur. Can you do that?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStable nodded, and then wiped her eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe set the Valkyrie as her target and then moved in with the Freedom\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Ally Kerman was in a comma in the greenhouse. Val moved her over to the freedom and put her in a medical facility on-board.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/jenliO1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jenliO1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStable watched the inert form of Ally strapped to the bed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Will she be alright?\u0022 she asked Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry Stable,\u0022 Val smiled reassuringly, \u0022Everything will be alright.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStable nodded her head and then retreated around to the other side of the cockpit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally Jeb set up a maneuver which put them on an encounter with Gaia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Val! I got it!

The reason I want you out there, is so that I have someone out there. Unfortunately, the space program has been dividing up. There are three major factions right now. My faction, which calls for space exploration on a major scale. Missions to all the planetary bodies. Then, there is Mortimer\u0027s faction which calls for extensive colonization of the Gaian \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. They will have a lot of supporters on this mission. Finally, there is a group of kerbals under Nylon Kerman who want to colonize Niebos, Telos, and Sonus. They want massive spacecraft sent to those planetary bodies in fleets to start colonization.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The problem is that there is only one launch pad, which I have personal control over. Mortimer\u00A0Kerman has control over the funds,\u00A0and Nylon over public support. We have to work together, but since our agendas are difference, there\u0027s a lot of shoving going on. I can trust you being on my side, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded slowly, \u0022Alright. I\u0027m on your side. But why not Val, she\u0027s in favor of space exploration, isn\u0027t she?\u0022 Jeb frowned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene sighed, \u0022She signed up on a roster of people who want to colonize Sonus.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked flabbergasted, \u0022Why!

The only person you can trust is me, or yourself. Understood, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb drew away a little, but replied, \u0022Understood, captain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do not call me that again. I left the military far behind me when I entered the space program. If you call me captain, I will have to call you sarg. Dismissed.\u0022 Gene turned around and faced a large screen. This screen documented all of the transfer windows in the solar system. A transfer window to Sonus approached. If Jeb got back after the Munar-5 mission before the launch, he probably would get on it. If not, then a fully Nylon-sympathetic crew would head over there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe heard Jeb\u0027s boots clomp out of the room. Jeb was his most solid contact, having been his commander in previous wars. The list didn\u0027t extend much farther beyond that. Only 5 or 6 more kerbonauts were sympathetic, and not to a point of loyalty. Gus and Werhner\u00A0were his though. That was worth something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe picked up his phone and dialed to Werhner. After a minute a heavy accent confronted him, \u0022Ah, Gene.\u0022 Werhner drawled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Werhner, I must tell you I\u0027m in a hole right now. Public opinion about exploration is dropping and the funds are becoming a little but more restricting. I need you to focus on a technology that requires exploration of all the planets.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gene, I must tell you something.\u0022 The heavy voice crawled through the phone. \u0022I might be on your side, but I will not make up ANYTHING.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not asking you to. What technologies would require visiting the non-habitable planets?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWerhner thought for a minute, and then drawled, \u0022I think.....there are hypothesizes about planetary information. We could suggest a mission to visit all of the planets in the solar system and take surface samples. I think for some of the larger planets we will have to take multiple surface samples from different biomes. It will take some time to elaborate on this theory, but expect it in the next 200 days. Good-bye Gene.\u0022 Gene put the phone down and started to pace. It looked like in two hundreds days, a lot of things were going to clash. Only the best prepared would win.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the Munar-5 mission would only occur \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E mission.

One of the main characters in it was the first flight director, and his name was Chris Kraft. I decided to name the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E after that guy.\u0022 Jeb explained.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright.\u0022 Debney Kerman shrugged his shoulders. He remembered back in the day when they were the closest of friends, only Jeb was superior in most things. Including nerve for Debney\u0027s knees knocked together as Jeb throttled the engines up while engaging the brakes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Its so that they can spool up and help us use this runway to its full capacity.\u0022 Jeb explained further.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDebney nodded his head, staring straight forward as the rumble of the whiplash engines reached fever-pitch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, Debney.

I was really stressed out with that launch.\u0022 Jeb replied. \u0022Not just with the talkative newbs. Have you heard of the....fracturing of KASA?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. It\u0027s not a big deal or anything.\u0022 Stable said hastily. \u0022Every precedes like business.

If only Val could stand with him here on the Tutor.

Do you know why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shrugged, \u0022I don\u0027t deal with stress very well. I actually hate it. For some reason, the thought of Gaia\u0027s beauty has always served as a stress reliever. Now when I\u0027m in space and under stress, I long for Gaia and that only increases my stress.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis cheeks grew a little flushed, \u0022My friends and Val have noticed that when I\u0027m stressed out, I get detached and out-of-wack with everything.
