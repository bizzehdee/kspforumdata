But Kerbal Alarm Clock reminded me that the ship for fixing the Laythe Comsats was approaching Jool and needed to be handled first...so I\u0027ll do a quickie report of that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may recall, all of the comsats in the Jool system were broken when the 0.90 MeV Beta Particle Storm hit, destroying the reaction wheel capabilities of the OKTO 2 probe cores. This mission is to refurbish the Laythe probes and deliver some replacement comsats that could potentially be moved to the other Joolian moons as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Standard Nuclear Tug carrying the comsat payload performs a plane shift burn, which happened to be very close to Jool\u0027s sphere of influence. Also built into that maneuver (planned shortly after the ship left Kerbin\u0027s SOI) were some small prograde and radial components to target the ship on a tangential intercept with Laythe that would result in aerocapture by Laythe. Note MechJeb\u0027s Landing Guidence display that shows the expected orbit after aerocapture (this was tweaked using RCS after the ship passed into Jool\u0027s SOI to give a Laythe apoapsis of 3,000 km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k28GhPr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k28GhPr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the upcoming universe of KSP 1.0, which will include aerodynamic heating effects, the question of how to get captured at the Joolian system becomes very important. In the old days, I used to aerocapture in Jool\u0027s atmosphere (rather than in Laythe\u0027s). My thinking was that when using an atmosphere to come screeching into orbit, it would be less violent to slow down over a distance of thousands of kilometers in Jool\u0027s atmosphere rather than slow down over a much shorter distance of hundreds of kilometers in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. But this turns out not to be the case, for reasons given below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you pick up more speed dropping down to Jool than just dropping down to Laythe\u0027s orbit. Second, Laythe is moving in its orbit, which increases the distance over which you are slowing down...and you only have to slow down to Laythe\u0027s orbital speed. Add to this the fact that you don\u0027t need to use additional fuel to intercept Laythe and brake into orbit (as I did after a Jool aerocapture), and aerocapture directly at Laythe becomes even more desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, to ensure minimal aerocapture heating, you need to do a couple other things. One: You want to make sure your ship\u0027s intercept trajectory with Laythe is as close to tangential to Laythe\u0027s orbit as you can make it; this minimizes the relative velocities (by quite a bit in some cases). You can do this by tweaking the prograde and radial components of your distant targeting burn (while focused on the Jool system to see the results) so that your ship will arrive at Jool when Laythe is in the correct part of its orbit. Two: Adjust your aerocapture altitude as needed to put your ship into a highly eccentric orbit around Laythe; this also minimizes to aerodynamic heating by minimizing the aerocapture delta-V. You can then use multiple aerobrakings to lower the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this depends on having a good aerobraking calculator. I use the one built into MechJeb\u0027s Landing Guidence feature, but I gather that there are aerobraking calculators online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The Comsat Refurbishment ship drops in toward Laythe. I apparently hadn\u0027t handled my plane-matching burn outside of Jool\u0027s SOI too well, since the ship is coming in from below the plane of Laythe\u0027s orbit. I not sure how I messed this up...but I apparently hadn\u0027t done the burn to match Jool\u0027s orbital plane right at the node (I don\u0027t recall if I used Kerbal Alarm Clock\u0027s opinion of where the node was, or using the marker in Map view...I should have double-checked as that burn approached).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZEKKD1p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZEKKD1p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship got as low as 26,160 km during the initial aerocapture, and the entry flames were unimpressive (as desired).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sTutO9N.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sTutO9N.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: A burn of 279 m/s was needed to align the ship\u0027s initial post-aerocapture orbit with Laythe\u0027s equator. Unfortunately, the nodes were both close to Laythe, so the burn was relatively expensive. This could have been avoided had I done a better job out in deep space matching the orbital plane of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lk5j4ip.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Lk5j4ip.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: You might notice that the Map View above doesn\u0027t show all the orbital and surface assets that I have at Laythe. This is because, for reasons of lag reduction, I do my orbital assembles in Kerbin orbit and interplanetary transfers is a separate copy of my savegame file with fewer ships (the main savegame file has over 200 active ships, landers, bases, etc., which can bog down KSP). After the Comsat Refurbishment ship got into a stable orbit at Laythem I copied and pasted it into the main savegame file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt apoapsis, a small burn of 1.4 m/s was made to lift the periapsis a little for an aerobraking pass that would drop the apoapsis near 1,000 km where the stricken comsats are located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2UQlkQ9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222UQlkQ9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the aerobraking pass, a burn of 293.2 m/s was needed at the new apoapsis to almost circularize the orbit. \u0022Almost,\u0022 because a slightly elliptical orbit was used to create an intercept with Laythe Comsat 1 upon the ship reaching its next apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KX4ulEX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KX4ulEX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0ASvYUZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220ASvYUZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the ship rendezvous with Comsat 1 in a 1,000 km circular orbit above Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6JKqrkf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226JKqrkf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor extra fun and excitement, the first thing I did to Comsat 1 was give it a bump to get it slowly tumbling. Then I backed off and changed position and then tried to dock. First I gave a few little bumps to try to minimize the tumbling...then docked. The magnetic docking force is strong with this one, being rather small in mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uAtaALL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uAtaALL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r0H8NyH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r0H8NyH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter docking, I saw that the RCS fuel was down to 79%...which seemed to indicate that I had used a lot more monopropellant than expected...though this does include monopropellant used during the interplanetary transfer targeting. But still...this seemed like a lot to have used. Maybe I forgot to top off the RCS tanks during the refurbishment of the Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NsSD1iu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NsSD1iu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... The central spire on the nose of the ship is a stack of: Jr. Docking Port - Small Reaction Wheel - Jr. Docking Port - Jr. Docking Port - Small Reaction Wheel - Jr. Docking Port...etc. The reaction wheels in that stack had been deactivated previously to keep the stack from wobbling around during maneuvers...so before the comsat was released, its new reation wheel had to be activated, and then the comsat was separated with its shiny new reaction wheel in place (and a docking port still on the end for future refurbishment, if needed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QRARFeD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QRARFeD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was off to Comsat 2 by kicking the Comsat Refurb ship in a slightly higher orbit (just its apoapsis) to wait for the next comsat to move into position for a rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ngEdEC7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ngEdEC7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remaining three comsats were still aligned Normal, and I didn\u0027t bother to bump them off kilter to force docking with a tumbling object (I\u0027d already had enough of THAT fun).

The liquid fuel and oxidizer levels in the main X200-32 tank was just below 13%...but the two FL-T400 tanks on the nuclear engine nacelles are full, which is enough fuel to return the Tug to Kerbin for re-use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p5hblSY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p5hblSY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe eight replacement comsats around the centra Comsat Bus core can be used later to replace the disabled comsats around Vall, Tylo, Bop, and/or Pol (as needed by future missions).

I can try to explain if you can explain what you\u0027re asking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a very early mission, I sent Jeb, Bob, and Bill to Jool, and I didn\u0027t think they had enough fuel to return (I wonder now whether or not they did, if I was clever with orbital dynamics). So, they attempted landings on Jool, and were all lost. Mysteriously, they all showed up again later at the KSC. They claimed that they had enough fuel to return after all, and that they never tried landing on Jool. Others think maybe the mission was a hoax shot in a film studio...but we aren\u0027t allowed to discuss hoaxes on the KSP forums, so that\u0027s all I\u0027ll say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also use Jeb during very dangerous test flights of vehicles. Again, because of his mysterious ability to return after a seemingly deadly crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also had several other kerbals killed by game bugs...but I revert using F9 in those cases. For example, terrain glitch explosions vaporized Thompbles and Kurt many many times when they were exploring the surface of Pol. But I didn\u0027t hold that against them. And Ludger and Bobgan have crashed several times recently when they were bringing the Passenger Pigeon in for a landing from the east at KSC...when a mysterious \u0022collision with the VAB\u0022 sheared wings off of their plane on final approach (they were not near the VAB). But I didn\u0027t hold that against them. Reloading the game cleared that collision mesh bug and they could land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack when I first tried to make aircraft in KSC, I smeared MANY kerbals across the landscape (mostly Jeb, now that I think about it)...but those were all reverted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdn certainly back during my first Mun landing attempts (in the old demo and in version 0.17), I crashed a lot of kerbals on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut recently, I learn to do dangerous things (such as landing on Tylo) by practicing during \u0022engineering simulations\u0022 before attempting the Real Thing in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T19:08:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T19:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour plane shift, or should i say plane sh**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso thanks for telling me your deatcount.

The BirdDog can still fly at KSC, but it\u0027s not balanced well (needs to have its CoM and CoL positions tweaked). Also, the severe hammering the Basic Jet engine received means that it won\u0027t be able to go as high or fast, and the higher fuel consumption rate will reduce its range. Also, I worry about how well it can drive around on the ground as a rover now because solar cells now obey 1/r\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, so power for the wheels will be much more limited out in the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t expect the original Laythe SSTO (based on jet engines) to be able to make orbit...but the RASSTO version might because it\u0027s built around RAPIERs. The little STUBBY SSTO rocket (also jet power) will be useless in reaching orbit as well. I expect the LadyHawk spaceplane (Turbojet) won\u0027t stand a chance to reach orbit, and the Raptor RAPIER version of the spaceplane is probably too draggy to get through the sound barrier. I read a post that said that scoop intakes no longer work as flotation devices...in which case anybody flying the Mallard will be in for a rude shock if he tries to land on water. Also, the Turbojet Mallard isn\u0027t going to be accidentally going into orbit anymore.
