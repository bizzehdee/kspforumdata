But from what our science has returned on this mission, it appears that magic will not work beyond Earth\u0027s sphere of influence, that it is, indeed, tied to the \u0022pool\u0022 around Earth, and cannot be utilized outside of it. It, like an electromagnetic or gravitational field, asymptotically approaches zero with increased distance. So Ambriana was able to use it very weakly to inspect the object, but using magic much further than the moon will prove impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is sure to blow a crutch out from under the Equestrians.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are now announcing a full-scale effort to go to Mars, for the glory and advancement of all Terrestrial life!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will investigate whether we need nuclear engines for this or not.
