The game is about exploration but eventually all the blank spaces on the map get filled in, although some \u0022Here there be Krakens\u0022 warnings might remain. The purpose of exploration is to pave the way for expansion but 2 things nip that in the bud. First, there\u0027s nothing really in the game for the expansion phase. Sure, we can plunk down clusters of low-rent housing but this is really no different from landing any other ship and the housing units do nothing but sit there. And second, such things count as \u0022ships in flight\u0022 against whatever total your computer and the game itself can handle, which ain\u0027t really that much, so any such colonies you create eventually start getting in the way of further \u0022happening\u0022 things, like more exploration and building other \u0022colonies\u0022.

So, as much as possible, I wanted to do things with reusable vehicles (including the somewhat tedious need to send tugs home for re-use, rather than just popping a new ship up on the screen every time). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to do things on a reasonably small scale (not just build a gigantic beastie of a ship and immediately haul out tons and tons of anything you might want). So my kerbals made do with a little equipment at first (they drove as much as possible rather than flew, because that\u0027s cheaper; they had to make do without backup vehicles at first, so they had to be slow and careful about what they tried to accomplish). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted them to do things in a reasonable timeline. So there would be no, \u0022Oops, Bill got stranded\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6well, let\u0027s place everything into suspended animation while we send a rescue ship out from Kerbin,\u0022 kind of thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was to build up the infrastructure over time, sending out as many kinds of ships as I could think of that would be useful on Laythe (the exception being a VTOL airplane for landing on water, since I have a bad habit of breaking those when I try to land/takeoff from water\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and I wanted ships I could use reliably).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to explore all of the islands, at least minimally (which I have basically done by now). And I wanted to do it in a way that would be justifiable in the context of the storyline (so, for example, while I always wanted to send someone to North Fredoly to look for Fredoly Kerman\u0027s landing site, I waited until I had a good reason to do so in the game. I did jump the gun with a dream excursion to Bsalis Island to do the Leap of Laythe, but I also got there \u0027legitimately\u0027 eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started this mission back in version 0.18, it was also my expectation that I would be exploiting indigenous resources, and having this first group of kerbals set up that infrastructure as well. I expected this would require missions to Vall and other of the Joolian moons to get what was needed, depending on how Squad\u0027s resource system worked. But that never materialized, so I did without (which mostly involved sending more fuel, and making sure the ships were designed with the notion that their fuel supply was in orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also liked the challenge of keeping the mission running through multiple versions of KSP. This involved finding workarounds to various problems (like the original upgraded landing legs). It also involved thinking up ways to incorporate new parts and perhaps retrofit them to existing hardware (and while I enjoyed finding a way to put Goo on the BirdDogs, I\u0027m not particularly interested in doing the missions I probably should with them, like sending Nelemy to the North pole with his Goo buddies, or sending Kurt to the top of a mountain with the materials bay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and I expect you would agree that would be just more flying around). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when we got cool new toys like RAPIER engines to play with, I wanted to try a comparison between ramjet and RAPIER powered SSTO spaceplanes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6so why not do it on Laythe with my kerbals there? Certainly those are items on the list of potentially useful hardware that should be on Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though there was no need to go there for resources, I did the Vall exploration mission anyway. And I used female kerbals because some people on the forum seemed to think female kerbals would be a pox upon the kerbal universe and should never be added to the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and I wanted to show that they can be competent, entertaining little kerbals just like the boys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar flare was added as a mechanism to get Hellou and Emilynn to Laythe, and to stretch out the mission in general to appease the people who were enjoying the antics of my band of explorers. And once you have a geologist on Laythe, it makes sense to put her to good use for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway... Sending replacements and rotating the old crew out has always been part of the plan. And although I intend to increase the number of kerbals on Laythe (and elsewhere in the Joolian system), I don\u0027t think we\u0027re anywhere near the point where we try to make a colony, yet. There need to be some serious experiments done with growing plants on Laythe before that\u0027s possible\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6but I expect future crews on Laythe will include focusing on that (but I really don\u0027t intend to follow the future crews in detail).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exit strategy for the current crew will involve going out via the outer moons. I\u0027ve been working on the necessary ships, but Tylo has been giving me some problems. The Tylo lander/ascent ship I used during my initial Kerbol system exploration program was bigger and clumsier than need be\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6but trying to make a reusable Tylo SSTO is difficult to justify if one can send out an additional small disposable lander/ascent ship for the weight of extra fuel a big SSTO would require (it would be a different story if we had exploitable resources, of course). And I find it much harder to land on Tylo than on Laythe (with is very safe and easy in comparison). I need to develop a system where I have a good chance of success without killing my happy little kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, yes, Scotius\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 if all the kerbalnauts who are anxious to go on long space missions all pile into the Joolian system when that opportunity arises (after an all-clear from the threat of more solar flares), then when the mission to set up an exploration infrastructure on Duna comes along, who might be available as crew? (This is why I mentioned the lack of much having been done on Duna...yet...because of the kerbal\u0027s fixation on the Joolian system.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-24T03:07:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2014 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T12:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfull\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfull\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit seems that lately this has just been about Kerbals flying around Laythe\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that exploring the islands of Laythe by air is so much fun!

For example, since there are two \u0027Kethane Converters\u0027 in the pack...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Modify the large converter to have two outputs rather than four.

Less energy intensive but takes considerable time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Modify the small converter to make monopropellant using Kethane as a catalyst with water (is it possible to make the converters only work when they are in water? I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027d need to check the CFGs for that. I know it\u0027s possible in KSPI\u0027s system). IE, park your ship with a small converter just off from a beach, fill the kethane tanks, then make monopropellant. I\u0027d say this would also be slow, but less energy intensive compared to standard Kethane, but I\u0027m no chemist so might want some fiddling to get to feel right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the components would be fine for you, and I believe you can define locations of deposits manually via CFG to match your map too... except they don\u0027t increase in level the closer to the center you get.
