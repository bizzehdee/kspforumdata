The speeds he was talking about reaching while still in the atmo seemed unthinkable, some even stated that they thought he\u0027d become \u0022a little too ambitious\u0022. \u0022These engines have never been tested\u0022 they argued. Jeb reminded them that it had been a unanimous decision to cut funding from the wind tunnel project and put the money towards refurbishing the staff complex and getting those lovely leather chairs and pool table (the only one of its kind on all of Kerbin). The only way to test an engine was to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs these engines had not yet been tested he did agree that before he could use them to design a Mun capable craft he needed to test them with a simple flight to LKO and back.

Previous craft had to climb at a steady 45 degrees to punch their way out of the thicker atmo before switching to rocket engines to accelerate to orbital speeds. This had worked but required much more of the heavier rocket fuel to achieve orbit. With these new jets the Sprinter could level out at around 15km and then gain a much higher horizontal speeds and it\u0027s advanced intakes allowed it to carry on using its jet engines higher into the upper atmo. This approach required far less rocket fuel, by the time Jeb had to switch to the rocket engines he was already going at 1500ms at an alt of 25km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/sEMNLgi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sEMNLgim.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sEMNLgim.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Cr9Pvqs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cr9Pvqsm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cr9Pvqsm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom take off it took less than 4 minutes for the Sprinter to raise its Ap to 100km and in just under 10 minutes Jeb was once again orbiting Kerbin with a smug grin stretched across his face.

The investigation that later followed would regard this as being the point at which problems began, although at the time it wasn\u0027t apparent that anything was wrong. Perhaps if he\u0027d maintained a higher orbit then everything would have been ok, but he was determined to orbit under 40km to get closer EVA reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe completed several orbits, getting out periodically to take pictures of the different landscapes below him and started to assign names to them. One site in particular caught his attention, a wide and otherwise unremarkable crater located on the east side near the equator. It seemed flatter than the others and although he couldn\u0027t be certain Jeb was sure that at it\u0027s northern most point he could see something which glinted in the light. A strange rock formation? A structure?! He noted it as anomaly 1 and vowed to return to investigate it further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn his final orbit he was treated to a stunning solar eclipse. To a kerbal a solar eclipse is nothing special, they see them about once a month on Kerbin, but this was the first time anyone had seen the Sun being eclipsed by Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/otJmxEt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/otJmxEtl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022otJmxEtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZAVrE6x\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZAVrE6xl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZAVrE6xl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally it was time to depart and he fired up the 909\u0027s to begin the transfer home. He was so full of wonder from what he\u0027d seen that his attention was not on his instruments. His thoughts where suddenly interrupted by the deafening silence of his engines cutting out. He was out of fuel!! He\u0027d made escape velocity from Mun, but was still a couple 100km out from being able to return home. What was he to do? Was this his fate, to drift forever? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe thought about his options for a short while. There was no hope of a rescue mission, all the space faring craft where single seaters and they hadn\u0027t as yet designed any craft that could fly unmanned. And even if he was rescued all the science that he\u0027d just gained would be lost. In the end he resolved to go EVA and see what he could do. With just his little jet pack he started to push against the rear of his stricken craft, desperately attempting to nudge it\u0027s orbit closer to Kerbin. It was slow progress and time wasn\u0027t on his side. Each passing second took him further from the optimal burn point meaning he\u0027d have to exert more and more force. Without any display of heading in his space suit he had to alternate between pushing the craft and climbing back on board to check his position and restock the suits oxygen supplies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FodW1Sl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FodW1Slh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FodW1Slh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter what seemed like an eternity he managed to lower the Pe so it just clipped the upper atmo of Kerbin but he was still a long way from being safely home. With the Pe at 68km the aerobraking effects would not be enough to de-orbit him. He\u0027d have to make several passes though Kerbins atmo and he realised that if it took more than 3 orbits he stood a high chance of re-encountering Mun and being pulled uncontrollably to her surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he hovered in space, his goal seem infuriatingly close but at the same time impossibly far away.

He first had to do some re-wiring so the thrusters didn\u0027t fire as the cockpit disconnected and then he needed to fire just 1 or 2 of them at the right moment. Being dedicated to the scientific cause he first transmitted the data from the experiments attached to the main craft and then pulled the release lever and broke free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/mPcmFiy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mPcmFiyl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mPcmFiyl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/6MXPvgb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6MXPvgbl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226MXPvgbl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow came the tricky part. He had to use the single thruster which normally would push the cockpit up during an emergency eject and this was angled at 90 degrees from the cockpits orientation.

Jeb knew that this has simply exchanged his fate from drifting forever to being incinerated by a overly steep re-entry.

He wriggled around to try and get out of this uncomfortable position but there wasn\u0027t much room to move with all these control panels and lights blinking urgently at him.

The controls become extremely sluggish and he had to fight to keep it steady as he attempted to make an emergency landing. With everything taking longer to respond the control of the air-breathing engines became impossible to manage and he dropped out of the sky much too fast.

Such a craft has yet to be built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealising that Kerbin could be as dangerous a place as anywhere in space Jeb refocused on his primary goal of space travel.
