I moved back home and started looking for work and for a while I was unsuccessful. Around the time of the 0.24 update I had a couple of really promising job opportunities that didn\u0027t pan out and kind of fell into a bit of a depression, and lost the urge to play KSP for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn September 2014 I got a job offer, at long last, with the company I had interned at earlier (in 2012-13), which necessitated moving out west in November to start work. Yay! Depression went away but still no time for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn November/December I move west and start work. Living in a new city in my own apartment that I had to furnish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had mostly given up on continuing this again because I felt too much time had gone by and that I\u0027d never get back into it again, but today I decided to stop by and see what\u0027s up, and was surprised people had bumped my thread as recently as December, so it seems like there still might be some interest. So, should I continue? I\u0027ve upgraded computers since then, I\u0027d have to see if I\u0027ve properly saved everything and then check to make sure all my mods are up to date and everything....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDON\u0027T DIE ON ME NOW!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCONTINUE THE STORY!!!!!
