In the KERBAL X! flying through cosmos and cosmos in a distant galaxy...Not really just about 2000 Lightyears away. The kerbals after a few game hours they\u0027ve finally landed on the mun.

Once we re-entered we got a perfect landing, Surprisingly, RIGHT AT KSC BY THE LAUNCHPAD. I wasen\u0027t even planning on aiming there. I was thinking heh its a landing. But as chance would have it i landed right by the launchpad. In my mind i heard the Kerbal Space Center Mission Control\u0027s shouts and laughter at the accomplishment! Then the 3 kerbals emerged...From the capsule. Mission success.
