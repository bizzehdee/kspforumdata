In the end, it was settled upon a helping had with science and research. This help came in outright theft of ancient US documents of early rocketry research. With this data securely inside their compound, the BEARS got to work. Within a few week, their first craft had been deign and built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChristened the Mk 1, these early engineers knew that imaginative names would go down the sink. These rockets would not be remembered. Yet these early sounders where important in gathering important scientific data. Their first rocket, would also, however, be manned.
