This was my first attempt to launch parts of a station using a shuttle type craft and complete the construction in low Kerbin orbit.\n\nThe shuttle was enjoyable to fabricate. Finding a solution to lift the cargo and safely return was at times hilarious. There was sixteen launches to furnish the stage with props.\n\n Each piece of the station has function as well as form. To imitate the image all the while the station is built up from parts that have a reason to be attached.\n\n**Image Diary**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Keeping everything lined up is next up. \n\nThe four main components for the shot will be placed on a rail so minor adjustments can be made to each item. As well the correct perspective will also have to be found. \n\n The idea to directly edit the save file or photoshop was mentioned but that is deemed as bad kerbal behavior.\n\n **** \n\n**Line Float**\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/video/130656639\u0022 width=\u00221280\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 title=\u0022LineFloat\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nDesigning, launching and constructing the rail has had loads of entertainment value as well as refinement in vessel rendezvous and docking. The rail is to be disconnected and thrusted out of the shot. Once all is ready the picture will be taken.\n\nFound it! I misplaced the save file after upgrading to 1.0.4 and thought it was lost.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T22:22:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"}]}
