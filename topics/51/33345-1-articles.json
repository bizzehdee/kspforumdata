Probe is equipped with a Poodle engine and enough fuel for about 30 seconds of flight. After sufficient data and pictures have been taken, the probe is to attempt to lift off and fly as high as it can at terminal velocity in order to gain more understanding about what sort of conditions are experienced during Eve ascent attempts. When engine burnout occurs, deploy a second stage of parachutes and land back onto the surface of Eve, providing a permanent observation outpost and marker for a possible future landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunches\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st launch: Fuel tank assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd launch: Probe Payload docked to fuel tank assembly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd launch: Nuclear engine module attached to fuel tank/probe assembly, forming the craft to transit to Eve.

The drogue chutes were deployed at 10km altitude. However, when the chutes fully deployed at around 4km altitude, the resulting force snapped the main fuel tank/engine/lander assembly off of the probe body, which remained attached to the parachute assembly. The battery was ripped off of the probe, so the electrical charge drained faster than I could deploy the solar panels, which were left intact on the parachute assembly. The probe was dead before it hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/vonjager/KSP%20Eve%20Mission/screenshot87_zpsc1a751d5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot87_zpsc1a751d5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe impacts the surface of Eve, dead as a doornail and upside down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/vonjager/KSP%20Eve%20Mission/screenshot88_zps3c7d1862.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot88_zps3c7d1862.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven strong and thorough use of struts throughout the probe body did not keep the craft from separating. The main chutes never had a chance to deploy, with the drogue chutes seeming more than capable of slowing the craft down. Probe failure due to high G forces experienced during drogue chute deployment.
