After taking seats in a new rover, they decoupled and proceeded to land on Duna. The landing was nearly uneventful, except for the rear wheels breaking upon landing. Obemy was able to fix those pretty quick while also planting the starter flag.\n\nAs with Ike, the mission director was convinced (by one of his other mission director buddies) do also do Duna via polar route. So the crew set off mostly straight north, but wandered a bit to the east to catch a glimpse of one of the massive craters north east of the landing site.\n\nJulella describes Duna as quite hilly, which most of you probably already know. If you ever decide to do this challenge with a similar rover, it was very much like doing a Baja through the desert. Except it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a really, really, (really) long desert. For the most part the terrain seemed smooth (through the mesh transitions) with only an occasional rover flipping fold in the terrain. The transition to the ice cap is also pretty neat, with some very unusual terrain. There are even some valleys along the way. It was actually quite fun trying to decide which way to twist and turn through (or over) the dunes.\n\nThat is, until the crew arrived at (or maybe we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just say near) the North Pole. Not the whole snowy polar area, mind you...just the terrain right at the pole. There are some seriously bad things Obemy wants to say about the North Pole, but I told him to keep those to himself (as momma always says, if you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t say something nice...). Julella\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s theory is that there is some elf magic up there keeping kerbals out of a secret workshop. In any case, the North Pole was like some sort of rover-impervious fortress from the Kraken realm. Julella drove as slowly and as far as she could along one of the radial ridges, but after constant flat tires, crashes, and random flipping, she simply turned around and backed out. (The terrain starts to turn into sharply angled triangles.) Also, it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wholly obvious to the crew before they arrived near the North Pole, but even if they could get to the pole itself, the sheer radial cliffs make it impassible by rover anyway.\n\n\u003E ![Yga3Eou.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yga3Eou.jpg)\n\nSo the mission director didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tell the crew how long, but it took a heck of a long time to get around the pole. Running south along the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cback side\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of Duna was actually quite pleasant, or maybe it just felt that way after doing the North Pole. I think I went several hours before experiencing any blown tires, and even those were from being stupidly aggressive. The South Pole...well, I was hoping for it to be different than the North. In all, it actually took me several days of play time to get through/around the near pole areas. Several times it was bad enough that I quit playing early that night due to frustration. I guess as rugged as my rover is, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just not well suited for dealing with the shattered terrain that exists at the poles of Duna.\n\nAs with the Ike post, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m just going to post one the route and one of Duna here, and you can peruse the rest of the album if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re interested.\n\n\u003E ![8ir5Dob.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8ir5Dob.jpg)\n\n![l5MLkNj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/l5MLkNj.jpg)\n\nFor the most part, the route is straight north from the landing site, and nearly straight south around the back side of Duna. I took a few side trips to check out some of the larger craters, and to follow the numerous gentle valleys that grace the landscape.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Gtg8F)\n\nRover Status: At the end of the trip, the rover lost two of its three reaction wheels, a probe core, both lights, and the two top most solar panels. These parts are on the upper half of the vehicle and, for the most part, the lower half parts survived well. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s due to the differences in the terrain, or if the rover adjustments actually did some good. Most of the damage the rover took was when it flipped over and landed on its back or tail, so I think further adjustments might be made to strengthen the top.\n\nWhile I would choose to do another polar route on Ike, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think anyone could pay me enough to do a polar Duna route again. It was interesting to see the poles (I hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t before), but came with a hefty price.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T14:23:33Z","Content":"What\u0027s the terrain like?

It\u0027s not exactly like Minmus though. Minmus has much more flatness to it, with some steep drops. Whereas Duna is more \u0022rolling\u0022 hills. I didn\u0027t really \u0022catch\u0022 on the terrain as much as what seemed to happen on Mun.\n\nThe polar route was really only painful because of the poles themselves. The pole was pretty much impassible by rover (at least by my rover), because there was no way to climb the vertical.

I actually did this trip a bit over a month ago, but 1.0.5 sort of stalled out my posting (then I completely forgot).\n\nAs it turns out, I even wrote up the post (about a month ago). I just never got around to editing and uploading pictures. To kickstart myself, I\u0027m going to post the transition pictures, and my month-old writeup:\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n**Dres Transition**\n\nThe mission director wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even thinking about Dres until the crew was nearly done with Duna (probably for good reason). He had actually started thinking ahead to Jool and how difficult Tylo is likely to be. But when studying the solar map, the mission director realized that the crew on Duna was smack in the middle of a transfer window from Duna to Dres.\n\nThe Duna Mothership is already carrying two spare rovers for Duna. One rover is parachute capable only, but the second has roughly 1200 dV (more than enough to land on Dres). Also, the Mothership is carrying excess dV. The only real problem here is that there are only two recovery vehicles, both of which have been spent on Duna and Ike.\n\nAfter looking at transfer windows from Duna to Kerbin, then out to Dres, the Mission Director decided to try a new approach. The transfer window from Duna to Dres is open now, so the crew will do a more optimal style transfer directly from Duna. The window for Kerbin to Dres doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t open for some time. However, since only a small recovery vehicle is needed, the Mission Director gave the go-ahead to send a small crew recovery vehicle on an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cout of window\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 high-dV transfer to Dres. While this will be more expensive, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s better than the alternative of waiting a couple years to transfer the Mothership to Kerbin, then wait a couple more years to transfer it back out to Dres.\n\nWith that decision, the Elcano crew began immediate preparations to transfer to Dres. They sent the spare parachuted rover and remnants of the recovery vehicle on a burn-up reentry back into Duna. Julella plotted a course while Obemy warmed up the nuclear engines.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Kerbin, the KSC crew cobbled together a recovery vehicle using existing designs. When the news media asked how the engineers were going to get the recovery vehicle there so quickly, a KSC engineer was quoted as saying, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmore boosters.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n![E5SIY8Q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/E5SIY8Q.jpg)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhoosh\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is about the only thing that seems appropriate here. When asked if this was overkill, a KSC engineer was quoted as saying, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYep, it sure is.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nHere\u0027s the rest of the transition, but not the Dres Elcano.

The mission certainly started off in an exciting way, since the Mission Director decided last minute. The extra recovery vehicle was basically shot directly at Dres, but will still take some time to arrive. In the meantime, the crew enjoyed some rest in the comfort of the Mothership while waiting for the recovery vehicle to arrive. There was no need to sit on the surface waiting when they could wait up here and head down to Dres after the recovery vehicle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s arrival.\n\nThe descent was pretty uneventful, considering the lander had excess thrust and fuel for the job. However, after landing, the real fun began.\n\nIt took several days of driving about near the landing zone. Turns out there\u0027s some sort of terrain kraken hiding around on Dres. Any time I got around 1200m, the rover would sometimes spontaneously blow up as if hitting a wall. The F3 log reports \u0022crashing into terrain,\u0022 except that nearly the whole rover would vaporize. Sometimes there were only wheels left, sometimes only the rover\u0027s engine core. It wasn\u0027t even tied to terrain tile seams. I\u0027m not really sure what it was, but it cause a drastic change in routing near the beginning of the mission. I was planning on an equatorial route, but couldn\u0027t get more than about 2km east of the landing zone before blowing apart. As it was, it took me nearly two days to find my way out of the mine field.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/GId4E/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHowever, after that, the trip was relatively uneventful. It was actually really fun to drive on Dres, after I got over the initial (and extreme) frustration. Also, turns out the poles aren\u0027t anywhere near as messy as Duna. The south pole is also home to a nice canal in the polar area. I would definitely not recommend driving on Dres at night. The terrain is quite dark, and when the sun goes down it\u0027s pretty much a black hole.\n\nAnyway, took me long enough to get around to posting this, so it\u0027s not a particularly clever post. Thanks for tuning in!\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T03:19:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m still reading these."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T07:40:07Z","Content":"Oh dear. I see that I have some post editing ahead of me.\n\nIn the mean time, I also have a new announcement...\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n*The fine line between inspiration and insanity has been completely erased.*\n\nJoolCano 5?\n\nThe mission director\u2019s ego must be swelling bigger than his own head. Given the recent success on Duna and Dres, the mission director has decided to go ahead and build another Mothership style design to Elcano around the Joolian System.\n\n* * *\n\nWell, I\u2019m not quite sure what to call this. I don\u2019t know if this was a flash of inspiration or if I\u2019ve utterly lost my mind with the whole rover driving thing. Dres had some rather infuriating moments, so I\u2019m not entirely sure what I\u2019m thinking here. I suppose I wanted to have another grand adventure, and the Elcano missions always seem to end up with a bit of interesting quirk. As many Elcano travelers know, many hours are spent with absolutely nothing going on. However, there are some interesting bits along the way, and some neat pictures that come out of it.\n\nAnd after all...as Fengist says...it\u2019s all about the adventure.\n\nSo with that, I started looking toward the next Elcano mission. The one big thing I realized about Elcano is that I\u2019m doing and seeing things in KSP that I haven\u2019t done before. So I took a look at the Jool system and started mapping out what was left to explore. I\u2019ve been to Laythe a few times and already circumnavigated it, but sadly, I\u2019ve not even been to Pol or Bop and have only been to Vall and Tylo maybe once. (It just takes so darn long to get to and around Jool.)\n\nSo I thought maybe I\u2019d try to do something really ambitious. It seemed like it might be a fitting time to try to tie in the Jool 5 Challenge to what I was already planning. There is only one major problem to this plan. The crew has already circumnavigated Laythe. And while that trip was quite straight forward (relatively speaking), it doesn\u2019t fit the Jool 5 criteria if the crew skips Laythe on this trip. So perhaps, instead, the crew can prove that La Cucaracha is capable of making the trip with the Jool Mothership and landing on Laythe, along with a recovery vehicle, that will fit the bill.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the mission director realizes how much insanity salsa he\u2019s eating, to think of the \u201CJool 5 Challenge\u201D as some sort of subset to this maniacal plan he is inflicting upon the crew.\n\nAnd then the engineers realize that although the Duna Mothership was built to be mostly reusable, it probably isn\u2019t going to be capable of hauling a full Joolian mission...at least not in its current configuration.\n\nSo my initial look at dV requirements for Jool came from looking straight at the standard dV map. Though I know this is really rough, I needed to start with a vague idea of the requirements before starting anything else.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![8jGWLCg.png](http://i.imgur.com/8jGWLCg.png)\n\nJool \u2013 Intx: 1930, Orbit: 160 (Elliptical Orbit)\n\nLaythe \u2013 Intx/Orbit: 930 \u002B 100, Crew: 100 \u002B 2900, Boat: 100, Return: 2000, Total: 6130\n\nTylo \u2013 Intx/Orbit: 1500, Crew: 2270 \u002B 2270, Rover: 2270, Return: 1500, Total: 9810\n\nVall \u2013 Intx/Orbit: 1530, Crew: 900 \u002B 900, Rover: 900, Return: 1530, Total: 5730\n\nPol \u2013 Intx/Orbit: 980, Crew: 130 \u002B 130, Rover: 130, Return: 980, Total: 2350\n\nBop \u2013 Intx/Orbit: 1120, Crew: 220 \u002B 220, Rover: 220, Return: 1120, Total: 2900\n\nReturn \u2013 Intx: 1930 \u002B Exit SOI \u002B LKO Capture\n\n(Note: During further analysis, I found out just how far off these numbers are...but it was a start.)\n\nThe initial thought is to leave a mothership in orbit around Jool, and create a single lander that the crew can reuse. Hopefully this will cut down on the overall requirements, at the cost of having to design an \u201Call in wonder\u201D lander. So from there, engineers started doing some analysis on exactly what the Jool-SOI fuel requirements would be for transferring around between the mothership and all the stops. The worst case transfer was either going to be Laythe or Tylo. Laythe because it would require a boat (which will be much heavier than the rovers), or Tylo because of the gravity and size of the lander needed to put down a rover and recover a crew.\n\nAll-in-all, the Tylo lander was estimated at about 5 tons for the crew vehicle and 8 tons for the rover lander. The Laythe boat is a huge unknown (due to the changes in 1.0.5), so they left that alone for the time being. (I actually started working out the basics of this plan before 1.0.5 came out, but based on announcements, I knew La Cucaracha would no longer work.)\n\nThe engineers actually sketched out a single-lander design that would work on Laythe and Tylo, while potentially delivering a rover to Tylo at the same time. Turns out this created a rather massive lander, needed lots of fuel to get around Jool, a high TWR for landing, and still be relatively low drag to get off of Laythe. Overall estimate for fuel requirements alone for the mission portion of the JoolCano5 was about 46 tons!\n\n![IGgivtJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IGgivtJ.jpg)\n\nOver 26 tons. Talk about overkill...\n\nSorry, not a lot of exciting pictures here, but I wanted to lay out the plan so you can pick at how ridiculous I\u2019m being. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) (Also, I\u2019m posting the Jool 5 and Elcano rules here for my reference.) My JoolCano5 is actually underway. But much like my first postings, the mission reports are lagging a bit.\n\nSpoiler\n\nCHALLENGE RULES\n\nGiven the scale of this challenge, everyone who completes the mission successfully gets a spot in the hall of fame.\n\n1. No cheating, including alt-f12, HyperEdit, or config file editing.  \n\n2. No part-clipping of functional parts (fuel tanks, batteries, crew pods, engines, science parts, SAS) into each other. It is okay to clip structural and non-functional parts.  \n\n3. You are allowed to edit science points and funds into a new save to have enough money and parts to complete the mission.  \n\n4. Any number of launches are allowed to assemble the ship in Kerbin orbit. All launches must be flown, no HyperEdit!  \n\n5. There\u0027s funding for one main ship only so all the crew, lander(s) and other stuff has to go to Jool as one big ship.  \n\n6. Kerbals must be in a pod or cabin (no seats) for the interplanetary journey. Seats are okay for landing and flying within the Jool system.  \n\n7. One refueling mission is allowed in the Jool system if you run out of fuel on any levels except ISRU. The refueling mission can only transfer resources, not parts, to your Jool 5 craft. This mission must actually be flown!  \n\n8. On all of the landings, the Kerbal must be able to get out and walk (or swim!) around on the surface.  \n\n9. Use at least 100% reentry heating and at most 100% science rewards, AKA Normal mode or harder. Also, don\u0027t use any science increasing strategies.  \n\n10. All the Kerbals have to arrive back to Kerbin surface at the end of the mission, happy and alive. You are allowed to either send up a craft to get them from LKO or just land the crew pod(s) from your main ship.\n\n11. Mods: All mods listed in green are cleared for takeoff. All mods listed in red are prohibited. Any mod not on this list is prohibited until you ask if it can be allowed.\n\nENTRY SUBMISSION RULES  \n12. Submit your challenge as an imgur album, with good captions and descriptions, as a video or series of videos, or as a thread in Mission Reports.  \n13. Pictures or it didn\u0027t happen! Please keep the resources tab open, as well as show the informative windows from Mechjeb or KER if you use them. Take a picture of every important moment, including transfers, dockings, landings, stagings, and refuelings. Alternatively, video submissions are a great way to show everyone your mission as well. These will help the peer reviewers and future participants to see exactly how you accomplished each part!  \n14. If you just barely did something (like landing on Tylo with a low TWR, for example) then post more pictures about that heroic part of the mission so everybody can be sure it really happened as you say! If it is really improbable I may ask for your craft file to test it.  \n16. If you finished the mission, please post information and pictures with some additional statistics:  \n- Which game versions did you use?  \n- What mods did you use, if any?  \n- How many Kerbals are on the mission?  \n- How many launches was needed to start your mission from Kerbin?  \n- How much did your mission cost?  \n- Did you needed a refueling mission?  \n- Did you bring additional stuff like satellites, rovers, etc?  \n- Share the delta-V information too, if you tracked it!  \n- Any additional note or description?\n\nAlso, I feel like I have to apologize in advance. Elcano missions are already a bit picture heavy. The requirements of Jool 5 are such that it\u0027s extremely pic intensive. I will try to reduce size, convert, and combine pictures like I have in the past...which also likely means more delays in posting.\n\nSo seriously, if people are interested in this, give me a thumbs up of some kind since this is a bit of a time investment...\n\nCheers!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T07:44:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T12:42:53Z","Content":"By all means, do crash something into Tylo for me?

The Cockroach became nothing more than a paperweight.*\n\n1.0.5, you crush my soul...\n\n**Back to the Drawing Board**\n\n     The engineers didn\u2019t know if this was a godsend or some sort of punishment for their insolence. The Cockroach and La Cucaracha are no longer seaworthy. Whey they do look ahead to the prospect of developing a new boat design, the prospect of spending a couple weeks relearning hydrodynamics also feels kinda painful.\n\n     However, the fun part is that there are some new ISRU parts to play with. And smaller ones! It might be quite possible to develop a smaller ship this time around, which will certainly be useful, given the huge requirements of a JoolCano5 mission. So I cracked. I figured if I\u2019m going to do the Jool5 challenge along with Elcano, I might as well go ahead and do Laythe (again). I figured if I skipped out on doing the Elcano of Laythe on this trip, then someone along the way can say that I never really did a full JoolCano5. Also, the water has changed enough that at least it\u2019ll be a different experience (if ever so slightly).\n\n     So without further ado, here are some of the different lengths of wire I used to design my new space-boat. (That\u2019s a Futurama reference, for any of you fans out there.) As the boat took on various evolutions, the other thing that became obvious was that a boat that floated well while fully fueled, floated way too high when running out of fuel. That sounds like it wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue, but it often resulted in a lot of flipping and bouncing. On the opposite side, boats that floated well while empty, were much (much) too deep when fully fueled.\n\n     Boat designs ranged in weight from 10t to 60t, but the two primary prototypes are pictured below. One is based on the old Cockroach design, and the second is a smaller version of the Cockroach using the new (smaller) ISRU parts.\n\n![5hkE70j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5hkE70j.jpg)\n\n     Adding wings and control surfaces to compensate for fuel mass had mixed results. CoM shifts seemed to cause even more issues for boats than what they do for airplanes. Humorously, this resulted in boats that either bounced excessively, or simply became airborne. Again, the huge shift in fuel mass created a problem where lift needed at heavy weight was way too much when at light weight. I even tried using \u201Cflaps\u201D as a form of adjustable lift control (deflect them at heavy weight, retract them at light weight). That also didn\u2019t work out so well for...various reasons.\n\n![CB3Shlm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CB3Shlm.jpg)\n\n     So to try and ease the burden on the drag in the water, while keeping the lift rating low enough that the boat was less likely to flip, the engineers decided to test out some hydrofoil designs. Though not ideal, the hydrofoil designs showed a lot of promise. Initial testing showed dramatically improved fuel efficiency, even at heavy weight. At light weight, the boat could run at half throttle or below, and still remain at fairly high speed. (Much above about 80m/s, and parts began to rip off.)\n\n![lsee6DM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lsee6DM.jpg)\n\n     The real kicker here, is that the hydrofoil designs are very unfriendly to time warp. They tend to sink, dig in, and then turn into a submarine while under time warp. This could be quite the problem, given the amount of driving required... However, with the time spent already, it was decided that this design would be \u201Cgood enough.\u201D Rather than spending more time perfecting the boat design, the Mission Director decided that he would accept spending less time traveling at warp speeds. (I think I heard the flight crew cry a little.)\n\n     The other driving factor was trying to keep the size smaller to fit into a cargo bay or fairing. Mostly I wanted to force a smaller size in order to give the new parts a try. Though I think I\u2019m going to pay for it horribly later, since the small converter runs at 10% the rate of the big one. I fully anticipate this to be a huge problem, but thought I\u2019d give it a try anyway.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T07:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 07:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T07:13:27Z","Content":"*The engineers cackle as the first simulations of the grand JoolCano Mothership come back.* \n\n**Well This Should Be Easy**\n\n1.0.5, you continue to crush my soul.\n\n     With the redesign of the boat and the total fuel requirements, the engineers elected to go for minimalist designs. The Tylo Crew vehicle contains seats only (no capsules) to keep weight down. Also, the Tylo rover and Tylo crew vehicle are going to land separately (again, to keep size and mass down). A single lander would be capable of bringing down both parts together, but the overall size starts ballooning.\n\n![t5DwfbF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/t5DwfbF.jpg)\n\n     Also, the crew needs a way to get the rovers (and themselves) from the Mothership to the other landing sites. Initially the engineers started designing a tug that would move the landers and rovers around the Joolian system. The initial designs ended up in such a way that the tug had more than enough dV and TWR to get to and land on Pol and Bop. A couple gold donut tanks were added to ensure there was enough dV for a trip to Vall, and the JoolCano5 Tug was complete. It will also be used to drop the boat and crew vehicle on Laythe, as well as deploying the rover and crew vehicle for Tylo. Best of all, it\u2019ll act as a rescue vehicle in the event of an issue getting to orbit, much like the previous Elcano-Laythe trip experienced.\n\n![ShdrtdL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ShdrtdL.jpg)\n\n     The basic Duna Mothership design was used as a starting point for the JoolCano5 Mothership. Really what it amounted to was mounting the boat and landers in a fairing on top of the rover carrier. The whole ship would then fly to Jool and aerobrake around Jool (since that is supposed to work now, right?...RIGHT!?). Also, because I simply didn\u2019t feel like docking all this stuff together in LKO, I simply stuck it all together and launched it in one go (plus that felt like it fit the Jool5 rules better, though not completely necessary).\n\n![9C5Zycp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9C5Zycp.jpg)\n\n     The thing is so tall and wibbly-wobbly, I wasn\u2019t even sure it would make it to space. But after a few tries it did.\n\n![vhdADb5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vhdADb5.jpg)\n\n     I ultimately sent it on its way to Jool to give it a tryout. After many (many) failed attempts to aerobrake at Jool and Laythe, the design was finally abandoned. It was simply too bendy, too tall, not enough control authority, and the aeroshell was ultimately a failure as a heat shield. I\u2019m not sure that the fairing would have worked before 1.0.5 either, but there simply isn\u2019t a big enough heat shield part that works with this configuration.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gcx3L/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAerobrake: **Failed**\n\nAero**break**: **Highly Successful**\n\n(FYI, this post covers around two weeks of work, lots of frustration, and led to taking a break from Elcano for a while.)\n\nNext up will be actual mission start.

It couldn\u2019t aerobrake and didn\u2019t have enough fuel to slow down without aerobraking. It\u2019s flawed at a fundamental level (especially for 1.0.5), so rather than bellyache about what\u2019s lost, the Mission Director just scraped the whole thing.\n\n     The engineers actually went back to some previous ideas for a Mothership which included symmetric cargo bays on the sides of the ship, rather than along the length. The general idea is a more pancake-like Mothership with symmetric fuel/engines on two sides, and symmetric cargo modules on the other two sides (#BringBackThePancakes!). With that idea as the basis, they set to work first on figuring out how to get the crew home (i.e. building the mission backwards).\n\n**\u003Cu\u003ECore Crew Vehicle\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n     After iterating through several design concepts, the Mission Director  decided to go with a separate smaller return vessel for the Jool-\u003EKerbin return trip, rather than trying to bring the whole Mothership home. The issue was that with all the extra cargo storage needs and heat shields, the baseline Mothership was quite heavy.\n\n     And then the engineers said \u201CSmaller! What the heck, it still weighs over 20 tons!\u201D The Mission Director figured at this point in their career, Julella and Obemy have earned a little comfort during travel. But even with the comfort, the Jool 5 Challenge puts the crew in the position where they have to come back down to Kerbin at the end of the mission (a required part of the rules). So in addition to the \u201Ccomfort\u201D module, the engineers included a handy-dandy Mk1-2 capsule for the crew to recover on Kerbin.\n\n![9db7uiT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9db7uiT.jpg)\n\n**\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ECargo Modules\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n     Unfortunately, as it turns out, the cargo bays are heavier than fairings, and are also not quite long enough for the Laythe boat. The tips of the pontoons dig into the end of the bay, and lengthening the bay means adding several more tons to the ship for zero real gain. That\u2019s actually rather unfortunate because I think the bays look really cool, but the ship is already quite large. At this point, I need to start shaving off weight where I can. Partially because I don\u2019t want the ship to get too heavy, but also because I already know part count is going to be a killer when trying to launch this entire thing at once.\n\n     So the cargo modules will still use fairings for storing the mission payload. However, I still wanted to keep the cargo areas on the side of the ship, because the extreme length of the previous Mothership became a problem. That also means the ship will be wider and need a huge heat shield for aerobraking.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EFuel Tanks and Engines\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n     After the main components of the Mothership were established, the fuel tanks and engines were built around the cargo fairings. During building and testing, the engineers filled the cargo fairings with cans of silly-putty to simulate the mission payload and save on part count.\n\n![rSr100m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rSr100m.jpg)\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EMating the Mission Payload\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n     Filling out the cargo modules was also rather interesting. Because of how the ship is built, the fairings needed to be constructed first so that struts and structural members could run through the fairing walls for support. So the fairings were put into place, then the cargo fit inside. In some places, that meant some interesting rotating and offsetting to get all the parts and pieces inside without clipping.\n\n![qW243Td.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qW243Td.jpg)\n\n     Heat shields were fitted to the bottom of the ship. They actually became a fairly integral part of the overall structure. There\u2019s not much to say here, other than they look pretty cool when heating up...\n\n![yU73oNX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yU73oNX.jpg)\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EMothership Shakedown Mission\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n     The crew is excited, yet terrified, of this mission. It\u2019s such a long endeavor that failure to meet a Jool-5 objective near the end will kill so much work. I think, as such, this will be an all or nothing attempt. Elcano is the priority, so failing at a Jool-5 objective will likely result in forever abandoning this grand Jool-5 / Elcano adventure. (I\u2019m not going to restart and drive all those worlds again.)\n\n     So, as a pre-Jool checkout, the entire ship was flown on a test mission through the Kerbin SOI. All of the major elements that weren\u2019t tested as part of the design phase were tested in space around Kerbin.\n\n     The basic mission profile was a takeoff from KSC into about a 150km x 150km orbit around Kerbin. The launch included only one crew member who \u201Cvolunteered\u201D to test out the Laythe boat reentry capabilities. Julella and Obemy are still aboard the Duna-Ike-Dres Mothership in an inclined elliptical orbit around Kerbin. The Duna Mothership was rather slim on fuel when it returned from Dres, so this shakedown mission was also a good time to go pick them up using the tug. Julella and Obemy then went on to test out each of the major systems.\n\n     The crew jotted down some notes during the mission so that the engineers could evaluate and make some adjustments for the JoolCano-5 mission.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/dVGsX/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n     The Shakedown Mission finished about three days prior to the Jool transfer window."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T08:49:35Z","Content":"*The mission director gives the green light.*\n\nJoolCano-5 (Combined Elcano and Jool-5 Challenge)\n\nThe Voyage of the Iron Narcissus Begins\n\nObjective: Circumnavigate all five Joolian moons in one big mission.\n\nThe Mothership, christened Iron Narcissus, has officially begun her journey to the Joolian system.
