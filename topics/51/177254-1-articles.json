A refuel station at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, a captured asteroid to be mined in the future.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDuna\u003C/em\u003E: The refuel and relaxation station (R\u0026amp;RS) in high Duna orbit, a Duna lander in low \u00A0orbit, a crewed return vehicle waiting for a transfer window back to Kerbin, a lander in low Ike orbit and a mining rig connected to a refinery in low Ike orbit as well (for future crewed, or heavy equipment missions to Jool and beyond)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDres\u003C/em\u003E: 2 relays in a polar orbit, an uncrewed science probe with relay dish in low orbit and a rover on a horribly performing skycrane (can\u0027t get the thing stabilized, another design error)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJool\u003C/em\u003E: relay constellation, consisting of 2 main relays in high polar orbit. A relay around Bop, one around Pol and one around Tylo. They all have the capability to reach the whole system.Vall and Laythe were supposed to get one too, but they went rogue. Then an uncrewed science probe, which has visited all the moons.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESarnus\u003C/em\u003E: (playing with Outer Planets Mod). Only the first probe has just arrived. Nearly lost it because of loss of signal during a decelleration burn. It came into range just in time....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for sharing fellow Kerbonauts.
