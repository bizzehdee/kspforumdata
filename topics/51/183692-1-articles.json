To begin, let me give you a\u00A0brief recap of what we have achieved so far.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early stages of the program were probably much like you would expect them. Suborbital excursions on solid rockets, first orbital excursions including a polar orbit to learn as much as possible about our mother Kerbin and to enjoy her in all her beauty. Unfortunately we were very poorly staffed and funded at that time. We somehow lost all picture documentary of those early days when we accidentally ran an engine test next to our head offices with the windows open.\u00A0Nobody had thought of stowing those precious memories properly and we could not afford a fireproof safe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut our team of four was soon eager to explore beyond. Looking up at the sky in many beautiful starry nights we felt an urge to reach the Mun. At first, we sent a manned ship to a Mun flyby to see if we could reach orbit and bring ship and Kerbal safely back home with at least some useful science data to exploit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022R6R3QUW.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/R6R3QUW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe then managed to bring our chief male pilot Jedediah safely to the surface of Mun to make him the first Kerbal who ever put a foot on another celestial body. In the absence of air it was quite \u00A0quiet up there so we nicknamed our landing spot \u0022Tranquility base\u0022.\u00A0Soon after that we balanced the gendering by also bringing our chief female pilot Valentina to a different landing site we deemed interesting and we dubbed that spot our \u0022Venus base\u0022.\u00A0Luckily we preserved some of the imagery of those important milestones, but with our limited funds we could only equip our early missions with very cheap cameras as you can tell from the image quality.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TaLlXiS.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TaLlXiS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrilled with our recent success we not only expanded our technology rapidly but we also dared\u00A0planning\u00A0further ahead. Our next big milestone would be to bring a science lab to a stable Mun orbit, both as a way to leverage our science and technology expansion and as a permanent link to the surface of the Mun. We soon found out that we lacked the capability to bring our desired configuration to the Mun in a single launch. Also, without having trained to dock two vehicles in space we did not dare to continue. We therefore designed a mission to give our pilot couple the chance to train docking procedures in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226K9wZOb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6K9wZOb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith these skills we also managed to help out other space exploration initiatives by rescuing stranded crews from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and bring them back home to the surface of Kerbin. Overwhelmed with the selfless support they had been receiving, many of them decided to join our organization. Finally we were able to expand our head count.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen came the time to launch the bits and pieces of our planned Munar laboratory space station into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. The first\u00A0launch\u00A0hauled\u00A0the core science lab and its two-man scientist crew to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, coupled with a tiny little unmanned tug. The second launch brought the reusable Mun lander and docked it to the lab.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221hSQzTb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1hSQzTb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile bringing the actual Mun orbit insertion vessel close to the lab, we\u00A0discovered a major flaw in our planning which made it necessary to abort the mission before actually leaving the orbit of our home world. Back to the drawing boards was the motto of the time and hard work proved to be the best way to overcome our frustration. We redesigned the lander/orbit insertion configuration and decided to launch both in one go. Valentina and Jedediah had to ditch the first lander into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and watch it burn in flames before we docked the second lander and orbit insertion stage to our lab. Urslev and Reiritz, our brave scientists, patiently waited through this difficult time but managed to focus on processing some science data they gathered from EVAs during their extensive orbiting period.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p6QgNhZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/p6QgNhZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis configuration finally made its way to a stable Mun orbit on Y1 D90. It then underwent some reconfiguration\u00A0to change the sequence of the modules and to free the lander for actual landing operations. Once all these steps were completed, Valentina\u00A0undocked the lander and made her second visit to the surface of the dusty grey satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wHlEoPdm.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wHlEoPdm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qgcg7U6m.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qgcg7U6m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yTxgjwUm.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/yTxgjwUm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p5Svn5S.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/p5Svn5S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-13T20:32:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2019 08:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Shmauck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-13T10:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196571-shmauck/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022196571\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196571-shmauck/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Shmauck\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Nice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thing, you can take screenshots in-game using the F1 key.

We managed to receive a constant stream of science data from our newly establish Mun lab. This helped us a great deal in pushing our technology developments further. Soon the Mun was some kind of second home to our crew so thought we were ready for the next step: exploring Minmus!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early missions to our mint colored neighbor in space were carried out quite similar to what we had done around Mun. We reused our proven ship designs to first complete a Minmus flyby before we had our chief pilot Jedediah\u00A0to first set his foot\u00A0on what looked like delicious mint slush ice. After he splashed down in Kerbin\u0027s waters he stated in an interview that he was rather sad about Valentina not having the chance to be the first Kerbal on Minmus due to her ongoing mission around Mun. His statement spawned an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA science lab around Minmus - Minmuslab Alpha\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe held a three-day conference at Shmauck Space Center to sketch out our plan for the next Minmus missions, certainly enjoying mint slush ice as our dessert on all lunch and dinner breaks.\u00A0Our lead scientist Bob came up with the idea\u00A0to ferry a new and novice crew - including himself - to our Munlab Alpha and to bring back the current team of Valentina, Urslev and Reiritz. Our intention was to launch a new\u00A0lab into the orbit of Minmus and to assign the\u00A0experienced Mun crew to that Minmus mission. This would allow to further enlarge their experience in space.\u00A0We had acquired enough personnel during a couple of rescue missions to support Bobs plan.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur veteran engineer Bill - personally lacking any spaceflight experience as of then - chimed in and suggested to let both Urslev and Reiritz carry out their own Mun landings before bringing them back to Kerbin. This would not only boost their own personal experience to the same level as Valentina was, it would also give us even more valuable data from the Mun to process and research. We put this idea into practice and completed three Mun landings before the crew was ready to leave the Munlab Alpha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was again Bill who lead the\u00A0design for a crew ferry which would\u00A0serve as the launch vehicle for the new crew and as the return vessel for the current one. The following photo shows the ferry on the launchpad, ready to carry Norzenz as\u00A0pilot and Bob and Norlen as scientists to the Mun.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qv1gVYO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qv1gVYO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt proved a very wise decision to first complete the\u00A0crew switch before we began construction work on our Minmus lab. As our Mun lab had very limited crew space without any spare seats and also did not offer an additional docking port, the crew exchange process appeared to be rather complicated. Each of the six astronauts involved had to perform EVAs one by one to travel from the ferry to the Munlab or vice versa. This cumbersome exercise\u00A0helped us improve the design of the Minmus science station by a great margin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\u00A0ended up designing\u00A0the following configuration to explore\u00A0the farther of our two moons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229SSGMlX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9SSGMlX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe core science lab was now accompanied by a four-seated crew compartment to which we also added four additional sideways\u00A0docking ports - two small ones and two normal ones. Should we decide to switch crews again we would definitely have a much smoother approach to that. It\u0027s really good to have people like Bill on our team!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the above picture you can see the lander docked to one of these sideways ports. To the bottom end (right side of picture) you see the original Minmus orbit insertion stage which brought the lab to its destination. At the top end (or left side) we docked an additional unmanned tanker vessel which we brought separately to\u00A0Minmus. The tanker increases the onboard liquid fuel and monopropellant supplies and\u00A0allows extensive research on repeated landing excursions to Minmus. The station was launched carrying a crew of three: Valentina, Urslev and Reiritz, our former Mun crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also had a small tug on the station\u00A0but we learned another lesson. Minmus requires serious antennas to allow unmanned vehicles to be controlled from the Space Center back on Kerbin. Bad luck we didn\u0027t think of that in advance. We lost all control of the tug after undocking it so we could only watch it float away into the vast nothingness. We added that bit to our vehicle construction checklist within minutes after the loss.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223582227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183692\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555156069\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178125\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SiriusRocketry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SiriusRocketry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat visual mods do you use?

We soon felt\u00A0ready to reach beyond Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and\u00A0Duna glowed red in the distant space. On Day 114 of our first year we accepted the challenge of the record-keeping society and signed a contract to explore Duna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe pulled out some of our old maths books and tried to make up our minds about what would be required to enter interplanetary space. Apparently the task at hand would result in a long journey through space so we decided that a crew of three would be the minimum if they were to sanely survive this trip. Our chief male pilot Jedediah was clearly our first choice for commanding the mission. As the contract required only a flyby and gathering some scientific data, we asked our engineering department to come up with a design for the mission.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogically they based their design on a Mk1-3 command pod and\u00A0added the necessary components to bring craft and crew safely back to Kerbin. Their usual approach of throwing some science experiments to the outside hull of the craft seemed not fitting. We also wanted some extra batteries on the vessel just in case Duna would have a dark side which we would have to fly over. Bill Kerman, our lead engineer, suggested to add a service bay to the capsule which would also reenter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. This way the science experiments would be in a protected compartment which could be opened when in situ. Yes, we also learned some latin while preparing our journey. And we crammed some batteries into the service bay.\u00A0The final design also featured solar panels attached to upper stage fuel tank and engine module, an antenna completed the package. As we didn\u0027t plan to dock or maneuver, we spared all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and docking equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D3VXufz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/D3VXufz.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeighing a bit more than 16 tons, we put our Duna orbiter on top of what was\u00A0the heaviest launcher we ever built. We ended up with a 263-ton-ship that required us to add some concrete to our launchpad. Our first stage consisted of five Skipper engines for combined 2.845 kN of thrust at sea level, barely enough to get us off the pad. Another Skipper with a X200-32 tank should propel us out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence into interplanetary space. A third stage consisting of a Poodle engine pair and a X200-16 tank\u00A0would then allow us to enter Duna\u0027s sphere of influence. The upper stage with yet another Poodle and X200-16 should be enough to bring us back to Kerbin. Here is an image of our ship in the early morning sunrise. So much for our calculations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SvpjXse.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SvpjXse.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the good news first: the craft really made it to Duna and managed to enter a stable orbit roughly 84km above Duna. The bad news is that mission control failed to establish an encounter with Duna when leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. As this was our first time to enter interplanetary space we were all very surprised with what happened on our screens here at SSC. It took us quite a while to figure out what we had to do and when we finally found the answers we were already half-way to Duna. Our crew complained that they didn\u0027t like the idea of playing Scrabble in zero gravity but at least it kept them busy for most of the flight. The bottom line is that we used all of our third stage and one third of our last stage fuel to achieve the encounter and the resulting orbit. We have 1848m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left in the last tank and we figure that should be enough to leave Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and return to Kerbin, potentially exercising some aerobraking at home.

So far, our crew\u00A0ran our materials and goo experiments, temperature and barometer reads in solar orbit, high above Duna and in low orbit.

We were thrilled by that opportunity,\u00A0quickly accepted the contract and got to work. It turned out that our business partner had ideas similar to what we had just recently brought to Minmus\u0027 orbit. Instead of creating everything from scratch, Bill pulled out the plans\u00A0of our Minmuslab and adapted them to the mission\u0027s requirements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iduo78l.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iduo78l.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe reused the core piece of science lab and crew compartment, removed the additional docking ports and drastically increased the battery capacity to keep the base operational during extended Minmus nights. He also increased the number of solar panels which later proved a bit useless. And of course he added a chemical engine, a fuel tank and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E capability for both autonomous landing and docking. He didn\u0027t forget the antenna this time and also managed to attach landing struts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a special reward for Bill, we\u00A0decided to reserve a seat on the Minmus outpost for our meritorious engineer and finally give him his first spaceflight experience. Bill wasn\u0027t so sure if this\u00A0actually was a reward as we didn\u0027t put any explicit end date to the mission. He soon regretted to equip the outpost with just one small docking port on its top. As it seems he felt we gave him\u00A0a one way ticket. Funny how engineer\u0027s minds work. To make up for his suspicion we named the base after his favorite engineer Leonardo Da Vinci.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GU4H7iw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GU4H7iw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe brought Da Vinci\u00A0out to Minmus, manned by Bill and Lendon, one of our new employees and remotely controlled from the Shmauck Space Center. The outpost docked with the Minmuslab Alpha to be resupplied with fuel and to undergo the final preparations and checkouts for landing. Bill and Lendon spent a few happy days with the Minmuslab crew of Val, Urslev and Reiritz before they finally waved goodbye, slammed the hatch of the docking port and released the clamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur preferred landing spot turned out to be on the dark side of Minmus very soon after inexperienced Lendon had prematurely slammed the docking port and the descent had begun. Back then we didn\u0027t have radar altimeters available for an AGL readout on the command station in SSC. That\u0027s how we ended up in a very slow powered descent towards the surface of Minmus, not exactly knowing how low we needed to go. It could easily have cost our two inexperienced colleagues their return ticket to a Minmus orbit as we have used way more fuel than we originally planned. Obviously Bill had planned for an extra reserve and it seems we still have the option to bring the two guys back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe outpost landed on day 55 of our second year of operation and is happily researching during daylight. Bill has underestimated the length of the Minmus nights. While we have more than enough solar panels, we don\u0027t have enough batteries on the Da Vinci base.\u00A0We are just glad we put a fax machine and candles\u00A0on the\u00A0outpost so that Bill can continue designing our next ships during those extensive nights while Lendon is cleaning the research and science equipment and washing the dishes aboard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SOC2asa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SOC2asa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-14T12:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnmanned satellite operations (Y2 D60\u00A0- D70)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs most of our crews were deployed to our remote vessels,\u00A0stations and the Minmus base, we began wondering what to do with those satellite contracts we had been offered. We started off with a very simple test probe which we launched into a\u00A0highly eccentric polar orbit around Kerbin, almost as far out as Mun\u0027s orbit. Accidentally, that first satellite encountered Mun\u0027s gravity field during our Sentinel mission and got catapulted deep into our solar system. We abandoned the craft and remotely terminated the mission to avoid further problems.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up we were asked to put a surface scanner in a Kerbin orbit. Once we reached that orbit, the requirements proved to be entirely wrong and the surface scanner refused to work. We received payments nonetheless. Based on our experience with the test probe we took the money and then immediately adjusted the orbit to the scanner\u0027s profile. We\u00A0now have a nice little map of Kerbin\u0027s ore concentrations as a bonus from that contract and our satellite is happily revolving high above our home world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Sc4zlMi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Sc4zlMi.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we announced our recent success in satellite operations on a press conference, Gene Kerman was approached by a Kerbal in a beige trench coat, a hat and dark sunglasses. The stranger pulled Gene over to a remote corner in the hall and informed him that Kerbin was in danger. He claimed to have evidence that asteroids may someday get close to our home world and potentially hit it with catastrophic results. Then he left without a trace. We organized a cosmic video call to involve all our science crews in a discussion about how realistic such a scenario could be. It turned out that many of our staff had seen a movie called\u00A0\u0022Kermageddon\u0022\u00A0a couple of years ago and were therefore concerned that such a scenario could become real. At the same time they offered to volunteer for a manned mission to blow up an asteroid once we found one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly recently our engineering team had invented an infrared telescope. The\u00A0scientists agreed that this device could be\u00A0helpful when searching for incoming space objects. We built\u00A0a mission around this telescope which they called \u0022Sentinel\u0022. Putting the device in an orbit around Kerbin seemed a bit useless because it would leave us with almost no warning time if the Sentinel actually found a dangerous object. We thought that an orbit around the sun, just outside of Eve\u0027s orbit, would be the best place to look out into the solar system. Such an interplanetary trajectory would also allow us to test drive the recently developed nuclear engine which we want to use during our next Duna mission.\u00A0Engineers came up with a vehicle design to combine a nuclear engine with the Sentinel telescope and a new and powerful antenna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fa6ghkU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022fa6ghkU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MwxAEsr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022MwxAEsr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-14T17:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrepare for Duna (Y2 D256)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving learned that Duna transfer windows are not appearing every day, we want to be prepared for the next one that opens. Not only will we have to bring back our Duna orbiter crew during that window, we also have collected a number of contracts to perform several steps out there on the red planet. Planting a flag on Duna is always a good start and it serves our owner\u0027s desire for being on magazine titles\u00A0very well. Collecting science on the surface of Duna happens naturally to us when we\u0027re there. Another partner wants us to build a Duna surface outpost and yet another one asks to put a satellite on Duna orbit. Whew, that transfer window will be packed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add our own little extra, we would like to have a science station on orbit of Duna. The value of our stations in orbits of Mun and Minmus cannot be overestimated and we believe that we should replicate that same concept also around Duna. And that last bit is an excellent point to start our preparations. We grabbed the blueprints of the Minmus station and tweaked that design to include some of the recent discoveries of our engineering crew. A set of four large solar arrays to provide all the necessary power and to\u00A0replace the many tiny 1x6 panels we used on the Minmus lab. Those things were always in the way while docking and\u00A0made some of the docking operations rather complicated. We added a service bay to accommodate an OKTO2 control unit and a pile of batteries. We equipped a large ring of reaction wheels for autonomous control and a large Communotron HG-55 antenna for more bandwidth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all our crews still out there in space, we shot\u00A0the unmanned\u00A0core component of our combined Duna mission\u00A0to an 80km orbit and put it to sleep there, ready to be woken up by its crew at a later day.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YOBpzj9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022YOBpzj9.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-16T16:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew management\u00A0(Y2 D260-D294)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of our important milestones for the upcoming Duna mission was to reassign the crews of our manned / womanned outposts to new jobs and habitats. Just like Bill originally suggested we planned to\u00A0let all crew members in Mun and Minmus labs perform a landing on their moon before moving them to their next destination. This practice would help maximize their experience levels.

He was yet to perform his first Mun landing and we had assigned to a descent heading for Mun\u0027s twin craters. His destination happened to be on the dark side of the Mun so we could make great use of our upgraded altimeter which now featured AGL readouts. Bob perfectly mastered all the navigational and piloting challenges of this trip, including the necessary plane changes before and after the landing. We here at mission control\u00A0are quite happy about all the experience we gathered so far which is freely shared among all our staff. Also, we really embrace the altimeter upgrade. Unfortunately the dark side of Mun is really really dark so we didn\u0027t manage to shoot any decent photos of Bob\u0027s success. But he left a nice flag on the landing site with our logo and his name on it for future proof how well he did.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMinmus, D265\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up\u00A0was Reiritz Kerman. He was the last member\u00A0of the current Minmuslab crew who had not smashed a flag into\u00A0slushy mint ice cream yet. Reiritz\u00A0was interested to visit two or possibly three biomes with just one landing so we tried to bring him close the edge of Minmus\u0027 flats where he would have also slopes and lowlands within walking distance from the landing site. Theoretically, that is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022d4yn1hA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/d4yn1hA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReiritz nailed the spot really well, got out of his lander and walked or hovered his way around the lander. He discovered not only the flats and lowlands biomes of Minmus but also that messing up the touchdown on a slope after a jetpack flight on the surface of Minmus may end in a ten-minute downhill slide. Mentioning slopes, he didn\u0027t find the slopes biome despite sliding down a slope for ten minutes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022F2MYYrr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/F2MYYrr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EMun, D265\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis day was a busy day here at mission control. Mun lander was refueled and restocked with popcorn after Bob\u0027s excursion and ready for the last member of the Munlab crew to head for the surface: Norlen. We felt safe to assign him to a landing in Mun\u0027s highlands because we had so successfully run the new altimeter on Bob\u0027s landing. Off he went.\u00A0You will see in the picture that we have meanwhile upgraded our Munlab station. It now features a separate crew compartment with additional docking ports, much like the Minmus station. This will certainly help the crew rotation activities ahead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229KLqSZS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9KLqSZS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe experienced that highlands can quite a tricky place to land, exactly how we had expected. Norlen brought down the lander on a rather steep slope and feared that the entire thing would fall over. Two of the four landing legs did not touch the ground at all. We decided to let him take off again and to slowly direct the lander to another spot, further down the hill. He bravely maneuvered his ship to a place less steep and touched down for a second time. Even here the ground was not horizontal and two landing legs barely stood on the surface at first. A little kick from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters corrected that issue but Norlen was reluctant to unfold the solar panels on the downhill side to avoid moving the center of mass in the fatal direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SjZYn2o.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SjZYn2o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin, D266\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe allowed our mission control crew a night of well-deserved rest before we launched our round trip to the two moons and back. Yes, we would go for a single launch with our crew ferry to visit Mun, Minmus and come back to Kerbin. For that purpose we had redesigned our crew ferry, now called CF3. The\u00A0upgraded\u00A0ship featured the nuclear engine we first employed on the Sentinel mission, together with some additional fuel capacity. We tried pumping the liquid fuel in the oxidizer part of the tanks to use that empty space for fuel but that didn\u0027t work so well. Thus we now have a CF1 and a CF3, but no CF2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224smlGoc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4smlGoc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this\u00A0new ship already on the pad, our Mun replacement crew\u00A0Danlan, Dave and Jonley were eagerly awaiting to take her on her maiden\u00A0flight. As always, we had significantly overdone the launch stage and hauled way too much fuel to orbit. This time, it came in handy at the end of the mission. For now, we decided to let the launch stage burn for the transfer orbit and the Mun orbit insertion. Docking the huge cigar to the Munlab station was quite a task due to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E maneuvering thrusters are only attached to the CF3 itself and not available at the launch stage. Danlan\u00A0managed to carefully bring his large ship close enough to the docking port on the station when he found out that the port on the CF3 would not engage. He scratched the paint and gave the station a bump which pushed the CF3 backwards. We told him to park the ship fifty meters away from the station and hold while we undocked the little tug from the station. We flew the tug out to the CF3 and tried to dock, just to be 100% sure that the problem was on the CF3 and not on the station. As the tug also failed to engage the ship\u0027s docking port,\u00A0we called our emergency engineers into mission control. Something must have gone terribly wrong during the redesign of the crew ferry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe usually place a control unit right below\u00A0the nose docking port of our ships because that is just such a convenient spot for these devices. Our engineers refused to say who was to blame for it but they suspected that a later adjustment could have lead to an interference between the control unit and the port. As this is an area of the capsule which cannot be reached while the docking port is closed, we were stuck without hope of repair. Our only chance would be to bring ship and crew back\u00A0to Kerbin, rebuild the ship and restart the mission, not without beating up everybody on the engineering team. Then suddenly the comm lines crackled and our junior scientist Dave aboard CF3 voiced\u00A0an idea. While examining the docking port he had found a hidden lever near the docking port saying \u0022decouple node\u0022. Engineering shrugged and agreed it could be worth trying, so Dave yanked the lever. The whole ship began to shake, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and other gases escaped into space, whizzing loudly inside the cabin. And then, suddenly, a loud bang and everything was calm again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob, who had watched excitedly from aboard Munlab Alpha, spotted a dark object fly away from the nose of the crew ferry. Was this the probe core that had been spat out by the docking port? And if so, was the port still intact and sealed? Was the crew aboard CF3 still alive? With worried faces we turned to the CAPCOM desk. Benten Kerman, the astronaut on duty, moved his microphone close and slowly pushed the talk button on his console, calling out to CF3 for a status. After\u00A0awfully long seconds of silence Daves voice came through, telling us about the\u00A0loud bang resulting in explosive decoupling of the control unit. The port looked perfectly fine from the inside, so we gave it a try and again brought the tug up in front of the ferry. This time, the ports engaged!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LlQS1O4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LlQS1O4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanlan repeated the procedure to move the ferry and its launch stage towards the station and after separating the tug from the ferry he managed to dock with ease. After some handshaking and hugging through the docking tunnel, the pilot and his two-man science crew debarked their ferry and made themselves comfortable inside the crew module of Munlab Alpha, their new home for the next months. Norzenz, Bob and Norlen, our current Munlab crew finished the lunch for three they had begun and packed their stuff to take over CF3 and make their way out to Minmuslab. Before they left, they pumped the remainder of the fuel in the launch stage of CF3 into the station\u0027s tanks and prepared to abandon the stage after undocking. Now finally on the nuclear engine, these three were the first manned crew ever propelled by nuclear power and also the first crew to do a direct Mun-Minmus-transfer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorzenz\u00A0got his calculations right for an\u00A0efficient transfer inside the Kerbin-Mun-Minmus system. Twenty-one days after undocking from Munlab Alpha they arrived in a rendezvous orbit around Minmus to dock with their new home. We took a nice picture showing the nuclear-powered CF3 approaching Minmuslab Beta, backdropped by Kerbin and the Mun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eAeppbg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/eAeppbg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time, docking went without notable incident. Valentina, Reiritz and Urslev greeted the newly arrived Minmuslab crew and showed their colleagues around. Everything looked very familiar, much like the Mun station except that extra tunnel between science lab and crew habitat which immediately gave Norlen an opportunity to bump his head. All six crew members spent an evening aboard Minmuslab, playing cards and dice and having a couple of beers. After a good sleep, Val, Reiritz and Urslev took their baggage to the ferry, boarded and undocked to head back to Kerbin. Leaving Minmus\u0027 gravity field after so many days on orbit weighed heavy on them but the blue homeworld ahead of them made up for that. Excited as Valentina was, she overlooked some strange results of the onboard navigational computations and by the time the ferry was supposed to cross the Mun trajectory she noticed she would have an encounter, but not a romantic one. Zooming past Mun, the ferry deviated from the return course significantly and now was the time to embrace all the extra fuel the vehicle had originally lifted at the beginning of its journey.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina corrected the course to enter a suitable orbit around Kerbin and meet what was supposed to be her next exciting adventure: Dunalab Gamma.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WrdAko2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WrdAko2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe docked her ship to the empty lab and together with her two scientist colleagues brought the station to life from its post-launch\u00A0hibernation. Our crew ferry had spent all its fuel reserves during the approach. Surprised by the situation and in a reflex we decided to let go of the fuel tank and engine and keep the capsule docked to Dunalab as some kind of crew return vehicle. Had we thought a bit more we would have noticed that a capsule without any propulsion system would not be able to deorbit from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but hey, we hadn\u0027t. For the trip to Duna we will undock the capsule anyway and dump it. For now, Val and her crew can use the extra space for leisure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-16T16:57:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2019 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Shmauck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-29T21:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMinmus mining and fuel production (Y2 D295-D306)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the flying staff was happily switching positions within the Kerbin/Mun/Minmus perimeter, our engineering department had brought to life something they had been dwelling about for quite some time. Following the Kerbin surface scanning experiment we had conducted as contract work earlier this year, Kerbal geologists had suspected that also Kerbins moons could be hiding valuable resources under their skins. To prove this hypothesis we approached the Integral corporation again in an attempt to partner with them on a surface scanning mission to the Mun. At the same time, our engineers teamed with our associates at Kerbodyne to develop mining tools suited for vacuum conditions. Both companies accepted their respective challenges and work began. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second surface scanning satellite was launched to the Mun around D260. It\u00A0revealed that our inner moon indeed carries some exploitable ore concentrations. Oversized as the satellite launcher was, we left the satellite on a counter-clockwise orbit around Mun and kept the upper stage docked to it to conserve the large amount of fuel still waiting to be burned. In total, the tandem held enough juice for another 3,600 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, good to go to Minmus later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the high bay of our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E at the space center, the engineers joined the Kerbodyne mining equipment with our usual spaceflight gear to come up with a mining and fuel production lander supposed to be deployed on the mint ice moon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZyLxpqJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ZyLxpqJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft itself had undergone thorough testing here on Kerbin to prove that it is capable of excavating ore from deep under the surface, store and process the ore into all known blends of spaceflight fuels. We used our grounds at the space center for those live tests, leaving some nice holes around the otherwise perfectly trimmed lawns. We have not yet decided how to fill these holes but the good news is that we could confirm all requirements of electric power and specialized cooling in daylight and at night time without having to shoot the craft to Minmus in an untested state. The 16.5-ton-ship is supposed to be manned by an engineer to operate and monitor mining and fuel processing at all times. It features four tank compartments to store liquid rocket fuel and oxidizer and a large tank for monopropellant. At launch, the monopropellant tank contained only a minimum quantity of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel to be able to dock the ship, the other tanks were launched completely empty. The two small tanks on top of the engines were filled to cover the need for landing burns. We ended up with a 21-ton payload for launch, including two heavy drills, the large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit, thermal control systems, large solar arrays and\u00A0fuel cell arrays for electricity generation and a single seated lander can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe nominated Bardine Kerman as our engineer on duty, who had joined our team during on of our numerous orbital rescue missions. She beamed with pride when we informed her, totally surprised about the confidence we had in her after the\u00A0orbital failure we recovered her from. Well, our confidence was in fact a bit less than she understood because we remotely controlled the launch, orbital insertion and docking to our Minmuslab Beta. We felt safer to trust our folks at mission control to fly the delicate craft rather than the young and inexperienced engineer.\u00A0The following image shows the fuel production plant in a parking position close to\u00A0Beta, waiting for the docking maneuver. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uyWuB20.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022uyWuB20.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBardine didn\u0027t have much time to meet the crew on Beta because our team at SSC was way too eager to see the plant in action, landed on the surface of Minmus. And we hoped to bring her back to Beta soon enough when she had completed her first mining and refining trip to the ground. After checking all systems for fuel transfer in docked state and checking out the Terrier engines\u00A0for landing\u00A0we undocked the plant from the station and began the landing sequence\u00A0towards the Greater Flats of Minmus. The capabilities of the engines carrying the plant was the only thing we were unable to test at home. Here, in the ice-cold reality of space above Minmus, Bardine would be the first to find out if our calculations had been correct. We had no reason at all to be worried. The craft performed\u00A0a spectacularly smooth landing on the flats in bright sunlight\u00A0with only a tiny bit of fishtailing motion right before the touchdown. Now the only remaining question was if we would be able to lift the plant up from the surface once we had filled it with fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing our first engineer outside of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, Bardine was delighted to receive the \u0022go for mining operations\u0022 from mission control. With the solar arrays and thermal control systems operational, she deployed one of the drills. After confirming a good penetration of the icy surface she activated the ore harvesting and transport. Readings on our screens here at SSC proved that the mining was actually successful, delivering minor but solid quantities of ore. Once the mining process had stabilized we were ready to activate the fuel production. All systems worked very well and within their designated specifications. Bardine also deployed and activated the second drill and the plant started to produce liquid fuel and oxidizer at its capacity limits. We were overwhelmed with our success and Bardine was elated about hers, hearing the joyful cheering from the engineering crew via comms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HyLdUyX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022HyLdUyX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the daylight faded on Minmus, we had half of our tank capacity filled with free rocket fuel! Then it was time to let\u00A0the remaining parts on the plant go to work: our fuel cell arrays. Also these components proved to be well suited for their task. Power generation allowed us to keep fuel production running through the entire night of Minmus which is about twice as long as on Kerbin. When the greater flats of Minmus saw the dawn of a new day, all our tanks were full of fuel. The remaining steps were to produce monopropellant, fill up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank with it and then launch back to a rendezvous with Minmuslab Beta. We also got the final checkmark on our lists when the ascent of the plant went exactly as planned. After\u00A0the docking clamps clicked we knew that we had achieved another important milestone in our space exploration program. And this time, Bardine finally left her lander can and joined the Beta crew for some serious celebration of our success.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fVY30Nm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022fVY30Nm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-01T09:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScanning grounds and hauling fuel (Y2 D306-D333)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the welcome party aboard Minmuslab Beta had ended and the crew of four had rested (or recovered from their hangovers) it was time to go back to work. Bob and Bardine began to configure the crossfeed lines so that the first load of free fuel could flow into the two tanker ships of the station. Back on Kerbin, we were all glad that our earlier missions had not only resulted in sufficient storage capacity for fuel but also given us the opportunity to ferry the fuel back to Kerbin aboard the unmanned tanker ships which had been transfer stages in the first place. Bardines first trip to Minmus had given us enough fuel to fill both tankers. Gene decided to let the first tanker undock from Beta and make the trip back home. While mission control staff piloted the tanker on its escape trajectory, Gene established a comm link to the Da Vinci lab on Minmus to get in touch with Bill Kerman, our chief engineer. We had been wondering if the tanker design allowed us to perform fuel-saving aerobraking maneuvers in Kerbins atmosphere when bringing the fuel back into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Bill, who had designed the tankers himself, recommended to make careful attempts at around 55 km altitude but to retract both solar panels and the antenna during the hot phase of the braking maneuver.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother task for the folks at mission control was to move the surface scanner from Muns orbit towards Minmus to give us a better understanding of where to land the mining and refinery ship on the next descent. The guys in orbital maneuvering calculated a rather aggressive approach to a polar orbit on Minmus while ejecting from the retrograde Mun orbit the scanning satellite was currently in. We relit the upper stage engine on D306 and put the craft on course.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/leqln7p.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022leqln7p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrossing the tanker\u0027s trajectory back to Kerbin, we corrected the satellite\u0027s flight path half way to reach a polar Minmus orbit of below 80km. After the capture burn, the surface scanner started to create a complete map of Minmus\u0027 resource reserves which proved that our assumptions had been correct. Our first landing spot was not the ideal place to mine for the precious ore and we would most certainly not go back there to continue. The lesser flats appeared to be much more promising for mining. We transmitted our new findings to Beta and ordered Bardine to prepare the mining plant for its next journey. On D311 she\u00A0set foot on Minmus\u0027 lesser flats and planted a flag after the lander had made another precision landing under remote control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the tanker control team took the steps recommended by Bill to prepare the craft for its first pass through Kerbins atmosphere. At a periapsis of about 58.5 km the tanker made its way safely through the upper atmosphere, lowering its apoapsis by about 13,000\u00A0kilometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zFxPLU8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022zFxPLU8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aerobraking proved to be a patience-testing approach but we were not in a hurry. Our goal was to refuel the remainder of Dunalab Gammas launch stage which was still connected to the lab. This stage, consisting of two X200-32 fuel tanks and a Skipper engine, was very capable of putting the Dunalab on its escape trajectory when it was completed. Unfortunately it had\u00A0never been designed to be reused for that purpose so it was not equipped with a docking port or autonomous control. Gene nonetheless insisted that engineering should come up with a modular solution to allow a very cost-efficient escape, using free fuel in a free stage already on orbit and connected to the station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the second aerobraking pass, we lowered the\u00A0periapsis\u00A0to 55km, which was Bills recommended limit. This time, the tanker was exposed to much more friction but this trajectory - together with the braking burn to lower the periapsis -\u00A0lowered the apoapsis significantly by another 28,000 km to a point just outside Muns orbit around Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JWct8V4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022JWct8V4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter two more aerobraking passes we had collected enough data. Gene decided to assist the braking process with some of the fuel aboard the tanker. Considering that the tanker itself, the fuel and the launch stage to Duna were completely free in this phase of the program it would not matter much to waste some of the free fuel. On D333 the tanker finally approached Dunalab Gamma on its 80 km orbit around Kerbin and executed the docking maneuvers just fine.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Kefpr8a.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Kefpr8a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-02T19:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoving Minmus (Y2 D330-D343)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the tanker crew in mission control executed their braking orbits around Kerbin, we had another first to celebrate outside on the campus of SSC. Wolfheim Kerman, one of the engineers who joined us after a space rescue mission, had been busily working in a hangar on the research and development complex for an entire month after he was involved in one of our early briefings about\u00A0our mining and fuel refining plans. He had been experimenting with wheeled ground vehicles for quite some time. When he saw the plans for our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E plant he urged his fellow engineers: \u0022Do me a favor and throw some docking ports on the plant if you can, as close to the bottom end as possible. I have a great idea!\u0022 Then he ran off to his hangar and little was seen from him except in our all-team lunch breaks in the astronaut center. Then, on D330, the large hangar gates opened and Wolfheim stepped out of his lab, carrying a remote control and wearing a big smile. Behind him followed a huge 12-wheeled tubular truck. Many of our staff gathered around Wolfheim and his giant companion to admire both.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/n54xm1B.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022n54xm1B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWolfheim presented us the first ever roving vehicle of our fleet and Gene was very happy to officially christen it the \u0022fuel truck\u0022 after our gifted engineer had explained what he had in mind for the vehicle. Equipped with four large tanks and a large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank, the fuel truck was capable of holding the entire production of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E plant but not only that. Wolfheim had added some extra tanks,\u00A0engines and all other necessary bits to allow the truck to land and takeoff on its own and therefore carry the produced fuel to Minmus orbit while the plant would remain in place on the surface. Gene was immediately thrilled and headed off to the mission control building. As soon as he had understood the potential of Wolfheim\u0027s work, he had another brilliant idea. What if we would use the tanker ship that was supposed\u00A0to arrive\u00A0in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E soon to carry the fuel truck on its way back to Minmus! That would give us another opportunity to reuse stuff that we already had. All it took was another launch to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to bring the fuel truck up to Dunalab Gamma and meet the tanker ship there. It turned out that this would actually work if we would just use some of our free fuel. So we just did it. The morning after the tanker vessel had arrived at the Gamma station we saw a clean liftoff of a mid-size launcher with a very oversized payload fairing on its top. A couple hours later, the fuel truck made its first successful docking in space and Wolfheim was a very proud Kerbal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bNiakMn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022bNiakMn.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina Kerman, our commanding crew member on the Gamma station, performed the required docking maneuvers from her controls inside the station. She first undocked the tanker vessel and piloted it around the station\u00A0to dock it to the fuel truck\u0027s rear docking port. She then re-balanced the fuel loads according to mission control\u0027s calculations to make sure the truck/tanker duo had exactly the right quantity to go back to Minmus with the truck\u0027s extra mass of 13.5 tons. Soon we were ready to bring the vehicles on their way to the outer moon and Val watched the lengthy ship coast away over Kerbins desert.

With the first rays of sunlight touching Minmus\u2019 surface she had climbed out of her airlock and had taken stance atop her plant to look out for the fuel truck. Wolfheim, who had spent most of the past days at mission control without getting much sleep, produced a smile on his tired face.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EDuring the last couple of hours, everybody at mission control had been waiting eagerly for Bardines visual confirmation. For reasons of direct communication, we had to undock and land the fuel truck over the dark side of Minmus which was facing Kerbin. Our experience from earlier night landings at Minmus made us confident that we could also land the rover based on instrument readings. As additional safety measures we performed the landing with the craft strictly pointing prograde and at least two kilometers away from the plant. The prograde orientation allowed us to roll out the twelve-wheeled rover to bleed off forward motion on the vast flats of Minmus. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EAccording to our sensor reports the fuel truck touched down gently a little more than two kilometers away from the fuel plant and rolled out some extra two hundred meters before it came to an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-assisted halt on the icy surface. We left the craft there with brakes locked to wait for the dawn of the next Minmus day to approach the fuel plant only during daylight. This would allow us to generate power through the solar panels while using the electric motors and would avoid stranding the vehicle powerless. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003ENow that Bardine had confirmed she saw the truck we activated the motors and steering and released the brakes.

Therefore the truck\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E was high above the ground which demanded cautious steering inputs. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EWe slowed the truck down directly east of her plant and fully stopped it ten meters away from the plant\u2019s east docking port. Bardine gently dove from her outlook down to the ground using her jetpack to watch the docking from up close. Wolfheim, still following the video stream of Bardine\u2019s helmet camera, took over the remote controls to personally guide his craft slowly towards the outpost. With the help of Bardine who voiced him through the last step giving onsite visual confirmation of the progress, Wolfheim achieved a smooth docking to the plant. Everybody at mission control had held their breath until the docking clamp arrest lights showed green. Then the ground crews broke out in loud cheering. On the shoulders of his colleagues Wolfheim was carried back to the crew quarters to finally get some well-deserved rest. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dNXfFXS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022dNXfFXS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EBardine however took over the truck by landing on its top side. She reconfigured the fuel flow lines so that her plant could start to pump fuel into both the storage and the maneuvering tanks. Soon the precious liquid filled half of the storage capacity which was our limit for the first trip back to the Beta station. As we had never had the chance to test a loaded relaunch in reduced gravity we did not dare to fully load the truck. After she had finished the loading and had confirmed that she had reconfigured all flight tanks back to flight mode Gene had a little surprise for her. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u201CBefore we launch the truck I want you to officially name it in a christening ceremony\u201D, Gene broadcasted from his desk in mission control. \u201CI know I have been a bit reluctant about names in the past and I want to change that.

Then let\u2019s go and inform the team.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineering team applauded Wolfheim after they had been informed by Gene. The boss turned to the whole group. \u201CThere is work ahead for all of you. Before we think about the Beta station expansion we have one more thing on our list.\u201D Gene elaborated on a new contract to upgrade the Alpha station around Mun to double its crew and research capacity. \u201CThis will be a good exercise to prepare the Minmus upgrade\u201D, he added. \u201CAlso, Wolfheim and Wernher will soon have some surprises for you. Get to work on the Alpha expansion!\u201D With that Gene left.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWolfheim and his team created another incarnation of the science station design, based on the latest Gamma installment. A crew module and a science lab was the requirement. To meet the high electric charge requirements of the contract they added large battery discs to the backbone and kept the large solar panels. Extra hardware like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel and a set of reaction wheels would go into a large service bay, four additional docking ports completed the exterior design.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the electronics side they had some great new gadgets to play with. Wolfheim decided to give the newly acquired remote guidance unit a try. It could serve well as the central control point of the upgraded Alpha complex but could also provide guidance to the Mun lander when operating on the outer side of Mun. To upgrade the communication equipment of the station further, the engineers added a high gain 88-88 antenna and an RA-15 relay antenna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the next tanker ship from Minmus was completing its aerobraking orbits in Kerbins low atmosphere we rolled the Alpha expansion to the pad on top of a rather small launch stage. Gene had planned to use the Minmus tanker as a transit stage for a payload again, this time to Mun. We would just dock both the tanker and the Alpha expansion at Gamma in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, mate the two and bring them on their target trajectory to Mun. This plan worked out very well and the Alpha station has now doubled its science and crew capabilities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Minmus tanker would have to be relocated from Mun to Minmus at some time in the future, ideally with an efficient swing-by maneuver around Kerbin. Mission control took the task to plan for the relocation.

Wolfheim had a thrilling time showing Jett around his offices and presenting his next projects to the talented constructor. The two spent quite some time and a few drinks dwelling about engineering, construction and design. Benten elatedly invited selected guests into the spacious, four-seated cockpit of the Kerlumbia and explained each and every button to them.

He turned to his right and looked at Wolfheim Kerman who was occupying the copilot seat for this first flight of the new shuttle. \u0022You ready, mate?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t wait, get her going\u0022, Wolfheim grinned. Benten reached for the thrust levers and pushed them fully forward with one slow move. The cockpit vibrated from the roar of the five RAPIER engines in the back of the shuttle. The two pilots were pushed against the backrests of their seats when their ship jumped forward. Both had completed eight starts and landings for training purposes during the last two days, at daytime and at night. They had experienced this acceleration before but Wolfheim was still as impressed. He had not taken the training Benten had received so for him everything was still new. But this time it was for real. They would go all the way to orbit with a four-seated crew module inside the cargo bay. Their mission was to rescue three stranded Kerbals from a low orbit around Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBenten gently rotated the craft and Kerlumbia entered a shallow fifteen-degree climb, fully accelerating. Wolfheim retracted the gear after they had cleared the runway, headed for the stars in front of the cockpit windows on a straight eastern course.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s still amazing. We just keep going and going, keep accelerating like this all the time and then suddenly we are no longer a plane, we are a spaceship\u0022, Wolfheim babbled. \u0022This is a dream to me! And I have dreamt about this ever since I was a child!\u0022 Benten smiled at the engineer. \u0022Sure, but don\u0027t forget to check the altimeter and engine thrust readings. Otherwise we may wake up early from your dream and will still be on a plane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nine thousand five hundred meters\u0022, reported Wolfheim a while later, \u0022airspeed two seven five meters per second.\u0022\u00A0Benten pressed the radio button on his control stick. \u0022Okay, time to go supersonic, ground, do you copy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are go for supersonic, Kerlumbia, throttle up\u0022, Gene replied. Benten carefully pushed the control stick forward to lower the craft\u0027s nose a little bit, then increased thrust. The RAPIERs screamed and the massive ship vibrated just a little more, hitting the surrounding air with increasing force. Kerlumbia climbed while quickly gaining speed. Wolfheim continued reading out the instruments for his fellow pilot and when the ship had passed twenty thousand meters at roughly 950 meters per second, Benten activated the closed loop mode of the engines. Visual signs of thin air heating up around the ship became visible, filling the cockpit with an orange glow. Wolfheim had seen this happening during re-entries before. He looked up from his instruments and saw the sun rising over the horizon right under their nose. They were on course to space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/f1HrHmI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022f1HrHmI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene called: \u0022Kerlumbia, go for the\u00A0NERV engines.\u0022 Wolfheim activated the nuclear thrusters and Benten raised the nose of the ship as they were climbing faster and faster through\u00A0the higher layers of Kerbins atmosphere. \u0022Oxidizer under ten percent, RAPIER engine cutoff in twenty seconds\u0022, announced the engineer. \u0022We\u0027re good\u0022, replied the pilot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt mission control everybody was watching the orbital parameters. Kerlumbia was on course to reach orbit\u00A0ahead of the first stranded capsule. Gene ordered to insert the shuttle in an higher orbit so that the wreckage could catch up to the shuttle. After their circularization burn, Benten and Wolfheim were between five and ten kilometers outside of Ferbald Kerman who was the first to be rescued. Gene was satisfied. \u0022Good job, Kerlumbia. That was one flawless takeoff for our very first spaceplane mission!\u0022 \u0022Thank you, ground. We are glad all went so well. I guess Wolfheim will be wearing that big smile for quite some time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter two orbits the shuttle lowered its trajectory\u00A0to rendezvous with the tiny one-seated can Ferbald was orbiting in. Kerlumbias cargo bay doors were opened to expose the crew module and Benten maneuvered the 100-ton ship carefully up to the can. The remaining distance of roughly one hundred meters would be easy to bridge for Ferbald\u0027s EVA jet pack. Ferbald climbed out of his tiny can and pushed it off which lead the small craft to enter a wild spin. The scientist initialized his thrusters and brought his own spin under control before he aligned himself to face the shuttle. He reached the cargo bay easily and slipped inside the crew module where Benten greeted him. \u0022Welcome aboard, kerbonaut!\u0022 \u0022Glad you came by, I was starting to feel very alone and very hungry inside that tiny thing\u0022, Ferbald said. \u0022They shouldn\u0027t be doing this to scientists like me. I would much rather like to work in an environment like this.\u0022 \u0022I am sure we will have an offer for you. We are constantly looking for scientists as far as I know\u0022, the pilot replied. \u0022Now have seat and a snack. Make yourself comfortable, you will soon have company in here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2QNRVG8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222QNRVG8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBenten and Wolfheim raised Kerlumbia\u0027s orbit again to wait for the next ship to come by. After they had repeated the procedure for a third time over three days they had successfully rescued pilots Kirwell and Zeldous from similar orbital mishaps, had closed the cargo bay doors and had prepared their shuttle for the deorbit burn. They relit the nuclear engines just south of the large meteor crater and entered the upper atmosphere of Kerbin soon after. Benten put the craft in a 35 degree nose-up attitude to expose the full underbelly to the airstream and to bleed as much speed as possible. Wolfheim closely watched the temperature sensor readings and announced necessary attitude corrections. Kerlumbia made her fiery metamorphosis back from spaceship to plane when the engineer reopened the air intakes and fired the RAPIER engines up in air breathing mode. They were exactly on course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ground, we have visual contact. The weather is spectacular. We can clearly see the SSC\u0022, Benten reported. \u0022I am just totally thrilled!\u0022, shouted\u00A0the engineer in a much more enthusiastic outbreak. \u0022We have made it! We are almost back home in the same craft that we launched in! What a great piece of engineering!\u0022 Benten activated the intercom to the crew module in the cargo bay. \u0022Ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing to land at SSC. Put your seats in an upright position and fold up the tables in front of you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2iKuYKD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222iKuYKD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilot performed another perfect landing on the runway at the space center. Kerlumbia touched down in the bright afternoon sunlight of D369 and rolled out before Benten brought it to a halt on the taxiway to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, just like he had done six days earlier during the opening ceremony.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you for flying with Shmauck air and space lines\u0022, he announced over the intercom. \u0022You may now unfasten your seat belts.

Wernher, who knew what was presented, looked into the faces of Benten and\u00A0Wolfheim. \u0022First of all, Kerlumbia will carry the second part of the Alpha expansion into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. It will be mated with a tanker transit at Dawn station. On your way there you will pick up another stranded pilot from orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not again!\u0022 Benten leaned back in his chair. \u0022Oh yes\u0022, Gene chuckled, \u0022I have no idea what these guys are doing wrong but they keep doing it. Anyway, the contracts pay off, especially with our fully reusable shuttle. And most of the stranded\u00A0folks are happy to sign with us after their rescue. Take that new girl Zeldous, she reminds me of Val when she was new. So positive and enthusiastic, even after her breakdown up there. And Kirwell, the other new pilot, he is almost as relaxed as you are, Benten. You should consider picking him for that mission. We\u0027ll run him through the simulator at Quasar\u0027s place so he can join you then.\u0022 Benten nodded briefly, then Gene continued running them through the plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then we will launch your new tanker vessel, Wolfheim. It already has a name.\u00A0Administrator Shmauck managed to\u00A0acquire sponsorship from the Kerbonas corporation so that will be its new designation.\u0022 The engineer leaned forward. \u0022I am thinking about a three-letter-acronym system that works so well in many fields. Can we name the tanker ships FTVs as in fuel transport vessel?\u0022 Benten rolled his eyes and grabbed a bottle of water. \u0022What would we call the Kerlumbia then? BMW as in \u0027big multi-use workhorse\u0027?\u0022 Gene smiled but ignored the remark. \u0022Actually I like the idea. FTV Kerbonas sounds rather professional. I will pass it to Shmauck. And you develop a system that works for other vehicle classes and types, Wolfheim.\u0022\u00A0\u0022Oh, I have already\u0022, the engineer quickly responded, \u0022the fuel storage modules for Dawn station\u00A0will be FSMs and the manned construction vehicle should be called MCV. For the Kerlumbia I could imagine STS as in space transport shuttle.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene interrupted gently, immediately picking up\u00A0the suggestion. \u0022Speaking of the shuttle, there will be another mission for STS Kerlumbia before the end of this year. Wernher?\u0022 \u0022Oh... yes, sure.\u0022\u00A0The head of R\u0026amp;D cleared his throat and sorted his papers. \u0022We have this new device which we call the claw. No idea how that fits into your three-letter acronyms, Wolfheim, but it could be very useful to collect debris from space. We could mount it on a tiny little probe and take it up to orbit in the shuttle cargo bay. And once we collected valuable remains of space debris we could bring it back down with the shuttle.\u0022 \u0022You must be kidding\u0022, said Benten, slowly shaking his head. \u0022Recover the stranded and collect the garbage, that\u0027s what we use this great ship for? STS should stand for stranded and trash service!\u0022 A moment of\u00A0awkward silence passed, then Wernher, Gene and Wolfheim broke out in laughter. Benten, irritated at first, joined in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was a good one, Benten\u0022, Gene finally giggled, \u0022but really, the Kerlumbia can show how versatile she is and you will have an additional mission to train the second pilot.\u0022 \u0022I will think about that small probe to carry the claw and also about an acronym for it\u0022, added Wolfheim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boss prepared\u00A0to close the meeting. \u0022To wrap it up, gentlemen. First is a\u00A0shuttle launch to bring up the next part for Munlab Alpha and to recover a kerbonaut. Second is the commissioning of the new tanker Kerbonas to Minmus. Third is the shuttle launch to recover some component from the orbit. That should bring us close to new year\u0027s eve. We could think about some fireworks.\u0022 Benten smiled briefly and Wernher caught it with a strict look. \u0022Don\u0027t even think of blowing up equipment!\u0022 \u0022Wait and see\u0022, the pilot replied. Gene raised from his chair. \u0022It\u0027s time for me\u00A0to get back to mission control. We are currently moving the Munlab into a polar orbit and once we are there we will prepare a landing in Mun\u0027s polar crater.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA\u00A0viewpoint for the Mun (Y2 D389-D392)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s close enough, well done.\u0022 Benten patted his copilot\u0027s shoulder. Kirwell Kerman had proved to be an eager and fast learner. He had gone through the shuttle trainings and simulator runs with ease. On his first real mission aboard Kerlumbia he\u00A0was tasked to take over the shuttle\u0027s controls and to rendezvous with the Dawn station. He\u00A0had managed to maneuver the large vessel within close range of the station in orbit above Kerbin. Benten pressed the talk button to activate the radio transmission. \u0022Dawn, Kerlumbia here. We have a package to be delivered to the Mun. Will you take over?\u0022 Valentina responded promptly. \u0022Sure thing, guys. I hear you also have a passenger? Welcome to the show, Sigsel!\u0022 Benten turned and looked over his shoulder. Sigsel occupied the seat behind Benten. The pilot had been recovered from his stranded capsule two hours before and had since been quietly sitting in the backseat to follow the procedures between Benten and Kirwell. \u0022Hi, this is Sigsel Kerman. Thank you for the warm welcome.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8Yj08EC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00228Yj08EC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina undocked the Kernoco tanker from the station. The tanker had been brought back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to transfer fuel coming from Minmus and Gene had once again decided to take\u00A0advantage of a tanker rotation to bring another expansion to the station in Mun orbit. Val directed the fully loaded tanker craft from her remote controls inside the station and maneuvered it towards the shuttle. After she had stopped all relative movement, Benten took over the shuttle controls. He brought the shuttle up below the tanker. The payload was a crew module with a viewpoint called cupola, intended to be used by third party crews aboard the Mun station. The module was entirely lacking any means of control and therefore the handover of the payload would have to be treated with maximum care. Kirwell had left his copilot seat and watched the cargo bay monitors to assist Benten and to release the payload from its docking point when needed. Benten called Valentina. \u0022Dawn, Kerlumbia, we\u0027re perfectly aligned, ready when you are.\u0022 Again, Vals response came quickly. \u0022Then release and slowly dive away so I can pick it up. Ground, you copy?\u0022 \u0022Green for payload release\u0022, came Genes brief confirmation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/R7I7yQX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022R7I7yQX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKirwell activated the undocking mechanism and Benten very slowly moved the shuttle aft and down to avoid even the slightest touching of the module. \u0022Dawn, Kerlumbia, we are slowly falling away, payload is stable and stationary, go ahead\u0022, the pilot reported calmly. Val ordered the tanker to follow the shuttle\u0027s movement in constant distance. She used her own instruments and cameras to see what was happening, but\u00A0Kirwell gave additional visual clues from inside the shuttle. After long and tense minutes she had brought the Kernoco tanker in the correct position to dock. With a final puff of lateral forward motion she moved the ship towards the module\u0027s docking port. \u0022Contact, all sensors green\u0022, she reported and then, \u0022docking ports engaged, payload is locked.\u0022 \u0022Well done, Val, congratulations! We\u0027re all very happy here at mission control.\u0022 \u0022Thank you, Gene\u0022, she responded, \u0022now let\u0027s bring Kernoco and the module on course to their destination.\u0022 \u0022Sure, we\u0027ll take over from here\u0022, Gene said. \u0022The trajectory is already programmed. You can watch together with the shuttle crew. We have not\u00A0docked Kerlumbia to the Dawn station yet. Time for another first. And show Sigsel around. Ground out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JzEUwVZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022JzEUwVZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kernoco tanker brought the new module safely to the Mun station and released it by a similar procedure. Danlan Kerman, the current pilot aboard Munlab Alpha, remotely controlled the undocking and left the module stable and stationary in space close to his station. He then undocked the unmanned mini tug and piloted it remotely to dock with the payload. Once he had docked the tug with the module he used the tug to bring it back to the station. Alpha had now received another upgrade and the external contractor happily acknowledged the successful delivery of their module to the station. The mini tug provides the link between the new module and the station for now until there will be a way to move an uncontrollable component from one docking port to another. The new claw may come in handy at some point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Gi00yjZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Gi00yjZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of day 392 Kirwell performed his first landing of the shuttle at SSC under the eyes of Benten.

His main screen now showed the claw tug as it was docked inside the cargo bay of the shuttle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, let\u2019s see what this thing can do\u201D, he murmured when he pressed the undock button and activated the tug\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system. The small tug came free and moved slowly towards the rear end of the bay. With very gentle control inputs Benten stopped the rearward movement and let the craft climb slowly out of the cargo bay. Once the tug had cleared the shuttle, Benten moved it forward until it came into their view outside the cockpit windows.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGround, I am unleashing the beast now\u201D, the pilot commented into his headset, then he activated the claw on the tug. The small ship retracted its front cover and revealed three large metal teeth which spread out at an angle. \u201CLooks like we are ready to bite.\u201D Kirwell had his hands on the shuttle controls and followed the action outside the windows closely, ready to react if needed. \u201CI am\u201D, he said, \u201Cyou can go ahead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBenten steered the tug in an angle towards the narrow end of the piece of fuselage. The main screen in front of him showed a camera view from inside the claw. His eyes frequently moved between the front window and the screen while Kirwell was reading the distance measurements for him from his instrument panel. \u201CTen meters at one per second\u2026 eight\u2026 six\u2026\u201D, Benten activated forward thrust, \u201C\u2026 three at one point four\u2026 contact\u2026\u201D The claw mechanism activated itself due to the proximity of the object, the teeth closed and grabbed the hull. \u201CGround, we have a capture.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood job, Kerlumbia!\u201D Genes response came promptly. \u201CCan you provide us with visual clues about the actual size of the piece?\u201D \u201CSure we can\u201D, Benten replied, \u201CI will maneuver the tug over the cargo bay so we can take a closer look.\u201D A few minutes later the tug and its prey was parking close above the shuttle and it was very obvious that the combination of both would not fit inside the cargo bay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UsjB8K6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UsjB8K6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene communicated the next steps. \u201COkay, Kerlumbia, we will work something out. For the moment we want you to dock the tug to the shuttle nose port and report back. We have a mission update for you.\u201D Benten and Kirwell exchanged looks, then Benten pressed the talk button. \u201CRoger, ground, we can\u2019t wait.\u201D The two men proceeded as they were told. Benten aligned the tug\u2019s rear docking port with Kerlumbia\u2019s nose and Kirwell opened the shield. \u201CNow our ship gets a real mouth\u201D, he chuckled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the claw tug was safely docked to the shuttle, Gene revealed the adjusted mission objectives to them. \u201CI know how you feel about it, guys, but we have two more stranded astronauts to rescue. One of them is in a very practical spot between your current position and Dawn station. You\u2019ll be passing by anyway so just pick up the poor soul.\u201D Benten sighed. \u201CAnd?\u0060\u201D \u201CThe other is on a highly inclined and eccentrical orbit around Kerbin. We did the maths down here. You managed to get to orbit very efficiently with lots of spare fuel. You won\u2019t have problems to reach that other guy after your rendezvous with \u2018Dawn\u2019.\u201D Benten nodded. \u201CThat second one sounds like fun, actually, as it involves more flying and higher orbits.\u201D Gene sounded happy. \u201CI knew you would like that, Benten. Proceed to the capsule of Nelely Kerman and then on to Dawn. We need to get that piece of fuselage stowed properly and the folks aboard the station will help you with that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rescue of Nelely Kerman went smoothly and four and a half hours later Kerlumbia arrived at the Dawn station with one additional crew member on board. Mission control linked the comms of the two crews together and Gene, Wernher and Wolfheim joined the conference from the SSC. Gene explained: \u201CWe have a solution which involves some construction work on the cargo bay doors. As the fuselage adapter will not fit inside the bay we will have to cut out a circular hole. Here\u2019s a drawing.\u201D He switched from camera to presentation mode and showed them what Wolfheim had rapidly scribbled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat means we release the fuselage from the claw, re-grab it on its upside and let the narrow bit stick out upwards when we dock the tug in the bay?\u201D, the shuttle pilot asked. \u201CExactly, Benten. And that shape needs to be cut from the cargo bay doors\u201D, Wolfheim added and Benten laughed. \u201CThat\u2019s so crazy that I actually like the idea!\u201D Valentina raised her hand. \u201CAre we sure that the shuttle\u2019s structural integrity is not affected?\u201D \u201DYes, I checked that with Jett\u201D, said Wolfheim and Gene added: \u201CWe will also have no problem during re-entry as the upper fuselage of the shuttle is not exposed to plasma. Aerodynamics will suffer a bit but Kerlumbia can cope with that. And after landing she will get a new set of doors.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene talked them through the planned EVA and explained the required procedures to perform the construction work. The fuselage adapter was released from the claw, re-grabbed and docked inside the bay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zSxqQxe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zSxqQxe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina, Urslev, Benten and Kirwell went outside while Nelely remained in the shuttle and Reiritz remained aboard the Dawn station to watch over the operation. Another three hours later the team had completed the task and had re-entered their vehicles. The cargo bay doors had been closed to confirm the successful completion of the work and the hole was exactly where it was needed. The narrow part of the debris stuck out of the shuttle\u2019s top side. Mission control congratulated the joint crews for their accomplishment. Benten and Kirwell docked the shuttle to the station and the crews finally got to meet without their EVA helmets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe astronauts spent some free hours it was time for the shuttle crew to prepare for the last leg of their trip. Kirwell undocked Kerlumbia and fired the nuclear engines to put them on an intercept trajectory with Hadfel Kermans capsule five and a half thousand kilometers above Kerbin. It took them five days and a couple of orbits to reach their rendezvous point and when they finally reached it, Hadfel was as impressed as Nelely was about the shuttle and the precision with which Benten flew it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YqyMOwd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YqyMOwd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHadfel climbed out of his capsule and performed a very short spacewalk to enter Kerlumbia and fill the last seat in the cockpit. Benten then turned to his three companions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys, it\u0027s time to hurry home. I had a little surprise on my mind and it seems our timing is just right. If all goes well, we will arrive at SSC for the new year\u0027s fireworks and I think we should add some flames to it.\u0022 He smiled. \u0022I plan to re-enter the atmosphere a little later than I normally would so we zoom across the night sky above SSC in a ball of fire.\u0022 Kirwell laughed, but the newcomers looked somewhat concerned. \u0022Will you be allowed to do that?\u0022, Hadfel wanted to know. \u0022I guess not\u0022, Benten replied, \u0022that\u0027s why I won\u0027t ask.\u0022 Nelely shared Hadfels concerns. \u0022Will we be facing negative consequences for such a stunt? I wanted to apply for a spot in your team after our landing.\u0022 \u0022You should not worry\u0022, Benten tried to calm them. \u0022All responsibility is with me. I am the pilot and if I make a bad judgement on the re-entry angle then who would blame me for that?\u0022 They all smiled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNine hours later the shuttle hit the upper atmosphere of Kerbin and Benten informed the ground crew about his \u0022error\u0022. \u0022I knew it. He hinted something like that\u0022, Wernher told Gene. \u0022I remember. It may be spectacular though, so let\u0027s get the staff outside\u0022, Gene said smiling. In the end, most of the night shift watched a bright orange trail of fire high above the SSC campus to welcome the third year of Shmauck\u0027s space program.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-27T14:30:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2019 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Shmauck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-28T14:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003ENew Year (Y3 D001)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelcome, my fellow space enthusiasts.\u201D Administrator Shmauck\u2019s voice filled the large void inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, amplified by speakers mounted on the first floor of the assembly structure. The entire staff of SSC was seated in long rows of chairs on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E floor, facing away from the giant main gate. Shmauck stood at a sleek desk in the middle of the first floor and smiled down at the crowd.

It marks the beginning of the exciting next steps of our mission into the Kerbol system. In this third year we shall greatly enhance and advance our capabilities and our facilities. Before I come to the future, let\u2019s look at what we have achieved until this day.\u201D Behind Shmauck a projection screen showed a timeline with milestones of the past two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe learned to fly into the atmosphere, then into space. We learned to dock vehicles in orbit and to assemble multiple vehicles to stations. We learned to put Kerbals on orbit and to perform EVAs and spacewalks. We flew to Mun and Minmus. We established permanent outposts on orbits around Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. We launched satellites and probes to these bodies and beyond. We deployed two bases on Minmus and established a productive mining operation there. And we sent a manned ship out to our neighbor planet of Duna.\u201D He paused for a round of applause from the audience. \u201CWe learned, we researched, we designed and constructed. We made mistakes and learned from them. We flew and we landed, we rescued and grew, we recovered and reused. Our story is a great story of success and we can all be very proud!\u201D The audience applauded again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt this very moment we have three Kerbals orbiting Kerbin\u2026\u201D While the administrator spoke, the screen behind him changed and showed a live camera image from the Dawn station.

During this year we will largely expand our \u2018Dawn\u2019 station in Kerbins orbit. We will establish permanent communication capabilities at Minmus. We will turn our orbital outpost there into the much larger \u2018Rise\u2019 station. We will develop, build and send a roving base to Duna and Ike.

Xandra and Wolfheim sat side by side in the audience. They had been seeing each other for lunch and dinner on several occasions in the past weeks and both enjoyed the growing friendship between them. Xandra was attracted by Wolfheim\u2019s humble intelligence and Wolfheim enjoyed her openness and her always positive attitude. She hinted over her shoulder with her thumb and leaned over to him. \u201CWe should get this thing into space rather than listen to boring budget details\u201D, she whispered giggling. \u201CI can\u2019t wait\u201D, he replied.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZeldous Kerman, the former stranded pilot, was seated between Kirwell and Ferbald, who had been rescued during the same Kerlumbia mission with her. After their rescue, all three had abandoned their former employers and had moved into a shared house close to SSC. While Kirwell had almost immediately been named as the second Kerlumbia pilot, Zeldous and Ferbald had started to train for an assignment to the roving base Shmauck had mentioned during his presentation. Kirwell whispered: \u201CNelely over there is a great guy. We rescued him from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and I spent six days with him in the shuttle. He is going to apply for a spot and he could fit nicely in your team.\u201D Zeldous asked: \u201CAnd the other one you picked up?\u201D \u201CHadfel? I really can\u2019t say much about him.

The audience raised from their chairs and moved towards the long tables at both sides of the large building. The celebration lasted for another hour with Kerbals chatting, laughing and having the occasional sip of Kerpagne.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shmauck","CreatedById":196571,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-03T15:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDawning part one (Y3 D002)\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022MCV Dawn, you are go for launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWenbrecht Kerman relaxed his muscles willingly. He felt very tense in his excitement and he repeatedly found himself grabbing his armrests much tighter than necessary. \u0022Roger, ground, I confirm go for launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus ten, nine, eight, ...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing Wenbrecht saw outside the cockpit canopy of his Mk1 inline cockpit was the inside of a huge payload fairing. His tiny manned construction vehicle was mounted on top of a long thin structure called the Dawn fuel core and both parts were stowed in the protective fairing. His seat began to vibrate as the fuel pumps far below started to come to live.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Five... four... three...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWenbrecht felt the chemical engines ignite. He closed his eyes. This was supposed to be his return to space after he had experienced a catastrophic incident more than one year ago with another agency. Since then, he had received treatment to slowly recover and overcome his panic attacks. He had spent endless hours in the simulators at SSC to achieve flight readiness again. And now he was assigned to an extended mission in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to work as a pilot operating the construction vehicle which would carry out the assembly of the Dawn space station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Two... one... go!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe memories of his last real launch flooded Wenbrecht as soon as he felt g-forces grasping his body. The incident had begun immediately after his orbital rocket had lifted off the launch pad. One of the booster engines had started to lose thrust and the failure of the engine had led to a significant course deviation and then to an inability to reach orbit normally. His former ground crew had then decided to burn the first stage with just the main engine and to shut down and separate the boosters as quickly as possible. The faulty booster had exploded briefly afterwards causing damage to a fuel pump of the main engine. In the end, they managed to put him in orbit in one piece but with a damaged heat shield. That was the moment when they had called for help. All this appeared before Wenbrecht\u0027s eyes while his Dawn launcher ascended from SSC.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Clean liftoff and we\u0027re right on course, Wenbrecht.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene spoke very calmly, knowing that the pilot would be under additional stress during this phase of the flight. The head of mission control had decided to be the capsule communicator himself as an additional sign of safety. \u0022We\u0027ve passed maximum dynamic pressure and are throttling up again into the gravity turn. It all looks very good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon Wenbrecht felt the first pair of boosters separate from his launcher and to his relief, no explosion occurred. He started to calm down when the acceleration lowered. His navball indicated that his trajectory was already below 45 degrees and his orbital speed increased over six hundred meters per second. After the second pair of boosters had separated he was very confident that he had overcome the worst part, safely and flawlessly. He pressed the talk button on his control stick. \u0022Ground, I am okay now. Thank you all for your patience. It\u0027s great to be back in space and I didn\u0027t think I would say that someday.\u0022 \u0022Roger, Dawn MCV. Standby for payload fairing deploy. It\u0027s about time you see where we brought you\u0022, replied Gene with a smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shell around his cockpit broke up and Wenbrecht saw the giant ball of Kerbin hanging dark above his head. \u0022Standby for main engine shutdown\u0022, came Genes voice out of his headphones. \u0022Okay, we\u0027re almost there. Circularization burn in about two minutes, Wenbrecht. All systems nominal.\u0022 The pilot turned his head. His eyes followed the struts to the central part of the Dawn fuel core. Everything looked stable and in perfect order.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022FeNEaS7.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FeNEaS7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the cicularization burn the ground crew confirmed a good orbit. Wenbrecht took control of the long thin vehicle and tried to roll, pitch and yaw on reaction wheels only to see how it responded. \u0022The ship feels bulky and slow but I am sure it will work as it did in the simulator\u0022, radioed the pilot. \u0022Roger, MCV, you should be seeing the station soon. We have some spare fuel in the launcher that we want to conserve so your first docking will be forward.\u0022 Val came over the radio. \u0022Ground, Dawn here, we can see the ship approaching.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWenbrecht confirmed the sighting and a little while later brought his ship to a halt close by the orbiting station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022XuUQKxg.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XuUQKxg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, ground, I am ready for the first docking\u0022, the pilot reported. Gene gave his go-ahead and Val confirmed the station was ready to receive the MCV and its fuel core subassembly. By then, Wenbrecht had completely overcome his anxiety of the launch phase. He was now a fully-focused pilot, having his hands on the controls and his eyes locked onto his target, the northern docking port of Dawn. He maneuvered his ship around the station and finally docked the front port of the MCV with the station. After he had confirmed good docking to mission control, all the excess fuel of his launcher was pumped into the original launcher stage of the Dawn station. With enough fuel for a controlled termination in Kerbins atmosphere left in its tanks, the launch stage was undocked from the station expansion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022hlyicQ1.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hlyicQ1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, now comes the hard part\u0022, Gene said after the launch stage was out of sight and on its way to its fiery death. Wenbrecht undocked the MCV and turned the remaining MCV and fuel core combo by 180 degrees. The detached launcher stage had freed the docking port which was supposed to make the final connection to the existing segment of Dawn. The pilot carefully reversed the subassembly into the northern port. Val assisted with visual clues to ensure a correct alignment of the expansion module. After the docking ports had engaged, the Dawn station had become more than three times as long as it had been.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022kibwEhr.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kibwEhr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal connected the systems of the fuel core expansion and the station and took the necessary steps to even out the air pressure between both. Then she opened the docking hatch. \u0022I am feeling a little adventurous here, I go where no one has gone before\u0022, she giggled into her headset. \u0022Reminds me of the day when I entered the Dawn station for the first time!\u0022 Val pulled her floating body forward through the long pipe towards the center module of the fuel core. She inspected the center module and the other pipe as well, then reported to mission control. \u0022Looks like everything got here in great shape. Thank you for all this new space!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger, Dawn, that\u0027s just the first step, there is more to come\u0022, Gene replied. \u0022Wenbrecht, you can now release the struts and redock the MCV to join the Dawn crew. Take a bit of a rest, we are ready to send up the first fuel module.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
