Magnificent! Too bad I got interrupted while I was reading it so didn\u0027t reply to that thread and now I can\u0027t find it. Oh well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to business. Kethane. Previously only known as a source of blue flames when drunk Kerbals had been eating too many snacks, recently it\u0027s been discovered throughout the Kerbin system and there\u0027s no reason not to expect to find it everywhere else. The promise this gives of ending fuel shortage problems inspired the boffins to create the Kethane Travelling Circus. This will consist of a mobile space station known as the KethLab Mothership, which will refine Kethane into LOF and monopropellant for itself and various other ships. Some of the various other ships are the drilling rigs that will provide Kethane to the Kethlab Mothership, so it\u0027s sort of a self-perpetuating monstronsity. Other uses will include dedicated landers and whatnot to explore the various systems visited as the KTC moves around, to be sent out from home and left at that planet. This is because the main purpose of the KTC is just to cruise all around the Kerbol system in a long, \u0022lost weekend\u0022 sort of expedition, doing whatever comes to mind at the time, leaving a long trail of discarded boosters, tugs, tankers, and Kerbals in its wake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst on the agenda is the despoiling of Duna and Ike. The highlight of this gig will be the DORK, a name decided upon because somebody else has already used DERP. The DORK is the Duna Overflight Requiring Kethane, previous working title having been Keth-o-Plane (thanks to King Snoke for the name). Basically a jet using the Kethane engines. Light weight, huge wing, intended for very thin air. Here it is during testing on Kerbin, where it was able to take off at 15m/s:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dajm7Sc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dajm7Sc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch to my surprise, the 0.21 SAS was able to get this thing off the ground, just a routine launch. But then, I\u0027m not using FAR like I was in 0.20. I strongly suspect this thing would be impossible in FAR, or would need to be an SSTO. I\u0027ve had 1 successful SSTO and don\u0027t wish to repeat the experience so I\u0027ve very glad I was able to launch it as a rocket. I have no idea at all whether this will work on Duna but that\u0027s why Kerbalnauts get paid like the lab rats they are \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then I built the KethLab Mothership gave it a thorough shakedown, testing docking ports and moving it around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/84xq4Y2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002284xq4Y2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KethLab Mothership is the essentially vertical part, the upper half being the KethLab and the lower half with all the docking ports being the Mothership, each launched individually, plus the tug (not show) to move it around. In the lower right, you can see the DORK and its tug really did get to orbit. That was 1 launch. In the lower left is Ike Rig #1 Kethane drill. This was 2 launches to get here, one for the rig and the Keth Scan/MapSat probe formerly attached to where it\u0027s now docked, and the transfer tug for both (neither shown). Something like this will eventually happen at Duna when the DORK loads its fuel tanks before attempting re-entry. Another pleasant surprise in all this was that the solar panels didn\u0027t hit each other or other ships, because I sure didn\u0027t know they had clearance beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, the basic design of the KethLab Mothership worked, so it was time to see if I could move it as a unit or would have to assemble it at Duna, so up went the transfer tug I\u0027d designed for it and off went the rig and the DORK to their separate fates. I have long-standing habits of not trusting multi-part ships to stay together, least of all not wobble, and the same goes for copious amounts of Space Tape. So, I built the tug double-ended and tried it first as a tractor, in a free-return figure-8 orbit around Mun and back to repeated aerobraking tests at Kerbin. Everything worked perfectly, yet another surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Zu1GTq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226Zu1GTq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I was back where I\u0027d started, I switched ends with the tug and tried the same trip as a pusher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TPu5Z0A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TPu5Z0A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmazingly, this was just as stable as using it as a tractor. Because the pusher mode as zero chance of burning any parts of the KethLab Mothership and seems just as practicable, that will be how I\u0027ll do it for real. Which means I can get rid of the long outriggers for the engines and the associated strutting. Hell, I can get rid of lots of lacing struts all over the thing because rockets seem much more structurally secure in 0.21. With things as they are, including the tug the KethLab Mothership has 275 parts, which seems to be bogging even my top-end, liquid-cooled computer. That needs to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot mentioned so far is the infrastructure on Duna to support the DORK. This will be another Kethane drill and a fuel bowser rover to move raw Kethane between the drill and the DORK. The drill will have rudimentary housing for whichever poor Kerbal I end up stranding as permanent gas station attendant (working the KAS on the bowser). There are also plans to get most of the infrastructure set up before sending out any Kerbals because they can\u0027t do much more than plant flags and work KAS anyway, so they\u0027ll go out in another ship that\u0027s capable of getting home, and will have a lander to get down to the DORK base that\u0027s already been set up by remote control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-02T14:35:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2013 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ramnrmeul","CreatedById":48560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy is the rover called a \u0027Bowser\u0027 rover?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ramnrmeul\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ramnrmeul\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy is the rover called a \u0027Bowser\u0027 rover?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason people in the aviation business say \u0022bowser\u0022 where everybody else in the world says \u0022fuel truck\u0022.

So, after creating a new save game and copying the craft files over (to simulate all the testing having been done in a simulator without anything actually leaving the ground), I set to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KTC\u0027s Duna gig is currently envisioned as consisting of 3 waves:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Getting the Kethane drills to Duna and Ike (including mapping both for Kethane and surface features), and getting the refining station in Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Creating the airbase on Duna by sending over the Dork and the bowser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Finally sending out Kerbals to actually use this stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st wave is the biggest and most complex, and just getting it off the ground was the job for today session. This wave consists of 3 interplanetary ships, the Ike Package, the Duna Package, and the KethLab MotherShip. The Ike and Duna Packages are drills and probes, with the Duna drill intending to be essentially a permanent fixture at the future airbase, while the Ike drill will hump Kethane down from Ike to the orbital refinery, to keep the ships fueled. All 3 ships were assembled in orbit from 7 launches and 5 dockings. This all took lots of real time and nothing exciting happened (thanks to all the testing). The rest of this post will just show how this happened. Boring stuff, but I\u0027m somewhat proud of having suffered through it. Most of the 7 launches used my standard ascent stage for 20-30ton payloads, which I\u0027ve been using for several months now. Being an unimaginative sort, I just call it \u0022the lifter\u0022. So there\u0027s not a lot of rocket variation in the pics, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, 1st up was the Ike drill/probe combo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YNZgvqS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YNZgvqS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the Duna drill/probe combo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EfdL301.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EfdL301.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen 2 nearly identical transfer tugs, 1 for each drill/probe combo. The only difference in the tugs is that they have lights in different places so I can tell them apart visually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bTuc76T.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bTuc76T.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese 4 launches and 2 dockings resulted in the fully assembled Ike Package.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5KI8ou6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225KI8ou6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....and Duna Pakage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q2QPXhp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022q2QPXhp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the KethLab MotherShip, which required 3 launches and 3 dockings. The MotherShip going up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1gK5Yur.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221gK5Yur.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extra docking involved in this assembly was just switching the MotherShip\u0027s small auxiliary tug from 1 end to the other. Don\u0027t know if I\u0027m really going to take this little tug all the way to Duna, but it might be useful so for now it\u0027s in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wi0lEHH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wi0lEHH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KethLab was the only really different launch vehicle. I don\u0027t have any empty tank mods and all the docking ports made TAC Fuel Balancer go nuts, so in the end I opted to burn the tank empty on the way up and made an asparagus-ish thing, which as you can see I normally don\u0027t do. The above issues also necessitated putting a separator between the small tug and the main KethLab, turning the tug into a disposable booster, which I jettisoned just before docking by shifting into reverse with RCS once I was more or less lined up with the MotherShip, firing the separator, then coming back forward with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KethLab on the pad showing its crossfeeding nature:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gqQhW5n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gqQhW5n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJettisoning the KethLab booster during the docking process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XYkFoGL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XYkFoGL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there was the transfer tug for the KethLab MotherShip. As shown in Episode 1, this was originally built to be used as a tractor but testing showed it worked just as well as a pusher, so I redesigned it to become a dedicated pusher. This let me reduce the part count somewhat by pulling the engines in closer to the middle. This was also launched with the standard ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nuok2ci.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nuok2ci.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so at last all 3 ships were complete. The KethLab MotherShip deployed its panels and antennae to make sure they worked, then stowed the panels to await the transfer window. The antennae of course are stuck open but testing showed they survive aerobraking just fine so no big deal. And no big deal if they don\u0027t, because they don\u0027t do anything anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nQF4gbR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nQF4gbR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, there we are.

None of the tugs had used enough fuel during assembly to warrant the hassle of sending up tankers. So, fast forward and off we go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was my 1st attempt in KSP at doing a flotilla of ships in the same launch window so at the back of my mind I was always worried they\u0027d all arrive at once, despite knowing from that other game this probably wouldn\u0027t happen. SO I just burned them 1 after the other, waiting only long enough between them to create nodes and come around the orbit to them, trusting to this slight time difference, imperfections in the burns, and mid-course tweaks to spread them out manageably far apart at the Duna end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off the mark was the KethLab MotherShip with its untested redesigned pusher tug.

Sure enough, there was no need to worry about the next ship arriving while trying to do the aerobrake on the 1st. Despite leaving 1st, the KethLab MotherShip ended up being about 4 weeks behind 1st-arriving Ike Package, with Duna Package being 10 days behind Ike Package. This time difference allowed the Ike Package to complete Phase 1 of its mission with 2 days to spare before Duna Package arrives. So the rest of this episode will just be about the Ike Package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ike Package has the most demanding job in the 1st Wave. Phase 1 of the Ike Package\u0027s mission was to 1) map Ike, 2) scan Ike for Kethane, 3) obtain a load of Kethane, and 4) get the Kethane into Ike orbit to await the arrival of the KethLab MotherShip. Because the Ike Package as no refining capability, all fuel required for these objectives had to come from Kerbin so the delta-V budget was rather tight. That will change once the KethLab MotherShip arrives, but for Ike Package Phase 1, everything had to go essentially flawlessly. And none of the later stages had been tested, just calculated on paper, so I wasn\u0027t sure it would all work. So, after offering a libation to the Delta-V Gods, I gave it a go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon arrival, much depended on the initial aerobrake maneuver. Every one is different and there are no hard-and-fast rules so I feel no shame in F5/F9 until I get it right, to simulate Mission Control running simulations \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. As it turned out with this ship, aiming for an 11km periapsis worked swimmingly. During the pass, I got down to 10km and was slightly worried. Here, the Ike Package passes a high mountain, glad it wasn\u0027t directly ahead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZGdRSKs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZGdRSKs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerobraking put me into an elliptical orbit with an apoapsis about 2.3Mm out, about 3/4 as far out as Ike. Which was where I was going anyway. Perfect! It took negligible delta-V to circularize this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L5Sy9D3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L5Sy9D3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then it was just a matter of riding around waiting for the best phase angle, like I did coming out here to begin with, then a mere fart of a burn to coast out to Ike. While setting up this maneuver node, I had a strange thing happen that I\u0027ve never seen before. There came a point while pulling on the gizmos that it showed me captured into Ike orbit immediately upon entering its SOI. And doing this cost only 35 delta-V!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4s9Bakk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224s9Bakk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, I had to give it a try, for bragging rights if nothing else. But I didn\u0027t trust it so Mission Control simulated this, too (F5/F9 again). Turns out, the above picture was a lie. What happened was, I actually hit Ike\u0027s SOI at about where the ascending node is shown, and from there nearly an instant lithobrake before I could do anything. So, if you ever get something like this, be VERY CAREFUL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. After I reloaded the quicksave, I just did the normal thing and all went well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027d done all I could in the delta-V battle. I\u0027d used about 1050m/s leaving Kerbin. After that, getting into a 235km equatorial Ike orbit had coast about 250m/s total. So now it was time to see if what I had left was enough to complete Phase 1. First step was to pump some fuel into Doodlebug Ike*, the mapping probe, and send it on its way. I only gave it about 1/2 a tank. It needed a fair amount to get into a polar orbit but it\u0027s very light so didn\u0027t need much, and I was worried I might not be able to get any excess fuel back once Ike was mapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*NOTE: \u0022Doodlebug\u0022 is oilfield slang for guys who use explosives and geophones to detect oil here on Earth.

Mapping planets is boring but doesn\u0027t hold a candle to scanning for Kethane. GEEZ, that takes a long time, even at 100x time warp, even on a small place like Ike, tying up the computer until it\u0027s done. But finally, with about 2.5 days remaining before the next ship arrives, I figured I knew enough to commit the Ike Rig No. 1 (another oilfield term) to a landing on a Kethane field. I was waiting to find one that was reasonably close to the equator to minimize delta-V, on reasonably flat ground for a safe landing, had at least 16,000 \u0022barrels\u0022 in it to fill the rig\u0027s tanks, and was on the sunny side so I could get to work immediately. I finally found such a place so made sure the rig\u0027s fuel tanks were full then finished the break-up of the Ike Package into Ike Rig No. 1 and Tug Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke Rig No. 1 landed successfully and got a gusher right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YHvIapS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YHvIapS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt only took about 1/2 a day to fill its tanks, finishing just as the sun was setting.

Would that be enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cKjmGXk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cKjmGXk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I put the rig up into a 20km orbit, about all it had fuel for (about 230 delta-V left). Then I brought the tug down to it and linked them up, on the opposite end from the way they\u0027d gone out, and pumped the rig\u0027s remaining fuel back into the tug.

But the devil is in the details. Note the small size of the probe in the pic above, no bigger than a beer keg thanks to having to sit atop the generator. Pre-launch testing had shown that bringing the whole package in with a polar orbit, while it made life easy for the probe, was a real pain for the rest of the package, mostly because all the other main components of the KTC will be in equatorial orbits, meaning Tug Duna would become essentially useless. So, the package had to come in equatorial, which put a strain on the probe then getting into polar orbit. Much paper calculations showed that if the package settled into about a 500km equatorial orbit, Doodlebug Duna would have just enough juice to establish itself in a 87.8km orbit inclined 85.9^. So no quick, high-altitude mapping this time, just the slow, low-altitude orbit doing mapping and Kethane together. Oh well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now to aerobrake into an orbit of the correct size. Because the Duna Package had a different configuration and was coming in with less velocity, data gained from the Ike Package couldn\u0027t be used directly, but could be fed into the simulator back at Mission Control to figure out how to aerobrake the Duna Package. Eventually, the boffins decided (several F5/F9 tweaks later) that a periapsis of about 11800m would probably work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo down went the Duna Package. Here it is discovering a terrain feature that has now been officially named Aerobrake Valley.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VWzvqQg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VWzvqQg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis resulted in a 435km apoapsis on the other side, which would have to do. Was the probe up to it? Only 1 way to find out. So Doodlebug Duna pumped its tiny fuel tank full and set off. Much to everyone\u0027s surprise, it made it into the desired orbit with about 200m/s to spare.

It had a good supply of Kethane. But it was at medium altitude and from what they could tell of the terrain from orbit, it wasn\u0027t particularly flat.

Fortunately, all I had to do was hit somewhere in a big green blob, although I really wanted to be as close to the eastern edge as possible, because from what I could tell that looked the flattest. So, I just used MJ to set a target mark on the surface and keep me pointed retro while I did the burns and watched what my path was doing. I set the target in the center of the blob right under my orbit and guesstimated 3 Kethane hexes east of it as the lead required by the atmospheric drag and Duna\u0027s rotation. Then I fired the engines and down I went. I warped at 5x until I hit the atmosphere, watching in the map how my path was moving. It had crept 1 hex west toward the target mark so I figured I was good.

There\u0027s a reasonable amount of flat ground in the immediate vicinity of Airbase Duna and the DORK is a SSTOL (SERIOUSLY short takeoff and landing) plane. If this was Kerbin, I\u0027d say no problem. But this is 2500m up on Duna so no telling until the DORK arrives in the 2nd wave. On the bright side, however, the rolling sand dunes stretching to the horizon don\u0027t seem to impose any obstacles to rover travel. Thus, the bowser\u0027s landing doesn\u0027t have to be that close to the Airbase; it can drive here, and it or hopefully the DORK can fetch wayward Kerbals when their lander arrives (now moved up to the 2nd wave). When they get here, they\u0027ll have a home already established (thanks to the Hitchhiker on the Airbase).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETune in next time for the arrive of the KethLab MotherShip, which should be uneventful, although once it gets here the reassembled Ike Package will have to carefully rendezvous with it to deliver its load of Kethane.

Most of the boffins back at Mission Control were confident this was enough to rendezvous with the KLMS but some were skeptical because EVERY mission so far has always taken more fuel than expected.

The 16000 units of Kethane proved to be enough to totally refuel the Ike Package and almost refuel the KLMS, too, all before the sun went down. 1 more trip to Ike should be enough to top off the KLMS, refuel Tug Duna, and still have enough raw Kethane left over to fill up the DORK when it arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZXjodkK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZXjodkK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, apart from this 1 trip back to Ike, Phase 1 of the Duna Gig 1st Wave is complete.

This had passed initial flight and launch tests with flying colors, but an unexpected problem arose with its powerplant, the KE-J65 Zero-Bypass Kethane Turbine. Further testing discovered that this engine cut in and out totally unpredictably, making it unsuitable for any imagined use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the engineers set to work redesigning the engine (my 1st and only hack of a CFG file), resulting in the KE-J85D, designed for better performance in a light aircraft and with the air intakes tweaked to work better in Duna\u0027s thin air. 2 of these were hastily retrofitted to the DORK which, along with several other minor modifications, resulted in it becoming the Mk III.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this time, the new simulator (aka HyperEdit in a separate saved game) was up and running at KSC so for the 1st time it was actually possible to get decent flight data for the conditions on Duna, instead of just high altitude at Kerbin. This showed that while the new engine could be expected to perform adequately, the whole DORK airframe had a tragic flaw. It could enter the atmosphere and fly around no problem, but despite its incredible STOL performance on Kerbin, it was incapable of slowing down to less than about 80m/s on landing. This proved totally disastrous in the hilly sand dunes around Airbase Duna\u0027s location, every single landing attempt ending in multiple fireballs. There was thus nothing for it but to go back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 teams set to work, one attempting to retain as many features of the DORK as possible, especially the need to burn Kethane because that was the whole point of the mission. The other team investigated electric power, abandoning the whole Kethane thing. Both teams at first tried to retain the DORK\u0027s interior seating for 3 Kerbals which, combined with attempts to increase wing area, resulted in rather large designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2ukNhac.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222ukNhac.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we see some of the bigger ideas. Going clockwise, top left is the DORK Mk III. It could fly on Duna but couldn\u0027t land. Top right is the DEF (Duna Electric Flier), utilizing a massive RTG and carrying a Hitchhiker as well. Sadly, on Kerbin, it couldn\u0027t even reach the equivalent altitude of Airbase Duna. Bottom right is the DORK 2 or \u0022Double DORK\u0022, essentially the same fuselage as before but with twice the wing area. This designed was unable to fly on Kerbin without tumbling uncontrollably. Finally, in the bottom left is the DRUNK (Duna Recon Using Natural Kethane). This dropped seating to 2 but both were still inside, and was the 1st to use a hybrid Kethane-electric power plant. It worked well enough put into the Duna simulator, where it was able to enter the atmosphere and land safely. However, it lacked the power to take off again. By this time, the engineers were beginning to realize they needed not only more wing but less weight, so these big designs were abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u9OIGsJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022u9OIGsJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now smaller designs appeared. On the left is the DORK 3, little more than wings and the KE-J85D engine with 2 lawn chairs taped on the front. This proved to have the same problems as the original DORK only worse--the engine was far too powerful for this light plane so it never advanced beyond testing on Kerbin. The electric team, meanwhile, made the DEB (Duna Electric Biplane), also going for the minimalist approach. While this flew quite well, testing on Kerbin showed that it could only fly heading away from the sun, its operational parameters were too limited, although it probably would have flown well on Duna. And finally, somebody suggested abandoning wings entirely and using a balloon, resulting in the DKZ (Duna Kethane Zeppelin). However, the unavailability of a suitable balloon left this project in the mock-up stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, just when the whole idea of flying around on Duna seemed on the verge of defeat, some mad genious combined the best features of several of these failed designs and created the DOH (Duna Overflight Hybrid):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PUkwKWs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PUkwKWs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has the 2 open seats of the DORK 3, the Kethane-electirc hybrid propulsion system of the DRUNK upgraded to 2 engines, and 2 sets of the original DORK\u0027s wings from the auspicious flights of the DEB. High-altitude tests on Kerbin showed promise, especially if there was lower gravity to help, so the DOH was loaded into the simulator and tested under Duna conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND IT WORKED!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wubIry0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wubIry0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt successfully entered the atmosphere and dropped into a flying regime, able to hold altitude at 5km. And then it successfully landed at 30m/s despite bouncing over several sand dunes, and taxied up steep hills. And then, wonder of wonders, it was able to take off again. It requires a long run to build up speed and needs to go uphill for a ski-jump effect, but once off the ground it can gain altitude and maneuver around. Everything about it is clumsy: the landing runs are extremely long and bumpy, it takes off like an albatross, and it turns like a cow, but it\u0027s tough enough to handle this, won\u0027t nose over, and in general gets the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also quite pleased with the Kethane-electric hybrid power plant I thought up. This combines solar panels with the Kethane generator and some fuel tanks. When the solar panels don\u0027t provide enough, the generator kicks in and makes up the shortage, burning a little Kethane in the process. The result is continuous electric power in a fairly light package and an extremely long range, regardless of sunshine. It\u0027s probably not as efficient as total electric but for something that can\u0027t have sun-tracking panels due to its motion and doesn\u0027t always face the sun, it\u0027s a pretty good compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding an airplane that can fly on Duna was harder than making my 1st SSTO.

Given the total lack of problems the 0.21 SAS had with launching the DORK, I figured the D\u0027OH would be routine, too. NOT!! It had too much lift to survive launch on a rocket so there was nothing for it but to turn it into a spaceplane by appending a SABRE-powered SSTO ascent stage onto its butt. Getting the D\u0027OH to LKO proved at least as difficult as making it fly on Duna. This was doubly the hardest challenge I\u0027ve ever met in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this epic tale will have to be told later. See, once the boffins had finally sorted out this problem and were hoisting their tankards in celebration, some junior lab assistant spoiled the party by reminding everybody that Duna wasn\u0027t the only stop on the KTC\u0027s tour. Nope, according to the Kerbal Almagest (aka Alex\u0027s Launch Window site), it would have to go to Dres next and a window to get stuff there from Kerbin before stuff at Duna could get there was coming sooner than the next Duna window. Plus, there was a Jool window at about the same time and we needed to use it. Needless to say, that junior lab assistant will not be invited to any more parties \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. But the half-drunk and HIGHLY annoyed senior boffins couldn\u0027t deny what he said so there was nothing for it but to push the deadmen aside and get back to work on not just 1 but 2 major design projects with fast-approaching deadlines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Dres. This place not having anything of apparent interest, the mission there is just to survey, refuel, and continue on, leaving nothing but a flag and maybe a transfer tug. For this, the KTC needs both a lander and a probe/Kethane rig/transfer tug package. And to keep from having to do another crash research program for every other future KTC destination, the boffins made the probe big enough to be retrieved and the rig and lander capable of landing on Moho, Dres, Val, and Eeloo. The lander can also do Laythe although it needs refueling on the ground, which is something to worry about later, there being a deadline now. Writing these planet names on the chalkboard--Moho, Dres, Laythe, Val, Eeloo--some halfwit decided to name these craft after the suggested Roman numbers. Thus, the lander is the 1555 (aka MDLV) and the rig is the 1505. That\u0027s about as imaginative as my ship names go; deal with it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. In any case, the plan is that both will become permanent additions to the KTC, going everywhere else it goes. To this end, the mapping probe is big enough to return to the rest from its polar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the 1555 Lander all ready for its launch window. Note the innovative design employing 2 radially mounted 1-man lander cans and the absence of landing gear to save weight. When manned, one of the cans defaults to the \u0022control from here\u0022 part and if the crew doesn\u0027t remember to change that to the probe core up top, the thing flies in circles. But what do you expect from a rush job? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d6GAikD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d6GAikD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd below is the 1505 Package. It can only lift 8000 barrels of Kethane, 1/2 the usual amount, but that\u0027s what I get for designing it for higher gravities. All the other combinations of engines were rather worse and anyway, DEADLINE.

Not that anybody knows when the KTC will get there, but pre-staging its system-specific equipment will take 2 waves, the composition of the 2nd depending on the results of the 1st, so best to get started early. The basic plan is to send the usual probe/rig/tug package permanently to Pol as the primary fuel source within the Jool system now and in the future, to survey all the other moons (with an eye towards Val and Bop as alternate fuel sources), to land on Tylo purely for propaganda purposes, and to do something cool with airplanes on Laythe. What happens on Laythe, however, is totally dependent on where the Kethane there turns out to be. Oceanic fields cannot be exploited with current technology and there ain\u0027t much land area, so the chances are good that there will be no useable Kethane on Laythe. If there is, then great. Land some permanent airbases and colonists. If not, then any Laythe base or colony will require a rather complex fuel shuttle service from other moons, which I haven\u0027t even begun to think about yet. So, the 1st order of business is to map all the moons for Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo accomplish this task, behold the Probe Cluster. It\u0027s just my standard interplanetary tug modified to carry 4 small probes, 1 each for Laythe, Val, Tylo, and Bop. All this is intended to stay in the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kRngyvH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kRngyvH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s certain there\u0027ll be Kethane somewhere on Pol, however, and whatever happens in the Jool system will need it. So here\u0027s the probe/rig/tug package to get it. In an effort to reduce the tippiness of the Ike Rig, this one\u0027s short and wide. Also, its probe is smaller and its got a Kethane-burning generator to eliminate its dependence on sunshine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t66rdl2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t66rdl2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, there\u0027s the Tylo Lander, simply designed to allow 1 Kerbal to go down, plant a flag, and return.

All routine stuff, the standard KW Rocketry lifter and the same tugs seen before. It just took a lot of time. And all this had to be done before I can get into the 5 or so launches needed for Duna\u0027s 2nd Wave and get on with the exploits of the D\u0027OH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T03:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPISODE 8: Duna 2nd Wave \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, with the pre-staged equipment to Dres and Jool en route, it was time to get the Duna\u0027s 2nd Wave up and at \u0027em.

The tug is the left-hand part, then the lander with the other engines and all the parachutes, and then 2 Hitchhikers with a jolly crew of 8 pressed Kerbals who are only now just waking up from the lumps on their heads. Neilvis, Lenfal, Samlorf, Obbal, Neweny, Cambles, Franklin, and Adgas.

Its extremely high lift made it impossible to launch vertically so there was nothing for it but to turn it into a spaceplane SSTO. Making that fly was just as hard as making the D\u0027OH itself fly on Duna.

This ascent stage consists of a big central fuel tank with docking port, some extra fuel and B9 SABRE engines hanging on the sides, and then the B9 Heavy Wings to keep it all airborne and heading in the right direction. The whole thing is a tail-dragger using the D\u0027OH\u0027s main gear up front and some small tailwheels under the ascent stage\u0027s big wing. It flew itself off the runway at 50m/s and continued up with low forward speed but high right of climb (thanks to all the wing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y6vQw2N.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y6vQw2N.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, the whole thing was able to limp its way into orbit at 84km after switching the SABREs to rocket mode at 25km and about 1000m/s after 15 or so minutes of flight. The big wings are on radial separators so can be ditched as needed leaving just the engines. The original plan was to jettison the big wings once in orbit but it occurred to the boffins that they might be needed for aerobraking at Duna so until they crunch all the numbers (as in, F5/F9 a few times at Duna), they\u0027re staying attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t0HpKGC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t0HpKGC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once the D\u0027OH was up, I docked a modified standard transfer tug to it.

The Great Plan is in motion and this was just one of the more boring phases of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo begin with, I realized that the Hitchhiker components of the Kerbal Kanz lacked RTGs so would be unable to move around between the KLMS and anything else as intended. There was thus nothing for it but to send up the New, Improved, Limited Edition Kerbal Kanz Mk II complete with RTGs. And because I was feeling lazy, that\u0027s all I did, meaning I left the Duna Lander tacked on to the new Kanz on the same lifter.

I hadn\u0027t expected this for another 100-odd days (due to the Launch Window web site not showing a window before then) but Kerbal Alarm Clock swore it was a good time to go and I had to agree. So, off went those 3 ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, though, I\u0027m a fireman. I had today off but was still on-call and damn if somebody didn\u0027t fall over and get hurt right in the middle of the 2nd transfer burn. Nothing for it but to stop the game and go to the call, resulting in that ship using WAY more delta-V than planned. Oh well, them\u0027s the breaks. But I figured the other ships in the flotilla, plus the KLMS when it arrives, would pick up the slack so I went with it. Then I started burning the 3rd ship and damn if I didn\u0027t have to go to another call, which caused equally bad delta-V consequences for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that tore it. Now I\u0027d blown my delta-V budget so I had to send out some tankers. Still being lazy, I just shot off a couple copies of the transfer tug used to push the Kerbal Kanz. They\u0027ll arrive with plenty of fuel to solve any problems as they don\u0027t have to push any payloads out there. And for good measure, while I was at it I launched identical tugs/tankers to LKO to go to Duna with the 2nd Wave and to Dres as well when their windows come up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tugs aka tankers all looked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XeB7gIx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XeB7gIx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, I ended up doing 5 transfer burns for Jool, my biggest flotilla yet. Kerbal Alarm Clock says they\u0027ll arrive within a 20-day span but none closer than 5 days apart. I\u0027ll see how the mid-course trajectories change that.

Anyway, that\u0027s 8 interplanetary ships underway at once. And in 20-odd days, I\u0027ll add 5 more bound for Duna.

This is my 1st time going there and I went in assuming it would be just a routine transfer. Wrong. First off, due to nuke engines not having a lot of thrust, the burns were 10-12 minutes. This, combined with the node placement dictated by the ejection angle, made the 1st half of the burn be pointing literally straight down at Kerbin, and my parking orbits weren\u0027t high enough for this to work. So I improvised. 1 ship I did the burn in 2 parts with an elliptical orbit between. The other 2 I just did the burn later, once Kerbin was mostly out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, I didn\u0027t have an encounter either way, nor even \u0022closest approach\u0022 markers, but I figured no big deal, I\u0027ll just tweak that once out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. That\u0027s when I discovered Dres has a TINY SOI that\u0027s bloody hard to hit. The upshot of all this was that even with tweaking burns from just beyond Minmus, the best I could manage was to at least get closest approaches down to 300-500km for the various ships. Now having looked at the Wiki, I see the SOI is only 32.8km. Egad! But I figure some mid-course tweaks down the road a ways will finally get me encounters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd hopefully by then, the 3 ships heading there will be spread out somewhat in time. Another unanticipated problem with a tiny target is that units of flotillas will tend to arrive very close together. I hope I end up with enough time between the ships to give each the attention it needs. But I don\u0027t yet have any encounters so I have no way of knowing just yet. In any case, this is going to be interesting \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I learned all that. I also learned doing the 2-part burn is more efficient that delaying a 1-piece burn. The ship with the 2-part burn only needed about 60m/s to get a close approach whereas the other 2 needed about 250m/s. Lucky I packed a lot of fuel; I don\u0027t think this will be a problem when I get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this mucking about with Dres consumed all my available playing time for today so the Duna stuff will have to wait some more.

That should be more than enough to jump between 1 and the other as needed. We\u0027ll see. I guess I\u0027m getting better at doing transfer burns because the Duna 1st Wave was spread over 20 days or so.

The other lander will stay in Duna orbit as a spare. And the more I think about it, the more I think I\u0027ll leave the KethLab-MotherShip at Duna. I really don\u0027t see a need to lug all its docking ports all over the system and they\u0027d probably be more useful at Duna, which will soon start to be rather heavily populated. Thus, KethLab Duna will get renamed, linked up with the Hitchhikers of the Kerbal Kanz, and take the other 6 Kerbals off to Dres and then wherever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T20:48:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T03:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPISODE 12 -- Duna 2nd Wave Arrivs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after 80-odd days in transit, interrupted by me doing quite a few mid-course burns for the 13 different ships then en route, the 5 ships of the Duna 2nd Wave arrived at their destination. They had undergone quite a bit of course tweaking because when they were about 2/3 out, I realized they were all going to be in retrograde orbits, so I had to change that, which took several small burns for each ship. This also delayed their arrival by about a week, reordered their arrivals, and also bunched them rather closer together, so I expected things to be interesting. They were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, the D\u0027OH got an unexpected early encounter with Duna (as in, it wasn\u0027t shown on the map) that DID turn out to be retrograde. D\u0027oh is right! Even worse, it was WAY out there, only being within Duna\u0027s SOI for 14 minutes. Not being sure if I\u0027d get a 2nd encounter at the expected place afterwards, I had to burn hard to get captured and flip the orbit to prograde. This took about 1200m/s, more than the ejection burn. Fortunately, the D\u0027OH\u0027s tug still had about 3600m/s in the tanks so this wasn\u0027t a problem, just an annoyance, although the burn was nearly as long as my time in Duna\u0027s SOI.

It took it 3 days to get down to Pe from there. 3 days after everything else was already safely in orbit, and it came at Duna from the opposite direction as all the other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other ships all arrived with nice prograde orbits on the same day, spread fairly evenly all through it. That alone was OK but each ship needed several tweaks to fine-tune its Pe for aerocapture. All this meant that about once an hour, I was changing to a different ship to do one of its tweaks. This made things a bit hectic and worrisome but as it happened, I always had time to finish what I was doing with 1 ship before having to deal with the next, so nothing fell through the cracks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rae8MZh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rae8MZh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see the wad of 4 ships approaching from the left with the D\u0027OH\u0027s orbit coming in from the right.

So, now, FINALLY, I started doing what I came here for: colonizing Duna. It\u0027s a small start, only 2 Kerbals, but they\u0027ve got great mobility so can see where best to put the larger settlements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st thing to go down was the Duna Bowser Mk II, a rover with tanks for all types of fuel and the small-size refinery. Its primary purpose is just moving raw Kethane from Airbase Duna to the D\u0027OH but it can also refuel landers. It does this with KAS winches and the electricity for refining comes from the solar panels on Airbase Duna. Anyway, I did my usual low, flat, 1/4-of-the-planet landing approach from 50km and came down using the engines, 1 big chute, and 12 radial chutes, all done manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kb3dkea.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kb3dkea.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was rather proud of this landing. I came down within 2.7km of Airbase Duna and didn\u0027t bust any tires. I tried the Steam Gauges radar altimeter for this landing but found it hard to read--it would be more useful at night IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZYdIdBC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZYdIdBC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext came the D\u0027OH. Its tug gave it about 300m/s worth of rocket fuel plus a full load of Kethane, then separated. The D\u0027OH used its SSTO ascent stage for the last time, establishing a de-orbit trajectory a bit short of Airbase Duna so the discarded bits wouldn\u0027t hit the latter and itself being able to fly the rest of the way. Once the de-orbit burn was over, the D\u0027OH finally shed its big wings on the off chance they\u0027d make the rest of the ascent stage tumble into the D\u0027OH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z3I468d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z3I468d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe D\u0027OH entered the atmosphere just fine and eventually found enough air to level out, passing over Airbase Duna at about 6km.

As such, I rather botched the landing and managed to flip the thing twice. But the Duna Gods were with me because it landed on its wheels with no damage and came to a nice stop about 2km on the far side of Airbase Duna, from which point it taxied back to base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time to bring down the 1st colonists, Obbal and Samlorf. I\u0027ll leave enough stuff in the Duna system to get them home if needed but their mission is to stay there forever. I did the same sort of landing with them as I did with the Bowser but forgot the lander had nuclear engines so starting retroburning at 30km from the target wasn\u0027t soon enough. As such, they ended up landing about 5.8km from Airbase Duna. But again the Duna Gods smiled and they came down in a very flat place in the dunefield \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/71ZXSws.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002271ZXSws.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was a simple matter of driving the Bowser out to them and bringing them home. They repacked all the chutes on their lander, the Bowser, and Airbase Duna when they got there, plus each planted a flag. Then they climbed into the Hitchhiker of Airbase Duna to unpack and see how the supplies had held up. After all, Airbase Duna had been away from Kerbin for 263 days so far. All was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore embarking in the D\u0027OH to begin their explorations, they decided to watch the instructional videos 1 more time.

Judging from the angle of the shadows, it was late morning and Mission Control determined they probably had enough daylight to reach their 1st objective, the anomaly detected in the depression WNW of Airbase Duna. So, the Hitchhiker\u0027s hatch opened, the floor tilted to dump the Kerbals out, and all interior surfaces became electrified to keep Obbal and Samlorf from hanging onto anything. Once they\u0027d been dumped outside, the hatch slammed and locked behind them. So, they had no choice but to mope over to the D\u0027OH and gave it the preflight inspection they\u0027d learned.

The fuselage tail is squared off from where the SSTO ascent stage decoupled. Note the 4 rudders mounted on the wing trailing edges instead of the tail fins. This keeps the yaw forces balanced so you don\u0027t get any roll when using the rudders. VERY helpful in general but especially in Duna\u0027s thin air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WvYdwC2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WvYdwC2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Samlorf in the left seat and Obbal in the right, they check their controls and communications.

Thanks again, buddy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all systems go and no apparent damage from the rough landing, away they went. At the 2500m altitude of Airbase Duna, the D\u0027OH can become airborne at about 48m/s but it really needs to be going up a hill to do so, staying up when the ground goes down on the other side. Fortunately, finding a hill to climb is no problem in the dunefields at the airbase \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Once in the air, you have to fight to keep it there so I don\u0027t retract the gear until I\u0027m sure of things. Then it takes carpal-tunnel-inducing S-key work until it gradually builds up speed to about 90m/s. After this, you can set SAS (turn it off for a second, then back on again) and it will hold the climb you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7dXDYR7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227dXDYR7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the pic above, Samlorf\u0027s got it settled into a VERY slow, steady climb and has gained about 500m of altitude in the 7km traveled since take-off. Also, I marked the flightpath on the ISA MapSat display (it\u0027s off towards the left edge a bit above center). The plan was to fly 090 most of the way, then turn 045 to the objective to fly through a red gap between 2 white mountains. I knew from testing I could reach a bit over 5000m but also know from aerobraking that many of those white areas are considerably higher than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the D\u0027OH flew along, Mission Control kept an eye on the Kethane consumption and noticed it wasn\u0027t using any. Apparently the sunshine\u0027s more intense on Duna than on Kerbin despite being further from the sun. I guess thin atmospheres and no ozone layers have their advantages. So, some accidental science done \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. In any case, eventually Mission Control became convinced the D\u0027OH didn\u0027t need a full load of Kethane to complete the mission. So, in an effort to increase the climb rate and ceiling, the TAC Fuel Balancer dumped 4 of the 6 tanks, keeping just 300 units as a reserve. While this went against every KSP habit in my body, I figured I could get away with it. After all, it never rains on Duna \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s9sZYxq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022s9sZYxq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the lightened load, the D\u0027OH was able gradually to claw its way up to 6290m altitude, the highest recorded on the trip. This occurred just before the turn to the NE through the low gap in the hills behind the D\u0027OH. Samlorf was glad he had all this altitude because making the turn cost him about 800m. That\u0027s one of the drawbacks of thin air. But on the plus side, now being lighter, the D\u0027OH regained 6200m much quicker than it had before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N3iDYps.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022N3iDYps.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the ground below suddenly dropped into a deep valley in the center of which was a big mountain, probably the rebound spike of a huge but very ancient crater. The map was leading the Kerbals to the mountain so they flew low over the top, taking full advantage of the unobstructed view from their seats to scan the terrain. But they saw nothing unusual, just the usual scatter of boulders. Once across the top, they noticed the anomaly was at their 4 o\u0027clock so they dove down and started circling the mountain clockwise about 1/2way up its slope. This almost proved their undoing because Samlorf was a bit aggressive in trying to do a split-S instead of a gradual descent. As he should have remembered from the instructional videos, sudden changes of directions don\u0027t work well in thin air--the plane tends to switch ends while continuing in the same direction, and that\u0027s what happened here. So down they went in a tumbling tailspin. Fortunately, however, they were by then over the deep valley surrounding the central mountain so were able to regain control and pull out with about 200m to spare, thanks to the relatively thick air down near the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wSn8IXA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wSn8IXA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the D\u0027OH climbed back up like a champ in that thicker air so soon they were again 1/2way up the mountain and circling around it as planned. Samlorf was now doing all the scanning because Obbal could no longer see through the puke on the inside of his visor. Suddenly, Samlorf saw a boulder that looked much bigger than the others so he flew closer. It was a boulder, but huge, and carved to look just like the St. Jeb!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zgkkjrK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zgkkjrK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Samlorf brought the D\u0027OH around and landed on the flat ground around the moutain\u0027s feet. Given its huge wing, in the thick air down there, the D\u0027OH didn\u0027t want to quit flying even with all 16 airbrakes open, so they ended up probably 3-5km away from the anomaly. But no problem, they just taxied to it at about 20m/s. The flight had lasted exactly 59 minutes, all in real time because the D\u0027OH don\u0027t like warping \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E. At an average speed of about 100m/s and given the dogleg in their course, Mission Control estimates The Face is about 330km from Airbase Duna, but the D\u0027OH flew for about 360km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now, Obbal had remembered one of the instructional videos about pulling his arm up into his sleeve and then using it to wipe the inside of his visor, so he could enjoy the sights. As such, while Samlorf was busy shutting down the D\u0027OH, Obbal jumped from his seat, ran to what could only now be called an artifact, jetpacked to the top, and planted his flag. Samlorf joined him as quickly as he could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bpKHnUr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bpKHnUr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFACE PLANT! From their vantage point, Obbal and Samlorf looked down the valley to east and saw Ike hanging there on the horizon, eerily illuminated by the mid-afternoon sun effects on the alien atmosphere. This vista awed them; it was way better than the underside of the big bridge at Kerb City, which is all they\u0027d seen in as long as they could remember before the KSP Pressgang caught them. They realized they were the 1st Kerbals to see this and would be the only ones for a long time. They also realized they had a plane that flew reasonably well, a company car, and a whole planet to explore. They hadn\u0027t been on Kerbin in nearly a year but suddenly they didn\u0027t miss it. The spirit of St. Jeb touched them. They came down from The Face no longer galley slaves but willing participants. Of course, with it getting late in the day and not having much Kethane left, they had to camp out under the D\u0027OH\u0027s wings to await a new day, but given their lifetime living under a bridge, this seemed just like home to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back at Mission Control, the boffins were pouring over a satellite image of the D\u0027OH parked next to The Face.

I only just now got the (IMHO underappreciated) fight wings and black dot on the Duna ribbon for the above D\u0027OH flight. Apart from a few insignificant probes to learn the mechanics of interplanetary transfer, the KTC is my 1st interplanetary expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m saying is, just jump in at the deep end. There is only 1 true difference in gameplay and game mechanics between going to Mun/Minmus and going anywhere else: the game-time required. The orbital mechanics in the flight and the need for enough delta-V are exactly the same. Simply put, you can go to Kerbin\u0027s satellites any time the mood strikes you and will only have to wait to do the transfer burn for no more than 3/4 of your ship\u0027s orbit around Kerbin (about 15 minutes of game time), and the travel time is measured in game hours or a few days. With the other planets, however, you might have to wait 3/4 of a Kerbin year to get a similar alignment on your target. And then of course, it can take anywhere from a month to a year to coast all the way out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: In terms of flying the ship, if you can get to Minmus, you can get to Moho, Eeloo, and all points in between. Sure, you need a different ship designed to different specs, but there is absolutely zero difference in the actual flying of it. So, the only thing stopping you from going anywhere you please is making up your mind to give it a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd FWIW, MJ is pretty useless for the bulk of this. It can\u0027t do interplanetary transfers worth a damn and it is utterly unable to land at a specific point if the planet has an atmosphere. So you have to do all such things by hand whether you have MJ or not. Where it comes in handy is in giving you info on the state of your ship and your obit, and in handling the small-scale, boring, routine chores you\u0027ve done 100 times already, or in running a 10-minute transfer burn while you do something more important like a debeer/rebeer cycle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HAMsmith","CreatedById":78111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T16:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove it, keep the reports coming!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T22:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeconded. loving it so far \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T23:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPISODE 15 -- THE D\u0027OH CONTINUED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, Obbal and Samlorf crawled out from under the D\u0027OH\u0027s wings and rooted around in the hollow rear fuselage looking for snacks. While so engaged, Mission Control called to inform them that their job for the day was to fly to the next anomaly SE of their current position. This immediately presented a technical difficulty because the D\u0027OH\u0027s rather low rate of climb dictated leaving Face Valley via the canyon to the east, straight towards the rising sun. Due to the angle of attack they\u0027d have while climbing, the leading edge of the wing would keep the solar panels in the shade until mid-morning and they wanted to save the Kethane they still had for emergencies given they were so far from home. So, they pointed the D\u0027OH east (keeping in mind it\u0027s a tail-dragger with a positive AoA while on the ground) and waited until the solar panels said they were at 50% efficiency. Then they taxied a bit down Face Mountain to where a reasonably flat shoulder stuck out, faced the sun again, and took off. This time, Obbal was flying and Samlorf acting as observer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pR86frB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pR86frB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above pic, I drew another purple line on the ISA map showing the flight path for today. It followed the canyon as it curved from E to SE from Face Mountain, nearly sea level at the bottom but slightly higher than the D\u0027OH can fly on either side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IxaC4Lv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IxaC4Lv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis canyon eventually opened out into a huge depression, so wide that Obbal and Samlorf couldn\u0027t see the surrounding mountains from the middle of it, even from 6200m altitude. In fact, they got up to 6302m, setting a new altitude record for the D\u0027OH. As before, however, they couldn\u0027t hold this but today they were able to hold about 6230m, a bit higher than yesterday. They reached this altitude just as they were leaving the canyon and starting the long haul across the depression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PYSwusT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PYSwusT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing their map, they made a slight course change over the depression and eventually saw the surrounding mountains appear on the far side with a gap between to the SE just as shown on the map. Their objective was up that gap to the SE so they headed that way. Soon, the ground rose beneath them and they began to worry that it might end up being higher than the ground at Airbase Duna, above which the D\u0027OH\u0027s landing characteristics had never been tested. It\u0027s VERY hard to judge height and distance on Duna due to its relatively small size, all looking the same, and the atmosphere always looking like sunset all around the compass regardless of altitude or time of day. Good thing they\u0027d installed the new radar altimeter they\u0027d brought out from Duna so could be reassured the ground wasn\u0027t too high. Eventually, checking the map, they decided they were close enough to find the objective by taxiing so put down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SVuvuWC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SVuvuWC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis area is still dunefields but the dunes are shorter, less steep, and further apart than around Airbase Duna, so makes for a better airfield. It\u0027s also a little below 2000m altitude. It would be a great place for a colony if there was any Kethane there. Perhaps the anomaly will provide an excuse to build here. In any case, thanks to the lower altitude, the D\u0027OH wouldn\u0027t quit flying until it slowed to less than 30m/s. The flight lasted 68 minutes which, at an average speed of 100m/s, means the D\u0027OH traveled about 408km this trip, again without a drop of Kethane burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on the ground, Obbal and Samlorf spent almost as much time looking for the objective. First they looked at their ISA map and got their position lined up as well as possible with that of the anomaly. Nothing seen, either then or on the landing approach. From this they knew the anomaly was much smaller than The Face so they\u0027d have to get very close to see it, closer than the coarse-grained map allowed. So, after about 30 minutes of taxiing back and forth across the area and nothing seen but sand and scattered boulders, they held their position while Mission Control manipulated all the data it had every which way (as in, used Google and YouTube for help) and instructed the Kerbals to patch the positional data from the D\u0027OH\u0027s spaceflight computer (aka to turn on MJ\u0027s surface info box) into their GPS system so they\u0027d really know exactly where they were. Then Obbal taxied some more until, 42 minutes after landing, they were reasonably sure they were exactly where Mission Control swore the anomaly was. Still nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, Obbal and Samlorf were getting a bit fed up. They decided that perhaps their perch way up on the D\u0027OH\u0027s nose was too high to see the thing and they\u0027d have better luck if they dismounted, perhaps being able to silhouette the anomaly against the horizon. So they climbed down the ladder, moved far enough away from the D\u0027OH that it didn\u0027t block much of their view, and stood back-to-back, sliding slowly around in a circle so each of them could sweep the whole horizon to spot anything the other had missed. Still nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7gYAwK4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227gYAwK4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they reported and so they stood until the speed of light allowed an answer from Mission Control. Mission Control said it had given up on finding the thing and Samlorf was to plant his flag to mark the spot for future reference. But at this point, Samlorf discovered he didn\u0027t have a flag*. It must have fallen out of his pocket somewhere, probably during the tailspin after passing over Face Mountain. So, on this rather anti-climatic note, Samlorf and Obbal again made camp under the D\u0027OH\u0027s wings with the knowledge they be returning to Airbase Duna come the dawn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if it had been a snake, the anomaly would have bitten them. IOW, the thing\u0027s buried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/62Wvoe5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002262Wvoe5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*NOTE: When the Kerbals got off the D\u0027OH, they moved like they were using jetpacks, always facing away from the camera. So, I went back to KSC then back to the D\u0027OH. and that solved that problem, but still neither of them had a flag, despite only 1 flag having been planted since they were last inside a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T00:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is some impressive work!
