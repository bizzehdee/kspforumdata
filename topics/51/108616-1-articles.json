Allow me to introduce\n\n***GREEN*** ***THUNDER***\n\n![bjPfOSc.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/bjPfOSc.jpg?1)\n\n*Green Thunder is the baddest of the bad...*\n\n*The ground-shaker, the record-breaker...*\n\n***The roughest rider this side of Kerbin.***\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSo this is my mission report for a mission I am attempting: A circumnavigation of Kerbin, following [the Elcano Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation). This craft, my long-hauling electric-powered truck, is mostly stock but I have modified the wheels to give it better steering control and make them tougher. Nothing can pop these tires!\n\nThis is going to be mainly a sightseeing mission, and I shall be visiting almost all land anomalies on Kerbin. I plan on traveling to KSC2 and the desert pyramid before coming up and using the northern ice cap to head around the planet and make it back to the Space Center, where I am starting this challenge.\n\nI have four Kerbals to make this journey, and will only stop if I run out of battery power. At that point, I will put on the parking brakes and unfold the craft\u0027s solar panels, and plant a flag to track my progress. I expect to be able to go for quite a few klicks on each charge, its all speculation.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/WaPSR)\n\nI\u0027ve been designing and refining this craft for roughly a week, making it look good and ride smoothly. It has a high ground clearance and tight turning radius compared to the standard ruggedized wheels. It is front-steering only, though depending on the circumstances I can still turn on he rear steering for whatever reason. It\u0027s got mostly aesthetic parts, but I\u0027ve angled the lights such that it provides a very nice view at night. Green Thunder is incredibly tough, able to withstand a smack straight into the VAB at 21 m/s with nothing more than a screwed up cabin. Two Kerbals sit in command seats in the cabin, and are completely protected from crashes and rolls by the metal truck, which tops out at almost 30 tons. It\u0027s no sedan, that\u0027s for dang sure!\n\n**ENTRY 0**\n\n**May 10, 2015**\n\nSo before the ride even started, something hilarious happened.\n\nI was setting up the flag for the start of the challenge, as per the rules, and decided to take one last group photo before beginning the journey. I planted the flag and got everything set up, Green Thunder parked under the little awning thing in front of the Astronaut Complex. Something must\u0027ve happened though, because the truck suddenly flipped out and exploded, smashing into the Complex and making it explode as well...\n\nAs I was taking the photo...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Well, sort of, anyway.\n\nThe beginning was perfectly fine. I\u0027ve discovered that the amount of batteries I have on the truck allow me to ride for about fifteen minutes before needing a charge. I\u0027ve decided that this is a great tool to keep track of when to plant flags to track my progress, and I\u0027ve made it all the way to my first milestone, which was conveniently right next to another vehicle that I\u0027d been driving previously. Bill and Bob were in there!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/tBWeT)\n\nAfter that, though, things began going real wrong real fast.\n\nSo the only way my batteries can be recharged is via two unfoldable solar panels on the back. Should be no problem, right? Well, it turns out they\u0027re a severe problem when you forget to unfold them before starting to roll again. Oh, and by the time my batteries recharged it was night time.\n\n![Hwg4wBA.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/Hwg4wBA.jpg?1)\n\n(Notice the broken-ness of the panels...)\n\nSo yup. That vehicle was dead in the water. The only solution was Green Thunder II, which I began rolling out immediately in the dead of night, testing out my high-power headlights setting and getting some nice night skies. Also, I discovered that there must be some sort of bug with the terrain, because sometimes the beam from the headlights would disappear from the ground and reappear when the terrain flattened out or something. Not game-breaking, but something I noticed.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/oDG2K)\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nAfter I had got the crew all moved over to the second truck, something strange happened. I warped to the next morning to get my batteries to charge, and when they were done I pressed the action group I\u0027d set to retract the panels. But. Um. They wouldn\u0027t retract. So they stayed out... I tried manually doing it, sending a Kerbal out to try and do it from there... Nothing. So the vehicle would work, but the slightest bump would destroy the panels anyway.\n\nAnd then I hit a pretty big bump.\n\nI had the brakes on, raging and trying to get the panels down when I accelerated forward and promptly snapped one of my wheels off. The explosion was cool, as always, but resulted in \n\n![WZQigm3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WZQigm3.jpg)\n\nThat.\n\nSo that\u0027s where I left off on the first leg of the journey!

Ingenious, eh?! It\u0027s like stuffing a truck inside of a plane!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/5025b)\n\nSo here\u0027s how it works. Green Lightning will take off from the runway, the Green Thunder truck stuffed in the middle. I will admit it needs some tweaking, being very slow to take off, and indeed very slow at flying. Initial runs only brought it up to about 100 m/s of a cruising altitude.\n\nOnce the plane flies the payload to the destination, the last truck, wherever it is that it\u0027s broken down, it will deploy its parachutes and cut the engines. it will then nosedive towards the landing site, and at about 400m above the terrain the parachutes deploy and the landing gear extends, and the plane lands (rather roughly, actually). The landing can be quite explosive, but luckily the truck payload has survived 100% of testing, even when parachutes are cut and the plane explodes from the impact of the ground. The truck can survive even if the plane disintegrates!\n\nFortunately, though, it usually lands much more softly. In that case, the plane\u0027s brakes are activated and then the plane is staged. It is coupled to the truck at the front and rear of the payload, and therefore splits into three pieces: The front section, the truck, and the rear section, the first and third pieces being rendered useless. The payload is strong enough to push the sections apart and free itself from the landing sections to get the crew all transferred and beginning the next leg of the journey.\n\nSo then! Then came the long-awaited second leg of the journey!\n\nHowever, almost immediately there was another incident. One of my Kerbals (forgot their name, unfortunately!) was jumping up on the newly-arrived truck, only to promptly break half of the retractable solar panels I had on. \\*sigh\\*\n\n![YFBbtQB.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/YFBbtQB.jpg?1)\n\nThe other side would still work, though, so there was that.\n\nThe rest of the journey of the next leg went quite smoothly indeed! There was some pretty scenery coming about from the mountains I was driving into.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/xnYsv)\n\nAfter that, I decided to save time by climbing up the foothills to then descend into the valley. Seemingly a simple enough strategy, and one that would\u0027ve worked fine had I not encountered my old nemesis... A rover glitch on some spots on Kerbin that causes a loss of traction. As I was going downhill, the truck suddenly began to skid, turning to the right as I tried to correct to no avail. When the glitch subsided and traction was regained, one wheel promptly snapped and sent the vehicle rolling over one time. Much to my relief, the hitchhiker pod was unharmed and the Kerbals in the cabin survived untouched as per designed.\n\n![XTPVo60.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/XTPVo60.jpg?1)\n\nSo thus ended the second leg of my journey! It seemed like a good stopping place, and is where I will resume the journey in a few days when things settle down.
