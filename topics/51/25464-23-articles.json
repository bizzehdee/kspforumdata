Several nuclear Tugs have been piling up around Laythe, what with delivering all those payloads, so it was time to prepare for sending some back to Kerbin. Nuclear engines don\u0027t grow on trees, you know. The Double-Tug that was attached to the bottom of Laythe Space Station was separated (leaving a tank behind to increase the fuel capacity of the station) and I planned to boost it out to an orbit beyond Tylo to await the next Jool-to-Kerbin transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For earlier Tug returns, I\u0027d boosted them out into orbits between Laythe and Vall, but this was trickier to get right because Laythe\u0027s sphere of influence would tend to swallow the Tug back up as it was leaving, despite what the projected orbit said at first, requiring some evasive maneuvers. Kicking out further to beyond Tylo avoided this problem.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3tvVsPr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223tvVsPr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I plotted the trajectory for the outgoing Double-Tug, it ran into a Tylo encounter that would whip the Tugs out of the Joolian system into Kerbol orbit. Well, that was nice...so I took the shot and sent it on its way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sX5nYPE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sX5nYPE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y4iftbe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y4iftbe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the double-Tugs from Laythe Train #2 (which had recently delivered the RASSTO SSTO) was rendezvoused with the station and offloaded all of its excess propellant. To return to Kerbin, the Tugs would only need the fuel in their side-tanks...plus a little extra in the main tank just in case. Because of the recent spate of SSTO test flights, there was room in the station\u0027s tanks to hold the propellants. The Tugs also left behind another tank to increase the station\u0027s capacity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/97hfAB5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002297hfAB5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the Train #2 Tugs were separated and sent off to beyond Tylo, which took about 582 m/s of delta-V. I did not bother to wait for the perfect time to get another Tylo encounter (because I have better things to do with my time), but I suppose Thompbles would take the time to do it. Anyway...so the Tugs will need to use another 470 m/s of delta-V to circularize their orbit out beyond Vall (which the previous Double-Tug will not have to do). All of this delta-V goes to getting the Tugs out of Jool\u0027s gravity well, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QiFqoVX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QiFqoVX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait, there\u0027s more! The Tugs from Laythe Train #1 (which recently brought the Raptor spaceplane to Laythe, and which still had the NAMOR-21 attached) was rendezvoused with the Space Station to offload its excess fuel (and add yet another tank, which nicely balanced out the bottom end of the station).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EZNstl5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EZNstl5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter transferring fuel and disconnecting the rear tank, the Train #1 Tugs undocked and moved up the side of the station to dock the NAMOR-21 Marine Rescue ship to one of the side docking ports. The NAMOR-21 will be stored there until it is needed (if ever). The Tugs then undocked and backed away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uxa9YEr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Uxa9YEr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow you can see the elliptical orbits of the first two outgoing sets of Tugs, plus the plotted trajectory for the Train #1 Tugs. Again, I did not wait for a Tylo encounter, and just kicked the Tugs out to cavort beyond Tylo with their fellow Tugs. Note that Kerbal Alarm Clock is very handy when doing this kind of thing (I have reminders set for when various sets of Tugs will need apoapsis burns or have Tylo encounters, and for when the Jool-to-Kerbin transfer window will arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gNBpGy5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gNBpGy5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a small maneuver as the first pair of Tugs passed Tylo to give them a little extra speed so that the Tugs would make it outside Jool\u0027s sphere of influence just before the Jool-to-Kerbin transfer time comes. It was nice to see Tylo close up again. The apoapsis kicks for the other Tugs went off on schedule, and they are now happily waiting for their orders to boost home to Kerbin in about 64 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2NYzTSW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222NYzTSW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThompbles\u0027s Travels\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverybody agreed that Thompbles should get out more, so he assigned himself the job of piloting the Airedale plane/rover, which is basically a BirdDog modified to carry scientist passengers and their lab equipment on expeditions to points of interest on Laythe.

Nelemy had landed near the upper end of Jenlan, but most of that very large island is unexplored. There were a couple small islands beyond Jenlan that had not been visited yet, so Thompbles planned to start with them and then pick out a couple spots on Jenlan to stop at on the way back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see in the picture below that the Airedale needs to maintain a high angle of attack when flying in the thin air at 12 kilometers altitude, but it makes good speed there. Because of its greater weight and drag, the Airdale is less fuel efficient than the BirdDogs, but not too bad. The LiquidFuel indicator in the lower left is only showing the fuel remaining in the rear tank (the forward tank has its fuel flow turned off to keep the CG of the plane further forward).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XLXkeeU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XLXkeeU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJenlan is a rather rugged island, but Thompbles spots some seaside real estate that he might investigate on the way back. But he thinks the valley high in the mountains looks very interesting (from what he\u0027s seen of it on maps). The boys have yet to discover a monolith or other anomaly on Laythe, and Thompbles thinks that valley is the kind of place he\u0027d put one if he were in charge on anomalies. Once he passes Jenlan, he spots the first of the two small islands he\u0027ll visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Af27w6b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Af27w6b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Thompbles passes Jenlan, he spots the first of the two small islands he\u0027ll visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Airedale to Base.

The area wasn\u0027t too bad (and it\u0027s the most accessible part of the large island, being about as far south as it goes), but not a great site. He collected samples and then took off again, this time headed back to Laythe Base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zEUpOQp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zEUpOQp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WXyoBTS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WXyoBTS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter leaving Jenlan, the fuel in the rear tank was running out, so Thompbles switched on the fuel flow from the forward tank. He landed back at Fido Bay with 107 units of fuel left (out of his initial 300), and docked with GasStation 2 to refuel. After that, GasStation 2 had less than one full plane-load of fuel left in it. But not to worry...they still have the DoubleGasStation at the main base area, and two regular GasStations waiting in orbit to be dropped in where needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lz51NXu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lz51NXu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H3OnY1A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H3OnY1A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe map below shows the route of Thompbles\u0027s training trip. The Airedale checked out fine, but as expected it is not as good a rover as the BirdDogs. It certainly can\u0027t be driven as fast as a BirdDog (not safely, anyway), and time warps over 2x should be avoided. This confirms the earlier testing on Kerbin (and it\u0027s important to heed this, because if the rover DOES fail, the passenger cabins are NOT very impact resistant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MIfaTIt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MIfaTIt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EKethane, Kethane, Kethane!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I\u0027m not going to install the Kethane Mod... But I am going to let my Laythe kerbals hunt for kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[As to why I choose not to use the Kethane Mod, there are a couple reasons. First, I generally avoid lots of mods because they make upgrading my save-game file more difficult (although I love certain user interface enhancement mods). Also, when I look at things that people have done with the stock game, I am familiar with the parts, so I can easily tell what they did. If there are mod parts I\u0027m not familiar with, I never know what I\u0027m looking at. I prefer it if people can more easily understand the capabilities of my ships and what I\u0027m doing.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Also, some mods just strike me as odd in concept, and Kethane is one of those. What is this kethane stuff, and why do we find it on all kinds of planets and moons? And you can apparently convert it into liquid fuel, oxidizer, monopropellant...and even Xenon. What alchemy is this? I love the idea of exploiting indigenous resources to make propellant and whatnot...but I\u0027ll leave the Kethane Mode to others.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyway... I wanted to have some kethane deposits that my kerbals could find. But how much kethane should there be? And how should it be distributed? What I decided to do was take a \u0022typical\u0022 kethane distribution and use it as a basis for my kethane map. Geschosskopf (he of the wonderful Kethane Flying Circus missions) had a kethane map posted for Laythe in one of his threads... so I took that image, copied the region markers, resized it to fit my Laythe map, and then generated ramdom numbers to decide how to flip it vertically, horizontally, and shift it in longitude. And I got the map shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K3vfD6Z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K3vfD6Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed later that I had made a mistake in my process... Geschosskopf\u0027s map had a gap in longitude with no kethane deposits, but when I resized the marker overlay to fit my map, that gap got lost... So I have more kethane than I should, I suppose, but I\u0027ll live with that. I\u0027m not actually going to exploit the kethane (since the engineers in Division 19 never came through with the anticipated resource extraction equipment)... I just using it for roleplaying my missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs expected, most of the kethane deposits are underwater (easy to happen on Laythe). And whereas Geschosskopf had kethane all over what I call Dansen Island, my home base, my Dansen Island has none. But what my kerbals do have are lots of samples picked up on BirdDog missions, bagged and sealed and labeled. And they have Hellou, with equipment delivered in the shiny new SCIENCE Lab, including, I contend, sensitive spectral analyzers that can detect kethane. So she has been sucking the air out of the sample bags and running it through the infrared spectral analyzer and finding signatures of kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results are shown below: Places where my kerbals have picked up samples that show positive for kethane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vcmvEAL.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022vcmvEAL.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the map above, we see that my kerbals hit upon various pieces of five of the deposits. The large area of hits on Fredoly Island includes samples from Aldner\u0027s initial survey there, but is filled in a lot more because I had Hellou and Emilynn stationed at the Base 3 there for several months, so Hellou would have been all over the easily-accessible spots in that area. Not shown on this map are additional data points that did NOT show kethane, which help to delineate the sizes of the deposits. For example, Thompbles\u0027s samples from the high valley show kethane, but his samples from Bob and Bill Islands, and from the southeast coast (and Nelemy\u0027s older samples from the northeast tip) show NO kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Kethane?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Yes. KH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E. A simple hydrokarbon. Where it occurs close to the surface, it leaks out and we can detect it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022And this stuff is useful as rocket fuel?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022For future Laythe explorers, yes. You need an oxidizer to burn it, but one can process LOX from Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, or just suck in the air to burn kethane in jet engines built for that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022And our samples show kethane?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Some of them do.

I\u0027m putting some equipment into the Lab module of the Airedale, and I\u0027ll need a ride to some places.

There is an Sensor Array Computing Nose Cone on the tail.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Oh, that. Since we upgraded the software in the cockpit computers, that thing has been useless.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Yes, but this new upgrade will allow it to detect kethane.

Both of the new indicators are showing positive.

Aldner\u0027s samples had indicated kethane on Manley, Scott, and Its Islands (but not on Hellou Island to the west), and there were some islands further north that had never been sampled.

So she tested a couple more samples to be sure. Meanwhile, Emilynn and Thompbles checked out the gap between the two islands, which was almost shallow enough to walk across. So they decided that this would be named South Tomster Island, and the other part would be North Tomster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey then drove to the southern tip of South Tomster to see if there was kethane seeping out there. No. So the Manley kethane deposit did not extend this far north. Thompbles did another float test off the south tip of Tomster, where he floated lower in the water.

One manned landing, followed by some unkerballed rovers, and that\u0027s it (other than the Duna system being visited to explore Magic Boulder). Once the kerbals found out how wonderful Laythe was (Oxygen! Water! All the sand you can eat!), they have mostly been ignoring the other celestial objects.

Manley is located about 5 degrees north of the equator, which is within the inclination range of the deorbit motors on the GasStation...so the GasStation was separated from its Tug and headed down to Manley Island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7JzdILC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227JzdILC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the entry flames appear as the GasStation approaches the east end of Manley Island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YFggjUV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YFggjUV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deployed the chutes a bit later than I should have, so GasStation 5 landed about 800 meters east of GasStation 3, but that\u0027s plenty close enough.
