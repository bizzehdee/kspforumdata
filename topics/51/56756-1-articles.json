I\u0027m trying out mods again, though all I\u0027m using for this series is KW Rocketry and possibly KOSMOS later on. I\u0027m playing out this series in sandbox mode, but presenting a logical course of events, mostly. I say mostly because I\u0027m doing this the \u0022Kerbal\u0022 way; as in, starting with manned missions and using satellites later on. I\u0027ll have a separate \u0022simulation\u0022 save, where I test if designs are feasible; a good substitute for mods like Kerbal Engineer, which I\u0027m too lazy to install. I\u0027ll start out with the Big Three crew, but quickly move on to new recruits, and rarely use the same Kerbal twice. So without further ado, let us present... Adventures in KW!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor centuries, Kerbalkind has looked up at the Mun and the stars and said \u0022I\u0027m hungry.\u0022 Now, however, the technology of space travel is within the reach of the Kerbal race. The Kerbal Space Program has been formed, founded on the principle of science and exploration. A space center along the equator has been constructed, and it is here that Kerbin\u0027s great pursuit of the stars will begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Kerbal to apply for the job was named Jebediah, famous for building a monster truck out of a demolished warehouse and smashing it into another warehouse that had just been built, with flames flying out the exhaust and a huge grin on Jeb\u0027s face. Two more applied, acquaintances, Bill and Bob. Bob was famous for voicing Rainbow Fish on \u0022The Adventures of Psycho Dorky Fish,\u0022 and Bill was famous for... um... well, nothing, really. He was a test pilot for the Northern Air Force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first rocket built was a simple suborbital rocket that fell apart in the VAB. So they built a better suborbital rocket that also fell apart in the VAB. So they threw up their hands and said \u0022Forget it. Let\u0027s go orbital.\u0022 And thus, Zhelaniye 1 was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/y9ui8eea3/screenshot27251.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27251.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EZhelaniye 1 in the VAB, sporting its prototype name, meaning \u0022Space Rocket 1.\u0022 To make their rocket names sound cooler, the Kerbals used a device known as \u0022Kergle Translate,\u0022 despite its reputation as a terrible translator.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket was untested, and thus, only Jebediah was crazy enough to apply for the first flight into space. Bill called in sick, and Bob got out of it by hiding in the \u0022Psycho Dorky Fish\u0022 recording room and locked the door from the inside, and pretended he didn\u0027t have the keys.
