The two Kerbals were part of a previous \u0022science base\u0022 mission to Minmus, where they would stay in the base and transmit science experiments back home. There was a problem, however, when once they entered the \u0022hitch hiker storage unit\u0022 part of the base, they discovered they could not open the hatch again to exit, due to a poorly placed solar panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img802/8968/e22w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e22w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The doomed \u0022science base mission\u0022. The rocket on top separated and returned home before the blocked hatch was noticed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a free Kerbal from a previous base nearby, so he tried launching himself into the side of the \u0022hitch hiker storage unit\u0022 in a futile attempt to dislodge the solar panel... It didn\u0027t work, but he lived (at least) and returned to his own base. (Sorry, no pics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was decided that the entire base would have to be lifted off the Minmus surface and returned home with the Kerbals in it. A space crane was designed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img607/3489/vusm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vusm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and maneuvered over the failed science base...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img850/2265/4bbp.png\u0022 alt=\u00224bbp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane formed a sort of cage around the science base. Landing struts acted as \u0022cage doors\u0022 on the bottom of the crane. The science base was secured and the crane launched off the Minmus surface!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img842/8720/sj74.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sj74.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll was going well so far, but this is where it got complicated. Since the crane and the science base were technically not attached to each other, every time I tried to time-warp, the two crafts would drift \u0022through\u0022 each other and away from each other. \u0022Physics time warp\u0022 prevented this, of course, but at only 4x time warp, it would take a \u003Cem\u003Every long time\u003C/em\u003E to return to Kerbin. My eventual solution was to time warp and let the two crafts drift away from each other, then try to re-capture the science base once we were close to Kerbin (no monopropellant thrusters - I had to make due without them). It worked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img20/1503/0ypp.png\u0022 alt=\u00220ypp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img853/3959/svka.png\u0022 alt=\u0022svka.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was really worried about the science base breaking free once the \u0027chutes opened up, which is why there were four smaller \u0022braking\u0022 \u0027chutes installed in addition to the other main ones. There was extra fuel left over as well, which also assisted in slowing the craft down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img23/7457/ijmr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ijmr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked! All Kerbals were returned safely to Kerbin! Science earned on this mission... 2 points. For recovering two crafts from the surface of Minmus.
