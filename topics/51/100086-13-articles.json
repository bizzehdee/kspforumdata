So let\u0027s end with a picture of one Duna Lander/Hab 1, with my flag symbolically lying in the dust after the 1.1 upgrade.\n\u003E \n\nHow well were you able to climb hills with default Traction Control?  I don\u0027t get anywhere that way.  It\u0027s like the slowing of the rover gives a false positive of wheel slip for the throttle setting you\u0027re using, so the Traction Control throttles down the wheels in a self-reinforcing feedback system that quickly brings you to a halt.  At least that\u0027s my experience.  But I\u0027ve been out of town for the better part of a week, totally missed 1.1.1, and haven\u0027t yet had a chance to play with 1.1.2.  Maybe that\u0027s changed.\n\nI\u0027m glad you\u0027re having reasonably good luck with RTG power.  The main drawback with them is the price (in career games), which makes RTG-powered rovers pound-for-pound by far the most expensive vehicles in the game.  So if you have to worry about money, fuel cells might be about the only option.  Most rovers just lack the acreage of surface area to get by with solar cells."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T21:38:00Z","Content":"For the rover mission up the mountain with the standard wheels, I used the default Traction Control (and friction override to 5). I didn\u0027t do as well that time as I did later with the Grippy Tires when I was using Traction Control set to zero (and friction override set to 5)...but part of that may have had to do with the different wheels, and part of it may have been experience from the previous climb (and being more careful when needed).\n\nCertainly RTGs are expensive, and fuel cells are the poor man\u0027s option...although refueling would be a bother if you want to do long-range rover missions since we lack hoses (but I assume most people don\u0027t do drives as long as mine). I\u0027ve never played career, and my whole kerbal society is dedicated to space travel and a strong nuclear industry...so I like RTGs and have all the money I need to pay for them in my sandbox. The price on RTGs would BE cheaper if your nuclear industry was geared up to crank out thousands and thousands of the things. Also, you don\u0027t need to have as many RTGs as you might think if you just divide the wheel energy needs by the RTG output...because that\u0027s a maximum energy draw by the wheels, so for a lot of places (like mostly level areas) you won\u0027t draw that much. And in the places where you DO draw lots of power, batteries and frequent breaks can get you through.\n\nStill, I miss the good ol\u0027 days when rover wheels were more effective. I was testing the new BirdDog 1.1 on Laythe, and the wheels simply can\u0027t drag that plane up slopes like they used to be able to do. It takes a lot more contour driving...and I can\u0027t use Phys Warp to make things take less time for me because the rover/plane jitters crazily at 2X with 1.1.2 wheel physics.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-04T21:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2016 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T22:51:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, Brotoro said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, you don\u0027t need to have as many RTGs as you might think if you just divide the wheel energy needs by the RTG output...because that\u0027s a maximum energy draw by the wheels, so for a lot of places (like mostly level areas) you won\u0027t draw that much.

In the real world, of course, once you overcome inertia and have some momentum, the energy needed to maintain cruise should be less than what it took to get started.  But I\u0027ve never before known KSP to respect any 2nd Law regardless of source.  Used to be, if you wanted the wheel\u0027s max speed on level ground, you needed its max amount of EC/sec, otherwise you just went slower.  Thus, thinking things were still like that, I was budgeting EC for max consumption all the time, which is why I was turning to fuelcells from the get-go.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, Brotoro said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Still, I miss the good ol\u0027 days when rover wheels were more effective.
