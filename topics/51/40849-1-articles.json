It will also deploy mapping satellites around all the moons. This mission will bring lots of new knowledge is critical for later colonization or resource extraction. Why does not the water on Laythe freeze is one question. who will be answered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/75RUltD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/75RUltD.png\u0022 alt=\u002275RUltD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see the ship is very large to be unmanned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top the Laythe blimp, below the Val sampler, this will also be reused on the two outer moons. Finally the Tylo lander who upper stage will be used to return all the samples to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne the drop tanks you see four of the mapping satellites, yes it was not an good placement as we can not drop the drop tanks until we return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the green tanks at the rcs tank is for atmospheric samples during aerobraking. The tanks in front is for analyzes and sample return, the ones in back are holding tanks to store atmosphere for future analyze if the areobraking is to violent or short to do an analyze in the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the tank used for this passing Jool would be compromised and we has an separate one for Layte it was jettisoned after analyzes was done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool sampler has to orbit multiple times to get an low dV Laythe intercept so mission control decided to follow the sample tank on an aerobraking path to learn more about orbital decay because of atmosphere and more important watch it get crumpled deep inside Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer you see the tank going down after two orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/OXGI3zy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OXGI3zy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OXGI3zy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep down, the darkness below is a bit of an disappointment but the sunset is beautiful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/p4MWhzU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p4MWhzU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p4MWhzU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfidential part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first indication that something was wrong was the black line on the bottom of the sent picture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ynEftON\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ynEftON.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ynEftON.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an know phenomena, however it has never appeared so high in the atmosphere, the reason for it is unknown but most hold it as an simple optical effect of the high pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen one operator look down and shouted: \u0022my God its full of moons\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/nParoMm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nParoMm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nParoMm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst reaction was that Jool was hollow inside and had moons orbiting below it surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the moons looked very much like Laythe an Val, their position also match their position on the opposite side of the probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Q1PiFPd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q1PiFPd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Q1PiFPd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly explanation must be that Jool is totally transparent at larger deep, however we should still see the atmosphere on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis picture shows that the surface on Jool is just an thin layer who is not visible up close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/mJjLJzL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mJjLJzL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mJjLJzL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow 0 attitude the we as usually lost camera control, however nothing happened at 50 meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/zZ6ezoA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zZ6ezoA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zZ6ezoA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 250 meter below the surface the probe exploded violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/5ky9H7t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5ky9H7t.png\u0022 alt=\u00225ky9H7t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that in an earlier trip Jeb was able to go down to the surface level at -50 meter and bounce around before safety returning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has changed during the cataclysm, the effect might have larger impact than all the new craters on Mun who has created widespread accusations that the government did it and an call for safer Mun lander.
