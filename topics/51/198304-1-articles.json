Today i\u0027m going to be talking about this new Mission Report. It\u0027s my first one and I hope i\u0027m doing this correctly. I\u0027m not very good at KSP but I can still write about my missions. Most of the names in my Mission Report are either made by me or somewhat made of actual Spacecraft names. I also have school and work to worry about so posting times will vary depending on my KSP play time. I will however be talking about some of my other KSP adventures. Sadly, I can\u0027t provide pictures of these adventures as they are in the past. But I can still tell those stories. So, enjoy reading\u00A0 Mission Report: From Construction to Conquer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENovember 24 2020 11-24-20 Mission Log: 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s talk about what happened in the beginning, and I mean the beginning. I was sitting at my desk thinking about random things and decided to watch a KSP video. I was scrolling through and found a Matt Lowne video. I watched it and after that day I was amazed by KSP, amazed! I immediatly checked Steam to see the price. The price, surprise surprise, was only 9.99. It was on sale! I withdrew 10 dollars from an account I had and purchased the game. I loaded up and was gleeful when looking at the \u0022Mun or Bust\u0022 loading screen. Now, I do feel a little regret thinking I could join the game and just be amazing at it. Major props to whoever is a good KSP player. Playing the tutorial and launching what is called the \u0022Jumping Flea\u0022 was the best part of KSP and I will always remember opening a tutorial and launching a rocket. From this point forward my mission reports are most likely going to be more formal than this one. The one i\u0027m writing now is an introduction to my KSP experience.\u00A0 Some of the events might be told in different ways than others. Pictures and styles of writing will be used a lot! Thank you for reading the first entry of Mission Report: From Construction to Conquer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
