I found out I couldn\u0027t get more than one kerball on EVA at the time, don\u0027t know why, so I could not put Enble inside the orbiter to recharge the RCS pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was also my first mission with more than one kerbonaut. The rocket I made returned to kerbal with practically no fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother time I\u0027ll try again to get a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T06:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the first Kerbal is outside, switch back to the ship using the square bracket keys ] and [, then EVA another Kerbal.
