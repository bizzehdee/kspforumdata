The First and largest probe was designed to descend most of the way down until it was stopped by the closing walls. It would then drop a smaller probe that was RCS powered to make the final decent to the bottom.

After landing nearby the pit, I deployed my launch pad and with the rocketparts I stored aboard it, built the three probes beside the pit. The area around the northern pit I found was extremely uneven and finding a landing spot for the two measurement probes was quite tricky as I needed a spot that had another flatish landing spot on the opposite side so I would get the best possible horizontal length with minimal vertical interference. I eventually found two spots and landed the probes accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th07.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/240/9/2/probe_a_by_samio85-d6k551h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022probe_a_by_samio85-d6k551h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/240/f/a/probe_b_by_samio85-d6k56gf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022probe_b_by_samio85-d6k56gf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part was the Decent Probe stage, I had to maintain a smooth decent down while avoiding the sides of the pit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th08.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/240/9/a/hole_probe_decent_hoz__by_samio85-d6k56q2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hole_probe_decent_hoz__by_samio85-d6k56q2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/240/f/8/hole_probe_decent_vertical_by_samio85-d6k56wx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hole_probe_decent_vertical_by_samio85-d6k56wx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first it wasn\u0027t too hard, the walls were a kilometer away from me and didn\u0027t really get much closer till around 3km down. Then the walls got close enough that I needed to maneuver away from them while descending and keeping the probe centered on the pit. Since the camera works by orientating itself with the poles, my camera constantly flipped about and confused the living crap out of me. Sadly this eventually caused me to overcompensate a maneuver and I slammed myself right into the walls, destroying my reaction wheel and upper half of the first probe. The rest, including the fuel tank and engines were still intact and thanks to the Mechjeb addon on the second probe, I could still control my craft. Since the reaction wheel was gone and the RCS vents were only on the second probe, I used the now flat top of the first probe to stick to the walls with enough thrust to stop the craft from flipping, but just enough that it would slowly slide down. I eventually reached as close to the bottom as I could get with the first probe and released the second one for the final decent. It reached the bottom mostly intact, and not too far down from the first probe. It was then that the mission was a success as now I had the value needed for the C side of the triangle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th02.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/240/c/c/hole_probes_bottom_hoz__by_samio85-d6k57zd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hole_probes_bottom_hoz__by_samio85-d6k57zd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th02.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/240/9/9/hole_probes_bottom_vertical_by_samio85-d6k583f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hole_probes_bottom_vertical_by_samio85-d6k583f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/240/8/3/hole_probes_bottom_measurements_by_samio85-d6k586q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hole_probes_bottom_measurements_by_samio85-d6k586q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThe Evaluation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the efforts of those three unmanned probes, I could now calculate the final depth of Moho\u0027s Northern Pit to within 100 meters of accuracy. Since the two measurement probes were not on the exact rims of the cone, the measurements given by them were different by at least 75 meters of the actual value, and since KSP\u0027s target finding system at more than a km is only accurate to one decimal place, I used two rough values to get an approximate answer of the actual depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th06.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2013/240/7/d/diagram_known_by_samio85-d6k58r5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022diagram_known_by_samio85-d6k58r5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the values that resulted by the equations above, my final conclusion to the depth of the northern Mohoian pit was approximately 4600m deep plus or minus 50 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this mission will help future explorers and scientists uncover more about this baked world.

It looks like the power came from an RTG hidden away somewhere. Also, this thread is old, it is from 2013. Generally we try to avoid posting in old threads. It\u0027s called \u0022necroposting\u0022 and it is frowned upon, but you are new here. Welcome to the wonderful world of the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
