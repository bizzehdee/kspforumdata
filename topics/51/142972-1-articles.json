Back then I was a relative amateur at KSP, and the entire thing was shoddy, but nevertheless successful. However, looking back, the reason I chose Gilly was because I was worried about doing damage to the wheels. Once I got there, I was more worried about making orbit by accident. While I don\u0027t trust myself to create a ship capable of reaching Pol, the 2nd smallest body in the game, I do feel confident to go to Minmus. I\u0027ll submit several \u0027Chapters\u0027 in the form of IMGUR albums to showcase this. So, without further ado, I present Chapter 1!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/X7NZr/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies for no info on the album, I\u0027m not sure how to add captions to each bit, any advice is kindly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T16:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003ETHE ROVER\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo I should probably explain the rovers similarities\u00A0with the Crater Crawler. The first Machete was just an improved version of the CC that I used on my main save to transport fuel between Arch Base and Crater Base at decent speed. The second version was a lot different, as it was fitted to reach a very low orbit around the Mun on a full tank - it was basically to refuel ships in orbit without the fuel to land. The MK3 was the first version made for circumnavigating and I used it on the Mun, but I came to realise it had nowhere near the capabilities required for Mun circumnavigation. But I DID realise that if I \u0027pimped my ride\u0027, it\u0027d be more than capable of Minmus circumnavigation. And that brings us up to the MkIV that we see today.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe MkIV retains very little of the original CC in its build. The largest and main thing it keeps hold of is the basic chassis, because it fits my needs very closely - sturdy but able to hit high speeds and \u003C/span\u003Emaneuverabilities. Problem is, it\u0027s a little TOO sturdy for Minmus gravity, so I tinkered with suspension and damper strength to get it closer to my needs. The only reason I EVER used the CC to begin with is because it was quicker and easier to modify a prebuilt chassis that was perfect for the job than to build one from scratch. Basically, I don\u0027t trust my building skills ;).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stripped off 50% of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules. I also removed the fuel tanks from the back of the CC, because I won\u0027t need that much fuel on Minmus. I DID move the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks forward rather than getting rid of them - they\u0027re on the front now, next to the crew cabin. I kept the docking port on the front because if something goes wrong and I haven\u0027t quicksaved, it\u0027ll be easy to just grab another rover, drop \u002B dock, transfer fuel and crew, and continue as normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, as I said, the CC chassis was too sturdy for Minmus. To solve this, I\u0027ve split it in two into a trailer and main body. The main body retains a lot of the CC parts, but the trailer is a new matter entirely. See, if you\u0027ve ever read or seen the Martian (which\u00A0I suggest you do, it\u0027s a great story), then you\u0027ll know that Watney used the remains to the 1st rover to create a trailer that hauled all the equipment he couldn\u0027t fit on the 2nd rover, which includes the majority of the power equipment. I took inspiration from this, and made the back half a power unit with all the power generation stored there. If I lose it, I\u0027m toast, but the whole idea of having a trailer is so the build is less rigid, so it\u0027ll be more malleable than the CC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can give exact details if required, but ultimately, the Machete is more me than Squad built. As I said, the only reason I kept the CC body was because it was better made and I saw no need at the time to make a new one when there was a perfectly made chassis ready and waiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s the Machete!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ryan234abc","CreatedById":136492,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T18:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pesky hill at the end nearly crippled me, but I made it successfully back to the start point where my descent and transfer stages lay.

Also, fun fact, the max speed or the Machete IV is about 60m/s, but soon after that the tires break up and I flip to my doom. I kept to the ground as much as possible but on hill descents like the one at the end, I had to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep to the ground\u00A0and soon enough I ran out.
