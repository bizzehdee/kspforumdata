My in game roster on my primary career mode\u00A0save is broken up into three crews. Jeb, Bob and Bill make up crew A. I hired an engineer and a scientist to serve under Valentina\u0027s command on crew B and three other random\u00A0lug nuts as crew C.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, a summery\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current program to Kerban\u0027s moons is termed Project Luna, and all missions are named \u0022Lunar x\u0022. Lunar One was an ambious attempt to put two probes on Mun at once. One a real lander, the other a cheep \u0022Impactor\u0022 built around a large nose cone. But I was unable to slow the horizontal movement and the ship slammed sideways into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything past mission four uses the same Booster, what I\u0027ve named the \u0022Moho Five\u0022. None of the other planet names struck me as something I could name a rocket after. Stage one uses a cluster of 5 S3 KS-25x4 engines connected to two Kerbodyne S3-14400 each. The second stage is powered by a Skipper attached a Jumbo 64 and a X200 to avoid the Jumbo\u0027s heat issues. There is also Moho Six for Beyond Kerbin missions, an extra tank on each section of the first stage and the second stage is replaced by two 23-14400s with a Rhino engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunar\u00A0Two and\u00A0Four were successfully placed into orbit to scan the surface. Lunar\u00A0Three missed Mun and was renamed as an \u0022Beyond Kerbin Explorer\u0022\u00A0class probe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunar\u00A0Five was a successful unmanned soft landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunar\u00A0Six sample return mission suffered a \u0022Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly\u0022 when it\u00A0snapped in half\u00A0just about the Stratopause when a SRB sep went wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunar Seven-ECRV Test One was an attempt to\u00A0soft land an automated duplicate of my crewed moon ship, the Emergency Crew Return Vehicle (ECRV), to be used if any of the landings proved to\u00A0only be\u00A0\u0022good landings\u0022. You know, as in the old saying \u0022A good landing is one you walk away from. A great landing is one where they can use the thing again\u0022. The ECRV\u00A0One\u00A0ran out of gas in a high\u00A0ApoMun orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nECRV Two crash landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I got to Lunar\u00A0Eight\u00A0it was time for\u00A0the first\u00A0crewed mission to orbit\u00A0Mun. Much like NASA, I was tired of worrying about\u00A0landing, I wanted to get bodies around Mun.\u00A0\u00A0It was carried out by Crew A.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrew A returned to Mun on my next flight, Lunar Nine, my first ever (in any save) crewed landing on Mun. After ECRV One got stuck, I switched to using \u0022Saddle Bag\u0022 fuel tanks on lander missions\u00A0to ensure safe return, except ECRV Two, which carried a Converatron.\u00A0These are not connected to the main fuel supply. The second stage engine is used to begin powered decent. Once it\u0027s fuel is gone,\u00A0I have two X200 main tanks attached to\u00A0the ship to handle the rest of the trip.\u00A0The mission plan is once the craft has landed,\u00A0to transfer fuel from the saddle\u00A0tanks to the main, and then dispose of the tanks so surface EVAs can begin. You can see the tanks below behind Jeb.\u00A0On Lunar Nine, everything went smoothly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002212670079_10205976886566204_5289030108365\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/12670079_10205976886566204_5289030108365216694_n.jpg?oh=38f79890dcee74c31b0b1071f2ac69f4\u0026amp;oe=57351385\u0022 style=\u0022width:838px;height:471px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, I intended to send up a rover, naming the Mission Lunar-Sirius One. yes, I borrowed that from Andy Wier, but I don\u0027t think he cares. A stage misfired and everything went RUD from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow onto the featured event\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunar\u00A0Ten was to be Crew B\u0027s first trip to the Mun. Everything started nicely. Good\u00A0clean launch. Then things started to go downhill. First, I misstimed my TMI and put the ship with enough Delta V to escape Kirbin. No matter,\u00A0not the first time I\u0027d done that, I was still on an intercept course with\u00A0plenty of gas in the tank to do a retro-burn and park in Mun orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI freely admit I was binge watching \u0022From the Earth to the Moon\u0022 on DVD\u00A0at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext I get to the Mun, and burn the second stage engine to depletion. Not enough. I burn the lander engine for a few seconds to try to get a low point I could work with. Then I was intending to warp to the apsis and retro again. But I was distracted and I\u00A0warped too much and overshot. Panicking slightly for still being on an escape trajectory, I check the maps and noticed, \u0022hey, wait, I\u0027m heading towards Minmus!\u0022\u00A0I still needed Delta V to get the ship to intercept and ended up going through all my saddle tanks keeping the mains full. I made the mistake of jettisoning one with my solar arrays still extend,\u00A0and it\u00A0took one of my three Testusjin 28go... I mean Gigantor solar\u00A0arrays with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I got to Minmus, I was more worried about landing. I\u00A0wasn\u0027t sure as to my fuel reserves, I had never intended to fly out there and back, and\u00A0worst case could send an\u00A0ECRV to pick them up. I entered orbit then right away committed to landing. Not paying attention\u00A0to where I was going. I ended up\u00A0on the night side.\u00A0being careful, I lowered the ship slowly, never\u00A0more than 20 m/s once the sun\u00A0had set. As you can see, I wisely included landing lights around the legs. Once I saw\u00A0the ground was flat I\u00A0was able to make a nice, soft landing. Unable to see anything around me. I extended my solar arrays and waited/warped till the sun came up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002212734035_10206003711436809_4596380095473\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12734035_10206003711436809_4596380095473364236_n.jpg?oh=5cda7547a54d1de0f2eb6ce2f8038153\u0026amp;oe=576CC7E5\u0022 style=\u0022width:838px;height:471px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the sun rose, Crew B found themselves on the Lesser Flats, about 400 meters north\u00A0of the southerm slopes. I ran some surface operations, and noted how much fuel I had left, which was plenty. Once everything way packed up. I took off and parked in a low orbit for TKI. I was able to swing back into Low Kerbin orbit with enough fuel for a nice retro burn, slowing enough that re-entry and splashdown was not an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next major project will attempt to land two ships, one carrying Crew A (Lunar Eleven), the other Crew C (Lunar Twelve)\u00A0on the Mun at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
