During ascent the STS-JATO uses it\u0027s 3 SSMEs to bring the apoapsis to 100-150 kilometers. The fuel for the SSMEs is contained in a fuel tank, attached to the inside of the cargo bay. Due to this arrangement, however, the STS-JATO is unable to carry any significant payload to orbit, and can therefore only serve as a crew carrier and station resupply craft. It can also recover large payloads from orbit, and bring them back to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the shuttle exits the atmosphere, the cargo bay door are opened and the fuel tank is jettisoned. The STS-JATO then uses RCS to move away from the tank. At the apoapsis, the OMS is used to circularize the orbit. The shuttle can the proceed to fulfill its mission target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaiden Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe takeoff was flawless, with V1 (Maximum abort speed) at 70m/s and VR (Liftoff speed) at 50m/s. STS-JATO P1 lifted off well short of the runway end, and pitched up to 20 degrees to start the climb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oBYLV7P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oBYLV7P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin 5 minutes the apoapsis was at 100,650 meters. The SSMEs were shut down, and upon exiting the atmosphere the fuel tank was jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bk11gxi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Bk11gxi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OMS was ignited at apoapsis, and the orbit circularized. Due to \u003Cem\u003Epilot error\u003C/em\u003E, the STS-JATO ended up in a 96X88 kilometer orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6xwhGfX.png\u0022 alt=\u00226xwhGfX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter OMS shutdown, the cargo bay doors were re-opened and the docking port extended to test all hydraulics and electrical systems. Several orbital maneuvering tests were also conducted. Kerbal Space Program officials dismiss the proposition that all of this was done just for the \u0022...nice cinematic photos.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rFtqvcx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rFtqvcx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring re-entry the shuttle flew perfectly, up untill the moment that aerodynamic heating began. At this point STS-JATO P1 began rolling to the left, and when Mission Commander Jebediah Kerman tried to bring the ship under control it \u0022...began dancing and going in every possible direction BUT where I was trying to point the [CENSORED] shuttle [CENSORED]!!!\u0022, as said by the Mission Commander himself. As the heating subsided, the shuttle rolled over and nosedived towards the ground. Jebediah Kerman nearly managed to pull it out of the dive, but STS-JATO P1 impacted the ground at high speed. The impact destroyed most of the shuttle.

What do you think caused it? Question: Do you use FAR or the stock atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy prime suspect is that removal of the fuel and tank mass upset the aerodynamic forces. I\u0027m sure you positioned the fuel tank very carefully to minimize the change in center of mass. However, that\u0027s not the only thing you have to worry about. There\u0027s also the change in wing loading, which decreases as you burn fuel (reducing mass) while the wing area remains constant. The lower the wing loading, the lower the maximum stable speed of the aircraft. This is because stable flight requires a balance between weight pulling down and lift pushing up. Lift is a function of wing area and speed, so above a certain speed, the lift totally overpowers the mass and the aircraft is impossible to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, my theory is that during your reentry, you came out of the fire into the thick air still moving at very high speed. Suddenly, you had a huge amount of lift but not enough mass to hold it in check, so the aircraft tumbled. But as it fell lower, the thick air slowed it down more and more, decreasing the lift until you ALMOST had a balance again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is true (which I can\u0027t guarantee but strongly suspect), then you have 2 options. Either add mass to the aircraft or decrease its wing area. I believe the latter is probably the easiest to do without a complete rebuild. Of course, either option will increase the takeoff run, reduce the effective lift during ascent when mass is greatest, and result in higher landing speed. But I really do think you need to do one or the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T14:05:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother possible option: Hacksaw variable geometry wings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure out the loaded wing loading in the current configuration. This wing loading is stable so then determine the empty mass and reduce the wing area until the empty wing loading is about the same as when loaded. To reduce the wing area, build the wings out of separate parts instead of single pieces like you have now. Then mount the wingtips on decouplers so you can dump them along with the fuel tank before you de-orbit. I\u0027ve never tried this myself; this idea just popped into my head.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"POTKC","CreatedById":57600,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T14:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have FAR, although I might try to install it and see what happens.

Besides what it does to airplanes, it has a HUGE impact on rockets. OT1H, it lets you get to LKO with only a bit over 3000 dV, provided you tweak the ascent profile for most efficiency. HOWEVER, it requires long, tall rockets with lots of tail feathers, and their tallness quickly runs you into the ceiling of the VAB, which limits the size of your payloads. And lumpy payloads have to have fairings. Plus, the length of the rockets requires a LOT of RCS to maneuver them, especially once above the atmosphere where the tail feathers quit working. Besides this, I\u0027m sure the web sites like the aerobraking and parachute calculators assume you\u0027ve got the stock atmosphere, so you probably can\u0027t rely on these aids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, FAR is a major commitment. Only do it if you\u0027re willing to have a lot of side effects you\u0027re probably not expecting. But OTOH, probably someday an update will incorporate something similar to FAR, so might as well start getting used to it now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"POTKC","CreatedById":57600,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T17:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried with FAR, and the shuttle just started spinning and tore itself apart.
