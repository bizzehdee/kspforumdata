I saw an asteroid close to Kerbin, and it was a Class A. I tracked it and it was on a slow hyperbolic trajectory with a periapsis of 450km, nearly exact. (Like 499) I had never done an ARM, nor had I watched any tutorials. I overbuilt a rocket that managed to keep it\u0027s upper lifter stage, nearly full, all the way to the rendezvous. This allowed me to make an easy capture, with about 1000m/s of DeltaV. The craft still had 4500 remaining, enough to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eget into orbit. \u003C/span\u003EAnd that\u0027s not counting MechJeb\u0027s wacky Deltav readings, which were way off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m circularizing it right now, I just finished the inclination burn.
