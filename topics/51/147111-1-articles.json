Jebs excitement turned to horror as we have NO fuel to get into a stable orbit round Mun, So I build a rescue craft rescue 1 but how will I find him will he be there do I know enough to match his position and then Land.\u00A0 Well the OMG moment as I flew right above Jeb\u0027s position only to switch to Jeb and view the rescue 1 fly above at 5.000ft I could not believe such a game.\u00A0 Now to descend and land near jebs position\u00A0 on the target showed 26.km and closing this was so intent unbelievable coming down to early had to fire a bit to miss a crater peak. but I landed half a mile away (approx.) In Jebs excitement at being rescued he ran/Flew to high and crashed and rolled hundreds of yards down hill.. he must be dead surely, but Jeb just jumped up brushed himself down and boarded the craft for home.\u00A0 But Jebs troubles were not over yet ran out of fuel after have pereapsis \u00A0Burn\u00A0to 68.00ft , so another rescue, rescue 2 was on its way again only ever tried this once before and was not confident, I still take ages trying to match orbits, But we done it and finally brought Jeb back home. I have had this game just over a week and while on holiday at home have managed 10hrs a day.. and THE wife is still talking to me...lol cant wait to get home, I want to build a space station and looking at some of the pic I cant believe its possible.\u00A0 well done the Kerbal\u00A0 team excellent game the best ever\u00A0 and I owned a ZX spectrum, and have been gaming ever since.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-05T11:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums. \u00A0As you have noticed, there\u0027s nothing else out there that gives you the same feeling of accomplishment as KSP. \u00A0Enjoy the addiction but\u00A0try to remember the rest of your life as well *grin*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-05T12:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168401-capt-scarlet/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168401\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168401-capt-scarlet/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@capt: scarlet\u003C/a\u003E!
