I think you\u0027re playing a little too hard, too. I know you kadets spend a lot of time down by the shore, but the rest of your class are making good grades. You\u0027re right on the edge of flunking out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShep grimaced. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, sir. I thought I was doing alright.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright isn\u0027t good enough in the space business, Shep. A little less time at the beach, a little more time in the books, ok?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re dismissed, Shep.\u0022 Bob watched as Shep spun smartly on his heel and marched out of the classroom. \u0027Poor dumb kid\u0027, Bob thought, \u0027I hope he straightens up.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob watched Shep progress over the weeks. He stayed right on the cusp of failure, but it wasn\u0027t from lack of effort. Bob noted that he wasn\u0027t among the kadets at the beach, at least not when Bob stopped by. When his turn came up in the flight rotation, Bob gave a final thought to Shep; \u0027Poor dumb kid. I hope he makes it,\u0027 and then Bob threw himself into preparation for the Duna mission. Soon enough it was launch day, and Bob climbed into the the lander that was to be the first part of the KICARUS REBOUND vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o1Ig1eR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o1Ig1eR.png\u0022\u003EThe radio crackled. \u0022REBOUND, this is Mission Control. The board is green,\u0022 Jeb said. \u0022I\u0027ll be following you up in the command vehicle shortly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022REBOUND copies, Jeb. I\u0027ll be waiting for you.\u0022 Bob reached up, hit the shiny red button, and thundered up into orbit on a pillar of flame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, Bob radioed down to mission control, \u0022Good morning control. Orbit is stable. Systems are good. Tell Jeb to come on up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger status, REBOUND. I\u0027m afraid Jeb\u0027s not coming -- must have gotten a bad snack or something. Anyway, we\u0027ve made a crew substitution.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA sense of foreboding stole over Bob. \u0022Who is it, Control?\u0022\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DEq6IzW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DEq6IzW.png\u0022\u003E\u0022Lieutenant Shepfrey will be piloting the command module.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Poor dumb kid,\u0027 Bob thought, \u0027I hope he\u0027s ready for this.\u0027 \u0022REBOUND copies, Control. Tell the Lieutenant to quit admiring those shiny new bars and to hurry on up here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the next couple of days, REBOUND was assembled and fueled in orbit. Bob was pleased and a little proud to see that Shep seemed to at least done his homework for \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E mission, and together they got the nuclear reactor started and set a course for Duna.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HsHGwVM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HsHGwVM.png\u0022\u003EDespite Shep\u0027s apparent progress, Bob was not looking forward to months cooped up with him in the command module, and at his first opportunity, Bob stole some alone time on EVA.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CvS49nw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CvS49nw.png\u0022\u003EAs Bob looked back wistfully at the tiny dot that was Kerbin, he thought again \u0027Poor dumb kid. I hope I\u0027m ready for this.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween transmitting crew and EVA reports back to control, Bob reviewed the mission profile with Shep. \u0022Shep, you\u0027ll take the lander down to Ike. It\u0027s lower g, easier, and you\u0027ll have a big fuel reserve. We\u0027ll switch out for the Duna landing. I\u0027ll have the chutes to slow me, and then we\u0027ll rendezvous, transfer all the science to the command capsule, and blast home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Does the lander really have the fuel for that?\u0022 asked Shep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027ll be tight, but I didn\u0027t make Colonel by wasting fuel\u0022, Bob growled. Shep took the hint and resumed preparations for their arrival at Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sryBVd5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sryBVd5.png\u0022\u003EA few manuevers later, and they were entering Ike\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S35bC5B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S35bC5B.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kfeLLTn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kfeLLTn.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A2xidrg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022A2xidrg.png\u0022\u003EShep EVA\u0027d over to the lander and undocked. \u0022Don\u0027t worry too much about the fuel, Shep,\u0022 Bob commented. \u0022I\u0027ve got the chutes for the descent to Duna.\u0022\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KHtS85w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KHtS85w.png\u0022\u003E\u0022Umm, Colonel? I didn\u0027t see any chutes on the lander during my EVA,\u0022 replied Shep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob cursed to himself. REBOUND 1 had had chutes, but of course they had done no good when the ship accidentally ran into the mun, and Bob could hardly blame the \u0027poor dumb kid\u0027 for them missing on RB2, as Bob had lifted off before the kid was even assigned the mission. Bob contemplated his chances of making a totally rocket round trip to Duna\u0027s surface, and how he, the experienced one, had failed to notice the missing chutes during preflight, as he watched Shep drift away and orient the lander for the first descent burn. Bob was stunned when the three landing motors/science pods suddenly seperated from the lander! \u0022You poor dumb kid! What have you done now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RbEszvx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RbEszvx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote to self: When you manually disable motors to overcome staging problems created by assembling a vehicle in space, \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eremember to enable them again\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E before you try to use them.

C\u0027mon back and we\u0027ll pack for home,\u0022 Bob replied coldly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a long pause, Shep replied, \u0022negative, sir. We didn\u0027t come all this way not to go all the way. I\u0027m headed down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Poor, dumb, cocky kid,\u0027 thought Bob. \u0022Lieutenant, do you understand what an order is?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ike\u0027s low g, and there\u0027s no need to save fuel for Duna now, is there sir?\u0022 Shep replied as the lander continued to drift away. A moment later, the single remaining motor flared, and Bob watched helplessly as Shep rocketed down towards Ike. While he waited, he noted that the kid was transmitting what science data he had before landing. Shep might have been reckless with his own life, but he didn\u0027t risk the data that both of them had gathered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no point in distracting the kid now. Bob waited. In a few minutes, the radio crackled. \u0022I\u0027m down sir. Something to pass to the engineers: rockets make lousy landing gear.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qrF6Esy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qrF6Esy.png\u0022\u003EThe poor dumb kid was cracking jokes! Either he was dumber than Bob thought, or the most stoic Kerbonaut ever in the face of being stranded on an alien world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m going EVA. No going backwards, might as well go forwards,\u0022 Shep radioed. Bob shook his head and grinned, glad nobody could see him.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QB8gGcZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QB8gGcZ.png\u0022\u003E\u0022I came, I saw, I think I\u0027m staying,\u0022 said Shep somberly as he planted the flag. After a few moments, he moved on to gathering surface samples and returned to the lander. As he climbed aboard, a maniacal twinkle came into his eye. \u0022Colonel, stand by for data transmission. I think I have a plan.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Transmission? Shep, wait, you can bring all the data back with the rescue mission! It\u0027ll only take a couple of months.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No go, sir. The ship\u0027s perched on a steep slope. Once the sun sets and the batteries run down, the stabilizer will die and the ship will topple. A few months with no ship and no power? No can do. Besides, I\u0027m out of snacks,\u0022 Shep said as the data began to upload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But what can you do?\u0022 asked Bob. \u0022You\u0027ve no rocket!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ve got RCS. In this g, I should be able to lift off with it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Poor, dumb, desperate kid. Jeb would like him.\u0027\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JO95BIg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JO95BIg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have lift off!\u0022 Shep yelled. \u0022Wait, I\u0027m tumbling. No, got it again.\u0022 Here, experience told. Shep couldn\u0027t work the docking controls fast enough to work both attitude and thrust. As Bob popped over the horizon, he saw a streak of vapor headed right for a mountain. Incredibly, Shep managed only to graze it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XciV4PO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XciV4PO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thrusters are out, but I have the gyros. If I can just manage the impact.\u0022 Bob could hear that Shep was speaking through gritted teeth. He hit fairly softly on a downward slope, but he was sliding, sliding way too fast, and that was no gentle plain at the bottom.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zihFYok.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zihFYok.png\u0022\u003E\u0022Noooooo!\u0022 wailed Bob as he saw the glitter of scattering debris. \u0022That poor, dumb, brave kid.\u0022 With nobody to see or hear, Bob wept and wailed shamelessly as he prepared to leave orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a whim, he made his departure burn using RCS in tribute to his fallen comrade. A vapor trail through Duna space was a fitting tribute, Bob thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7IcxZpi.png\u0022 alt=\u00227IcxZpi.png\u0022\u003EThe trip back to Kerbin was a lonely one. Bob rehashed the events, all the way back to that day in the classroom. What if he had just flunked Shep out right then? Wasn\u0027t Shep\u0027s death really his fault? Perhaps subconciously to punish himself, Bob plotted a steep reentry into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BXozkjQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BXozkjQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fpmy5ds.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fpmy5ds.png\u0022\u003EBob didn\u0027t even notice the gees. He automatically, instinctively, guided the command module down with all the skill his years of experience had given him. Soon he was contemplating sunrise on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dyvmNWp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dyvmNWp.png\u0022\u003EAs he awaited the recovery team, he listened to their chatter over the comm link. Their sadness, yes, but their excitement, too, at all the science to be recovered from the module. Shep had helped make that possible. Certainly, Bob couldn\u0027t have done it alone. \u0027Poor, dumb, kid. I think I miss you,\u0027 Bob thought as he climbed into the helicopter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at KSC, Bob met with some of Shep\u0027s classmates. He described what Shep had done, and dumb or not, they agreed that he was worth remembering. They commandeered a rover and headed to Shep\u0027s favorite spot on the beach, where they planted a flag in his honor.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s2xnPhd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s2xnPhd.png\u0022\u003EWhile Shep\u0027s classmates talked quietly about their friend, Bob stood apart and gazed over the water. \u0027Poor dumb kid\u0027 he thought. \u0027Poor, dumb, magnificent kid.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
