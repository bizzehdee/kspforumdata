The second module of the station also added solar panels to ensure continuous power to the station.\n\nI used the RCS at this stage to circularize to a 200x200km orbit.\n\nStage 3 - Science Module:\n\nThe third module was the science module. Although this is a sandbox save and it has no real function I felt that a good station had a science module.\n\nThis module contains 1 mobile processing lab and 4 science bay jrs and mystery goo containers. It also adds more batteries and monopropellant to the station and has several communication dishes.\n\n![screenshot21.png](http://62.195.185.218/station/screenshot21.png)\n\nThis module was even lighter than the previous one, so it could use the same launcher and launch profile.\n\n![screenshot22.png](http://62.195.185.218/station/screenshot22.png)\n\nIn orbit you get a better look at the different modules. There was still some fuel left in the launch stage at this time.\n\n![screenshot23.png](http://62.195.185.218/station/screenshot23.png)\n\nDocked! The fuel from the launch stage was transferred to the central fuel tank of the station and then the launch stage was deorbited.\n\nAt this point the station is only 186 parts, has room for 384 kerbals (\u002B2 in the science lab if needed) and 6 free docking ports for ships and 2 more large docking ports for future extensions. \n\nBeauty shots:\n\n![screenshot25.png](http://62.195.185.218/station/screenshot25.png)\n\nClose up of the science module\n\n![screenshot26.png](http://62.195.185.218/station/screenshot26.png)\n\nClose up of the refinery\n\n![screenshot27.png](http://62.195.185.218/station/screenshot27.png)\n\nShot with 3 crew transfer vehicles docked and a prototype ion powered craft leaving the station.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T16:53:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rfmeijboom**"},{"CreatedByName":"hurnik_playz DE","CreatedById":144078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T07:20:17Z","Content":"Wonderful space station.
