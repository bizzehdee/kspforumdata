Then, I throttled up to 75%. I punched the space bar and off I went into the cold dark void that is known as \u0022Outer Space\u0022. I circularized my orbit in low-kerbal-orbit. I did my Hohmann transfer burn to Minmus and off I went to Minmus. I truly was so excited, because I was going to land on my first Moon other than the Mun. I got into a circular orbit of Minmus and later I burned retrograde to start the landing process. I landed after minutes of yo-yoing 32 meters above the surface. I took Jeb out, planted a flag, did some science, and went back in. I have a screenshot to prove it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/128133743@N03/\u0022 alt=\u0022128133743@N03\u0022\u003E (Right click and click, view image in new tab if you are using chrome, sorry for the comma, it\u0027s my english!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I returned home safely, with Jeb inside the cozy warmth of his capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the moral of the story?: Even if your a newbie, if people criticize you, don\u0027t let that discourage you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T20:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations on your landing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E However probably should have posted this in mission reports instead of general discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T20:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas this your First, Second, or Third voyage to Minmus?... and did you get there First, Second, or Third?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T20:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWas this your First, Second, or Third voyage to Minmus?... and did you get there First, Second, or Third?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh.
