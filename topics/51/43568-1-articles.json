Mission Control at Kerbal Space Centre authorised the launch of the Spacebus \u0027MaxiTaxi\u0027, which was launched and later docked to Cloudsmoke in record time and almost without incident - an error in calculation lead to a high speed near miss (60m/s and passed the station at 30m avoiding a collision with the station and the docked \u0027Big Orange\u0027 fuel supply probe). 2 new milestones, for Time-to-station and for Safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter transferring the 4 astronauts who were to stay on station for the next few months, Jeb undocked the MaxiTaxi and de-orbited hoping to achieve a safe landing within 75km of the KSC thus achieving a new record for mission time and actually landing close to home. By Jeb\u0027s amazing piloting skills the Return Module of the MaxiTaxi was brought down 5km off the coast of the KSC, a mere 8km from the Astronaut Complex front door, allowing for recovery by the \u0027Swampthing\u0027 aAARV (an autonomous amphibious recovery vehicle) and delivery of Jeb, Bill, and Bob Kerman to the Astronaut Complex. A third milestone for the mission, as it was the first time this had ever been accomplished, and a fourth for the shortest Time-to-completion for the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC declares the mission a Complete Success, the highest level of non-failure currently achievable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/end report]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T08:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat report, but some pictures would really bolster the response and increase your fun levels.
