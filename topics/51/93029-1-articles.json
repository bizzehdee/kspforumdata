I decided to try my first orbital rendezvous in RSS using the Gemini Spacecraft and the Agena Target Vehicle. Overall, I was pretty successful, but I had to use most of the fuel in the Gemini service module adjusting my orbit because I messed up the Titan-II launch. I\u0027m still trying to figure out the optimal ascent profile to use with it.
