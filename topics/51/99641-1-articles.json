I won\u0027t be doing career mode, as I can\u0027t find any tech tree which conforms to what I want to do with this, so this\u0027ll be done in Sandbox mode. However, I will be starting small, mostly because I don\u0027t know a lot about kOS and I want to keep a realistic progression of flights. Because all this will be open source, anyone can contribute (see github page below) and submit ideas for future missions, improve code for upcoming planned missions and helping plan the trajectories and procedures for upcoming missions (using KSPTOT.) Maybe, together, we can actually learn some kOS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the mods that are almost definitely going to be in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EkOS\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemoteTech\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENEAR\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDeadly Re-entry\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETACLS\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProcedural Parts - makes the rockets easier to build and keeps the part count low\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings we need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA logo, because all space programs must have a spiffy logo\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMoar contributers\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECheck github for more jobs\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are interested in participating/collaborating with me on this project, hit me up here or on the git: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/FanaticalFighter/KSP-OSSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/FanaticalFighter/KSP-OSSP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMissions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110562-Open-Source-Space-Program-Collaborative-exploration-of-space-with-kOS?p=1755068\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1755068\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPathfinder 1 - First satellite launch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T05:57:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FanaticalFighter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T12:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo will code be linked here in the thread as well as github?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been thinking about going back to KOS, it\u0027s been a while but AFAIK the syntax has remained similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine initially I would just use snippets of code linked here then once I am familiar again I could contribute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FanaticalFighter","CreatedById":77314,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T12:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll only be posting missions here, because posting all the code here will inflate this thread with meaningless stuff.
