Operation Desperate Effort, Went from defend Kyberia, To end this civil war without a maximum of any civilian casualties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproximately 45 Minutes After the Broadcast, The citizens somehow started burning down every government building that wasn\u0027t guarded by at least 20-30 Juggernaut Soldiers with Rocket Launchers and Auto Aiming LMGs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe didn\u0027t want to kill civilians even in their murderous state, We just tried our best to suppress them with high weaponry, And Armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there was a time... When we had to, somehow they raided the gun stores and we had to fight back... But we tried our best to use non-lethal bullets, We had snipers use knockout bullets and try to get enough of them sleeping and get them to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we suppressed enough of them they pulled back but we couldn\u0027t start our original objectives, The Federation Hit our Home...

We fought them to a stalemate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs enemy recon teams are that they can send due to our air defenses being back online, We always have a emergency counter attack on all cities in case of attack... With a variety of Robotic Attackers, Such as UGVs and Experimental Robotic Soldiers As Well as anti-vehicle and infantry cannons/MGs/turrets and more, Anti Air Defenses Shot down enough drones and we took down the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s time to fight them back, we pulled away our quick reaction force, Tasked them with taking down various enemy positions in order to support our assault and end this bloody battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey got their in a few hours, undetected luckily. They assault enemy Artillery and Mortars, Various armed and infantry patrols as well as sabotaging enemy transports, air and ground... Once we got them out of there we gave the word, And Explosions were felt in all enemy positions, We pushed them out and they retreated... It was a lucky day for the UKS, And we regained the citizen\u0027s trust by fighting them off and evacuating them... After our teams recovered they stopped the civil war, Saving our cities... But the federation is long but defeated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T05:36:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bearsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
