I joined the forums back in December to get more into modding to bring out the game\u0027s full potential, and I\u0027m pleased to say I\u0027ve found a working combination that so far hasn\u0027t given me many issues. Mods like FinalFrontier and Kerbal Construction Time really take the game in the direction I enjoy most (semi-RPG while still completely sandbox), and so it\u0027s gotten me thinking, along with this sub-forum, that I should throw together a history of sorts for my current career mode. It would not do the handful of visual mods I use justice if I didn\u0027t include an unhealthy number of screenshots, so I apologize in advance if 100\u002B pictures just getting my first Kerbal to space isn\u0027t your thing. Rbray and Ven in particular get a massive shout-out for all their amazing work!\n\nAs far as the direction I intend to go, I look at stuff like [lajoswinkler\u0027s Kron series](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104160) in complete awe and am inspired to do something similar. Eventually, my goal is to pull of some fairly lengthy missions and hopefully in turn inspire others just like I have been. However, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m anywhere near ready for something like that yet, as I\u0027ve never left Kerbin\u0027s gravity well (although I could easily pull it off I\u0027ve just never been keen on skipping through vast amounts of time)... And since I started using TAC, it\u0027s like re-learning the game all over. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Either way, I hope I can at least entertain some of you and provide some nice pictures. Admittedly, before I started playing KSP, I didn\u0027t know much about space. However, I find that\u0027s the coolest part of the game, where most games have you learning some silly mechanics particular to just that game or genre, KSP has me reading up on Einstein\u0027s work and learning all kinds of things about our actual history of spaceflight.\n\nHere\u0027s a general list of things I haven\u0027t done that I\u0027m looking to do:\n\n- unmanned flyby of another planet\n- manned flyby of another planet and return\n- unmanned orbit of another planet\n- manned orbit of another planet and return\n- unmanned landing on another planet\n- manned landing on another planet and return\n- assembling a space station without MechJeb\n- assembling a space station outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI\n- system-wide comsat network\n- long-term manned surface expedition of a moon (Mun or Minmus)\n- build a spaceplane that can take-off and land with minimal staging\n\nAnd for fun, here are some things I\u0027ve accomplished in 0.25 stock (before I knew how to take nice screenshots)...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Dubbed *START (System Test, Atmospheric Research, \u0026 Training)*, the project looked to build the first rocket design capable of breaking outside of the atmosphere, and to test the essential systems required for spaceflight.\n\nThe first component for the craft was a pressurized cabin capable of supporting a single Kerbal through atmospheric and non-atmospheric flight. The pod also featured a parachute for un-powered atmospheric descent and landing. The design team looked toward the ancient ballistic projectile, the arrow, for inspiration and namesake. As the pod will sit on the top of the eventual *Arrow* rocket, the team has settled on a pointed design and the name *Arrowhead*.\n\nAfter five days of assembly, it was time for Jebediah to get acquainted with the pod that will eventually bring him to space. No engine was installed for the ground test, the engineers mentioned something about saving time... Shortly before sunset, the pod was rolled out to the launch pad to test the whole procedure before an actual flight, and Jebediah took a few minutes to test all the electronics and life support systems on the pod\u0027s power to make sure everything was working as intended.\n\nAs Jebediah exited the pod, he glanced up at the outline of the Mun and thought to himself, \u0022someday...\u0022. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Achieving a minor scientific breakthrough, it was equipped with a couple of science modules as well. Nearly ten days later, the work was complete and it was a clear day to take to the skies. Now it was time for Jebediah to prove to the world he\u0027s a Kerbal worth his salt! \n\nThe engine was tweaked perfectly to hit 5000 m, we went ahead and chalked that up to pure luck. The parachutes didn\u0027t cause any problems either, and Jebediah became the first rocket test pilot in Kerbal history (and lived to tell the tale).\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Toiling extensively throughout the night and following day, the team finished getting the *Arrow* prepared for another run after eight hours. By the time it was ready, it was too dark for any sane pilot, but Jeb insisted on flying anyways and attempted to set an altitude record at 11 km.\n\nHis rocket ended just shy of 11 km... so the primary objective was failed, and the team will have to spend another day getting the *Arrow* prepared to hit the mark. At least some data was acquired and Jeb made it back safe and sound with the *Arrow* in one piece.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

While no changes were made to fuel capacity, a set of landing legs and floats were installed. However, the team failed to take into account the added weight, and so while Jeb was convinced the *Arrow I* could push 22 km, the *Arrow II* could not. However, despite the oversight, the mission still provided the first data from Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere.\n\n*In retrospect, it was really silly to try and get to a higher altitude by adding weight... let\u0027s pretend this never happened.* ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif) *There are no pictures, because I don\u0027t believe landing legs hanging off the engine are worthy of the direction I\u0027m trying to take this space program... and I kind of forgot...

The *Iron Spine* was made detachable and recoverable thanks to two radial mounted chutes while also getting 50% more fuel capacity, and a launch clamp was added for good measure. With the last successful mission coming ten days ago and two failures out of the last three missions, the team was really hoping for good luck this time.\n\nUnfortunately, Jeb\u0027s piloting skills were a bit off and didn\u0027t quite break 22 km. However, being only 2000 m off, there was only some fine tweaking to be done to ensure the mark was hit next time. The separation and descent of the engine stage went off without a hitch, on the up side. It even provided some cool footage!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The boosters could be separated once depleted and recovered thanks to parachutes, and featured small radial gyroscopes to aid in control of the craft. The engineers strapped them on the *Arrow* and wished Jeb godspeed. *Fun fact: this launch was supposed to happen on D51, but had to be scrubbed because someone installed the SRBs with the wrong decals...*\n\nThe boosters worked better than intended, and Jebediah soared out of the atmosphere with fuel to spare. After deliberating with mission control, Jeb reluctantly jettisoned the main engine with nearly 75% capacity left in the tank. The *Arrow* might be capable of reaching orbit... but not today, as there was not enough life support on board. The return chute on the *Iron Spine* should hold, according to the engineers, so the fuel won\u0027t go to waste. Before beginning the descent, Jeb quickly logged the first scientific data from outer space.\n\nIt took 54 days, but the *START* mission was finally concluded. Jebediah Kerman went down in history as the first Kerbal in space. Even though it was only a suborbital trip, it was a huge step for Kerbalkind and the *Kerbal Aeronautics and Space Administration*.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Ten days after completion of the *START* project, the *SPTNK (Space Probe Testing, No Kerbals)* program began. This time, the Kerbals were going to run a series of tests in space as well as develop a reliable launcher to deliver payloads to LKO.\n\nThe first mission was to deliver the first probe into orbit around Kerbin, while the flight path called for chasing the sunlight for sweet pictures! All systems were nominal for takeoff and flight, and the *Arrow* successfully inserted the *Pioneer* probe into a stable 71 km x 144 km retrograde equatorial orbit roughly 5 minutes after take-off. While separating from the probe, the *Iron Spine* stage fired its retro-boosters to drop itself to a suborbital trajectory for eventual salvage. The batteries on the *Pioneer* were only good for a couple of minutes, but it was enough time for mission control to confirm the orbital parameters and declare mission success! \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The latest design replaced the two radial boosters with a new booster stage composed of three solid fuel boosters mounted below the main stage. \n\nThe mission was to deliver the *Trident* probe into orbit, marking the first effort at harnessing the sunlight for power in outer space. The *Trident* featured solar panels and rechargeable batteries that would hopefully pave the way for future missions and long-term space activities.\n\nNot too long after sunrise, there was successful liftoff. The *Trident* was delivered to a 71 km x 150 km equatorial orbit and transmitted data until it fell out of communications range from the KSC. Roughly 33 m 24 s later, it made another pass over the space center and continued to transmit scans on Kerbin\u0027s magnetosphere. It will continue to do so indefinitely, until it malfunctions or the orbit degrades (*and since neither happen in KSP... forever*). \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

After some rigorous testing, the team started working on the design plans. The goal was to build a prototype communications probe to close out the *SPTNK* program and to lay the groundwork for the next project: establishing a communications satellite network in low Kerbin orbit. On Day 90, construction of the payload and rocket began.\n\nIn order to build a communication satellite network, the satellites will need their own propulsion systems to fine-tune their orbits and stay in sync with each other. The *Perseverance* probe has been designed to fit the mold of a basic satellite, complete with RCS and enough battery power to last during the dark period of the orbit. While a communication satellite would normally have only antennas, the *Perseverance* was outfitted with a geiger counter and will transmit data on radiation levels for the duration of its life span.\n\nThe booster stage was redesigned to fit the rocket form a bit better and to lower the part count. The concept of two side boosters was abandoned in favor of a tight bundle under the primary stack. The *Iron Spine* also received an upgrade, switching out the engine for one more suitable for high-atmospheric and orbital maneuvers. \n\nThe new design exceeded expectations and delivered the *Perseverance* probe to a 99 km x 122 km orbit with an inclination of 47.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 within six minutes after takeoff. The RCS propulsion tests were successful and the *Perseverance* began measuring the radiation levels in low orbit. The team is now undertaking preparations to develop and launch the first series of communication satellites, marking the end of the highly successful *SPTNK* program.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

After furious testing on Day 102, the design was completed and work began on assembling the first vehicle. In all, there was to be five satellites in a circular 175 km equatorial orbit, establishing the framework for orbital activities around Kerbin out to nearly geosynchronous orbit. The satellite design called for about 72\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 separation to cover the entire equator, so the team will practice remote orbital rendezvous with a point in space for the first time. These techniques will provide a valuable learning experience if we are to move on to more complex goals someday. The *Arrow IX* launcher chosen for the mission remained unchanged from the design that launched the *Perserverance* into orbit.\n\nShortly after sunset on Day 110, the first satellite was launched successfully. Nearly two hours later, due to loss of signal for brief periods, the *LKONET-1* satellite achieved the desired orbital parameters. The final orbit after corrective RCS was 174.2 km x 175.8 km, hitting the targeted semi-major axis of 775 km within five meters.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
