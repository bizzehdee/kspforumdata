All I need to find is a way to sync the sounds properly or for an engine to fire once the cylinders at full pressure.. Similar to how I use the jet alternators and rover wheels as a proper throttle for a diesel loco  \n\nSteam needs a bit more engineering though.. I want a proper fire from an engine visible from the IVA cab and chuff sound being audible not just pitch change like diesels  \n\nAll possible..slowly coming to reality  \n\nI also found KAS magnets make more dependable kracken resistant couplings.. But we need to use switchers to marshall a train.. So battery electric yard locos are on the roadmap too..  \n\nIll release my 44 class generator engine and wheels over the next week..works fine with mechjeb or kos on the reverser (lock wheelthrottle to 1.)  \n\nYoull need a joystick or wheel though  \n\nSo yeah..its all coming slowly but nothings been forgotten :)"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T21:33:01Z","Content":"Little update..\n\nMy PCs dead so ill be getting a new more powerful and dependable rig very shortly  ..

resulting in a locomotive dragging to much to one side or being overpowered unresponsive to throttle (Too much power) \n\ntheres 2 states of a wheel - running and underpowered/off with a slight delay or ramp between the two later - \n\nthis means that at full power all wheels are running - at idle none or just one is running.. a locomotive at idle will slowly creep forward.. yet on a slight incline wont be effected - the system is far more evident climbing hills where torque not speed - comes into play - even beyond pure numbers - a fully powered system will still benefit of having 2 engines running providing an oversupply of power\n\n(Unique to the mark 7 44 class - Earlier locomotives required 2 engines for full power)\n\nAdd to this a wheel ramps down its power requirement as it gets closer to the torque cutoff speed - in that a locomotive running at near top speed of 26ms will use less power than one climbing a hill at 10ms... the later requiring full output of the engines - this I only discovered while driving battery powered trams well after this idea was hatched a few years back\n\nThe whole thing is kept \u0022in gear\u0022 but holding the pedal on my steering wheel set flat akin to a locomotive deadman pedal or pushing the aero trim fully forward (Alt W, or X to reset)\n\nWith the trains wheels aiding in keeping the locomotive straight with better balancing, a near perfect system can be achieved, \n\nPowerful, Noisy, Smokey, Moody, Horrible, Explody.. \n\nAll those wonderful things ive come to expect and love about driving these wonderful deadly machines\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T12:48:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Overland**"}]}
