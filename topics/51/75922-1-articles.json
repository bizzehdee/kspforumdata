Intrigued, I started to plan my mission. I regularly visited the thread, to see what the challenges were that I had to complete. I then saw someone went to every planet for their entry. When I saw what could be done, I was inspired to do something similar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP since 0.21.1, and only recently have I sent probes to the other planets. I still have yet to even encounter the two dwarf planets, land on any moons other than the Mun and minmus and other planets (except Duna) legitimately. The \u0027Kerbol Program\u0027 aims to have multiple kerbals landing on every object in the Kerbol system and returning them safely back to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConstruction:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other entries in the Jool-5 challenge, my mission will use an asteroid (a LARGE asteroid) as a core. I will also use probes to map the planets to choose a landing spot, along with basic landers for targets. Of course, it will use multiple modules for fuel, science and landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImages:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have yet to make any images or videos showing my progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
