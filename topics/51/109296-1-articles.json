That space potato is insane to reach, let alone land on WITH A ROVER!\n\n...okay, \u0022Big Wheel\u0022, sorry.\n\n...WITH A BIG WHEEL! And why would we need to circumnavigate it?! Why would you accept such a challenge, this\u0027ll bankrupt the KSC with the size of the rocket we have to build to get there!\n\n*\\*sigh\\** Well, I *suppose* we could check that wasteland of a planet for any anomalies...we\u0027ve been getting strange readings from Moho\u0027s north pole, and we haven\u0027t heard anything about the [fairies](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1bt9c7/my_continuing_mission_to_moho_a_rescue_is/) in quite some time...\n\n...ladies and gents, may I have your attention, please! We need our best, brightest engineers to build us a \u0022big wheel\u0022 that can get someone to, and land on, Moho!\n\n...\n\n...get to work! We don\u0027t get paid to blow things up, you know! Now, any volunteers to go on the trip?\n\n**Imgur link:** [**http://imgur.com/a/NUWmo**](http://imgur.com/a/NUWmo)\n\nI suggest that you visit the album in order to read the descriptions, things might make a tad more sense.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
