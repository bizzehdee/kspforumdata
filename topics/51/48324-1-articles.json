You should know how to get your craft to the Joolean system and how to park in Tylo\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a two-stage probe lander still attached to a heavily depleted tug which had lots of tanks that have been jettisoned throughout the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/vtnq8tzft/osteoblast_tylo_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022osteoblast_tylo_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon parking at 500 km height in Tylo\u0027s orbit, the tug still had half of its fuel. I wouldn\u0027t recommend going into a lower orbit because you have to deal with lots of lateral movement and you don\u0027t have enough time because you\u0027re falling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started braking using the tug and managed to do a nice reduction in lateral speed while still high above the satellite.

There were several full stops and ascents midair because I didn\u0027t want to land on the slope.

You can see from the screenshots what it takes to land the smallest probe core and be left with half of the last tank. This thing is still capable of hopping around, but it can\u0027t reach any orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine how tedious it must be to go Apollo on Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember to park in a high enough orbit to avoid problems with huge lateral speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-14T07:37:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2013 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T04:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Tylo and giving tips? Good job! I havent landed on anything but Laythe in the Jool system. I could if I wanted to devote time to it. I just like Duna and Ike so much more. I am throwing together a semi-grand tour in my KSP series. I plant to visit Jool after Duna then Eeloo then Moho and Eve then home. I want to land on Tylo, but I\u0027m still questioning if I should. It would for sure need its own lander. I could also reuse my Laythe lander a planned 2 stager with jet engines.
