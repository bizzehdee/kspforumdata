I\u0027ve been so bad at it that I\u0027ve skipped ideas just because they would have ended up involving docking. These missions were all stock, except for Procedural Fairings.

I actually flew more than 5 missions. My final craft file is actually Titan 10.

This guy is cool. I spent a ton of time getting the parachutes right on it, and I love it. The fairings at the top are not overly done, and the whole thing is fun to pilot. I start with zero throttle and just use SRBs. Then as they drop off I slowly increase throttle until I am maxxed out. The SRBs give it just enough boost that when the final is dropped the whole craft stops accelerating and just holds its velocity for a second. That one second is just enough time to burn off enough fuel to make it light enough to continue to accelerate. She hits orbital with only a little fuel left in the 2nd stage. The upper orbital stage is completely full when deployed. There is probably enough fuel to keep pushing for larger payloads. I don\u0027t know the max, and it won\u0027t be a whole lot, but it could be fun to find its limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis really has mirrored the Gemini missions.

Making orbital adjustments without needing to use nodes and just understanding the different directional inputs. Docking has been huge to learn.
