I\u0027ll be home in time for lunch.\u0022 Hensy replied before igniting his engine once more to lower his periapsis into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lfKEhHA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lfKEhHA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the ship had hit the upper atmosphere the service module was jettisoned and the parachute armed. This exposed the heat shield, and should Hensy meet a grim fate the science inside the capsule would survive. As the pod continued to fall through the atmosphere the air began to compress and heat around it, the heat shield absorbing and deflecting a large portion of the heat away from the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lfKEhHA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lfKEhHA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wOL0s9p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wOL0s9p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly Hensy was jolted forwards as his paracute opened far sooner than expected and began slowing him down far higher than he was supposed to. \u0022This is going to be a long fall.\u0022 he uttered as he waited until the ship finally came to res in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QPjlrRv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QPjlrRv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tSFsMrW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tSFsMrW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
