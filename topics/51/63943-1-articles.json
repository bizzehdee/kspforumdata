He\u0027d experimented a lot with boats in the past but had never been able to combine the ability to move at all with any degree of controllability. But recently he\u0027d heard that radial intakes would serve as floats so he determined to give that a try for his pedalboat project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Hey Bill, wanna help me test my amphibious boat?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Boats are lame. They either don\u0027t move or can\u0027t steer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022I think I might have the answer to that. If it works, we\u0027ll be famous.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Will this involve cattle prods?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022No, I\u0027ve designed it so we\u0027ll be out of reach of each other. You just have to pedal to Airbase Island while I steer, then we switch for the trip home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they set to work. They encountered many failures just getting aboard the boat and getting it moving. Then, when they finally got it in the water, it didn\u0027t move very well due to excessive weight. But by deleting the RCS steering system, which had proved unnecessary, and cutting the radial intakes down to the bare minimum, they finally had something that would work reasonably well. Here it is, after the initial launch step of separating it from the lander cans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TbWQKEP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TbWQKEP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb called it the \u0022War Galley\u0022. The push-post for forward motion was styled as a dragon figurehead. Amidships, the probe core set up as a steering wheel for the other Kerbal in the lawn chair. Using nothing but gravity and probe torque, the War Galley eased forward out from under the lander cans, set its parking brake, and extended its ladders. Then Bill and Jeb bailed from the cans and climbed aboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hQhDOoW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hQhDOoW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrevious testing had shown that the presence of the lander cans on the runway interfered with using the probe core to steer, so at this point the probe core on the cans released the launch clamps and fired the Sepratrons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KC5G6v5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KC5G6v5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrevious tests had shown that firing the cans with SAS on made it go straight up and straight down, which was a bit dangerous, but leaving its SAS off made it go halfway down the runway to explode in in full few of Jeb and Bill.

At this point, he just let it coast while Jeb steered and used the brakes as necessary to negotiate the drop and the end of the runway and the slope down to the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vJebzTM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vJebzTM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in the water, Jeb retracted the landing gear and Bill started pedaling again. They had 30km to go to Airbase Island, as shown by the distance to a flag previously planted there by Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5KfMA9W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225KfMA9W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe War Galley moved fairly well in the water but had a tendency to drift to the left, probably due to there being 2 figureheads instead of 1 on the centerline. When Jeb used the probe core\u0027s torque to get back on course, he\u0027d check the speed and usually it was between 21 and 22m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HghqDvC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HghqDvC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong the way, Jeb tried switching on the PhysicsWarp but discovered this was counterproductive. While time passed at the expected multiple, the War Galley\u0027s speed fell by an equal amount, so they actually made better progress without it. But it was still a long trip to the island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HghqDvC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HghqDvC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut eventually they got close enough for the beach to come above the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oIsgFZd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oIsgFZd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they got very close to shore, Bill stopped pedaling and Jeb deployed the landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dmhTNdp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dmhTNdp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Bill resumed pedaling and the War Galley surged up the slope. Their goal was almost within walking distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EEwCwLc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EEwCwLc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, when they got to the top of the hill, there was a mishap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/letaCrc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022letaCrc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Dammit, Bill, why were you going so fast?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0022 \u0022Dammit Jeb, can\u0027t you steer a rover without tipping it over?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Well, at least I don\u0027t have to pedal us back home now.

Capable of at least 60m/s on land and at least 22.7m/s in the water, and reaching Airbase Island from KSC in 34 minutes.

So the Kerbal only hits the push post 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4 as often, leading to a speed reduction inversely proportional to the warp setting.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/llBmeFd\u0022\u003EI hope Squad never fixes this \u0022feature.\u0022 At least with rovers and boats, you can justify it as using some sort of bicycle chain mechanism so why not?
