We we\u0027re falling back to earth, I tried to throttle up to not fall back but it didn\u0027t work! So we\u0027re falling, jebediah smiling as always, Rest of the crew...Not so much, I had to get my crew back alive. I HAD TO! We\u0027re falling kinda fast, I see from my m/ compass on the bottom that we\u0027re not in orbit anymore...Station falling even faster now that we\u0027re on the surface\u0027s gravity, I had to do something and quick! I quickly EVA the 1st Crew member taking that risk because i watched a youtube video from kerbals falling and surviving, I then switch back to the 2nd Crew member inside the station, EVA Him, Switch to the 3rd Crew Member, EVA him, Now all 3 are falling super fast, I open the 3rd\u0027s jetpack, switch to the 2nd, open his switch to the 1st, open his, and then switch to all 3 and use the jetpack on all of them, And once we hit ground they all survived! It just felt really awesome and victorious that they actually survived!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T16:06:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lolkillalevi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T16:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHahaha, that is quite funny, I haven\u0027t done anything like that but I will try to remember that for next time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lolkillalevi","CreatedById":90916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T16:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhyunix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rhyunix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHahaha, that is quite funny, I haven\u0027t done anything like that but I will try to remember that for next time\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey thanks!
