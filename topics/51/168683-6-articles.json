frightening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Things are just fine Jorfen, as you probably know.\u0022\u00A0 He would have added \u0027now that we\u0027re going to be getting your space

give focus to our efforts.\u00A0 Following the recorded energy surge seemingly focused towards Duna after we first approached the Munolith, obviously a detailed first-hand exploration of Duna is critical.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Originally we would have proposed a systematic survey by probes, not only of the Duna monoliths but also those of Mun and Minmus.\u00A0 However, the revelation to the public that the Shaman Stones are likely not of kerbal manufacture and that indeed one had been found on the moon has lead to an explosion of demand for exploration at the highest levels.\u00A0 A \u0027complete confidence\u0027 briefing was held for senior CA lawmakers, and their opinion was unanimous.\u00A0 The Program Civil Authority has been given the directive by the Civil Authority to, at first opportunity, land a kerbal at the highest priority site on Duna and investigate first-hand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost in the room had had an inkling

near the anomaly, which is automated but could also be comfortably manned.\u00A0 Due to the long day cycle of Duna, the craft would only spend 1 period of daylight on Duna\u0027s surface, both for reasons of battery life due to the expensive magnetic shielding used on the craft, and to minimize the chance of outright failure of a key component that might leave the crew of 2 stranded on the surface.\u00A0 After returning to orbit, the crew would observe and study the planet remotely before returning at first opportunity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It should be pointed

are virtually convinced that we were visited 17,000 years ago by space-faring beings, we are also soundly convinced that these beings are no longer present, and indeed most of our think-tank work concludes that they must no longer be extant.\u00A0 Therefore, there is ample thought that must be directed towards the conventional search for life in the solar system, as at\u00A0this juncture we

sat at a mechanic\u0027s desk in the Air Force space-plane hangar, the large craft itself now nearly half disassembled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was easy to see why it had never made it to orbit, even to him.\u00A0 It had clearly been designed by someone who thought the only answer to drag was \u0022\u003Cem\u003Emoar power\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, and the pilots\u00A0had been told that a \u0022standard\u0022 re-entry included the phrase, \u0027when the uncontrollable tumble begins immediately deploy the chutes\u00A0or you may not regain consciousness to do so\u00A0before impact.\u0027\u00A0 Comforting.\u00A0 Parts were even now being cataloged and deemed \u0027store\u0027 or \u0027dispose\u0027 by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E technicians, and then loaded on the\u00A0 appropriate trucks.\u00A0 Mortimer was itemizing the parts that would be disposed of\u00A0and calculating the expected remuneration they\u0027d get back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the \u0027complete confidence\u0027 lawmaker\u0027s briefing, Mortimer\u0027s primary job had been complete.\u00A0 He had originally been brought in to ensure that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E survived its spartan early funding period, and with the CA decision to divert half of the last year\u0027s Air Force space-plane budget to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E there would be so much cash that even Gene would be hard pressed to spend them into ruin.\u00A0 That being said, there was no reason it had to be Mortimer sitting here doing part notations in an unheated hanger on a chilly morning.\u00A0 He could have sent his assistant.\u00A0 However Mort was trying to find an answer to a larger question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn-between the technicians jogging up and dropping off slips of paper, Mort was going through the construction and concept documents for the Munex Initiative.\u00A0 The space plane had been born of a desire to ferry cargo frequently to space, and also rationalize the programs co-existence with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E from a gross horizontal/vertical launch perspective.\u00A0 The Munex Initiative had been born out of a classified briefing given by D-Magic to the CA which highlighted the threat to civilization of asteroid collision.\u00A0 What was most interesting though is that it was not the CA that decided to base asteroid intercepting missiles on the moon, that scheme had been pitched by D-Magic themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more he read the memos\u00A0though, the less convinced he was that D-Magic really cared about executing the plan.\u00A0 They seemed far more interested in establishing and ensuring frequent travel to Mun.\u00A0 Frequently they passed off design decision making or even suggestion opportunities to the Air Force, but always offered a firm opinion whenever that would support more numerous cartage trips.\u00A0 He was particularly interested in specifics of the plan that they argued most vociferously for, namely radar observatories at both poles.\u00A0 And every time the question had been raised which pole to start at, they had insisted the north...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMortimer paused to gaze across the tarmac to the black car that the D-Magic team had arrived at the admin building in.\u00A0 He suspected they had come to collect the box of documents he was currently sorting through.\u00A0 Funny that, that it was here with him rather than over\u00A0there waiting to be picked up.\u00A0 \u0022I bet they\u0027re\u00A0disappointed\u0022 he thought.\u00A0 A kerb in a dark suit wearing dark glasses turned and gazed across the runway towards the hanger before getting in and being driven off.\u00A0 Mort waved from the shadows of the hanger, then went back to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027meanwhile...\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus walked into Gene\u0027s office, where he and Wernher had been having a heated \u0027heart-to-heart\u0027 about his Duna Universal Space Transport.\u00A0 Gene looked up and waited for Linus to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It is just as we suspected Gene.\u0022\u00A0 He looked at Wernher with obvious sympathy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene didn\u0027t say anything, having been already convinced, but Wernher spoke sharply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can you truly be sure?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The sun is entering a stage of significant sun-spot activity, such that the astronomy department predicts there will be no period of quiescence lasting the required\u00A0 2.2 years for at least a decade.\u00A0 As you both know, our radiation shielding can make a single solar flare survivable, but not two.\u00A0 There is no way to fly to Duna with the current spacecraft.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene asked, \u0022How many active shields would we need?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002270.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher said something undoubtedly foul in \u003Cem\u003EKerman\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand slumped in his chair.\u00A0 Gene spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, that settles that Linus, thanks.\u00A0 We will need to come up with a new technology solution to fulfill the CA\u0027s mandate.\u00A0 I\u0027m sorry Wernher, I know that design has been your baby for far longer than we have had a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 It just won\u0027t cut the mustard now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher didn\u0027t speak, but his attitude seemed be one of begrudging acceptance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wernher, we\u0027ll need to wait until after Linus\u0027 team comes up with a radiation\u00A0solution before we can enter a new design stage.\u00A0 In the mean-time, that means all our \u0022local body\u0022 transport rockets will need to be reworked.\u00A0 We can\u0027t take a risk on even a Mun shot now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth Linus and Wernher appeared demoralized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get going guys!\u00A0 Our problems won\u0027t fix themselves!\u0022\u00A0 And Gene immediately pulled out a yellow pad and started writing an inter-office memo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

This is just a note on\u00A0my future game-play.\u00A0 I have spent 4 months trying to get Kerbalism to be stable, and every time I get it so I think it is right something else fails.\u00A0 It is to the point that designs that can fly in a Sandbox year-1 start will not load in year 15\u002B of my career save, so there is clearly not only an active flights issue but a time-clock issue.\u00A0 The last straw was getting a test vehicle into Duna orbit, but every time I \u0027switch to craft\u0027 the PC would literally reboot.\u00A0 Not CTD, not\u00A0lock-up or crash, but black-screen \u0026amp; then the typical boot-up display.\u00A0 So, with much regret, I was faced with either losing Kerbalism or losing my game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalism is great for the early game and Kerbin-system flights, it adds so much to the game, but I just can\u0027t endorse it for anything involving further aspirations.\u00A0 I have loaded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E life-support, as I think that\u0027s the one that I enjoyed using before, and I will continue the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the story\u00A0is no longer being flown with Kerbalism however, I am not sure it qualifies as \u0022interesting enough\u0022 to maintain a chronicle of.\u00A0 Many people have gone to Duna with stories/reports, and it isn\u0027t uncommonly difficult without Kerbalism.\u00A0 I will maintain notes on my next steps however, and if I get enough feedback I will continue to chronicle the game here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
