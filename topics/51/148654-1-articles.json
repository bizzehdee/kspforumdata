It is going to be hard, so i am doing this slowly. The first phase is going to be training and testing, here are my plans:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Do a Rendezvous around the Mun. (Done, Succes)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Do a an Ike sample return mission. (Done, Partial Succes)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Build a space station. (Done)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Build a Hugh Mungus rocket (Cancelled)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are the things i will do just to become more of a pro, otherwise the Jool 5 mission are going to be pretty clunky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhase 2 is actually working on the Jool 5 challenge. I will be building and testing the vehicles that will be landing on the Moons. Here are the things i will do:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Build a small Laythe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Build a Tylo Lander with mining system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Build a lander for all the other Moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Build something that is gonna take this all to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope to see me doing this in just a week. So stay tuned. Phase 2 will be popping up \u003Cs\u003Enext week\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0on Monday hopefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-25T23:34:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2016 11:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NSEP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T22:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Munar Orbit Rendezvous was great! Jebediah and Valentina went about 10 meters far away from each other. They also took a stop, to give the illusion they are standing still, so Jebediah could bang on Valentina\u0027s capsule, so he could feel a bit more Prankster Gangster. Valentina pooped her spacesuit.

But the return transfer did not end up well, their closest aproach was too far away, so they had to extend the mission 2 more years for another orbit, this makes the mission a partial succes. The return capsule shooted down at Kerbin at nearly 7km/s Luckily, the parachutes worked and the sample is now inside a secret locker\u00A0in the R\u0026amp;D centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vWHi64T.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vWHi64T.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-25T22:05:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2016 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NSEP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T23:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last task of Phase 1 has been completed, i scrapped the big rocket thing, there is no need for that now, so why would i even do it?
