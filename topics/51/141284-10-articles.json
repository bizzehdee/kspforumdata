It has certainly been a long time, but as the saying goes: The Story Of Project Intrepid Will Continue!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022YO6RkQd.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YO6RkQd.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter seeing Mr. Dilsby come back after all these years to work on Kerbfleet: A Jool Odyssey once more, I felt something I had not felt in a long time: the Project Intrepid spark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u2019t promise that we will eventually see the ending, nor that I won\u0027t get bogged down with stuff and disappear for another four years. Unfortunately, I\u0027m not a high schooler with seemingly endless free time any more. However, I have done what I can to increase the odds that chapters will progress in a timely manner, and that me may eventually see an ending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so the question is: What killed Project Intrepid?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. SETS. I had this big idea for this huge action sequence spanning several chapters, I got like 2/3 of the way through, and just was so sick of building sets that I stopped. I was spending so much time building sets and positioning them and taking story fluff screenshots instead of actually playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The stability and size of the save. My ambitions outgrew what the computer and modding community could handle and a lot of my time was spent on maintaining the save and fixing things when they broke instead of actually playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The complexity of the story. Every time I have the spark, I have to remember everything that happened, which entails going back through the stuff I wrote in 2016 or so, back when, quite frankly, I wasn\u0027t so great at writing. I spent so much time rereading the story to keep track of things instead of actually playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, these three factors combined to require so much effort to get up to speed, that by the time I got up to speed, I didn\u0027t actually have any more passion left to play the game, and with university, I often didn\u0027t have the time or energy either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what am I doing to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, that big action story arc, and probably future action arcs, are going to be mostly text based with few or no pictures. This is an unfortunate sacrifice, but it\u0027s what had to be done to get Voyage finished and I don\u0027t regret it, it is working so far for WIZARDS!, and I see no reason why it won\u0027t work for Project Intrepid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, everything has been updated from 1.3.1 to 1.12.5 and I will attempt to limit my use of unstable mods. The modding community is now much more stable, but unfortunately a few ships got caught in the crossfire: my version of the Kraken (big airplane) used part welding and is gone. BDA-FPS is being a pain, as are the BDA nukes, so anything from the action sequences is probably gone. The only actual gameplay related casualty was the Minmus city, which fell victim to Kerbal Attachment System part deprecation, which I will hopefully replace with a better version soon. The ITV ships were largely stock parts, though, so as far as I can tell all of them survived. This newfound stability will hopefully lead to a smoother experience with less save maintenance required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirdly, less fluff. I\u0027m going to try to limit my construction of high part count ships and play with graphics mods in an attempt to reduce lag. This is really only a problem with the \u0022Dragon Parade\u0022 though, the other ships are within my playable threshold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourthly, I\u0027m going to try to keep the number of story threads and round characters a bit lower, I did and still do take pride in the complexity of my stories, but this one went a little too spaghetti plot in retrospect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFifthly, well... Project Intrepid was pretty open ended, and I\u0027m not gonna say more besides \u0022spoilers!\u0022 for what I\u0027ve done here, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd lastly, I will write a plot summary here that should condense the stuff I need to catch up on from 55 chapters down into the space of just one or two, so I can come back to it and skip a lot of catch up every time I lose interest and come back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of right now, these canon changes and retcons are taking effect:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal death is now permanent, regrowth is not a thing any more.

After numerous centuries of war and fighting, there came an age of unrestrained capitalism, and right in the center of it all was Cloneus Kerman, owner of the largest gambling conglomerate on Kerbin, rich enough that he had bailed the government out of a depression on at least two separate occasions. Not because he liked the government, but because he just couldn\u0027t stand to see his casinos empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPurely out of spite and anger at the fact that the record for world\u0027s largest aircraft was being successively broken by machines that only flew once, he financed a massive luxurious flying casino designed to only fly once - but be refueled forever. This was known as the KFB-1 \u003Cem\u003EKraken\u003C/em\u003E, and it took off into the air in 104 BPI (Before Project Intrepid).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qE4wC1T.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qE4wC1T.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt around this time, a group of Kerbals looked up and decided that it would be nice to look down from up there. In 100 BPI, Jebediah Kerman became the first Kerbal to enter outer space. Shortly after, Kerbals conquered the Mun, Minmus, Duna, and Ike with chemical ships and basic nuclear propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany saw these efforts and believed that the history of warfare had all but come to a close, and that the future lied holding hands in the stars, but any and all hope of that was shattered the day that the nearby star Krion-B went supernova. The resulting blast of radiation made every unshielded computer in the Kerbol system go haywire. Space Station Epic V, the largest space station ever, experienced an electrical power surge, causing its engines to fire uncontrollably. Jebediah Kerman, in an attempt to activate the escape pods, accidentally vented the space station\u0027s atmosphere, causing grey-outs and blackouts among the entire crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BYjYz0D.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BYjYz0D.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station fell back to Kerbin, landing on a known geological hot spot. Most geologists had been warning that an eruption was coming for decades, and that the hotspot was one small nuclear weapon away from detonation, and politicians had passed a small amount of preventative and mitigative measures. But, they were not enough to stop the resulting station triggered supervolcanic eruption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis eruption in 90 BPI caused a worldwide famine. The space programs, relying on public funding, were nearly instantly shut down. As Kerbalkind had only a few semi-permanent settlements, everyone was returned to Kerbin in short order. The space program, now the most unpopular institution on the planet, was privatized for pennies on the dollar. In a desperate attempt to keep the dream of space alive, Jebediah Kerman took an impossible bet from Cloneus Kerman, the only one left who would fund them at all. In order to save the space program, Jebediah had to walk on all ten moons of Jool and Sarnus for effectively pocket change and return alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yD04oqF.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yD04oqF.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 89 BPI, the OCTAVIUS mission launched, carrying Jebediah, pilot extraordinaire, Bill, Jeb\u0027s old friend and expert engineer, and Angela, a space crazy rookie biologist, crammed into a tin can for two decades. The prolonged period of social isolation and the utter lack of personal space took all three crewmembers beyond their breaking points several times over, but still, they persevered, both through the rigors of space and through Cloneus\u0027s constant sabotage attempts, but... There were consequences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah began experiencing visions of the future in his nightmares. Dying in many, many ways, and waking up and being able to prevent it. He initially dismissed this as a continuous degradation of his mental health, but he soon became convinced they were something more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpirits were still largely high after all of Saruns\u0027s moons were landed on, the only hiccup being the possible discovery of extraterrestrial life on Eeloo during an incredibly rushed landing. However, the transfer to Jool, happening outside of a normal transfer window, took many, many years, during which the crew\u0027s mental state deteriorated significantly, with their recreational materials nearly depleted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the crew landed on Jool\u0027s moons, Cloneus began to have a slow but gradual change of heart and began financing his own secret space program, slowly becoming fascinated with space travel, but unable to publicly admit it. Two of the employees of this venture were Marie and David Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZYaK92e.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZYaK92e.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a nightmare incident on Vall, where the nauseometric effects of distorted planetary poles were observed for the first time, Jebediah finally told Angela and Bill about his prophetic nightmares. All anomalous illusions immediately ceased at that moment, and everything seemed normal until the Bop landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah was impulsively drawn towards a specific cater, seemingly having been given an infinite amount of jetpack fuel. There, he met an anomalous being\u00A0who revealed that there were two ancient magicians in the universe - one of order, the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EMonolith\u003C/strong\u003E, and one of chaos, themself - the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDeep Space Kraken\u003C/em\u003E. Both magicians possessed a fixed quantity of magic, with which they fought a great battle, centuries ago, in which the Monolith defeated the Kraken. Neither could use the other side of magic, a magician of chaos could not cause order, and a magician of order could not cause chaos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, each magician could have an apprentice with which their supply of magic was shared. This apprentice must be mortal, but would be capable of both chaos and order - both the possible and the impossible. The Kraken had chosen Jebediah as their apprentice, and had attempted to do so by force - attempting to break Jebediah\u0027s spirit by repeatedly killing Angela and Bill, and forcing him to watch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a thousand lifetimes of torture, Jebediah\u0027s body had submitted to the Kraken, he was now the Kraken\u0027s apprentice. But, the Kraken had failed to realize that Jebediah\u0027s soul had not yet submitted, not even after so many years, for Jebediah, for better or worse, had grown a heart of iron during his many years of isolation, and with Jebediah\u0027s newfound magic, deception, and the bravery and initiative of Bill and Angela Kerman, the Deep Space Kraken was once more slain with the OCTAVIUS\u0027s mighty nuclear plasma sword.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ERwGweM.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ERwGweM.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloneus had, however, against his own wishes, sabotaged the OCTAVIUS\u0027s antenna, and eliminated their only method of communication with Kerbin. Jebediah attempted to learn how to use his new magical abilities to fix it, but only made it worse. The journey home was made in even more isolation than they had already been in. In the meantime, Cloneus\u0027s space program accidentally crashed a rocket into a large city, effectively shutting it down. However, the planetary attitude towards space had recovered enough that limited private spaceflight was starting to happen, with Kerbalkind finally making it back to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0OCTAVIUS, practically falling apart at the seams, carrying its three minds, also falling apart at the seams, limped all the way back to Low Kerbin Orbit, and the return capsule, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDragonhearted\u003C/em\u003E, successfully landed back on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the Kraken was not dead, only dying - It takes more than a few years post injury to slay an immortal. With dying rage, he vaporized the four outermost planets, Plock, Neidon, Urlum, and Sarnus, and scavenged all available magic from them, in order to change reality out of anger and spite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDragonhearted\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and the crew re-entered the atmosphere, much faster this time, and just as Jebediah had pulled the wrong lever and doomed Kerbin to famine, Jebediah pulled the wrong lever and destroyed the re-entry capsule\u0027s parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCoincidentally (or perhaps not?), Marie and David were right there appraising the performance of an old trainer aircraft, and spotted the entry capsule, attempting to pluck it out of the sky with their cargo bay, and save the crew\u0027s lives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter many, many attempts, long past their abort point, Marie and David successfully caught the capsule, but in a botched attempt to recover from the dive, they stalled and crashed the aircraft, dying upon impact, but saving the crew, and more importantly, saving the dream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KznAPmn.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KznAPmn.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloneus, deeply saddened by this tragedy and now a reformed man, dedicated a large portion of his fortune to the newly resurrected Kerbal Space Program, fifty billion funds, 2,500 times as much as the original bet specified, and 200,000 times as much as the OCTAVIUS had cost. Bill and Angela married, a highly unconvincing cover story was formed for the disappearance of the planets, and the paltry samples from the outer planets were locked away in a secret vault to be opened when better technology existed - leaving the question of life on Eeloo painfully unanswered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe influx of cash brought around a new prosperous era of space exploration, beginning in 69 BPI. The next 19 years saw a number of advances, including the construction of the Cloneus mandated Mun casino, massive space stations, permanent settlements on the Mun, Minmus, and Duna, bases on Jool\u0027s moons, and crewed missions to every world except for Eve and Eeloo. In the process, Dres was found to be an anomalous planet, an inaudible voice causing madness in all who ventured near it. This voice was dubbed \u0022The Teddy Monster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThroughout this timeframe, Jebediah was, well, rather careless with his magic once he learned how to use it properly, but that\u0027s a story for a little bit later...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, a rival nation, the USKN, whose operations are so secret that nobody on the outside even knows what their name stands for, believed this influx of cash by a gambler with more money than most nations to be an attempt at spreading the unrestrained decadences of capitalism through the stars, and began militarizing space in response. The Kerbal Space Program followed suit, initially out of defense, but eventually out of offense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis arms race led to the militarization of most planets to some extent, but Kerbin specifically. Tensions rose to just below boiling, but just as a space disaster had set off the hair trigger of a volcano, so to would it set off the hair trigger of nuclear annihilation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 50 BPI, the KSP supply shuttle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EFarlander\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(piloted by Valentina Kerman, Jebediah\u0027s sister), and a USKN\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPeril\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 medium fighter (piloted by Hudson Kerman, Valentina\u0027s ex) met in orbit. A minor squabble over the nuclearization of the Mun escalated into a space battle, causing the USKN ship to uncontrollably plummet into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, where it was mistaken by the KSP for a USKN nuclear missile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nWmdZ0D.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nWmdZ0D.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EJWVx8k.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EJWVx8k.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP retaliated with their own missiles, the USKN retaliated with theirs, and for half an hour, the sky was filled with fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis event, called the Great War, or the Sixty Minute War, or simply, The War, rendered the surface of Kerbin nearly completely uninhabitable. Most of Kerbalkind retreated into massive underground bunkers, largely constructed by Cloneus as a protection against catastrophe. Cloneus\u0027s sky casino, the Kraken, flew until it could not fly any more, and after decades of constant flight, finally splashed back down into the ocean. The bunkers expanded into cities, and these underground societies continued on as the radiation gradually decayed away and nature slowly reclaimed the once bustling planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe largest bases on other worlds were permanent, but self sustaining, not quite. The ones that were not destroyed in space battles kept going on for as long as they could, gradually evacuating failing colonies for more stable ones, but a sudden surge in solar activity fried most of the remaining computers, causing most of the remaining aboveground colonies to fail, leaving very few Kerbals in space alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor fifty years Kerbalkind hibernated, monitoring the radiation levels. Eventually they dipped low enough to allow for some short excursions onto the surface. During one of these excursions, an untouched observatory was rediscovered. An experiment to map the motions of the stars had, miraculously, been running untouched for the past fifty years. Previous short term measurements had calculated that the Kerbol system would have a very close flyby of the Krion system in about 200 years - the system that contained Krion-B, the star that had gone supernova and turned into a black hole about 90 years prior. It was not anticipated to be dangerous. In fact, it was anticipated to be cool. Kerbalkind could explore a whole new star system and learn about black holes up close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this more accurate data from the long running experiment had determined that the Kerbol system was, in fact, on a collision course with the black hole remnant of Krion-B, and had only 200 years left of existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone went into a panic, trying to figure out how to evacuate the star system. Most people seemed to agree that the right thing to do was to start incrementally, try to recover lost technology. Nobody had built a space rocket in decades. The space center was desperately rebuilt from old plans, and the plan of action was to ambitiously immediately resurrect \u0022Project Intrepid\u0022, an old mothership concept, with an iterative approach to design.

Katchic barely had time to express surprise before she, katana in hand, was sucked out of the window and into the sky!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes!

A bunch of red lights filled the cockpit. \u0022Mulch. All of those museum artefacts flew straight into one of the engines.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But she didn\u0027t, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, Val saw her, she\u0027s fine.

There was an explosion and smoke filled the cockpit as a floor panel had bulged upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have company!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s trying to get in through the bottom hatch!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re diving!\u0022 shouted Omega-4, who had successfully restarted his engines. \u0022This is it, this is the bombing run for Kabra!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s almost over the city... Nuclear force is... authorized,\u0022 said Omega-2, with some strain, as he was attempting to hit Shercott, but couldn\u0027t because despite the Hex-Archer\u0027s maneuverability, the jousting craft were about the size of a bumblebee, and hits were few and far be -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*BANG*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a loud noise as Bill Kerman successfully landed another firework just ahead of the distracted Omega-2, sending shrapnel into the engines. \u0022I\u0027m hit!\u0022 he said, attempting to restart his engines. In the attempt his trajectory became predictable, and he was hit near simultaneously by another firework and Gidrien\u0027s jouster. \u0022Omega-2, attempting emergency landing. Omega-5, how are your engines?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have one, the other one won\u0027t restart,\u0022 she said. \u0022I think I can line up a shot, though,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Take it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill Kerman held his breath as he aimed at the incoming Hex-Archer, which was obviously lining up a nuclear shot on the Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not if I have anything to say about that,\u0022 said Doodgun Kerman, pressing the muzzle of his massive gun against Bill\u0027s head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They are going to nuke us both, you know,\u0022 Bill said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They wouldn\u0027t have sent us here if we weren\u0027t prepared to die for Karba,\u0022 Doodgun grinned. \u0022It\u0027s certainly one Moho of a way to go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not if I have anything to say about that!\u0022 said Valentina Kerman, pressing her half of a sword up against Doodgun\u0027s throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...I\u0027m wearing a helmet, you know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cloneus keeps these things sharper than cheese.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sharper than - What - \u0022 In Doodgun\u0027s moment of confusion, Valentina activated Katchic\u0027s laser-Katana that she had just barely managed to prevent from flying out of the window, and sliced Doodgun\u0027s gun in half! Bill Kerman turned around to punch him in the face, but Doodgun quickly overpowered Val and shook off Bill\u0027s blows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Omega-5 to all agents,\u0022 barked Doodgun\u0027s radio. \u0022May God be with you.\u0022 All three turned around in horror to face Omega-5. They couldn\u0027t see it, but they could sense it - Her finger on the trigger, her finger further down on the trigger, and her finger all the way down on the trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a flash as the air to air nuclear missile\u0027s motor ignited, but it was quickly overshadowed by an even larger explosion - seemingly out of nowhere, Omega-5 erupted in a ball of flame, her missile being diverted off to the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022TAKE COVER!\u0022 Bill shouted. All three of them ducked down into the fireworks turret as the active nuclear missile streaked across the sky.

Off course, of course, but the blast wave ruptured nearly every window on the Kraken, and vibrated the wing so hard that the Kraken screamed in agony as her insides were snapped and twisted like twigs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmong the components to be ripped off of the aircraft entirely were all of the fireworks turrets. Bill Kerman, Valentina Kerman, and Doodgun Kerman were all blasted out of the aircraft. The Kraken, bleeding, limped on through the sky, trailing debris as it went. Eventually, the trio would regain their senses and deploy their parachutes in time, but that hardly mattered now - what mattered was that they were out of the fight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Black Panther is at your service!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Black Panther - What?

Barely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not for much longer,\u0022 said Omega-4, lining up his aircraft at close range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re too close!

There was another explosion from beneath the cockpit as Grenman set off another grenade, and the hatch yielded even further, setting off even more warning bells and severing some connections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No!\u0022 shouted Jeb, aggressively steering the aircraft, attempting to dodge the unguided missile, but from such close range - there was nothing that could be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr rather, one thing could be done. Jebediah concentrated very hard, reached his hand out, and used up half of his remaining magic to shove the missile a few more meters out of the way, completing the dodge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What was that?\u0022 shouted Omega-4. \u0022It just teleported!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Missed me!\u0022 Jebediah chuckled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No!

It might kill a few hundred, maybe a few thousand if we\u0027re unlucky. Jebediah is carrying a strategic nuclear weapon, capable of killing all 100,000 Kerbals in the city. Omega-3, fire your missile!

The pilot of Omega-3 attempted to pull the trigger, now under 20 kilometers from the polar base, but the connections were already severed, and the trigger did nothing. The pilot bailed out as his aircraft crashed unceremoniously into the polar ice caps below, kicking up a debris field that was ingested into the Kraken\u0027s right hand engine bank, knocking out nearly half of the Kraken\u0027s remaining engine power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re going down!\u0022 shouted Jeb. \u0022Come on, just a few more kilometers!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gidrien, can you throw your nuke into the base?\u0022 Shercott asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m too far behind!\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are we going to do?\u0022 Bob cried in desperation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re going to ram it,\u0022 said Jebediah. \u0022That test room is on the top levels, just barely underground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You madman...

Okay?\u0022 Grenman grabbed the baguette and handed it to Jebediah. Jebediah snatched it and shoved it as far as it would go, up to reach the Kraken\u0027s pitch control cable. The stale, expired baguette was solid enough to hold the gable in tension, and the Kraken began to dive again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re a madman!\u0022 shouted Grenman as he wrestled with the broken control column in an attempt to reverse the dive, but to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 said Jebediah with a maniacal grin on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kraken plunged downwards out of the sky.

He flew along the fuselage, dodging debris and columns of fire and smoke as the Kraken shot past at nearly Mach 1, far faster than it had been designed to fly, narrowly missing the Kraken\u0027s massive tail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman held his breath and braced himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KFB-01 \u0022Kraken\u0022, the world\u0027s largest aircraft, smashed into the surface of the polar ice sheet, plowing a deep trench as it carried on by momentum alone, disintegrating and collapsing as she slowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMassive rainbow tendrils erupted out of the ground just in front of the nose of the aircraft, instantly growing to kilometers in length with a bright flash as the experimental Project K activated, sending a surge of gravioli and K particles across the face of the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the flaming wreck of the Kraken collided with the underground test stand, creating a tremendous burst of light, visible from the Mun, and bathing the entire Kerbol system in an inconceivably intense blast of negative gravioli particles, thus bringing an end to the second ever flight of the Kraken, and the second ever test of Project K.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb\u0027s dead!\u0022 sobbed Gidrien as she sobbed, flying over the flaming wreck of the crash site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No wait!

She was always coming down eventually, I was a little disappointed when it just landed safely because of the war, thank you for giving her the ending she deserved!

I think you should know about that before I go. Here, take this.\u0022 Cloneus took off his signet ring and gave it to Jebediah. \u0022Show this to them, they\u0027ll let you in.

What have we accomplished so far?\u0022 Jebediah asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Phaze zero has launched 27 Intrepid Test Vehicles so far, 29 if you count all of the minis,\u0022 Kari said. \u0022A number of spares and unrealized concepts exist in storage. Of those 27, 16 reached orbit, of which 15 are still operational today, again counting the triplets as one. We have successfully reached every world except for Eeloo, Bop, Pol, and Vall, solved a number of mysteries, including the whereabouts of Valentina Kerman, and the nature of the Teddy Monster. We have successfully ascended from Eve, located three separate instances of successful or semi-successful hibernation, and demonstrated the operation of a ship that can carry nearly a thousand Kerbals. We have, however, underestimated the need for redundancy on these short journeys, and also underestimated the threats that they would face, leading to a number of simple failures cascading into catastrophes, and leading to a number of stolen spaceships.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what were you planning to do next?\u0022 Sergeant T asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, explore more. Do search and rescue missions for any surviving Kerbals in the system. Investigate the possibility of life on Eeloo, I suppose.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Kari. Katie, you\u0027re up,\u0022 Jebediah said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Phase one launched 1500 tons of supplies to Minmus to jump start a colony. The ITV-020 Philosopher of Time launched 916 Kerbals to Minmus, of which about 500 stayed behind to continue the construction of Minmusville, 400 of which went to Gilly. Despite intermittent at best resupply missions from Kerbin, we able to extract local resources, create a large space colony, extract large amounts of fuel, and domestically produce most of the non-electronic components for two Intrepid Test Vehicles. We were later planning on completing Drydock One, and beginning on the phase two ships, but Minmusville was severely damaged by that gravioli blast and likely needs to be completely rebuilt.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Believe me,\u0022 Jebediah 2 said, \u0022if Minmusville was intact enough for me to be streaming from its spire, I would be doing so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Katie and Jeb,\u0022 Jebediah said. \u0022S.A.M., you\u0027re up, please.

But it is obvious we have bit off more than we can chew. We almost blew up Kerbin twice testing it, and we sent Kerbin into the future? We\u2019re still analyzing the data on that\u2026 But we\u2019re also working on time travel as well, without much success, but we got a lot of good data from, uh\u2026 dooming the planet\u2026 It was an accident.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeep going.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe also have been working on other propulsion advances, such as the 2.5m Rapier and the clipped Mammoths. We have a fusion program, but it is fairly halfhearted. But the big stuff\u2026 For phase 2, we had three steps. Step one, locate a habitable world. In order to do that, in an operation called Project Searchlight, we used several dozen tons of silver, a local resource extraction setup, and the manpower of 400 Kerbals to embark on a project that would turn Gilly into a massive optical telescope, capable of identifying any habitable world in reasonably reachable distance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI still think we should have just built it here, on Minmus,\u201D said Katie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe anticipated better long term results in the lower gravity environment, but knowing what we know now, Minmus would have been a better short term option,\u201D S.A.M. admitted. \u201CIt isn\u2019t done yet, but it is getting close. Step two was to send K-drive probes to nearby candidate planets, and Step three was to send a crew to assess final habitability\u2026 Needless to say, steps 2 and 3 are no longer feasible to complete.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s everything?\u201D Gus asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI mean, unless you want me to go into more detail on time travel.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell me what your name stands for,\u201D Gus said. \u201CThen I might believe you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?

Creating something that could support people for that long was gonna be huge and a massive undertaking. There would have been thousands of these ships in the end, but then we found out that Valentina, then later Gene and Leah, and Tomfurt all managed to create hibernation setups. This would tremendously simplify our operations, but we have thus far been unable to safely recreate the technology.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, Wernher von Kerman burst into the room and proclaimed \u201CI\u2019VE DONE IT!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ve done it?\u201D Gus said excitedly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes! I\u2019ve successfully entered hibernation and returned alive! Mostly! My pinky finger is looking kinda weird though, huh\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat was the problem?\u201D Gus asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell there were like 15 problems, but the main one was that two of the computers weren\u2019t communicating because the complete bodge of a UART connection we had involved soldering thin wires directly to SMD pads, but when connecting those with alligator clips we forgot we had to scrape off the insulating coating, which made the connections not really work, but - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s gonna talk for 2 hours if we let him, there are kinks to work out, but it works now,\u201D said Gus. \u201CFirst good news all day. That means we can build a lot of smaller ships with existing technology, assuming we can mass produce 5 million hibernation units in 2 and a half years. But we still don\u2019t know what kind of planet we are going to land on or how fast, so we have to be ready for anything. We were going to wait for Phase Two to find something, but I don\u2019t know if we are going to have that luxury any more. We were also going to send colony supplies beforehand, and an early team to set up the colony, but who knows if we can any more.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright,\u201D Linus said. \u201CThat\u2019s what we were going to do. Now here\u2019s what we are going to do: We\u2019re going to build the smaller but still big colony ships and design them to land on most reasonable atmospheric worlds, and start building them before we know where we\u2019re going. Once we know where they are going, we\u2019ll make any modifications we need to and then launch the ones we built one by one, and keep building and launching more until everyone\u2019s out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll need to get everyone to Minmus,\u201D Katie said. \u201CWe will need to rebuild the city as everyone\u2019s arriving, and while building even more infrastructure!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood,\u201D Gus said. \u201CWe will need the practice for building our colony on our next homeworld as everyone\u2019s arriving.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, hold on,\u201D Wernher said. \u201CWe won\u2019t be able to launch people for the first bit of our time left due to not having the planes, and the last bit, we\u2019ll be too close to Krion-B to escape. If we assume we have 2 years, our average rate of launching will need to be 16 Kerbals a minute.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen we\u2019ll launch 16 Kerbals a minute!\u201D Sergeant T said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a 96 Kerbal spaceplane every 6 minutes,\u201D Wernher said. \u201CIf it takes three days to get there, three days to get back, and a day to load and unload, which is a great deal optimistic, we need a fleet of 420 craft. Four crew per ship, and no breaks, we would need 1,680 trained pilots. We barely have 100, and most of them are in space! And then there\u2019s the fuel requirements! We can\u2019t operate 420 spaceplanes! We can\u2019t even land two of them reliably!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can\u2019t make the scaled up Rapiers that fast,\u201D S.A.M. said. \u201CWe could barely make the four prototypes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen we will need to change our strategy,\u201D Linus said. \u201CWhat if instead of sending everyone all the way to Minmus, we just launched everyone to low orbit, waiting for a transfer ship? We could maybe get 200 Kerbals per flight that way, that\u2019s only one every 12 minutes. We can launch each plane every two orbits, if there aren\u2019t delays, so each flight will take, what, an hour and a half? That\u2019s a fleet size of eight, a crew of 32. Plenty of room for spares and relief pilots.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe transfer ships can get their fuel from Minmus,\u201D said Katie. \u201COr, refuel themselves. If we can take 1000 Kerbals a trip, we need one ship to depart Kerbin every hour, so we would only need like 40 or 50 of them, less if we go faster or can fit more people on each one. We\u2019ve already built around 30 large ships, and we can reliably operate them and land them on Minmus, at least more reliably than we can land large spaceplanes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd we already have one and a half unused Philosopher of Time class ITVs in storage to get us started,\u201D S.A.M. added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll get them refurbished immediately,\u201D said Gus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf we can fit a thousand hibernating Kerbals on each ship, we need 5000 ships,\u201D Katie said. \u201CThat\u2019s about one per hour. If we can get a hundred thousand people up here all focused on cranking these out like tin cans, that\u2019s a hundred thousand man hours per ship when we\u2019re firing on all cylinders. That sounds like a lot, but we have to make EVERYTHING. The electronics, the hibernation kits, some of that is probably easier to make on Kerbin, but we don\u2019t know how much. So, we need to get the man hours per colony ship down to at least that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRick,\u201D Linus said. \u201CYou\u2019re the finance guy, you\u2019re great at cost cutting and economies of scale. We\u2019re sending you up to Minmus as soon as possible, you\u2019re gonna supervise that production line and get it going as fast as Kerbally possible.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRoger that,\u201D Rick said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDouble all those rates,\u201D said Jeb 2. \u201CWe\u2019ll need at least as much cargo as we do crew, both to Minmus and to the Homeworld.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut the logistics of planetary evacuation,\u201D said Walt. \u201CWe\u2019re going to need an industrial base to make all of this stuff, and a million Kerbal colony on Minmus, while also preparing the supplies necessary for a Homeworld colony.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, fortunately, tens of thousands of engineers around the planet just became effectively available,\u201D Sergeant T said. \u201CThese past three years have been a few thousand nerds learning how to walk, being interrupted by war every few months. But now, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to see what a whole planet looks like running.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright. I can work with this,\u201D Walt said. \u201CWe\u2019re gonna build an evacuation city near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to simplify logistics, then another city on Minmus. We\u2019ve got to reallocate as much of our industrial base as possible to this effort. But we\u2019ve done the math, and it is possible. I\u2019ll start working on the press release, it will be out in the next half hour.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t forget farming,\u201D Sandra Kerman said. \u201CYou can\u2019t just send 5 million Kerbals to Minmus and expect them to not starve. Or the Homeworld for that matter.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYounger me, I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not you right now,\u201D Jebediah said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is not going to be an easy task,\u201D said Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, didn\u2019t we put a pin in something?\u201D Sandra said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight,\u201D Jebediah began. \u201CThe space pirates are going on and on about magic and stuff\u2026 And we\u2019ve heard them call those sparkly asteroids magic boulders, which makes me think they may be in contact with the monolith.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe monolith?\u201D asked Sandra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight, here we go\u2026 There are two ancient creatures that inhabit this solar system. The Deep Space Kraken, and the Monolith, eldritch creatures of chaos and order, respectively.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, so there\u2019s actual aliens?\u201D Sandra asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201D Jebediah said. \u201CI met the Kraken during the OCTAVIUS mission on Bop. They told me that they used to move planets, and they taught me the magic of this universe. Or at least an abbreviated version. They sought to control me, and almost won, but I managed to break free. We killed them, or so I thought.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, so you have the powers of an ancient space wizard?\u201D Katie asked. \u201CWhy don\u2019t you just teleport the entire planet away?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI would, but the universe ran dry of magic long ago,\u201D Jebediah said. \u201CI have enough left to undo one, maybe two small mistakes. But the Monolith\u2026 The other ancient space wizard\u2026 Just as the Kraken took me as their apprentice, so to may the Monolith have chosen an apprentice, and I\u2019d bet all my money, if I had any, on it being Tomfurt Kerman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor real? The Flat Kerbin guy?\u201D Linus asked. \u201CNo idea how he got past screening.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEhh, practice,\u201D Walt said. \u201CWe\u2019ve got to launch the entire general public to space, and we need 10,000 starship captains. Gotta set the competence cutoff somewhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe point is,\u201D said Jebediah, \u201CI had one magic lesson by a hateful magician who barely told me anything, and for all I know, he was lying to my face. We have no reason to assume Tomfurt knows what he\u2019s doing, but the Monolith\u2026 They have a plan. And if the Monolith thinks that these boulders are important\u2026 And are possibly a source of magic\u2026 And thinks we can escape the solar system by creating a new element using surface samples from every world\u2026 I need to talk to them. If it takes launching a hundred Asteroid haulers to Dres to gather enough Magic, maybe we can move Kerbin after all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Linus. \u201CI am a man of science, but in this situation, we need to pursue all possible avenues of escape\u2026 Except for Project K. That can wait until we are a little more desperate.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t we need a surface sample from the sun for that?\u201D Jebediah 2 asked. \u201CEven with my piloting, that does seem rather hopeless.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually, if an atmospheric sample can be substituted\u2026 Maybe we might have a shot at that,\u201D said S.A.M. \u201CThe Experimental Engineering Division has been working on some interesting heat shielding technology.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about time travel?\u201D Sergeant T asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll keep you posted on that,\u201D S.A.M. said. \u201CWe don\u2019t yet have a working prototype, but it might be worth a shot.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd don\u2019t forget about me,\u201D Sandra said. \u201CCloneus founded Krypton Laboratories underground mostly to keep everyone busy. We haven\u2019t made anything revolutionary, but we have perfected a great deal of rocket parts that may aid you, for instance, ducted fans, and complete lineups of 1.875 and 5 meter rocket parts.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright, so it is settled!\u201D said Wernher Von Kerman. \u201CTwo and a half years to escape this planet. I\u2019ll work on perfecting and producing the hibernation gear. Walt will tell the general public and coordinate planetary logistics and morale. S.A.M. will complete project Searchlight, work on perfecting the larger Rapier engines, pursue time travel, and maybe, if we are desperate, resume theoretical, and possibly eventually practical work on Project K. Sergeant T will ensure that no disgruntled parties will disrupt the evacuation efforts, organize the defense of the space center from any more large scale attacks, and if necessary, deal with the space pirates. Gus will work on getting the Minmus transportation network up and running. Kari will work on colony ship design. Rick will deal with mass producing colony ships. Sandra will integrate the new parts into the supply chain. Jeb 2 will deal with the logistics of rebuilding Minmusville. Katie will deal with the human factors and production side of things on Minmus. And Linus, you will get better estimates of impact time, velocity, the Delta-V and times needed to escape the system, and which planets are being ejected versus swallowed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould we not just move to Laythe if it isn\u2019t being swallowed?\u201D Rick asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then we\u2019d be drifting through space without a star,\u201D Kari said. \u201CWe\u2019d be dying a slow death at the hands of entropy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t suppose we could nudge Laythe a bit and set off a gravity assist chain that ends up with us orbiting the black hole system,\u201D Sandra said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat would rely on about seventeen improbable things, including Jebediah and this so called Magic Boulder, but once I have better numbers, I\u2019ll see if it can be done,\u201D Linus said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright then, that\u2019s it, meeting adjourned,\u201D Wernher said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHold on,\u201D Jebediah said. Everyone turned to face him. \u201CWhat about the Intrepid Test Vehicle program?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to shut it down,\u201D Gus said. \u201CIt was a success. We figured out how to build and operate large ships. Now we need to put that knowledge into practice. We will soon no longer have the manpower to spare to waste on exploring the system.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, sure, but we can\u2019t just leave everyone that\u2019s currently out there!\u201D Jebediah protested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got maybe 1200 guys up there, maybe 200 not counting Minmus and Gilly,\u201D Gus said. \u201CWe have 5 million Kerbals down here. I\u2019m sorry if we can\u2019t continue to spare custom experimental gigantic motherships at the drop of a hat.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Independence isn\u2019t even scheduled to get to Eeloo for another 2 years, what am I supposed to tell them? \u201CHi, yeah, you\u2019re dead and we\u2019re not coming to rescue you?\u201D\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMan, we really botched that transfer, five years to Eeloo, we\u2019re a bunch of amateurs,\u201D Linus said. \u201CHow could we possibly evacuate an entire planet in two and a half years if we can\u2019t even do a simple Hohmann transfer correctly?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, settle down,\u201D Rick said. \u201CWe have plenty of unused ITVs in storage, and there will be a transition period between what we have now and full tilt evacuation. We can probably produce a handful of custom motherships, but it will have to be in the next month or two.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re in charge of that, Jebediah,\u201D said Wernher. \u201CGet as many of them home as possible.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight then. We\u2019re aborting the Jool mission.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut we can\u2019t,\u201D Linus said. \u201CThe space pirates have got our entire database hostage, they will delete it if we don\u2019t deliver them the JAVELIN. We can\u2019t get the Dragon Parade there and back in two years!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do, then,\u201D said Jebediah. \u201CWernher, can you get me a hundred hibernation kits before the upcoming Jool window?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt will be a tight squeeze, and they won\u2019t be of fantastic quality, but I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright then. The ships that we can get home, we\u2019ll get home, but the others, we\u2019ll send to Jool. We\u2019ll complete all of our\u2026 unfinished business\u2026 there, and send a delivery of everything needed to retrofit those ships into interstellar hibernation capable vessels. Then, we\u2019ll depart from Jool.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey aren\u2019t going to trust us, you know,\u201D Sandra said. \u201CYeah, we\u2019ll just send you guys a bunch of borderline untested experimental equipment and ask you guys to fly between stars in prototypes that could barely fly between planets\u2026 Let alone how they\u2019re gonna land. They totally won\u2019t desert back to Kerbin at all costs! Those that can, at least.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf they won\u2019t trust empty words, then I\u2019ll go there myself,\u201D said Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D said Wernher. \u201CYou\u2019re mad!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs always, old pal. I want the conversion kits loaded onto the Intrepid before the Jool window. I need a full load of fuel and ideally some sort of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E setup. Assuming my crew is willing to come with me, we will depart and complete our business at Jool, and then depart for the Homeworld in the last few months or weeks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd what if we never find the new Homeworld?\u201D Walt asked. Jebediah took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we have to, don\u2019t we?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut what if we don\u2019t?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we will.
