An asteroid has been discovered having just entered Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. Class D, tracking designation NVO-129. Its trajectory is highly elliptical, not quite a closed oval but fairly close distance between its entry and projected escape of Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe asteroid\u0027s existence is thus far an open secret amongst the personnel, and the decision to mount a mission to stabilize its orbit was practically unanimous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOperation Harpoon is named after the Javelin launch vehicle which has served as a workhorse since its development. The name is shared with a single vessel thus far, a probe-operated station featuring a klaw and plentiful docking and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E equipment. Further launches will be made, as Harpoon Station is currently calculated to have rather low delta V. In the event of a failure to capture the asteroid, the mission will be considered a partial success if Harpoon can manage to at least lock to the asteroid. The multiple relay antennas also present will serve their primary purpose as well as a beacon for future missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagrant203","CreatedById":202630,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-10T07:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOperation Harpoon has succeeded in capturing and decelerating NVO-129 into an elliptical but still accessible orbit.
