Just 43 minutes after launch veteran pilot Valentina Kerman docked the CSM to the station and the kerbonauts could begin to transfer equipment into the station.\n\nSeveral days into the mission Bill had to do a EVA to retrieve a film from the OTM and replace it with new one. The remaining time on the space station was spent productively, conducting experiments, eating snacks and taking naps. But after 26 days the Crew had to return. They transfered all the equipment they were supposed to bring back to Kerbin into the capsule, switched off the light and undocked.\n\nAfter drifting away from the station to a safe distance, Valentina activated the SPS and deorbited the CSM. Bill and Bob where unaware that she and CMP Thomas K. Kerman, of Odin XVI fame, had made a bet who could splash down closer to the KSC. While panic crept into Bill and Bob once they say the mountain range west of the cape in ominous distance, Val stayed confident.

Both stages of the booster worked flawlessly and put the CSM into a orbit close to the space station. Pilot Ronald E. Kerman holds the new record for docking with the space station mere 29 minutes after launch. Once the two vessels were connected the crew started to transfer their equipment into the station. There were several hundred items to bring into Asgard for their almost three month long stay.\n\nNevertheless they crew finished the task within the first day and soon could start their scientific experiments. Gene took care of the OMT and, over the course of the mission, had to complete two EVAs to change film magazines. The crew completed hundreds of experiments, with their favourite beeing a snack tasting in space.\n\nOn their 86th day in space the snacks were almost depleted and the crew had to return to Kerbin. Since right now no further mission to Asgard were announced, they left their last bag of supplies near entrace as a welcoming gift, whoever the next visitors might be, and left the airlock unlocked. Once all preparations were completed to put the space station in mothballs, the crew undocked and returned to Kerbin.\n\nThe capsule reentered over the KSC and splashed down safely several kilometers off the coast.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:31:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T04:16:22Z","Content":"So what\u0027s next?

The goal of the OZTP was to dock a Odin and a Zhar-Ptitsa craft in LKO.\n\nThe Zhar-Ptitsa 19 launched first, from the Kerviet Cosmodrome. It\u0027s reliable booster, that cant trace it\u0027s heritage to the rocket that launched the first satellite, put the crew into a 120 km circular orbit around Kerbin. There the crew, consiting of Gherman Kermanov and Svetlana Kermanova, awaited the arrival of the Odin spacecraft.\n\nSeveral hours later the Odin spacecraft launched ontop of a Sleipnir IB booster. The craft was crewed by our most senior team of Kerbonauts: Valentina, Bob and Bill Kerman. Once in orbit the spacecraft seperated from the second stage, turned around and extracted the Odin-Zhar-Ptitsa docking adapter, just like a MEM in a munar Odin mission. About one hour after it\u0027s launch the Odin spacecraft approached Zhar-Ptitsa 19. In this first docking the Kerviet craft would remain passive while the Odin capsule took the active part in the docking procedure. Once docked two crew commanders Valentina and Gherman exchanged the first international handshake in space.\n\nThe two crews assembled a commemorative plaque, exchanged flags and snacks, visited each other\u0027s ships, ate together, and conversed in each other\u0027s languages. After several hours the two ships undocked and Odin positioned himself in front of the Sun to produce a artificial solar eclipse for Zhar-Ptitsa 19. The spacecraft then docked a second time, this time with Zhar-Ptitsa as the active partner. However, this time none of the Kerbonauts changed their spacecraft. After a few more hours the two vessels undocked and went their seperate ways.\n\nBoth vessels stayed in orbit for a few more days, conducting several experiments. The craft that first reentered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere was Zhar-Ptitsa, it landet safely in the desert. The Odin capsule splashed down off the coast of the KSC a little later.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:32:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"astrokerb","CreatedById":151932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T22:32:10Z","Content":"That was a cool mission.
