Three cylinders and a disk, connected by pylons of various lengths. \u0022It\u0027s some kind of spacecraft\u0022 Hudry said. \u0022No, it can\u0027t be, we\u0027re still a kilometer away\u0022 Ersen snapped. \u0022It\u0027s clearly a group of asteroids.\u0022 Rogun agreed. As they approached the anomaly closer and closer, none of them could deny tht it was huge, and that it was a spacecraft. Small areas of exposed machinery were visible, along with windows. Strangely, the anomaly seemed to be dead, no signs of life at all. \u0022Into the lander, let\u0027s check this thing out.\u0022 Hudry told the others. The two clambered aboard the modified lander, whose engine and landing gear were replaced with thrusters and an advanced grabbing unit. They brushed up against the anomaly, then tried to grab on, when they finally attached. Suddenly, the anomaly started shaking, kicking them off. Rogun took this as a demand to leave, so they started flying back to the CSM. Ersen spotted something on the anomoly, an opening, and decided to go inside it instead. Rogun flipped a power switch using the claw, and a picture of the lit-up spacecraft was taken. The two cylinders lit up orange, and the windows came to life. They switched off the power, and went back to the CSM. As they were de-orbiting to Kerbin, they saw the Anomaly vanish, travelling at super speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one knows what the darned thing was... But it was definitely a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of this was to demonstrate how fun a contract to investigate some anomolous object would be. It gets put in a strange orbit and you rendezvous with it, take some samples, even grab it with a claw. Bring it back if the contract specifies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-20T14:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2015 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T14:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol, nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T23:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHa ha!
