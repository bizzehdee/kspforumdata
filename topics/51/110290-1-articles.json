This would be redesigned for later missions.\n\nShortly after docking it was noted that all the fuel had leaked out of the Service Modules tanks. Ground crew muttered about how no-one read their engineers reports and something about docking ports used as decouplers. They then suggested that the missing fuel would likely be found in the N-IVB stage. It was and had to be siphoned out\n\nAt the end of the first day in Orbit, after separation from the N-IVB, the Service Propulsion System was ignited to boost the CSM into a higher orbit.\n\nAfter the Second day of systems tests, the crew prepared to practice Rendezvous using the N-IVB as a target.\n\nThe CSM was then docked to the N-IVB and the SPS was used to push it into a re-entry trajectory to simulate pushing the LM. After separation the CSM returned to stable orbit.\n\n3days 1hour 5minutes and 55seconds into the mission the SPS was fired one last time to de-orbit the CSM. 3 minutes 16 seconds later the Service Module was Jettisoned.\n\nThe command module safely splashed down at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B030\u002727\u0022W 94\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B05\u002729\u0022W\n\nGallery\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

So yes you can tesGAH...\n\n![y1NDlfc.png](http://i.imgur.com/y1NDlfc.png)\n\nCapcom:WHAT HAPPENED? YOU ARE BURNING TOO EARLY!\n\nJebediah: Relax, I\u0027ve got this. You owe me two landings, So I\u0027m taking them. Munbles, Upload the new Mission Insignia\n\n![Sm1ajXV.png](http://i.imgur.com/Sm1ajXV.png)\n\nThe Minmus landing was flown with both ascent and decent being performed by the Descent Propulsion System, after Re-docking the Service module effected a Hohmann transfer from Minus to Mun.\n\nFuel was transfered from the Ascent stage to the Descent stage to allow for Munar landing, within 1km of Kerbollo 15 landing site.\n\nOnce on the suface, the LLES was deployed. Not pictured is the explosion of the LLES landing legs due to a combination of part clipping and being deployed downhill.\n\nWhile Sanbeth conducted the inspection of Kerbollo 15, Jebediah inspected the LLES and determined that it would be usable, with the reaction wheels providing enough control to orient it for launch.\n\nUpon Rendezvous with the CSM, Jebediah and Sanbeth EVA\u0027d across. Not pictured - As jebediah left his seat he was flung away, and had to use his MMU to return to the CSM. The LLES was flung less violently, but had to perform some small manuevers to stabalize with the CSM, there were no issues when Sanbeth left her seat. the LLES was rated as needing some adjustments befor it could enter full service.\n\nGallery\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
