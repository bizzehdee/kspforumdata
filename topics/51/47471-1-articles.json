Asking for help, I offered to set up a fairly small set of outposts for him to test his concept. The result was an actual challenge thread titled \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51335-The-Amazing-Race-Interplanetary-Edition-Season-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Amazing Race: Interplanetary Edition Season 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic concept is that Jebediah is the only pilot available to complete a set of tasks that have presented themselves to KSC that need to be completed as quick as possible. His first is to collect his buddy Bill, who is currently situated on Kerbin station. A few artefacts have been found on Mun, which they need to check out, but they also need to transport the resident alien expert, Ripley, to Mun station. At some point they also need to pick up Bob, who is currently on Minmus station. As the stations can\u0027t be left unmanned for any length of time, Buzz has offered to transfer from Mun station to Minmus station to replace Bob. Buzz apparently has had enough of the Mun anyway. Before they leave Minmus, Bob has offered to deliver a lander at Minmus station to Minmus base. Unfortunately that means someone will have to go and pick Bob up once he\u0027s made the delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is also on the task list, as someone back at KSC realised they didn\u0027t stake any sort of claim to the face that was recently unearthed on Duna, so they\u0027ve been asked to go and plant a flag there. Meanwhile on Laythe, due to boredom, a couple of guys on Laythe station decided to have some fun by trying to automate their lander. Unfortunately whilst it worked perfectly all the way to the surface, at that point their system gave up the ghost and stranded it there, so two of our intrepid trio have been asked to pay a visit to Laythe and retrieve the lander from the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my log of that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb sits alone on the pad, raring to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/IPM2/IPM01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IPM01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe timer probe is released from the end of Kerbin station, as this is the most reliable way of keeping track of the MET. Jeb is still docked, to show that he didn\u0027t try to leave before starting the timer. Meanwhile, the mission lander is sitting off station just out of shot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/IPM2/IPM02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IPM02.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving released the timer, Jeb is free to set off.
