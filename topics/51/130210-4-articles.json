Inside the crew transfer module that was in turn installed inside the cargo bay of the spaceplane, Jonnie, Angun, Margaret and yours truly sat fully suited up and attempted to be patient as we slowly cooked to death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe good news was that the refueling process was complete, we\u0027d been cleared for launch and this part of our ordeal would soon be over, but in the mean time we would have to close the cargo bay doors, seal the crew cabin hatch and trust the hard-worked GPU to cool us sufficiently to avoid us baking in our own suits like a bunch of foil-wrapped potatoes before the engines came on line. The true irony of the situation was that the cargo bay itself was sandwiched between two absolutely massive liquid methane and oxygen tanks that each contained an ungodly amount of super-chilled cryogenic propellant. But until the main engines started, the effect they had on the temperature inside the cabin was precisely nil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002219IRyaM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/19IRyaM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou would have thought that traveling into orbit on board a sleek single-stage spaceplane should be the coolest thing ever, and that it would beat the pants off riding an ugly, blunt capsule strapped to the top of a disposable rocket hands down, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWell, think again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E was certainly one of the most complex machines we had ever devised, I must admit. The design and development processes had been... involved, as the many tonnes of scrap metal and composites strewn across the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean floors beyond the western thresholds of our runways in Omelek and Kourou can attest. The idea was brilliant: a remotely controlled vehicle capable of taking-off horizontally and flying into orbit without shedding bits on the way to deposit a small payload into low Earth orbit. The same vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere in one piece and return to the launch site to land in an unassuming puff of hot rubber, before taxiing back into the hanger looking smug, if such an emotion can indeed be attributed to an inanimate object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI can still remember the day Froemone came to see me in my office with the requested propulsion specifications for the design, fidgeting nervously. I\u0027d read through the first page describing the closed cycle requirements and thought \u201CMeh...\u201D, then through the second page describing atmospheric performance and winced thinking \u201CUlp, this is gonna be hard...\u201D Then, reaching the end of the document I\u0027d realised that the two pages were actually referring to one single engine and I\u0027d snorted the tea I had been drinking out through my nostrils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut we\u0027d met these specs eventually, and a prototype finally made it to space with a probe that was to orbit the Moon. However, it took us a great deal of trial and error to get the craft back to Earth safely, and several more prototypes ended their short operational lives at the bottom of the ocean at embarrassingly large distances from our landing sites, rather than sitting smugly in our hangars. The project that was supposed to save our precious funds by cutting our launch expenses dramatically wasn\u0027t delivering as promised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut a change in launch sites from Omelek and Kourou, a new low-orbit communications network to reduce signal delay, and even more trial and error finally enabled an improvement in our ability to bring back our spaceplane intact. With Kourou, we at least had a whole continent to aim for rather than a tiny island in the middle of the Pacific, and eventually we had deemed \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E reliable enough to carry her first human passengers into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI had personally flown on \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E just once before, and it had also been to transfer to \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E when we had made our first jaunt into solar orbit more than a year ago now. In terms of the most terrifying experiences I\u0027ve had in space, I put it a close second to orbiting the Moon dangling from the open cargo bay of our shuttle. The spaceplane\u0027s crew module was wedged inside of the cargo bay, and once the bay doors glided shut you were left in the dark with no view of the outside world, and once \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E left the ground, no real sense of direction. For all you knew, the remote guidance system could have failed and you could be seconds from impact with the ocean\u0027s surface or a hypersonic mid-air break-up. At least when strapped to the top of a rocket, you could see the sky through the view-port and make sure the capsule was still pointing at it. And don\u0027t get me started about re-entry in such a contraption... the good thing about today is that, if all goes well, I won\u0027t have to worry about that at any time in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CEngine start, helmets on.\u201D said Jonnie flatly as the airframe shuddered. He was to be \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s pilot for our trip to Mars but right now he was just a passenger like the rest of us, and from his rather brisk manner and an uncharacteristic failure to call everyone \u201Cbuddy\u201D, I could guess that he clearly wasn\u0027t enjoying himself either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen the engine\u0027s shuddering turned into a rumble, and \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E started to roll. \u003Cem\u003EThink positive thoughts\u003C/em\u003E, Cam, I whispered to myself. Then, ten minutes of pure madness began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFirst of all, take-off. Today we were pushing the envelope by carrying a crew cabin, supplies and three tonnes of extra fuel for \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E waiting for us at more than 300 kilometres above, so we were at MTOW. Getting a 350-tonne craft into the air on such tiny wings is insane. Karanda could give lectures all day about lifting bodies if she liked; the fact remained that you could easily go out for tea and a muffin when \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E hit decision speed and still be back in time for V1, if you hadn\u0027t been strapped into your seat and clinging on with a death-grip of pure terror, of course. Somehow, she managed to rotate before reaching the end of the runway, but there was no margin for error or mechanical failure of any kind. If an engine stalled at that moment, then our only hope was that the cargo doors would open in time for the launch escape system to eject the crew module to safety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t8riiOg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t8riiOg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen came the sudden lurch of the three gee pitch-up maneuver that meant we had escaped\u00A0 obliteration on the runway threshold, but were now already traveling at such a speed that \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E had to swoop into a 45\u00B0 climb into order not to shed parts under the rapidly rising aerodynamic stresses. If this happened, the first thing to go would be the canard fore-plane (we knew this from bitter experience), which would definitely ruin our chances of reaching orbit as well as our aircraft\u0027s pitch authority. Fortunately, the maneuver went as planned and the canards remained attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OseM6zj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OseM6zj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere was a moment of respite as Carderie powered on upwards through the atmosphere at just below Mach one. I glanced over at Jonnie who was sitting along side me, and was relieved to note that our intrepid Head Test Pilot was having just as bad a day as I was. Then, having reached ten thousand meters, \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E started to level off, and the true madness of the dual-cycle precooled rockets kicked in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DrF4KI1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DrF4KI1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou see, the engines in air-breathing mode didn\u0027t behave like any normal rocket, where thrust was relatively constant. Once \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E had brushed the sound barrier aside and began piling on the Machs, their push began to get stronger as air was rammed into the intakes, and the more she accelerated, the stronger it got. Mach 2 was history in less than thirty seconds. The crew cabin seat pushed into my backside as if it was trying to eject me, and it was difficult to breathe. And then, just when I thought the acceleration couldn\u0027t get any stronger, it continued to increase. That\u0027s the thing about terrifying experiences: when you know what to expect, they\u0027re usually worse the second time round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAttached to the forward bulkhead of the cabin was a small panel that displayed altitude and Mach number. It reminded me of a similar display devised to impress the passengers in our hypersonic jets, except they took nearly half an hour to reach twenty-five klicks and Mach four. We were coming up on Mach five less than four minutes into the flight, and finally the thrust began to fade away to a gentle push. But we still had another twenty Machs or so to go. Another few seconds of sweet reprieve from suffocation, and then \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E pitched up again, the orbital maneuvering rocket fired and the main engines switched over to closed cycle. Positive thoughts, Cam... Unfortunately positive thoughts required the ability to breathe. Dark thoughts however, came easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMartian pyramids, unknown terrors in space, my potted plant finally withering away, never returning to Earth...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MK3ehfp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MK3ehfp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe next six minutes were just a blur of watching the figures on the display rise until a constant five gees made them fuzzy and meaningless. Fortunately, whoever had designed the flight profile had been merciful enough to throttle back the engines towards the end of the burn to limit gee-forces as \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E had consumed most of her fuel. Then, when mission control deemed our apoapsis was high enough to encounter our target, engine cut-off, and silence. Air in my lungs again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter a four minute coast, the orbital rocket re-lit for a gentle one-minute burn to push us to meet \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E.

I didn\u0027t doubt their accuracy, as she had never failed us yet, but I was a little concerned that she had forgotten a plus or a minus somewhere and so double checked with her for little crosses or dashes in front of the numbers she had written, and then triple checked with our autonavigation system. They agreed and I punched the figures into our flight computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThank you Steledith.

Their separation was messier than we\u0027d expected: the docking ports had not unlatched in sync and one of them had rotated inwards and banged against the lab, but no damage had been caused and they had finally drifted off into the emptiness of space. According to Steledith, they would be kicked up well above Earth\u0027s orbit when they swung past Mars, and would become relics of our first trip beyond our home planet, frozen in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ttpy37l.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ttpy37l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd now, the long wait lay ahead of us. Nearly nine months in deep space. This gave me plenty of time to think about what the hell I was doing here, although it was a bit late in the day to do anything about it. If I understood correctly, Angun and Margaret were determined to get to the bottom of the strange puzzle that was the state of life on our planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou see, the Earth was about four and a half billion years old if we believed what the zircon crystals, the lunar samples or the asteroids told us. Simple life and bacteria had appeared in a remarkably short time after the birth of our planet, and depending on which biologist you believed, life had possibly arisen just once or maybe several times at different epochs of the Earth\u0027s early history after major disasters, heavy meteorite bombardments, and various other phenomena that had rendered the planet\u0027s surface completely unsuitable for chilling out, even if you are a hardcore extremophile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut whatever the processes for abiogenesis may be, the fact remains that for several aeons life was a pretty simple affair, consisting of single-cell mush floating around in the Earth\u0027s primitive oceans or living in bubbling, reeking carpets covering the rocks on the sea-floor. After an awfully large amount of time, it had finally got bigger, evolving into the giant \u003Cem\u003ELeviathan\u003C/em\u003E and the awesome \u003Cem\u003EBehemoth\u003C/em\u003E that had roamed the waters, plains and forests of our planet for hundreds of millions of years. And still the rocks had rained down from space to take out these monsters. The bigger they came, the harder they fell when the Siberian Traps had erupted, or the skies had boiled to blackness from the fallout of latest impact. Despite this, the fossil record - however incomplete it was - showed that as more monsters were wiped out, even more fearsome creatures sprang up to take their place, romping carefree through an ever more luscious vegetation that spread across the continents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then the age of the giants had come and gone, and more subtle, complex animals had emerged. A blink of an eye ago, in cosmic terms, the monsters had got smaller, leaving room for even stranger creatures. Warm blooded and long lived, they defied any evolutionary logic with their weighty metabolisms and fragile ecosystems. Maybe Sol had entered a kinder phase of her life at this point, and the lenient climates had enabled the prosperity of strange and abundant lineages of birds, cats and primates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIf there is some kind of hilarious logic behind all this, it doesn\u0027t matter. The fact remains that these species were all betrayed by fortune anyway. Eight hundred thousand years ago, according to Angun\u0027s best estimation, something happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe very last \u003Cem\u003ELeviathan\u003C/em\u003E gave up the ghost on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a lonely cloud of bubbles that no other creature noticed, because they were too busy expiring themselves. Nearly all of the trees, plants and ferns that had covered dry land withered away and rotted into a layer of decaying organic matter, leaving behind a desolate carpet of only the toughest moss and lichen. Almost all creatures not capable of digging or burrowing into the ground became extinct. Unlike previous mass extinctions, this one could not be attributed to some bolide from the heavens or massive volcanic activity: there was no trace of such an event so recently in our planet\u0027s history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd almost immediately after this final disaster, give or take a few thousand years, we popped up. We, the Kerbals, a species of cave-dwellers blessed with organs that, by all logic, we should not have: eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEyes to see with. Eyes to look up to the skies with, and to search for the truth behind our origins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMake any sense of this if you may. I\u0027m still not sure that a lonely monument standing on an apparently dead planet will hold all the answers we are looking for, interesting though it may be. Angun champions the hypothesis that seems to be trendy in some of the thriftier circles of biologists since our discoveries on the Moon, stating that we might not be from this planet in the first place, and that we might have literally come from the stars. Without further evidence, I just don\u0027t buy this. Why would we have traversed the endless void, if this was even possible, just to live in damp caves eating fish for the next million years? Besides, here I am sitting in an interplanetary ship partly of my own invention, feeling full of myself at being one of the most adventurous pioneers in the history of my species. What a blow to my status it would be to find out that my ancestors came from Alpha Centauri.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd, judging from the heated arguments between Angun and Margaret I sometimes heard coming from \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s lab, I gathered that Margaret was more worried about the cause of this most recent mass extinction on Earth, and the possibility of it also being connected to our alien visitors, or whatever we would find on Mars. For all her previous warmth and friendliness, I sensed that something in her had changed since her own experience on the Moon beneath that gigantic rock arch that we still had no explanation for. I sometimes got the impression that she was on this mission with us to look out for Angun, and make sure he didn\u0027t get carried away with his research or do something that Kerbalkind would later regret.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat trouble have I got myself into this time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-13T22:34:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2016 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by UnusualAttitude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T16:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome, another chapter!

In comparison, the Earth\u0027s own belts that had caused us much concern in the early days of our space programme were a joke. An intrepid Kerbonaut wishing to conquer the Jupiter system would save himself a lot of trouble by taking a much shorter trip to the Moon, climbing into the service bay of our \u003Cem\u003EPadirac\u003C/em\u003E mining rover and hugging its fission reactor for a week or two. That\u0027s how bad it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJust hours before the mission critical insertion burn, \u003Cem\u003EMartel\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s simple computer brain decided that since we had shot it into such a hostile environment, we apparently didn\u0027t love it anymore and shut down. Only swift action from Mission Control, working around a forty-five minute signal delay, managed to persuade the probe that this was not true, of course we still loved it, and force a reboot just in time to save it from letting it drift past the gas giant without braking and shoot out beyond Neptune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, \u003Cem\u003EMartel\u003C/em\u003E was living on borrowed time and there was no way of knowing whether it would be months or even just weeks before it fell silent for good. Mission Control had therefore got to work gathering data, and adjusting the probe\u0027s trajectory in order to perform close flybys of the four large moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCallisto was first, and proved to be the easiest of the moons to aim for when \u003Cem\u003EMartel\u003C/em\u003E was at the slowest part of her orbit. After only two orbits around Jupiter, our intrepid explorer managed to get close enough for a good look. Callisto turned out to be considerably larger than Luna, but it contained a significant proportion of water ice. Its surface extremely old and was very heavily cratered all over, but lacking the volcanic maria of our satellite. On the whole, it was a rather drab shade of greyish brown that wasn\u0027t very appealing, and probably wasn\u0027t something I would travel through deep space for several years to see. \u201CIt\u0027s the Moon with some dirty ice mixed in...\u201D was Jonnie\u0027s unenthusiastic conclusion. Callisto did however score points for not having a level of radiation at its surface that would have you coughing up blood the moment you got anywhere near it, unlike the other moons of Jupiter, which was something I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022veMu16z.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/veMu16z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe next body \u003Cem\u003EMartel\u003C/em\u003E flew past was Europa, which turned out to be considerably more intriguing. Europa lacked the impact-blasted surface of most of the airless bodies we had seen so far, and the high albedo suggested a young surface that seemed to be constantly recycled, a bit like the oceanic crust on Earth, except here the crust was made of ice. Readings from \u003Cem\u003EMartel\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s magnetometer revealed fluctuations in the magnetic field of Jupiter as it swept past Europa that could possibly be explained by an ocean of briny liquid water beneath the surface of the moon, heated from below by tidal forces caused by its proximity to the gravitational bully that was the gas giant. Whether this subsurface ocean would be accessible to future exploration missions was anyone\u0027s guess, but the biologists back on Earth had already begun to imagine sightless aquatic monsters swimming in the eternal darkness of these unfathomable depths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jl4mlBs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jl4mlBs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe pictures that Bartdon had sent to us today were of Jupiter\u0027s innermost large moon, Io. As soon as I clapped my eyes on the first one of them, I knew that I would be in for some awfully bad kerbonaut nightmares the next time that I closed my eyes. Io was one of those places that seemed to be thrown out there by some evil Creator just to spite the engineers and scientists of a young and enthusiastic space programme, and to show them that no matter how hard they tried, there were some places in the Sol system that just weren\u0027t meant to be explored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BpMRZ27.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BpMRZ27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFor a start, it was so deep inside Jupiter\u0027s gravity well that getting there would require more delta-vee than we could begin to contemplate. It was also constantly blasted by high levels of radiation, and most surprisingly of all, the surface was highly volcanic and dotted with calderas that spewed lava out into space.

Exactly what they were in disagreement about I had no idea, and asking Angun about any of his subjects of research was usually a non-starter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lU0nPmf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lU0nPmf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEven Margaret wasn\u0027t talking, and when I approached her discreetly one evening to ask whether further examination of the \u003Cem\u003EVers Eight\u003C/em\u003E Mars orbiter\u0027s imagery had revealed any conclusive evidence of the pyramid, she simply told me not to worry about such matters and reminded me that we would still have to chose our landing sites based on the mission\u0027s official scientific objectives anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou see, old Cambert didn\u0027t raise no fool, and eight months in deep space had given me plenty of time to think things over... I had already come to the conclusion that Angun and/or Margaret knew just a little bit more than they had cared to share with me when they had shown me the picture of the Red Pyramid back at the KSC. You don\u0027t go sauntering off to another planet just because some watery black slab of stone spits out a picture that, for all I knew, could have been ripped from a page of the Mars tourist office brochure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd earlier this evening, while my crew-mates were resting and I was pulling watch, I received confirmation that my suspicions were founded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHalf way through my shift, while I was sitting at my station on the bridge, I received a message from Mission Control. We were now well beyond range for direct conversation, being about three light-minutes from Earth, so the message came through as text. It was also on the medical channel, which meant that it was private and could only be opened and read if I entered my personal code. I punched it in and the message appeared on my screen. One glance told me that it had nothing to do with my medical well-being. This is how it began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESalut vieux cousin pourri, c\u0027est Karanda,\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJe t\u0027\u00E9cris de la part de Bartdon.

Bartdon had gone through all of this carefully with far more attention to detail than might be expected for a busy, newly-instated leader of a space programme, but Bart just happened to be seriously committed to his job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThese documents included the account books for various activities that were essential to the Space Centre\u0027s operations, but were outsourced to private contractors for practical reasons. Examples of this included some of the transportation requirements between Omelek and Kourou if they were not provided by our own Air Service, and the deployment of certain equipment from aircraft or airship. This latter category also included scientific hardware for research projects. One such project had been the deployment of a network of underwater microphones in the Pacific Ocean, commissioned by a certain PI Angun, officially to perform research on marine life and sending the audio feed back to our lab via our geostationary satellites. OK, typical Angun stuff, but so far so good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHowever, what drew his attention was a request placed by PI Angun - four months prior to his departure for Mars - for an upgrade to one of the hydrophone platforms situated just off the coast of South America. Bartdon was now wondering why his predecessor had requested this particular platform to be equipped with a long range dish capable of transmitting directly across interplanetary distances. Pretty far out, even for Angun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd sure enough, after sending one of the Air Service jets to investigate and fly over the platform in question, it turned out that the contractor had done the job they had been payed for, and there was an underwater microphone beaming out gibberish into deep space through a shiny big dish. It didn\u0027t take a genius to work out where this data was headed, but they couldn\u0027t make any sense of it. It seemed to be encrypted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oLH2XNx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oLH2XNx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI checked. I flicked through the various channels our hi-gain dish was tuned in to and found several that might be relaying the signals, all of which Angun or Margaret had protected with a personal code. And there was me thinking they were just receiving data for the projects they\u0027d been working on back on Earth...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBartdon went on to state that he believed he could trust me. Karanda, who had known me since I had been a wee sprout, had apparently vouched for my integrity (thanks a bunch, Karanda...) and therefore he was appealing to me to keep an eye out for any sign of our mission commander engaging in suspicious activity or deviating from our primary mission objectives. I was not to say anything about Bartdon contacting me, as they were trying to decipher the data from the platform in the Pacific without Angun knowing they were listening in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe had his doubts about Margaret (\u003Cem\u003Etouch\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E, Bart), and suspected she would be working with Angun on whatever unauthorized research they were up to. And as for Jonnie, well... He could be trusted to recover a jet from an inverted flat spin or, in moments of dire need, to tie his own shoelaces, but certainly not to spy on a pair of crafty, paranoid scientists. Which is why Bartdon had turned to me for help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nKaranda ended by saying that I should report any information I came up with to Bartdon via her in \u003Cem\u003Epatois\u003C/em\u003E on the medical channel, including as many foul expressions as I wished to make it believable that I was just casually discussing the merits (or lack thereof) of my \u003Cem\u003Ecousine\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s latest design. (At least that didn\u0027t sound too difficult). Oh, and that I should change my personal code every day. Then she signed off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...tu ne me manques pas du tout.

But after thinking things through for a few minutes, I decided that this would only make matters worse. If I spilled all the beans, Mission Control would no longer trust anyone on board \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E with the possible exception of our pilot, and they would probably order Jonnie to lock us all in the lab until the launch window to return to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis is just great.

I touched the laminated glass with the sudden realisation that the ionised molecules mere centimetres from the palm of my hand, warming our ship\u0027s windshield, were those of an alien world just waiting to be ours if we could only find the means to get down there and back up safely. A brief caress of the unknown that faded away into nothingness as we rose back up into that infinite black vacuum that seemed to smother the entirety of creation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223sSpG1f.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3sSpG1f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNo matter, the Red Planet\u0027s moon Phobos awaited us, and each pass through the atmosphere brought us closer to our goal. Five times in total, we took the risk of plunging into the thin, wispy clouds to arrest our velocity relative to Mars and bring down our apareion. It worked, and we now just had to wait for our guests to turn up to the party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nRover \u003Cem\u003EType-G Seven\u003C/em\u003E was the first to arrive, with its inclination tuned so as to end up in an orbit that would enable it to land on Mars\u0027 southern hemisphere. It plunged into the thin air until it was less than thirty kilometres from the planet\u0027s datum altitude, so it was perhaps less than twenty klicks from the surface at its lowest point over the southern highlands. The Red Planet\u0027s atmosphere reached high above the surface but it\u0027s density dropped off more slowly than in the skies of Earth, and in any case it remained deceptively thin all the way down to the surface. It happened to be ideal for such a capture, and future missions would no doubt exploit this to save fuel. \u003Cem\u003EG Seven\u003C/em\u003E made it into a stable orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JK4r3ij.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JK4r3ij.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E lander was next, coming in more or less lined up with the inclination of Mars\u0027 moons. We had to make a small correction after it was captured to ensure that we would be able to rendez-vous with it up near Phobos, but there was enough fuel left in its transfer stage for this. Our two other rovers, \u003Cem\u003EG Eight\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EG Nine\u003C/em\u003E, made similar captures that put the lowest points of their respective orbits above the equator and northern hemisphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDuring this entire operation, \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E played a crucial role and most of the maneuvers our probe fleet performed were programmed from our on board remote command station, our ship\u0027s hi-gain antenna blasting orders at the simple machines. The rovers would be driven across the surface in the same way once they touched down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nToday, we finally met up with \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E and Jonnie guided the tiny lander, with its transfer stage still attached, in to dock at the front of our ship. I watched in awe from my station up front as the vessel we had sent on its way just a few hours after our own departure, nine months ago, caught us up and latched its docking clamps into place. After a journey through space across tens of millions of kilometers of emptiness, it had found us. For once, Jonnie\u0027s drawl summed things up perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell fancy seeing you here, buddy...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SlPcB9I.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SlPcB9I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E had been secured, I floated aft to the lab to enjoy the view from its wide, generous windows that gave a stunning view of the planet, seven thousand kilometres below. Even from this distance, I could clearly make out details with the naked eye that generations of astronomers on Earth had been straining to see with their largest telescopes. Olympus Mons and her sisters, the Tharsis Montes. The Martian Canyon was also creeping slowly into view above the planet\u0027s limb as we swept round Mars in just over seven and a half hours, letting Phobos slowly catch up with us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe lab had been empty when I\u0027d arrived, but shortly I was joined by Margaret who drifted down beside me to enjoy the view in silence for a few moments. Things seemed to have settled down a little between her and Angun since we had arrived, and the atmosphere on board \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E had certainly improved now that we all had things to do. Had the disagreements between them during the trip been a simple case of two brilliant but bored scientists in too close proximity for too long?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWeeks had now passed since Bartdon had contacted me with the revelation that Angun had been receiving live data directly from the thing at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean that he called the Monument. I was no closer to knowing if they were monitoring it just as a precaution in the off chance that it would provide some other pretty pictures of Mars, or if the Monument was actually still talking to them and they were tuning into Alien Artifact TV every day just before dinner. The fact that Angun had gone to the trouble of having an interplanetary coms relay installed on his listening platform suggested the latter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut Angun and Margaret had given no indication that the plan of action for our robotic exploration of Mars\u0027 surface had changed in any way. How was I supposed to approach the subject without them knowing that I knew what they were up to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CDo you think we\u0027ll find it?\u201D I thought out loud, gazing down at the red desert below us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CFind what?\u201D Margaret\u0027s tone was unreadable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe Pyramid... or whatever it is we\u0027re actually looking for?\u201D I tried to sound vague and thoughtful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat do \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E think we\u0027re looking for, Camwise?\u201D she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, I\u0027m an engineer. My job is just to make sure we get here in one piece, with air to breathe, water to drink, and then go in engines blazing. It\u0027s your job to look for stuff when we do. However, PI Angun seems to be of the opinion that the Martian Pyramid, along with the ship we found, suggests that intelligent life on Earth did not originate from Earth. And I gather you\u0027re not convinced.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nUnexpectedly, she gave a dry chuckle. \u201CThe thing is, I believe it doesn\u0027t matter whether I\u0027m convinced or not. The point I would make is that where we come from is certainly interesting but also irrelevant. The fact is, just under a million years ago, almost all life was erased from the surface of our planet. My point of view is that it might just make sense to find out why.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMaybe we Kerbals are all just Class-E bait green trash, waiting for the next one to hit...\u201D I started, but I was cut off by her mirthless snort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCam, I\u0027ve spent most of my life looking for the crater that would have been left by such an impact. I\u0027ve scoured the Earth and I found nothing. This one was something else, and if I have to travel to Triton and back to find out what it was, I shall. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWith that she lapsed back into silence. After a couple of minutes, she floated back towards the crew module, and I was left to watch \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E very slowly slip behind Phobos. Being in a slightly lower orbit, the moon was drifting imperceptibly ahead. When it lapped us, Jonnie, Angun and I would take \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E down to its surface. Until then, we had a couple of weeks to land our first rovers and start exploring the surface of Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aQzHjxF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aQzHjxF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-26T23:16:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2016 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by UnusualAttitude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
