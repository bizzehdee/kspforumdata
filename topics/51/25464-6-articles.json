I\u0027ve done some testing, and it turns out that the culprit in causing these pitch-ups (aside from having to hold a fairly high pitch-up trim to begin with in the thin air at 10 km) is the high position of the air intakes. I originally placed them high to give the plane more ground clearance for roving, but the drag on the intakes does cause an upward pitch. Below, as Nelemy approached his first target island, he steers toward the low-lying land on the left side (the general procedure when approaching an unexplored island looking for a good place to land, since there tend to be beaches with low slopes in those areas).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jMxMJzK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jMxMJzK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first bay area looks to have fairly steep slopes, so Nelemy checks out the next, smaller, bay.

Just be sure to set the brake whenever you stop and get out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude, the brake was set. I have it set now and the rover wheels can\u0027t move the ship, so the brakes work. Something weird must have happened!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, something weird did happen. The brakes WERE set on the plane. But when I swam Nelemy out to the little island and ran him around there at Physics Warp 4, the plane was responding to the physwarp by sliding down slope and into the water. So be very careful about running your kerbals around at warp speed when there are ships near by. Alas, since the kerbals don\u0027t know about this, they\u0027re probably going to think Nelemy is some sort of Mr. Squirmy Brake-Non-Setter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... Nelemy also checked out a little north bay where there was a very skinny peninsula that looked like to might be fun to drive on. That\u0027s #4 on the map below (#1 is where he landed, #2 is the first big peninsula he drove out on, and #3 is where he put the BirdDog2 into the drink).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V80RYen.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V80RYen.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GN4LLyj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GN4LLyj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter exploring the bay area, Nelemy headed cross country in the rover/plane to continue gathering samples and checking out possible base locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE: Brotoro\u0027s Rules For Driving Laythe Rovers.\u003C/strong\u003E My kerbals have rules for driving their rovers (don\u0027t go too fast, especially in known dangerous situations), but whereas they get paid to carefully explore alien words, I don\u0027t. So I have different rules that I follow, since I\u0027m just playing a game. For example, I\u0027m allowed to race a rover across the surface at high rates of warp and through dangerous terrain just so I can get to the next place quickly. If this means there are occasional smash-ups of the rover, well, that\u0027s what quicksaves are for. I don\u0027t hold those accidents against my kerbals. But if I do smash up the rover, I go back through that section of the trip at a slow speed following the kerbals\u0027 rules, just to prove it can be done (and if damage occurred then, I\u0027d be stuck with it). Then I\u0027m allowed to continue like a maniac. My rovers (especially the Fido...less so the BirdDog) are designed to travel fast and be stable across moderate terrain even at 3X and 4X warp. But I don\u0027t just fly everywhere because propellant is dear out at Laythe, so I use roving to decrease the need for jet fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Nelemy finds that the area on the south side of Kurt Island (opposite the offshore island there) is a good broad area for landing and setting up a base. This is #5 on the previous map. Then he continues on to the east coast and takes off for the next island:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7Jz0Flv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227Jz0Flv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w4xw4ej.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w4xw4ej.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Nelemy approaches the next island. Much of its shoreline appears to be steep, so he heads over toward the big bay area on the left to search for a landing site. Unfortunately, the left side of that bay has very steep slopes, and the right side is fairly steep. So Nelemy decides to do an up-slope landing to the right side, high enough up that the slope is fairly gentle. He brings in some extra speed, as advised by Aldner for upslope landings, and puts the plane down at about 70 m/s instead of the usual less-than-50 speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cXVVsxh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cXVVsxh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JohcL1F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JohcL1F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QcpchlQ.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022QcpchlQ.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022BirdDogie calling Thompbles!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s up, Nelemy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022I\u0027ve landed safely, and I\u0027d like to name this place J Island.

So, time for some driving. Still, being that the caldera is a long way up, it took a lot of driving upslope at a shallow angle to gain altitude. \u0022Contour driving\u0022 is an important technique for herding your rover up a steep incline. Just aim a little above the contour lines and keep your speed at about 10 m/s. You can steadily gain altitude at a meter or two per second. When you come to a sharp angled slope line, be ready to turn upslope as you cross it, or you can end up heading too much down hill. The BirdDog can handle 2X and sometimes 3X physwarp when driving along moderate slopes like this, but you have to keep giving it some uphill-turn to counteract the natural tendency of rovers to slide down slope under time warp in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DtyTg6M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DtyTg6M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually Nelemy came to a more level area high up (#2 on the map below) that overlooked some moderately flat areas that might have made a better landing site, since they would have been closer to the route up into the caldera (#3 on the map).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EcjbbII.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EcjbbII.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lXbGlT5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lXbGlT5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see Nelemy heading up the high pass (above Laythe\u0027s \u0022dune level\u0022) and then topping the ridge for his first view into the central caldera.

The plane was trying to pitch up violently, much more so than normal, and it was very difficult to control. I was mystified at first... Had it been a mistake moving the fuel around? Not...moving it back only made matters worse. I flew along a while giving it lots of down elevator until I eventually noticed that the pitch trim had apparently gotten set to maximum-up. Setting this back down (with lots of Alt-s keypresses) got the plane under control. It turned out (since I was able to sometimes replicate this weird behavior), that if I click outside the KSP window onto my Dock, the pitch trim can suddenly get set to some weird value. It doesn\u0027t happen most of the time, but I did get it to happen again. OK... so remember to be careful about wildly clicking outside of the window when flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oue1GCc.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022oue1GCc.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy landed safely back at Laythe Base and refueled at the original GasStation.

And, if you have a well designed rover and some driving skills, you can blast along at higher warp speeds and cover lots of ground fast when you get bored.

So, I extended the nose gear to lift the blown tires off of the surface, and then they were easily fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DdXIIGt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DdXIIGt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe southwest part of the island has some wide flat inland areas that would be great for mining resources (if there are any there to be mined). If I had known, I could have just landed there...but Aldner is all about saving fuel on these long trips, so he picked the first landing spot he saw. In the second picture below, Aldner drives down into the nice depression in the south central part of the island.

I\u0027m sure this was disappointing to the geologists because there was an interesting caldera feature on the far east end of the island...but Aldner figured he might pick that up on the way back home, if he had the fuel. Instead, he drove south along the big peninsula and the low inland area to get samples, then took off for the next island south.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xQ4ZFYy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xQ4ZFYy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4ZiI7pP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224ZiI7pP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X7JeWIM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X7JeWIM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next island south also was mostly rough highlands, but there was a peninsula poking out to the west. The peninsula had a pronounced ridge, but it flatted out on one side into a suitable landing area. Aldner drove the rover to the mainland of the island, then up over a ridge into a smooth depression (in the center of the second picture below). The ridge would make a good seawall protection against tsunamis for a base area here.

A good island?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022This part\u0027s OK. It does have the advantage that the giant green thing in the sky is not hanging right over my head all the time.

So this was going to require a landing in the highlands, which did not look overly smooth. In fact, this was the first island where Aldner wasn\u0027t able to find a suitable landing spot on his first pass. But after his pass low over the highlands to check things out in more detail, he came back around a put the plane down in a scooped out area with a slight downslope. It wasn\u0027t very big, so he came in low over the bordering south ridge, then landed. Downhill landings entail a longer runout, but he did it with room to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kPckHgN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kPckHgN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8VbDHwC.gif\u0022 alt=\u00228VbDHwC.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Captain Thompbles.

Danny\u0027s films are much funnier.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022A rather precise claim. But so noted.

You\u0027ve heard all those birds around the Kerbal Space Center, so I\u0027m sure they have some form of domesticated poultry, so the name \u0027chicken\u0027 will do fine for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChicken Island is a good sized island, most of which is relatively smooth highlands, but Aldner found a nice beach on the northeast shore to land on. He then drove up onto the high plateau, then over to the northwest corner of the island where a peninsula reaches out toward Macey Island. In fact, I could not tell from my maps for sure if Chicken and Macey were actually disconnected islands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lFjP8uy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lFjP8uy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RDgK4tl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RDgK4tl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Aldner drives down to the peninsula area between Chicken and Macey Islands.

The sky is a dark and ominous clear sunny blue, and a flock of vultures is strangely not seen circling overhead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pSOJl4f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pSOJl4f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK... this was actually my second time driving the rover up this ridge. The first time, I was zipping along a 3X phys warp, and I flew over the top and smashed down into a sharp valley on the other side, ripping off a wheel. OK...I\u0027m not going to hold that against Nelemy (see my note about my rules for driving rovers on Laythe in Part 11)... so this was the re-do, with me driving safely along at 1X speed, following the contour up the slope and around the end of the ridge. But what I thought was the last peak on the ridge was not. And I was coming along a bit too high. So when I turned the corner expecting some more slope, I found myself with the BirdDog2 straddling along the sharp top of a ridge. Arrgh! Nooooo! Turn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo late. The rear end of the rover/plane bottomed out on the ridge and ripped off the jet engine. It\u0027s the small black thing rolling slowly and mockingly down the far side of the ridge. So much for my safe-driving re-do. I was screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VYNLW88.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VYNLW88.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Thompbles! Dude!

What\u0027s wrong?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022I\u0027m sorry, man! I was trying to be careful! I was!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Calm down, Nelemy. What happened.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude...I was driving over a ridge and bottomed out! There was a ripping noise. My engine indicators are all red.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK, just take it easy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022I\u0027m stranded without that engine. I can\u0027t get back home!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022I know. Look, don\u0027t worry. We have rescue options. Don\u0027t worry. First, get out and check the damage. Maybe only the sensors are damaged.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, no. Nelemy carefully rolled back, then got out to get a look at the damage. Engine off. That BirdDog is never flying anywhere again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ernpw9B.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ernpw9B.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HflifTN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HflifTN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Nelemy to base.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022I\u0027m here, Nelemy. What did you find?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Yeah, Dude, I screwed the pooch. The engine is ripped right off the back of the plane.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK. Get back on board and see if you can carefully drive the rover off of that ridge.

We\u0027ll need to send you a rescue ship. Could be the SSTUBBY, or maybe Aldner\u0027s BirdDog piloted remotely. We have multiple options. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m working on the problem.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022OK, Dude. Thanks, man.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Laythe Base calling Fido.

Lost the jet engine while roving. Roving still works. But we need to arrange to get him back here. We\u0027ll use the SSTUBBY to retrieve him. but I could use your help with the maneuvers. And he\u0027ll need to be coached in flying the ship.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Roger. I\u0027m on my way back now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Kurt in the Fido, exploring the plateau area east of Joysina Lake. The area is not perfectly flat, but has large flatsections separated by low ridges. A good place for a base or mining operations, especially because it\u0027s near the equator and high up where tsunamis couldn\u0027t touch it. But that report is forgotten for now as Kurt drives back to base quickly, but carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LFizbYX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LFizbYX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XM6mQW3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XM6mQW3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vUcB6Ic.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vUcB6Ic.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Laythe Base calling Aldner.

What\u0027s up?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Sorry to wake you. Nelemy knocked the engine off of his BirdDog on top of a ridge. We are going to try to use the SSTUBBY to retrieve him, but if that fails I\u0027ll need you to fly back here in your BirdDog, and then pilot it remotely to pick him up. Hopefully that won\u0027t be necessary. But exploration flights are on hold for now, and please monitor the radio in case you have any suggestions.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022OK, understood. Nelemy\u0027s OK, I take it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThhompbles: \u0022Yes, he\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll be in touch. Base out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK. Rescue plan step 1: The SSTUBBY is a small SSTO rocket that is parked at Laythe Space Station. It can land via parachute, then boost back into orbit. BUT, in order for it to have maximum fuel to make orbit, it can\u0027t use too much for reentry and landing. So in order to get it into a orbit where it can reach Nelemy at 23 degrees north latitude, one of the nuclear Tugs was needed to move SSTUBBY into position. Below, Laythe Tug 9, which has been parked in a 90 km orbit since it delivered its payload (the BirdDog2 and GasStation3) to Laythe. It has over 1500 units of fuel onboard, which should be plenty for the operation. Thombles started by adjusting Tug 9\u0027s orbit to rendezvous with Laythe Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Kwrohy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222Kwrohy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Tug 9 got to the station, Thompbles remotely docked it to the rear end of the SSTUBBY (the SSTUBBY still had an adapter and docking port covering its rocket engine, so there was no need to undock the SSTUBBY first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yY0vwkO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yY0vwkO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z3HFakE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z3HFakE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the Tug needed to take SSTUBBY and change its orbital plane to pass over Milski Island. BUT, plane change maneuvers are very expensive in the low orbit where Laythe Space Station lives, so first the Tug boosted SSTUBBY out to an 800 km orbit, then did the plan change maneuver there (see below). Possibly some other altitude would have been more optimal, but I guessed that 800 km would work. Still...plane change maneuvers take a lot of propellant, especially when the SSTUBBY is fully fueled and heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y1RtyKl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y1RtyKl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter scouting around in the rover, Nelemy determined that the best landing area would be the wide shallow bowl area south of the ridge where he lost his engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qsYNLrc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qsYNLrc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the SSTUBBY separated from the Tug. Then it separated the separator and docking port that was covering its rocket engine.....which popped across and re-docked itself to the Tug. Tricksy little separator. OK...I\u0027ll separate that from the Tug later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ddHJCpv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ddHJCpv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g0xfHvS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022g0xfHvS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was a matter of waiting for Laythe to rotate Milski Island under the SSTUBBY\u0027s orbit...and with Kurt remotely controlling the ship, the rocket engine was fired to drop it from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bSnS8nO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bSnS8nO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTUBBY descended at a steep angle toward Milski Island (at the top of the image).

What do you mean I\u0027m going to have to spend two months in the Space Station?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022This is all using a lot of fuel. So to minimize the fuel usage, we\u0027ll have you wait in the space station until the new large base module arrives...then you can ride down in that when we land it here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022But, Dude! Two months? I don\u0027t want to spend two months alone in the space station. Why can\u0027t I just use the SSTUBBY to come back down to Fido Bay?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Because that would use up another 10 tons of fuel and oxidizer to bring the SSTUBBY down and back up again...but its free if we bring you down in the new base station when it arrives. You\u0027ll be doing useful things in the station...we need some better imaging of some areas from orbit and some other things.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Man...this sucks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yo, Thompbles. There is an alternative method.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Aldner? Dude! What\u0027s the alternative method?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022The two Lewis and Clark landers from the original Laythe expedition are still in orbit. I\u0027ve been looking over the misson reports, and both landers have enough RCS fuel to deorbit and land on Laythe via parachute.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Cool! Let\u0027s do that!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What? Those landers are over 14 years old. Besides, Nelemy hasn\u0027t been checked out on that hardware.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude! I landed on Pol with a Lewis lander, if you\u0027ll remember. I could fly one of those things blindfolded.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022The Laythe landers had a different configuration. Besides...didn\u0027t they drop their landing gear with their side tanks?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022He won\u0027t need landing gear. The main bodies of those landers have four chutes. They would land softer than they originally did.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022And what happens when it lands and the chutes cut off...and it falls over and smashes the capsule on the ground?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Not a problem. I\u0027ve studied the engineering diagrams. The CoM is located ahead of the chute mounts. It will land nose first.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022See? No problem, man!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK...how about landing guidance? Those landers were flown long before we had our landing guidance computers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Again, not a problem. We have the aiming points used by the original crew. And we can simulate using our computers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022But...14 year old hardware...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Look...the landers are in a 260 km orbit. The Tug needs to bring the SSTUBBY back down to the space station\u0027s orbit anyway, so it won\u0027t cost any more delta-V to stop there along the way. Nelemy can check out the landers. And if the systems are still good, he can use this option. If there are any problems, he\u0027ll just quietly go to the space station and wait like a good little astronaut.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Yeah! Deal!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow...Aldner at Manley Base, coming up with crazy ideas. Otherwise he wouldn\u0027t have had much of a part in this episode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vsezzCb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vsezzCb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... First we have to get Nelemy back into orbit. This involved some prep work (like making sure all the parachutes on the SSTUBBY were repacked in case anything went wrong and they\u0027d be needed). It also involved waiting for Laythe to rotate and line up Milski Island again with the orbit of the Tug. This was simple because it wasn\u0027t necessary to wait for the Tug to be in the correct position in the orbit...the Tug would drop down later to pick up the SSTUBBY, and it would match as needed then. So with the orbit passing overhead, Nelemy started up the SSTUBBY\u0027s jet engines at full throttle. Just as it started lifting off, he kicked in the rocket engine and boosted the ship up to 80 m/s, then cut off the rocket engine.

This orbit was not circularized...it was just so the plane shift burn could be made far out where it\u0027s cheap to do so. Once the big elliptical orbit was back over the equator, the Tug was used to rendezvous with the old Lewis and Clark landers, which were docked together in a 260 km equatorial orbit 14 years ago when the original crew left them behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w3rMxZ7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w3rMxZ7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NGUwxGq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NGUwxGq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy EVA\u0027d over to the old landers while the Tug and SSTUBBY maintained stationkeeping.

All of the systems seemed to work perfectly. The RCS tanks were 89% full...more than enough. There was even 1.2 units of fuel left in the main engine tanks. Test firings of the RCS thrusters showed they worked fine. Amazing. So Thompbles moved the Tug away, and Nelemy separated the Lewis from the Clark and oriented for the retro burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1U2HgFN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221U2HgFN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old mission records from the first Laythe landings showed where the trajectory had to be aimed out beyond Dansen Island to drop the ship onto the island from the same 260 km orbit it was still in (since that was the orbit the Mark Twain was in that released the Lewis lander, and to which the Lewis lander returned). Nelemy would have to start the retro burn right above Ocean Probe 8. First he fired the main engine to use up the small amount of fuel it had (he hadn\u0027t tested this, but it wouldn\u0027t have mattered if it failed to fire, since there was enough RCS to bring the ship down). The LV-909 fired and quickly burned out. Then Nelemy used the RCS to complete the retro burn. The trajectory needed to be adjusted until it was about twice the distance from the east coast of Dansen as Mariliza Island is located. Ah, the memories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W94dofG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W94dofG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cytvVGW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cytvVGW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Lewis lander is on a descent course as Jool rises above the horizon.

Of its original supply of 1511 units of fuel, the Tug had used up 856 units of fuel. That left it with slightly more fuel than it would need to return to Kerbin (but instead of offloading that fuel to the station, it was used up for this rescue).
