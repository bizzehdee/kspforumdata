It is in fact, the ONLY Space Agency on Kerbin. No Kerbin government wanted to start a Space Program, as they are still trying to develop everything else, like manned flight...and wheels. However, Deladin Kerman decided to go for broke, well he hopes not broke. The eccentric billionaire wanted to see the stars and turn a profit along the way. When asked in an issue of GK Magazine why he decided to skip a few hundred years of industrial design and engineering and skip straight to putting cashed strapped college stu-er kerbonauts- on onto poorly controlled explosions he remarked \u0022Golf my friend. Golf.\u0022 And many speculate that yes, hitting a Golf ball on the Mun WOULD be fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION STATEMENT:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta Galactic\u0027s goal is the betterment of all life on Kerbin, excepting that life that must be sacrificed to achieve the goal of bettering all the rest of the life. To achieve these ends, and to make the board of misfits happy, Delta Galactic will attempt to commercialize space in several phases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPhase 1\u003C/em\u003E: After initial research and development, Delta Galactic plans on commercial flights into space, for all manner of things including but not limited to: Space Adventures, University Research, Energy Drink Experiments, and of course Zero-G Dodgeball and Munar Golf driving ranges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPhase 2\u003C/em\u003E: Permanent Mun Kolonization.

Until then, print up the money and burn it....get it, burn...rockets...ya\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSION LAYOUT:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissions will generally be grouped up into specific categories, or Projects. Each Project will focus on specific aspects of the space program. Missions can jump around between projects, as until they are officially canceled, multiple concurrent projects are ongoing. For example the Geomancer Project is focused on Kerbin research and exploration, while the Artemis Project is focused on early Mun operations, mostly related to research and mapping. With this in mind, the table of contents will be broken down into each Project, with Missions being numbered as a running tally over all projects. So you may see the Mission numbers jump within each project. As Mission 10 might happen in one project, and 11 in another, and 12 back in the first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERULES:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELimited use of quicksave\u003C/strong\u003E: While I will kill off my Kerbals, I will still use quicksave loads for some things, usually if something happens right after launch that is a result of me doing something stupid in VAB. For the most part, any legitimate launch will continue regardless. As a result this is the FIRST time I have designed my rockets with an abort mechanism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIVA over EVA\u003C/strong\u003E:While I am not ready to do full IVA missions(and don\u0027t want to, some of the fun is \u0022seeing\u0022 your awesome spacecraft do it\u0027s thing\u0022 I am focusing on spending as much time in IVA as possible. I will also use the map and maneuver nodes. And yet I have Mechjeb and will take advantage of this.

Seconds after launch, as seen through the Kanon produced externally mounted cameras, a severe engine wobble in the SRB\u0027s turned into a low altitude suicide turn.

The follow is a condensed mission report supplement documenting this ongoing attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*After reviewing the data from the first flight, it was determined that either a software glitch, or stray piece of bubblegum, was causing the #1 Secondary Drive Engine (The small little guys at the top...cute things right?) to depart at launch. It was determined that this loss of balance is what caused the Artemis to return home before it even backed out of the garage. The second launch however, proved that, well this did nothing, and once again Donlong Kerman was hitting the abort button hard enough to knock the R off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*It was concluded this time that perhaps four SRB\u0027s was \u0022a little over the top eh guys?\u0022. Well, the engineering team did not not agree. They wanted four SRB\u0027s. So a compromise was made, and the design of the Artemis I was changed to a two staged SRB system, where an opposing pair of SRB\u0027s would fire, separate on burnout and the second pair would ignite. This worked a little better, and an altitude of just over 10km was reached, though the craft refused to to keep nose up attitude and drifted towards 45 degrees from the surface. Upon jettisoning the first set of SRB\u0027s and igniting the second set, what little control Donlong was maintaining over Artemis was tossed along with his lunch. Entering a high-G spin the Artemis quickly tore itself apart, this time however before Donlong could abort, the crew/lander module separated below the materials bay and landing gear(You know where it was actually intended to). So on the long descent back to Kerbin, Donlong tested out the new materials bay and took samples over Kerbin. However another flaw in the design was learned this day. The parachute could not slow the descent enough and hitting the water caused full separation and destruction of the science bay, losing all the research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The third iteration of the Artemis saw the removal two of the SRB\u0027s all together(Jeff, the 4 SRB guy was on \u0022vacation\u0022 this day). The launch went the same as before, with Donlong barely able to hold the rocket pointing up. Eventually, the rocket went horizontal and started a slow wobble until it broke itself apart. With the entire landing module again intact as in the previous flight, Donlong once again opened up the materials bay on the slow descent towards another shameful landing. This time the Artemis was over land, and it was hoped the craft could be saved due to the fragile, but glue reinforced landing struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne initial impact in the hills of Kerbin, the capsule bounce once before rolling onto it\u0027s side, crew hatch facing the ground, trapping poor Donlong inside! But the module was intact...including the Emergency Abort System boosters! Donlong, overcome with a bout of claustrophobia, tampered with the wiring and was able to fire a single EAS booster, flipping the entire module onto it\u0027s nose, where is proceeded to spin and dance until finally landing back down on it\u0027s side, this time with the crew hatch facing the magnificent blue sky. When rescue crews arrived, Donlong was sitting on his capsule, soil sample in hand, eating a Krunch Bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers at Delta-G decided to scrap the Artemis I in it\u0027s entirety and start from scratch on a new Mun capable craft.

It was devised to put a RADAR altimetry satellite in polar orbit and begin a low resolution mapping of the Kerbin surface. When enough data has been compiled, Delta Galactic would transfer the data to their sister company Delta Directions\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AE, a start-up venture with the goal of providing maps to would be adventurers under the brand name Hermes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2. Hermes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 is being marketed as the defacto mapping solution for anyone wanting to get around on Kerbin. To bypass the funding stage, Hermes was rolled into the Geomancer Project. The need for janitorial services for a new office was decided to be too costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hermes I spacecraft is the first in a series of unmanned mapping and survey satellites, and is launched on top of the Odyssey II light launch vehicle. The long term portion of the mission is achievable due to advances in sun stealing and converting technology -\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2Solar\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 power.

For several days Delta Galactic Probe Control just watched with fascination as Hermes began sending back mapping data.
