The program becomes unresponsive and I have to force-quit from it and restart the game. Luckily, it seems to be saving its state properly before going off to never-never land, so everything is where I left it before the hang-up. But the frequent restarts are making the game much less fun to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping that the upgrade from 0.23.5 to 0.25 would eliminate this, but it has not.

I\u0027m pretty sure that it doesn\u0027t have anything to do with me upgrading to Mac OS 10.9 (which I did shortly after the upgrade to 0.23.5) because the game freezes were hapening before then (they just hadn\u0027t gotten so annoying yet).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T19:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had the same bug and I\u0027ve been using OS-X 10.9 since release, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that.

I ran into other random serious bugs when a space station wiggled and shook itself apart after an undocking, and one time when wing parts suddenly popped off of a spaceplane Jeb was testing...then the program crashed before Jeb did. But I haven\u0027t been able to make these bugs repeatable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD seriously needs to do some debugging and optimizing. But enough of this.

So today is essentially a tutorial about how to maneuver between the Joolian moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first maneuver, plotted below, shows the escape of Aldner and Nelemy from Tylo. It takes a fair bit of delta-V to get away from massive Tylo, and once you get out of its S.O.I. you end up being flung further out than you might like. But the important point here is that the new orbit was adjusted to intersect with Bop\u0027s orbit at the Descending Node (on the left...either node would be fine). Kerbal Alarm Clock was used to determine when to transfer...but it doesn\u0027t do great when predicting transfers to Bop\u0027s elliptical and inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p8gGk0W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p8gGk0W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the \u0022Grey Haven Express\u0022 nears the end of it 757 m/s burn to escape Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xD6FM77.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xD6FM77.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ship reaches the orbit node, it needs to do a plane shift burn. Aldner also included hefty retrograde and radial-inward components to the burn to get an encounter with Bop (at the new node point where the ship\u0027s path next intersects Bop\u0027s orbit. I guess K.A.C. wasn\u0027t too bad at predicting a good transfer time, since the encounter will be about 180 degrees away from where the boys left Tylo. Note that the Precise Node mod now color codes the burn components (with the same colors as the respective handles on the maneuver node). Also, instead of \u002B and - buttons to increment values, it now has \u002B/- buttons that you left-click to increase values and right-click to decrease values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bDPFA2f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bDPFA2f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombining the components of the plane-shift and encounter-targeting burn gets the job done with 550 m/s of delta-V.

The rear tugs needed to be docked on rotated 30 degrees (instead of the normal 90 degrees used with most double tugs) in order to fit in the tight spacing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5qgnfg2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225qgnfg2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Aldner had Nelemy EVA over to the Bop Fido (the game lets me just transfer...but that\u0027s just silly when they aren\u0027t connected in a reasonable way for transfer) and separate the Fido (plus an empty tank mounted under it). This allowed Aldner to separate their Tylo Station Hab Module and move it over to the strong Senior port.

It was then time to bring Emilynn and Hellou over to Bop. Emilynn\u0027s first maneuver was much more efficient than Aldner\u0027s...first, because it takes less delta-V to leave Vall...and, second, because her Vall escape trajectory happened to have a Tylo encounter, which could be adjusted to give a gravity assist to send the Vall Ship out to Bop\u0027s orbit (adjusted to touch Bop\u0027s orbit at the ascending node with Bop set as target), all for a mere 206 m/s of delta-V.

Nelemy passed out the best snacks, but Hellou was more interested in what hair-care products had been packed onboard. Aldner presented Hellou with her book, safe and sound.

They took care of some final rearranging of Bop Station at that time: Aldner and Nelemy separated the Fido and the Bop Base Lander from the double-tug-adapter so that Emilynn could move the Vall Ship\u0027s Hab Module to the Senior docking port there. Then Aldner separated the Bop Base Lander and passed remote control of that module to Emilynn so that she could dock it to the standard port on top of the Vall Hab. And, finally, Aldner and Nelemy moved away in the Fido.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w2KwIun.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w2KwIun.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner activated the two 48-7S engines of the Bop Fido, then fired a retro burn to target them for an equatorial landing near 130 degrees West longitude. After the retro burn, the empty X200-8 Fuel Tank was released so that it would crash onto the surface (this tank was no longer needed on the Bop Station ship, and was taking up valuable docking port space, so this was their way of eliminating it without it becoming space debris).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dsq2EAi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dsq2EAi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing site turned out to be on a slope, but Aldner set the Fido down gently with no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0nYs69a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220nYs69a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing, the Fido had almost 69% of its propellant left. The remaining propellant is enough that the rover could do long distance hops, if desired, and could easily return the boys to orbit if needed. Nelemy got out to plant a flag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022So how\u0027s it look out there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dark and dreary.

Your name has been noted. You guys drive carefully now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gH2snKf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gH2snKf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, driving on Bop proved to take some getting used to. The rover has eight ruggedized wheels, since the older wheels I normally use wouldn\u0027t be able to get traction in Bop\u0027s low gravity. The ruggedized wheels do get some traction, but response is slow...except when you brake: The the wheels grab the ground and try to flip the rover if you have any kind of speed at all. Happily, in Bop\u0027s low gravity, you have a fair amount of time to respond, and the reaction wheel torque from the cockpit and lander can are plenty to quickly correct your attitude while in the \u0027air\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the brakes are right out (except under 0.5 m/s, or maybe in very short taps of the B key). To slow down, use reverse (I have my rover controls mapped to the i,j,k,l keys). But the ruggedized wheels can also suddenly snag the ground without warning and try to flip the rover, even with the SAS on (which I highly recommend)...so driving requires one hand on the rover keys, and the other hand ready on the attitude control keys to quickly re-align the rover during unexpected hops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA speed of 10 m/s is probably a safe maximum speed. It also controls well at 2X physics warp at that speed. Even then, the rover does spend a lot of time \u0022flying\u0022 over even small bumps. After a little practice, Aldner and Nelemy seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The Bop Fido does have RCS installed that is strong enough in Bop\u0027s weak gravity to right the rover if it does get flipped, unofficial tests have shown.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9nZT9FN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229nZT9FN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner found some mostly-level ground after a downhill drive of 5.8 kilometers. The boys stopped for some rock samples, and Nelemy found out that dark and spooky as Bop is, it sure is a heck of a lot of fun to fly aound on with your rocket pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude, I forgot how much fun low-G worlds are!

So I\u0027ve been doing some of that instead of exploring the Jool system. In the case of version 0.25, the new Mk2 spaceplane parts beckoned to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf particular interest to me was the new Shock Cone Intake. Especially since I read some forum messages that indicated that the Ram Air Intake will eventually be removed from the game, and the shock cone intake is its replacement. I imagine this will be quite the surprise to any kerbal using a BirdDog when the intakes of his plane suddenly have a different shape that he remembers...but they\u0027ve survived such things before with a minimum of befuddlement. Or maybe I should send out a payload to Laythe containing some upgrade parts that the kerbals on Laythe can install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specs for the shock cone intake looked very good. So the boys at KSC decided to test them out by revamping the design of the reusable SSTO Crew Carrier rocket that can carry eight kerbals to orbit. Tests indicated that just six of the new intakes would be enough (replacing 12 of the old intakes), and the tankage was rearranged to make the ship more compact and aerodynamic (see below). The six RAPIER engines are set to manual switching mode in the VAB, and action group 1 toggles the RAPIERS between air-breathing and closed cycle (rocket) mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OOqlHk3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OOqlHk3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman and Dilger Kerman conducted the test flights of the design. The flight profile was similar to that of the older version: The SAS was activated, the RAPIERs were toggled into air-breathing mode, the throttle was set to maximum (the handy Z key max-throttle implementation is great), and a press of the spacebar fired up the RAPIERs. After spool-up, the ship slowly lifted and the leading legs were raised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 5,000 meters, Jeb tilted the ship 10 degrees East. At 10,000 meters, the tilt was increased to 20 degrees from vertical...then at 15,000 meters it was pitched to 30 degrees from vertical. By this point that ship\u0027s flight path was more than 45 degrees from vertical, just as expected, so that it could be picking up some horizontal velocity. At 20,000 meters the ship was tilted all the way to the current location of the prograde marker (about 25 degrees from horizontal) to get the best amount of air intake for this relatively brief phase before flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlameout occurred a little over 24,000 meters at over 730 m/s, and the RAPIERs were toggled to closed-cycle mode and the ship was pitched back up to 45 degrees for the rest of the burn. When the apoapsis was over 120 km (the target altitude), the engines were to be cut off. Jeb had a little trouble with the new full-throttle key and accidentally ran the apoapsis up over 140 km before finding the correct cutoff key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lkvCTV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222lkvCTV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was already pretty high, so drag losses did not cause the apoapsis to drop too much during the coast to apoapsis. At apoapsis, Jeb fired the RAPIERs to raise the periapsis to 90 km...and they were in SPAAAACE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe image below shows the delta-V stats for the SSTO Crew Carrier 6d after reaching the 144 by 90 km orbit. Almost 800 m/s of delta-V remained...plenty for orbital maneuvers and for return to KSC for a powered landing, which Jeb took care of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UXysu7A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UXysu7A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use these SSTO rockets just as crew transport, but it occurred to me that it could also be used for lifting moderately-small payloads into orbit. The SSTO Cargo Carrier shown below is the result. The cargo in this case is a space station module that masses a little over 6 tons. This payload can be used as a small independent space station...but for this mission it would be lifted to the main Space Station in Kerbin orbit to be added to its structure. The payload has two hab modules, two gigantor solar arrays for power, and an RCS system for stability and orbit control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R3EuZtV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R3EuZtV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTO Crew Carrier uses the same flight profile outlined above for the Crew Carrier version, except that the aerodynamic nose cone is jettisoned after the transition to rocket mode of the RAPIERs.

So a 10-kerbal SSTO spaceplane was also built and tested...initially by Jebediah (with his amazing ability to survive any crash...or at least show up later), and later by Ludger Kerman and Bobgan Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane is powered by two turbojet engines and has two shock cone air intakes. I initially tried using a Mk2 Bicoupler to mount the two turbojets on the end of the fuselage, but the engines gave unbalanced power at high altitude when air was getting scarce. I was informed that this was caused by adding the engines one at a time instead of in symmetric pairs (I had indeed added them one at a time), but even when I rebuilt the plane with symmetric attachment of the turbojets and intakes, I STILL got the unbalanced power at high altitudes. I think the Bicoupler doesn\u0027t like me. So I went with the double side-pod arrangement shown below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor propellants, the plane has one Mk2 Liquid Fuel Fuselage Short (300 units liquid fuel), a Mk2 to 1.25m Adapter (135 units fuel, 165 units oxidizer), and two FL-T100 Fuel Tanks in the side pods (45 fuel and 55 oxidizer each).

Ludger and Bobgan Kerman would pilot the spaceplane. Rodgan Kerman was named to command the Space Station, and he would be joined by Dilger Kerman and two raw recruits: Gilwise and Macbo Kerman. In the VIP crew cabin, Jebediah Kerman, Bill Kerman, and Bob Kerman would be riding along, and they would be joined by Kelby Kerman (first kerbal to walk on Duna...and recently returning to astronaut duty after getting a Ph.D. in Extrakerbinal Geology). No pressure here, Ludger and Bobgan...but that\u0027s most of the astronaut corps currently on Kerbin (and its three bigwigs) riding on your piloting skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p6hzCpW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p6hzCpW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith full throttle on the turbojets, the Passenger Pigeon began to lift its nose at 110 ms, and lifted off at 120 m/s speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DZlrj7t.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DZlrj7t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial climb was done at a steep angle of around 40 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YXmtVXI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YXmtVXI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudger leveled of the rapid climb to a shallow climb at 25,000 meters.

But at the first sign of flameout, action groups were be used to switch on the rocket motors, the plane was pitched up to 45 degrees, and the push the orbit was made. When the apoapsis got to 140 km, the rockets were cut off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w2MdS30.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w2MdS30.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane was still pretty low, so occasional bursts of rocket power were used when the apoapsis fell below 120 km (the altitude of the Space Station).

I had found the autopilot to be of limited usefulness on Laythe, but that was mostly because the old-style rover wheels I was using there could not go straight up steep hills (not enough grip), which the autopilot tries to do...so I had to manually do contour driving instead. And, when going downhill, the autopilot would let my old-style-wheel rover go too fast, since it did not use the brakes for slowing...apparently trying to slow using wheel speed control only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my Bop Fido, which uses the much grippier ruggedized wheels, the MechJeb Rover Autopilot works very well. The Fido can climb straight up steep hills, and the wheel speed control can prevent its downhill velocity from running away. The most important feature, however, is the Stability Control check box. When the rover hits those inevitable ground-snag bugs and gets flipped up into the \u0027air,\u0027 the Stability Control quickly gets the rover leveled out for when it lands. That\u0027s wonderful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Emilynn pilots the rover up the rim surrounding Goblin Crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9xPpQxD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229xPpQxD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUneven or angled terrain is no problem for the autopilot.

I used the opportunity to study the motion of Jool in the sky from Goblin Point. The sequence below of Jool rising and reaching its highest point took about two Earth days. When Jool was rising, Bop was passing through the periapsis point of its orbit. It moves fastest there, and its rotation rate can\u0027t keep up to make Jool sit in one spot, so Jool drifts eastward across the sky at that time. The fact that this was happening around sunset time at Goblin Pit just depended on where the Jool system was located in its orbit around Kerbol; when Jool is in other parts of its orbit, this wobble will be seen when Kerbol is elsewhere in the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i1S1hph.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i1S1hph.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next part of the Fido\u0027s drive, Aldner and Nelemy were again in the rover while Hellou and Emilynn remained with the Lander Base.

Dansen was joined in the control module by Lembart Kerman, while the scientist-astronauts Tomster and Henry were below in the Hitchhiker module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heat shield and the triple-tug adapter are one unit, so those parts will be deorbited along with the Base and dropped as debris. The three Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tanks were empty except for the small amount of fuel needed for retro burn in the center tank. Thompbles provided a landing vector that would bring the ship in to the South of the facilities already on the surface, just to be sure the heat shield debris wouldn\u0027t hit anything valuable. The retro burn by the four 24-77 engines was perfectly on target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RGNNv2L.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RGNNv2L.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the entry flames dissipated, the heat shield assembly was dropped at 7,400 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kZROxAX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kZROxAX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo drogue chutes slowed the Base 5 module, and then the eight main parachutes were deployed in reefed condition.

The four landing legs were deployed to take the brunt of the landing force to protect the wheels...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UJx8VXh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UJx8VXh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but three of the wheels blew on landing, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6SdjcNM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226SdjcNM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of the wheels were actually damaged, so Dansen Kerman (who had been the first kerbal to land on Laythe, many years ago...and the kerbal whom Dansen Island is named after) somewhat unceremoniously set foot upon the surface of Laythe for a second time...so that he could fix some flat tires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dh8T2qN.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Dh8T2qN.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the wheels fixed, Dansen retracted the landing legs and started driving the Laythe Base 5 vehicle East along the surface.

Just a few of the angled panels exploded.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDansen: \u0022Those tanks might come in handy.

Dansen lined up the docking ports in preparation for linking the two Base modules together so that they could share consumables. The two landing legs on one end of Base 2 had to be raised to bring its docking port down a little to the same level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cpWIVGY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cpWIVGY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took multiple attempts to get the approach just right. And when the bases finally did dock, there was a strange jerk that caused the two far wheels of Base 5 to blow. Huh. The landing legs were lowered to firmly stabilize the modules, and Dansen again got out to fix the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EE33pXj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EE33pXj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew spent a couple hours unpacking the boxes of supplies that filled most of the open space in the two side hab modules of Base 5 (hauling them out to the two sheds behind the Base). Then they lined up for a group photo of ten kerbals on the surface of Laythe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft: Tomster, Henry, Corfrey, and Commander Nedmy. Center: Thompbles and Kurt.
