Moving the rig forward.\u0022 A flick of the wrist in the cabin of the Dres Shadow and the mining rig in the void beyond its windows moved towards the spinning pebble in front of it. \u002220 meters.\u0022 Its operator, one Engineer by the name of Shellan Kerman, watched his monitors patiently as the large rig lumbered towards the slowly spinning rock. \u0022What\u0027d we do to be condemned to this gig cap\u0027n?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Condemned?

Condemned he says. Tin can he calls it.\u0022 Shelzan Kerman, more affectionately known as Z, who had spent most of their years at Dres asleep, head buried inside his headphones. He snorted a response and twisted sleepily away, returning to his slumber. \u0022See, Z\u0027s not complaining so it can\u0027t be that bad. We just gotta finish this tanker, program it to fly to Jool, and the we head back to Kerbin. That\u0027s it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, ok, fine, whatever, final approach, call the pressers. Looks like we\u0027ve a good flat-like spot coming round, praying the claw holds and the stones don\u0027t scatter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir chosen asteroid was one of the many orbiting high above the dark world of Dres, in a ring better known as the Dresteroid Belt. Most believed the rubble cloud to be fragments of a small moon, as the debris was in a very clean 20,000km orbit, though a few others suggested it was kicked out when the scar was gouged across Dres\u0027 surface. All Shellan knew was these rocks were full of ice and ores, and perfect for being chewed up and turned into propellent. Propellent desperately needed by their Forgotten Space Program. Propellent they themselves would need to get back home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Dres Shadow was an old ship, built and launched in the earliest days of interplanetary exploration. As its name implied, it was built to travel to the tiny speck it now orbited, though its original crew had never taken it beyond Kerbin. Meanwhile its larger sister ship, the Jool Jester, had been the first to take kerbals to the like-named jolly green gas giant. Two slightly smaller ships, the Eve Gambit and the Duna Dragon, had also been to their respective targets. Only the Dres Shadow had remained unused, forgotten, moored to its fueling depot high above Kerbin until some stranded kerbal had stumbled upon it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany years later and all four ships had been rebuilt and reconditioned by the Forgotten Space Program. New control electronics were installed, including flight computers. Some of the fuel tanks were retrofitted to hold only liquid fuel (the preferred beverage of the LV-N), while the larger assemblies had their oxidizer tanks sealed until a heavier rebuild could be completed. Simply swapping out the smaller tanks and adding thermal control systems was enough to return the four to their desired delta-v capabilities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mining rig they were presently attaching to an asteroid was likewise a lucky find. Launched some decades previous as a piece of test equipment, one of their scouts had stumbled on it in Kerbin orbit and immediately realized its importance. A tug was hastily rigged\u00A0to fire it out to Dres, and there it had scratched out its living ever since. When fuel reserves in the greater fleet were running low a crew would be dispatched on a decade-long mission to refuel tankers and send them to Duna or Jool. This time Gregory, Shellan, and Z were the lucky three, and had scored an extra-long thirteen year mission. Their promised reward was a return to Kerbin, a home none had seen for many, many years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0005_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0005_z.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Five meters. Drill areas ahead of the target lights look good. Bringing it in for a hard clawing.\u0022 The rig shuddered as its Claw bit into the rubble. \u0022Contact, firm grasp, using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to stabilize.

At least enough to fill this last tanker.\u0022 Gregory pushed at his pilot again, shaking him awake. \u0022Z, move the Shadow in to dock with the rig. Shellan, get suited up. You\u0027ll need to inspect the anchor site before we bring the tanker in and start drilling.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0012_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0012_z.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir new quarry was between the ship and the Sun, making for a dark and foreboding scene. Z grumbled something about \u0022Evil tings that sleep in the dark,\u0022 but Gregory was having none of it. A few minutes later and the Dres Shadow was safely docked, despite all the doom and gloom coming from the rest of the crew. Doom and gloom and a bit of laziness, a bad trait they had all picked up from this miserable planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShellan was already outside and inspecting the drill site, Z had dozed off almost as soon as the ship was docked. It was cold and dark in the void, and Shellan could feel his very skin crawling. Or was it the MAG he was wearing inside the suit? Why was he always the one that had to go out? \u0027Shellan, inspect this spooky-looking wreck,\u0027 or \u0027Shellan, crawl into this dangerous looking hole.\u0027 Well, when they got back to Kerbin he\u0027d never crawl into any dark places ever again, so help him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then something glinted in the dark, and shadows moved across nothingness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0015_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0015_z.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Say, cap\u0027n, you picking any other ships up on radar?

This was something else.\u0022 Shellan finished his inspection in silence, turning around occasionally to check over his shoulder. Wasting precious fuel. There was something out there, he knew it. They should find another rock. Or just go home or....\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dres be a cursed place!\u0022\u00A0Suddenly Z was cursing\u00A0and spitting\u00A0into the radio.

Words spoken by Shelzan Kerman at 4 hours, 13 minutes, 29 seconds on the 23rd day of the 100th year.\u0022 Gregory grinned at his pilot, who glared back angrily. Their strangely imbalanced\u00A0staring match was broken up a few seconds later by Shellan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0018_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0018_z.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s really a bit dark out here you know.

Small bits of debris were kicked up, forming an ever-spreading cloud around the drill site. Shellan pulled back and watched as the drills went to work. This asteroid was definitely a rubble pile, but didn\u0027t seem to be anything the mining equipment couldn\u0027t handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, it was unusual for so much junk to be kicked up just by inserting the drills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0028_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022556\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0028_z.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, you\u0027re drilling right through the rock now. Shut off the drills. Have Z move the tanker in, I\u0027m headed back.... Wait.\u0022 Shellan spun around quickly and scanned the sky. A few pieces of debris were silhouetted against the Sun. Just small black dots, likely nothing more than rocks kicked free of the far side of the asteroid. Such a strange rock. \u0022Cap\u0027n.

I\u0027m headed to the lower airlock.\u0022 Dres was a dark place, darker than Jool for some reason. Dark places played dark tricks on the mind. He noticed the tanker was looming ever larger, and made his way hastily to the Dres Shadow\u0027s lower cabin and its airlock. He was inside and out of his EVA suit faster than he could ever remember a kerbal doing so. He almost wished his old instructor was there with a stopwatch. Surely he\u0027d just set a record.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160926_ksp0039_z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160926_ksp0039_z.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship had picked up a nasty vibration from their quarry, the ghosts of its rather persistent rotation kicking at the metal beasts that had halted it. Shellan had just slipped out of his EVA suit when Z brought the tanker in, bumping it roughly into place. The added mass helped to dampen the vibrations, or perhaps it was the added vibrations from the hard docking, but\u00A0a quiet\u00A0moment\u00A0descended on the ship. Life at Dres was peaceful once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the drills fired up, the refinery was running full blast, and Shellan was wishing he had a set of headphones like Z. Big, heavy, thick, enough to drown out the universe. A universe that had suddenly become rather loud, shaky, and bumpy. And loud. How could it be so loud in space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThud. Bump. Thud. Ding. Bing. Thud. Occasionally a heavy bump. Rocks kicked off from the drills, rejecting their bite.

A storm was moving in from the northeast, its rain falling peacefully on Green Plains. Life was always so tranquil here in the north, the land seemingly untouched by the hands of kerbals or the hands of time. Life continued here as it always had, peacefully and quietly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same could not be said for the eyes observing from on high, as the years had done nothing but change Jonbald. So many worlds had flashed before these eyes since they had seen this simple beauty. So many horrors since he fled the serenity of the Monastery at North Mountain. Eyes ever changing until the day they would close forever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow different would his life be today had he stayed at the mountain? Had he not gotten involved? When he arrived he was just another forgotten kerbal. When he left, he was ready to change the world. And yet there was a nagging sensation that, had he stayed, nothing would be different. He would still be just another spacekerb, cast aside and forgotten. Many of his friends would still be missing. Still be dead. No, the quiet life was never meant for him. He would ever fix the world or die trying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s what brought him back to North Mountain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160726_ksp0165_jonbald.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160726_ksp0165_jonbald.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, not literally. It was really an old research jet that had brought him back to North Mountain. He was pleased to find it\u00A0was still working after so many years buried in the snow and covered by a tarp. It had died those many munths, so many years ago, engines starved of oxygen as Jebediah foolishly flew it to the North Pole, only to be resurrected and then buried by Jonbald and a few of his friends. This simple aircraft\u00A0had outlived most of them despite having died twice. And for that he was happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe approach to North Mountain from the air was not easy, but he knew it well. Fly in from the east towards the twin mountains. Turn slowly south until you\u0027re flying towards the gap in the wall. Drop into the valley, dive, flare, brake, pray. He\u0027d only landed here twice before, the other times, the first time, he had walked in. As the monks preferred.

It would\u0027ve been a good place to build a fortress, too, had kerbals been the warlike types. A pleasant valley, buried deep within a seemingly impassible circle of mountains. Peaceful, quiet, far from the life most kerbals would choose to live. Ample farmlands and pure water, enough to sustain a small population of kerbals indefinitely. A pleasant wind blew into the valley, a secret valley that hid in plain sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd oh what a secret it held.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald brought the jet down roughly, bouncing off of the uneven terrain. Thump. Bump. Ding. Noises scratched across the bottom of his cabin, grasses and small pebbles kicked up by his violent arrival.\u00A0He hit the thrust reverser on the jet and laid on the brakes, hoping the plane would stop in time. It did. Now safely at a coasting speed, he taxied around the landing green and moved towards the monastery\u0027s hidden entrance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn old friend was already waiting for him, snacks and drinks in hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchibald Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the few kerbals left who was nearly as old as\u00A0himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160726_ksp0184_jonbald.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160726_ksp0184_jonbald.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160726_ksp0185_jonbald.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160726_ksp0185_jonbald.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My friend!

Anyway, enough about the horrors, you\u0027ve come to see the monolith, yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, no. Not really.

A new space program had sprung up down at the Cape, and he was organizing a council to run it. Seven kerbals, three of their own and four from this\u00A0new agency. He laid out Rosuki\u0027s plans, The Plan, his own thoughts on moving kerbals off-world, and how this new council needed a level-headed kerbal such as Archibald to help guide it. His old friend was agreeing with everything he said, every step of the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so he was a bit surprised when Archibald suggested a better candidate. Munlin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Munlin? The simpleton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Munlin, though he is no simpleton. Munlin sees the universe as a wonder to be explored, not an object to be conquered and controlled. He knows what it is to be stranded out there,\u0022 Archibald pointed upwards randomly, \u0022alone with no idea or hope of rescue.\u00A0He\u0027s exactly the type of kerbal your council needs. Look to the failures of Buring and Harler. Or to Enwise, and the tremendous damage he caused and may still be causing. The more you try to control this mess the worse it gets.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except Harler was right. The autonomous spacecraft have saved lives and saved resources. There\u0027s no way we\u0027d have made it as far as we did in the last cycle if....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchibald raised his hands to stop Jonbald. \u0022Just talk to Munlin. He\u0027s at Sky\u0027s Reach, not far from the place the new locals call Baikerbanur. I\u0027ll have him come to the Cape. Anyway, night is coming and fast. You\u0027re welcome as always to stay, wash up, change your flight suit. Everything of ours is yours. Yet you must visit the monolith. It\u0027s just a short hike. Then you can see what\u0027s happened.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Something bad?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Something wonderful.
