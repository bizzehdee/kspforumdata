Designed the ship. Got it to the Mun. And \u0022sorta\u0022 landed. Even with lights I couldn\u0027t see ground until 20 meters above the ground according to KER. Well at that close I was able to abort 3 times after noticing I was about to land on a 45 degree \u002B slope. My 4th attempt looked good, so I went for it and even though my wide base my lander still flipped over. Well I thought it was stable, so said hell, lets do some EVA, thinking \u0022I can figure out a way to upright this vessel.\u0022 Well I EVA and I\u0027m holding onto the ladder and I say to myself the ground looks funny but its SOOOO dark,, just has to be a texture thing. Have my kerbal release and woosh.. I didn\u0027t realize my craft was sliding down a mountain,lol. (wish I had screen shots of it). I see my lander fly away from me down a mountain (guess I didn\u0027t realize the slope) I start chasing and it settles after only breaking one landing leg of 6. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get to the ship, one leg gone,, ok I can deal with that. I decide to do science cause THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO GET HOME!!!! I do an F5 just cause I know a lot of attempts with a sideways craft will end in disaster. First I try torque and RCS to turn my craft with minimal thrust pointing uphill. KABOOM!!!!. Tried the same going downhill. KABOOM!!! Tried combinations of speed and direction with landing gear up or down and all were KABOOM!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight as I was about to give up, I said, ughh,, well since I play with TAC life support maybe I can do a rescue mission. Lets open the solar panels so I can at least get this fine brave kerbal some heat in what may be his last fine hours and extend his chance of being rescued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell what happened was this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/3281181583578401234/5D659F1137B60857BAA419A974D385A729A6C4AE/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/3281181583578401234/5D659F1137B60857BAA419A974D385A729A6C4AE/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was before solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3281181583578403759/4DA92815836A9008DB7649A184007F206EFD680D/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3281181583578403759/4DA92815836A9008DB7649A184007F206EFD680D/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell having the solar panels out it raised the direction I was pointing JUST enough over the horizon so with RCS and torque I was able to take off from the mun and gain some altitude and make and orbit then burn back home.
