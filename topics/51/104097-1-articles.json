Can you please upload the normal screenshots too so people can check fuel consumption too?\n\nThanks!\n\nI took screenshots exclusively with Alt-F12. While I do have the full-screen, original images, I would be very sorry if the pictures above didn\u0027t give you a very full idea, especially for Laythe and Tylo. Just to double-down on the most difficult missions, here are full-screens for the first two landings on both.\n\nLaythe, first landing\n\n[![5117full28c-Laythe-landing.jpg](http://hostingd.imagecross.com/image-hosting-th-07/5117full28c-Laythe-landing.jpg)](http://www.imagecross.com/d/image-hosting-view-07.php?id=5117full28c-Laythe-landing.jpg) Click Image to Enlarge [Image Hosting](http://www.imagecross.com/)\n\nLaythe, reorbit\n\n[![3874full31reorbit.jpg](http://hostingd.imagecross.com/image-hosting-th-07/3874full31reorbit.jpg)](http://www.imagecross.com/d/image-hosting-view-07.php?id=3874full31reorbit.jpg) Click Image to Enlarge [Image Hosting](http://www.imagecross.com/)\n\nTylo, shortly after separation from Atrytone\n\n[![2644full55a-tylo-landing.jpg](http://hostingd.imagecross.com/image-hosting-th-07/2644full55a-tylo-landing.jpg)](http://www.imagecross.com/d/image-hosting-view-07.php?id=2644full55a-tylo-landing.jpg) Click Image to Enlarge [Image Hosting](http://www.imagecross.com/)\n\nTylo, landed, fuel status\n\n[![1840full55b-tylo-landing.jpg](http://hostingd.imagecross.com/image-hosting-th-07/1840full55b-tylo-landing.jpg)](http://www.imagecross.com/d/image-hosting-view-07.php?id=1840full55b-tylo-landing.jpg) Click Image to Enlarge [Image Hosting](http://www.imagecross.com/)\n\nTylo, about to re dock with the Atrytone\n\n[![3652full31reorbit.jpg](http://hostingd.imagecross.com/image-hosting-th-07/3652full31reorbit.jpg)](http://www.imagecross.com/d/image-hosting-view-07.php?id=3652full31reorbit.jpg) Click Image to Enlarge [Image Hosting](http://www.imagecross.com/)\n\nIf there are any other part of the sequence where doubt might be entertained, I\u0027ll provide the relevant images. However, I do not wish to dump everything into an imgur folder. I think that interface is crap for story-telling, and telling a story is why I participated in the challenge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T16:24:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dawnstar**"},{"CreatedByName":"parzr","CreatedById":115059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T21:46:00Z","Content":"Your mission looks cool and your report is fun to read, but there really isn\u0027t enough info to verify your fuel consumption."},{"CreatedByName":"HANNIBALLA","CreatedById":129997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T02:43:08Z","Content":"That was a very interesting mission report. Loved the ship and the images. Although there\u0027s some gaps in your fuel/dv info, it appears legit. According to the Dv map, and using the difference between landing and orbital stats, you had enough fuel for all burns that had enough stats to do the math on. So in my modest opinion, this is a successful Jool 5!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziv","CreatedById":91995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T00:25:57Z","Content":"Hey Dawnstar, pretty cool mission and story but I have to check your fuel consumption throughout your mission to see if you progressed as it is in the pictures.\n\nSo I mean fuel levels for your main ship, and when and how you refueled from your main ship (if you did), etc... if you just upload all your mission pictures into an imgur album without any additional text will do well.\n\nIt\u0027s good if you have your fuel levels window opened but not necessary - in other missions I already recognized cheating on the small fuel indicators on the left side too! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThis is important because hyperediting the different ships into different orbits or magically refueling them is easy. But JOOL-5 is a hard challenge and the badge can only be earned if it was done as a real space mission.\n\nSo if you can\u0027t provide those pictures then I can\u0027t accept this mission!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziv","CreatedById":91995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:05:51Z","Content":"hm, your pictures disappeared, do you know that?"}]}
