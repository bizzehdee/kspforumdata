The part you seem to be having trouble with is the braking burn when you get there. If you don\u0027t do this, you\u0027ll slingshot around Mun (or just smash into it) and end up orbiting Kerbol. What you do is burn out towards Mun like you\u0027ve been doing to come that close. Then, wait until you fall under Mun\u0027s influence. You can tell this on the map view as the point where your path changes color from blue to orange near Mun. So just time accel until you get there. Once you cross that color-change point, go to 1x time accel and find your Munar periapsis point. Set up a maneuver node there to burn retrograde. As you drag the node\u0027s retrograde vector around, you\u0027ll see your future path change from a parabola out to orbit the sun into a circle around Mun. Tweak this until it\u0027s at the desired orbital altitude. Then point your ship at the blue target on the nav ball and time accel to just before the burn. When doing the burn, watch in the map view as your path changes. When the blue of your actual path merges with the orange dotted line of the maneuver node, kill the engine. Now you\u0027re in a stable Munar orbit and can go from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
