I can just imagine myself taking off, going into space, floating around the cabin for a few minutes, looking at the universe, seeing how tiny everything is. I can imagine being the first Kerbal on the Mun. I can imagine travelling to the big green thing in the night sky, with little things going around it. It\u0027s funny, really, how we rotate around Kerbol, the Mun rotates around us, Minmus rotates around the Mun (I think), and then the green thing also rotates around Kerbol, and things rotate around it, and those things have things that rotate around those things an-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYear 1, Day 2. \u0027Studying\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t finish what I was writing last night, as I fell asleep. As I was saying, the things that rotate around the big green thing, have things that rotate around them as well. Now my brain\u0027s starting to hurt...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYear 1. Day 285. \u0027Studying, but better\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made it! I put my application in at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E about a month ago, and after evaluation, it\u0027s been accepted! I\u0027m going to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E for \u0027basic training\u0027. I\u0027ll have a lot of work ahead of me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
