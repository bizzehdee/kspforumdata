Some of you might remember me from some of my previous mission report series but for those who don\u0027t, I\u0027m Stephen and this is On the Shoulders of Giants. Before we get into the thick of things I just want to give a shoutout to everyone and everything that allowed me to build, fly and write this series. To the outstanding mod makers who are the engine behind this game, to the poor stand-up guys who read my drafts, to Squad, to the writers who continue to inspire me every day, to the people who helped me troubleshoot my install, and to all the mad lads coming up with wild ideas in the space program, I say thank you to all. None of the things I\u0027ve done would be possible without y\u0027all and I dedicate this to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, soppy stuff over, welcome to On the Shoulders of Giants! Like I said I\u0027m Stephen and in this series we\u0027re going to be looking at the transition between the first generation of reusable launch vehicles and the second generation, as well as anything beyond, in a JNSQ 1.8.1 install. The overarching idea behind this series is, unlike previous series I\u0027ve done where we look at one or two launch systems, we\u0027re looking at several spread across the globe. Along with that, expect a few vignettes along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe full mod list can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/bXs6Toq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, and a special thanks to Zorg and his TUFX profiles that can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/188816-zorgs-screenshots-and-customised-visual-set-up/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, without further ado, I humbly present for your viewing and reading pleasure:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bZ7d6Pi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bZ7d6Pi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPROLOGUE:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022myyMkfH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/myyMkfH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe Space Transportation System Booster \u0022Enterprise\u0022 on the pad ready to liftoff on STS-161\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nThe Crew Chief could see a lot of long days and oceans of paperwork ahead of her. As the hangar door closed, the warm sunlight of the late afternoon was replaced by the cold halogen lights of the building. Three years with her leading the bird\u0027s sprawling hangar gang and not a single hiccup. Until today. She chafed at the thought. She was grateful it was in mostly one piece, and she offered a silent toast to the pilots who brought her back on a wing and a prayer. As if on queue, the STS-161\u2019s booster commander and flight engineer walked over to her after surveying the damage for themselves up close.

She stepped outside and took a good long look across the Cape. Past the gaggle of press outside the hangar, out past the company launch pad, was the competition. Younger, meaner and leaner. Securing contracts that her team couldn\u2019t. She felt a breeze, and over the hills to the west she could see thunderheads.

Her future, a future with the Space Transportation System program, wasn\u2019t so sure anymore. Minutes and hours ticked by as she, consciously or not, weighed different implications for today\u2019s events. She decided that sleep was a fool\u2019s errand tonight and rolled out of bed and lumbered to the coffee pot, making a pit stop at the liquor cabinet on account of the late hour, and over to her desk. It might\u2019ve been paranoia, or good sense, but either way the Chief gave her resume a thorough update. As the first whispers of dawn started blotting out the stars she was satisfied and sat back in her chair, feeling sleep finally sneak up on her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore tucking in, for giggles, she took out her rolodex and looked up the contact information of NASA\u2019s chief astronaut she\u2019d met at an STS contractor symposium. Attaching her working life\u2019s story to the email she was confronted by a blank page asking to be filled.

STBE-C-052\u2019s massive liquid oxygen turbopump, the very heart of the engine, was dredged up from a depth of 500 meters. Despite the damage from impact and its weeks long bath in salt water, the picture was abundantly clear. Evidence of impact damage on the turbopump\u2019s casing pointed in the direction of FOD being ingested into the turbopump, damaging it and leading to the engine\u2019s ultimate catastrophic failure. Simulations run by General Rocketry, builder of the STBE and STOE engines on STS, confirmed that a 1mm piece of aluminum could lead to a massive failure of the machine. Inspections done on the inside of Enterprise\u2019s oxygen tank revealed microcracking, as the craft\u2019s tanks had been cycled with cryogenic propellant over 40 times at this point in her long career. Out of an abundance of caution pending inspections of the rest of the STS booster fleet, the NASA Administrator announced a halt to all \u003Cem\u003ESpace Transportation System\u003C/em\u003E flights pending the final results and a fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nAs the investigation, and hope for a potential return to flight, dragged on from weeks to months the implications in the greater space ecosystem were drastic and far reaching. STS\u2019s domination of the commercial launch market, as well as being one of two man rated vehicles in the world at the time, meant that everything from commercial communications satellite launches to crewed orbital flight were affected. \u003Cem\u003EStarlab\u003C/em\u003E, the joint US, European and Japanese orbital outpost that like STS was ageing, had fortunately received the crew of Expedition 66 a month previous to STS-161 aboard the shuttle \u003Cem\u003EAphrodite\u003C/em\u003E. With a commercial resupply imminent, the crew of Expedition 66 agreed to extend their four month stay aboard \u003Cem\u003EStarlab \u003C/em\u003Eto seven months until their \u003Cem\u003ETsurumaru ECRV\u003C/em\u003E was due for replacement, at which point the station would be mothballed and abandoned pending STS and Shuttle return to flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222iDsL1Z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2iDsL1Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStarlab circa Expedition 2, the only time two Shuttles were docked to the station\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nBut while NASA fretted at the thought of abandoning their great orbital station, STS\u2019s competition on the commercial market was giddy with excitement. Although STS\u2019s massive size precluded it from reasonably lifting many of the payloads that made up the bulk of the commercial launch market, innovations like dual launching payloads meant that STS came to dominate the lucrative geostationary transfer orbit market. Across the ocean, the European MinerveSpace stood at the most complicated position. Although its fully expendable but technologically advanced \u003Cem\u003EMinerve 5\u003C/em\u003E rocket saw a notable uptick in bookings for its services, the joint European-American Poseidon shuttle which was the lynchpin for crew launches to \u003Cem\u003EStarlab \u003C/em\u003Ewas grounded along with STS. Additionally the institutional payloads which were \u003Cem\u003EMinerve 5\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es bread and butter were facing pressure as European governments fretted at the high cost to launch aboard the fully expendable system which featured advanced staged combustion hydrogen engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00228b9eYyA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8b9eYyA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe joint US-European Shuttle \u0022Aphrodite\u0022 returning the crew of Expedition 66 home from the recently abandoned Starlab.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nJapan\u2019s Hoshidoro Heavy Industries on the other hand was downright ecstatic. Its partially reusable \u003Cem\u003EJ-IIA \u003C/em\u003Eand\u003Cem\u003E J-IIB\u003C/em\u003E had seen a reasonable amount of success handling payloads on the lower end of STS\u2019s capability. The company pioneered the use of a recoverable engine pod that landed on parachutes as a cheap and effective method of cutting launch costs. Additionally despite the STS stand down Japan\u2019s \u003Cem\u003ETsurumaru ECRV\u003C/em\u003E and supply craft was still needed to support \u003Cem\u003EStarlab \u003C/em\u003Eand, should STS be grounded permanently, Japanese space planners quickly dusted off plans to man-rate the \u003Cem\u003EJ-IIB \u003C/em\u003Eand use \u003Cem\u003ETsurumaru \u003C/em\u003Eas the sole crew vehicle for \u003Cem\u003EStarlab\u003C/em\u003E. However, with Japan entering its second decade of economic stagnation, Hoshidoro still faced great difficulties capitalizing on its success compared to their European counterparts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nPerhaps the firm which was most neutral to the ramifications of STS-161 was the American private launch firm Starlift Launch Services. With the firm pioneering fully reusable spaceflight with its \u003Cem\u003EMark I \u003C/em\u003Elaunch vehicle, the vehicle\u2019s relatively limited payload capacity meant it came to dominate its own segment of the launch market: satellite constellations. Indeed, SLS was founded explicitly to launch the coming swarms of communications satellites cheaply and quickly, rapidly attracting funding and attention with its vertical landing booster and parachute recovered orbiters. However, the constellation contracts were not coming into the firm as quickly as had been anticipated and the firm relied on Commercial Starlab Resupply Service flights on its \u003Cem\u003EMark I\u003C/em\u003E to keep a steady cash flow. In turn this severely hampered the development of the firm\u2019s future, and highly ambitious, fully reusable launch vehicles to directly challenge STS\u2019s heavy lift domination.\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ePe6lrd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ePe6lrd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAn SLS Mark I Orbiter modified for pressurized cargo duties approaches Starlab on CSRS-Demo 1\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nAny potential work would have to wait.

Indeed for the first time since the old regime, Rosaviacosmos began the planning stages for an interplanetary probe. Christened \u003Cem\u003EAyk-Grunt\u003C/em\u003E, the mission aimed to continue a long tradition of robotic sample return missions pioneered by the \u003Cem\u003EM\u00FCna \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003EMinmuz\u003C/em\u003E missions of the 1970s. Planned to be launched by a \u003Cem\u003EZarya \u003C/em\u003Eheavy lifter to the Duna-Ike system the probe would then land on the surface of Ike, gather samples and perform observations of Dunan space, before launching a return capsule to be recovered back on Kerbin. As the Russians prepared their grand return to the fields of high energy cosmology and interplanetary exploration, elsewhere in the world other players were making their first forays into spaceflight beyond Kerbin\u2019s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nDespite its poor optimization for Beyond Low Kerbin Orbit missions, the extremely low price of a fully reusable Starlift \u003Cem\u003EMark I\u003C/em\u003E launch made it an attractive option for exploration missions within the Kerbin system. Having demonstrated solid reliability of its pioneering fully reusable vertical landing design, the \u003Cem\u003EMark I\u003C/em\u003E subsequently won the contract for the NASA/JPL \u003Cem\u003EMinmus Reconnaissance Orbiter \u003C/em\u003Eto help map in detail the surface of Kerbin\u2019s second moon and determine its value in future exploration programs. Minmus\u2019s weak gravity well precluded the need for a heavy satellite bus to delivery the vehicle to a low orbit around the moon, and in turn a heavy transfer stage, putting the total vehicle mass at the outer edge of capability for the Mark I. Starlift for their part began work on a proper interface between the STAR series solid transfer stage, and on the planned Extra-Extended Long Bay upgrade for its \u003Cem\u003EMark I \u003C/em\u003Eto accommodate the payload.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RVaTvgz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RVaTvgz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220bfQlm7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0bfQlm7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tNld4rt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tNld4rt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStarlift Launch Services makes its debut to the space exploration market.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nExploration beyond the confines of low Kerbin orbit continued throughout the year, with ESA following the MRO launch with the launch of their own \u003Cem\u003ECOsmic Microwave Background Observation Satellite \u003C/em\u003E(COMBOS) aboard a \u003Cem\u003EMinerve 52\u003C/em\u003E.

In addition, a firm retirement date for STS was set to no later than a decade away and that a replacement should be available to maintain American dominance of the launch industry. With the report in hand, the newly sworn in American administration wasted no time beginning their own review of the American space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the presidential review took place engineers from the Ortmann Company, MacDonald Stonewell and General Rocketry put the final touches in place for STS-162, the return to flight of the Space Transportation System. After nearly 14 months of forced stand down, the booster \u201CConstitution\u201D was rolled out to the pad with its L-IVC upper stage and a mass simulator. With special care taken to tank inspections prior to flight, STS-162\u2019s STBEs roared to life without a hitch as it pushed the rocket off the pad, then back to its own launch site. As the drag chute deployed after a safe touchdown, NASA made the announcement that it was recertifying STS for regular (albeit reduced) service with STS-163 slated to carry the Shuttle \u201CAthena\u201D and the crew of Starlab Expedition 67 on a mission to reactivate and repair the abandoned station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022liPlp2Q.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/liPlp2Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022DVblQM6.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DVblQM6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022KF7CopG.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KF7CopG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESTS-163, carrying Starlab Expedition 67 up to the abandoned station.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRiding on the back of careful attention to detail, STS-163 saw a flawless flight to orbit putting Starlab 67 on course to rendezvous with the station. After an uneventful two day trip, Starlab 67 was ordered to do a fly around of the station to verify its external condition. The crew meticulously documented the station\u2019s exterior condition from the windows of \u201CAthena\u201D, which showed no immediate signs of damage beyond a jammed solar array on the Japanese K\u014Dg\u014D module. With the necessary inspections complete \u201CAthena\u201D was cleared to dock with Starlab when it encountered a second issue. Upon activation of the vehicle\u2019s Radar Ranging and Alignment Array (RRAA) neither the crew aboard the shuttle nor ground controllers could detect a return signature that would normally be broadcast from a functioning docking port aboard the station. While the crew held at 100 meters to station, photographs beamed down through the TDRS network revealed that the small radar array dish on the station docking port was apparently misaligned and damaged. With the order to retreat and reattempt docking on the Endeavour module\u2019s axial docking port, and within a few hours the crew of Starlab 67 was finally aboard the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222ixBSid.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2ixBSid.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022My7iFSU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/My7iFSU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022dygkF6g.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dygkF6g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EExpedition 67 highlights, the mission would reveal many of the shortcomings of the nearly two decade old station.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the next two weeks the crew of four categorized necessary repairs to the station left to the harsh environment of space for nearly a year. As the list of repairs to be conducted by Expedition 68 and 69 piled up the picture in mission control and the whole of NASA administration was becoming abundantly clear: Starlab, not unlike the venerable STS which had facilitated its construction and operation, was rapidly aging with the effects of the stand down exacerbating existing issues aboard the orbital outpost. Although replacements had been slated for after Starlab\u2019s originally planned retirement age of ten years, the end of the Cold War (and subsequent budget cuts across the board) had put such plans for Starlab replacement stations on the back burner. With the necessary work to bring the station back up to its prime projected to take 6 months the crew of Starlab 67 safed the necessary systems aboard the station for another month long stand down before Starlab 68 and a replacement Tsurumaru ECRV could be launched, and returned to Kerbin aboard their shuttle. As the astronauts touched back down at the Cape after their two week mission the great gears of American space bureaucracy began to grind for the first time since the completion of Starlab, and the wider space world awaited the results of what came to be known as Orion Report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022uWXetbH.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uWXetbH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022YEaWTzY.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YEaWTzY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022pfBbVcd.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pfBbVcd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJapan\u0027s workhorse station lifeboat Tsurumaru is launched aboard a J-IIB to re-enable constant habitation of Starlab as of Expedition 68.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevphfeniey","CreatedById":124217,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T13:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey y\u0027all!

There was Gomez the Marine Corps pilot, Willow armed with her dual astrophysics doctorates, Noguchi the Japanese electrical engineering wizard, Freeman the space doctor, and Chief the ex-grease monkey who\u2019d been arms deep in STS for a decade.
