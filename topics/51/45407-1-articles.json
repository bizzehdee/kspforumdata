I felt I had to share my current mission to the mun because I hope that others will find it as hilarious as I do. Now I\u0027ve read a fair bit about KSP and previously have experience with orbital mechanics due to simulators(Orbiter) and being a physics major helps some too. However when it comes to the Delta V I\u0027ve heard so much about I have not yet payed too much attention to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow off from my slight background on to the mission. I had been testing my new asparagus lifter earlier this weekend and after easily reaching orbit with all payloads I decided it was time for a shot at the moon. So I sped off to the VAB to create an Apollo style orbiter and lander. If I figure out how to post pictures(or one of you kind souls informs me) I will post pictures of my lifter and my orbiter/lander if requested for it\u0027s a funny tale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET-minus 3, 2 ,1 Liftoff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch goes as planned and at 10,000m I begin my gravity turn west. I am under the impression that East could be better but I wanted to slingshot myself to come up behind the muns orbit because I would not be fighting it\u0027s gravity but just slowing it down. I may be wrong but that was my thought process. I got lucky that the mun was in perfect position and instead of positioning myself into orbit as soon as I hit my Aps I burned straight to the mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for an interjection - My lifter has 6 asparagus style boosters attached to the main rocket. As soon as I had an Aps of about ~100k I cut the engines was conveniently only 5% into my main rocket\u0027s fuel after the boosters had been discarded. With the mun insertion burn I had burned as long as I possibly could. Incidentally within 10m/s of the burn time I had run out of fuel. \u0022Good enough\u0022, said our brave co-pilot Jeb. During the flight I repositioned my lander to the docking point on top of our capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the mun burn to stabilize an orbit. I created the maneuver and time came and went. Low and behold I for the first time was in mun orbit..and mashed F5. At this point I noticed that I had about 1/4 of my total fuel left which I wonder if it will be enough to get back without the lander. However I\u0027m not to this point yet...I\u0027ve got to land on the mun first! Jeb and Bill were selected to be the lucky kerbins to land on the moon. So I get in a generous orbit of 15km above the mun and begin my ascent down to the mun. unfortunately I was only able to slow down to about 250 m/s before I ran out of fuel on my first descent....smash and explode. Lucky for Jeb I knew to quicksave beforehand because I don\u0027t trust myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple attempts(and failures) later I have come to a conclusion. That tiny fuel tank for one of those small engines is not enough to deorbit and land a lander. Woops. Being as stubborn as I am I opt for a new tactic. I transfered all extra RCS fuel into the lander(It had one of those mini 100 fuel tanks) for RCS and one of those 50 fuel for liquid fuel tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the new tactic in hand I went to try it out for real. With the combined force of my main thruster at 10% thrust and my RCS thruster I was able to start slowing down just barely enough. As I began to slow down I saw that I was coming to an edge of a crater that I had no choice to try to land in. I slowed down to about 15 m/s and 15m above the surface and at that moment the unthinkable(I actually should have expected it) happened. I ran out of fuel. So for that last split second I watched as my lander crashed into the mun\u0027s surface. I actually cried out in dismay...but when the smoke cleared something miraculous had happened...there was my lander can sliding down the slope of the crater. The landing gear, engine, and fuel tank I had below the can was destroyed but the can survived. So I had done it. I have landed on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is now I\u0027m trying to decide whether to attempt to orbit Jeb and Bill with their jetpacks and get back into the orbiter and try for a last ditch apollo 13 style mission home...or just send a revised rescue craft with more fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuarteRios","CreatedById":80485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T09:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry sending another craft ,Kerbals can\u0027t reach orbit with the jetpacks.

Alright it looks like I\u0027ll be sending a rescue orbiter. I\u0027ve been thinking about the design of it in class today and I can\u0027t decide on a particular one. I was thinking of sending a capsule \u002B 2man lander can and launch with 2 kerbins so there is space to bring back jeb bill and bob. The only problem that remains is I can\u0027t deorbit with that landing can because those poor souls will burn up. So my (current) plan is to make a 5man orbiter and put them in orbit around kerbin(after the mun rescue). I\u0027ll deorbit the pod and get 3 of them home and then launch another capsule with only 1 kerbin in it. It will rendezvous with the can and the remaining 2 will enter the capsule and return to kerbin. Is there any more efficient way to do this sort of rescue mission or is this the best case scenario? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I need to redesign a lander to pick up jeb and bill as well....Any tips for designing one?
