A small amount of thrust to slow descent is fine, but this is not a VTOL challenge, it\u0027s a HTOL one. As for the landing gear: it doesn\u0027t break if you put enough of them on the same line so they all touch down at the same time and share the load. The biggest problem in the later stages of testing was the fact that you come in so fast and the gravity is so low that you\u0027re almost guaranteed to bounce and likely clip the surface with a wingtip. And once that happens, you\u0027re guaranteed to spin out of control and die horribly. This was solved by putting additional landing gear on the wingtips to ensure they don\u0027t crash into the ground and using forward-firing aerospikes to slow down as quickly as possible and minimise the bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T08:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cirocco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cirocco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInteresting.

Glad to see you\u0027re interested in flying on Duna, which sadly is a neglected art. In my sig is a challenge where you can see many people\u0027s ideas on how to do, although only 1 of them is all-stock. Still that one (an ion-powered thing) meets the rather rigorous flight requirements of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027ve probably noticed by now, the main issue with flying on Duna is getting slow enough to land safely. Entering the atmosphere from space, flying around, and even taking off aren\u0027t too hard, but safely landing is a bear due to 1) the rarety of flat ground and 2) the high altitude of most of the surface. This leaves you with 2 basic choices when designing a Duna plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st choice is to design so you can land in the depressions, which have the lowest altitude and the biggest expanses of flat ground. This allows for much higher landing speed, so is a much easier design challenge. However, a design that relies on depressions to land rather defeats the purpose of taking a plane to Duna. The reason for having a plane instead of a rocket lander is so you can explore the planet faster and less boringly than using a rover, but depressions only cover about 15% of Duna, which means you can\u0027t explore the vast majority of the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd choice is to design so you can land out in the vast dune fields that cover the other 80% of Duna (the remainder being mountains). The average altitude in the dune fields, however, is about 2500-3000m, which equates to like 16-17km on Kerbin, and flat areas are only 200-300m long at best, and rather scattered about. The short LZs require a very slow landing speed (30m/s tops), which the altitude makes very hard to achieve. Plus, the low gravity greatly reduces the effectiveness of wheel brakes, and the thin air reduces the effectiveness of air brakes and chutes. Designing this short of plane is what my challenge is about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that any plane designed to land out in the dunes will have such a huge amount of wing area that it usually won\u0027t be possible to launch it atop a rocket, even in stock air. And anything that can SSTO from Kerbin by itself probably won\u0027t be able to fly slow enough on Duna to land out in the dunes. So the main options seem to be to attach a horizontal ascent stage on the back of the plane, which might also include a transfer engine, or (if the plane is small enough) build a cage lifter around it, or lift 2 planes at once facing in opposite directions so their lift forces cancel out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I wish you luck.
