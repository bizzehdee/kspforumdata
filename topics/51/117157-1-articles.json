Here\u0027s a brief overview of the mission:\n\n[![milkrun_05.jpg](http://ksp.schnobs.de/milkrun/milkrun_05.jpg)](http://ksp.schnobs.de/milkrun/milkrun.html)\n\nHints for anyone trying to do something similar:\n\n- large heat shield not only has more ablator, it also creates a lot more drag. This allowed me to enter at a comparatively high periapsis and still come to an nearly immediate stop. The G meter is off the scale, but who cares? This setup is good for entries of 6000m/s, maybe even 7000, at a periapsis of ~27km.\n- don\u0027t bother with maneuver planing. Just set your target and point at target, this won\u0027t be all wrong. There\u0027s plenty of time to fine-tune as you go.\n- returning from Minmus, I used chase view to point the rocket at Kerbin. Didn\u0027t work all that well, I had to dedicate a few hundred m/s to a radial burn later on.\n- heat was a problem: the vessel was getting hot enough that my ablator slowly vaporized. No practical amount of heatsinks could prevent this. In the end it worked out well enough, but sure looked scary.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T18:05:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"}]}
