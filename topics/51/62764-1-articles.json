But somehow always manged to neglect Gilly. Well I finally sent a probe there in .23 save with a number of realism mods. Finally I have visited every body in the base game. Below is my favorite image of the event.

However, I tuned the parts a little since the oxygen tanks were storing a paltry amount of o2 for their size and you had to spam a bunch of them just to get to the mun. Not as bad as TAC though where one oxygen tank can take you to about Proxima Centauri.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Joint Reinforcment:\u003C/strong\u003E Less wobbly rockets.

I massively tweaked the costing so that my rockets actually cost millions. I\u0027m just using it to see a running cost. I haven\u0027t picked a budget demand to try and meet yet. But it does make me think a little about test flights.
