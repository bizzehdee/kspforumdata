I thought no problem, orbit a few times until I can get a Joolian moon capture that will let me reverse my spin. Once I got there tho O found a wee problem. Coming out of aerobrake, I was headed straight for Tylo, like a rocket power interplanetary lawn dart. No problem, plenty of fuel, I planned for lots of maneuvering. started looking at nodes. Tylo was leering big, and its SOI even bigger. To adjust to a capture that would orbit me in the correct direction would have used a huge chunk of fuel and resulting intital path sent me poinbing right back to a solar orbit that would take more fual to avoid. Capturing tylo with another backwards orbit would do but that initial path pointed me at a messy impact with Vall, again needing a lot of fuel to avoid, and more to correct, with the firther possibility of just steering back into the center of the system and impacting into Jool itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I am playing through all the nodes, adjusting normal, anti normal, pro and retro, time is marching on and I continued to scream at whatever horrible speed you are at after earobreaking into an ugly elliptical that self terminated on the surface of tylo. As with any Joolian entry I did not have a perfect equitorial entry, being about 7 degrees off from true, which led me to my most inelegant solution. I burned into a polar orbital capture of tylo, and then burned back out into a Joolian orbit going the right way. It was not the best piloting I was to do in Jool system, but playing it out in my head afterwards it had a kind of perverse beauty in the realm of planetary 3d ballet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOP id right better to spend time with adjustment burn on the Kerbin to Jool approach leg, then end up in the Joolian system, orbiting in the opoosite direction of her moons. Depending on their orbits and your breaking, it can be like graviy well pachinko in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlacrity\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dellcom1800","CreatedById":89233,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T16:12:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah my first trip to Jool with an orbiter/lander probe was a little challenging as well. It was my first time trying aero-capture, which actually worked pretty well but still required some adjustment. I forgot that the scale of this game is really small compared to reality so I had ended up getting in the SOI of one of the moons on approach, thankfully it was not impacting, just adjusted my orbital inclination a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked out though and I got in a stable orbit in the correct direction around Jool then transitioned to Lythe and had a successful landing on land.
