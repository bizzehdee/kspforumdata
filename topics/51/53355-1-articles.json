After long 2-hour work day Jeb decided to relax by collecting some parts around the runway and borrowed 450 units fuel from Bob\u0027s environmentally friend car. Plane took off and gained quickly altitude. Flight included small attitude corrections and controlling throttle for 100 % at altitude 25 km to 50 % at 28 km and Jeb just smiled in glowing sauna about over half a hour. Completing trip around Kerbin it was time to find runway without any approaching lighting system help. It found but Jeb was far away from runway aligment. Another problem was controllability; for some reason plane took very slowly every turn \u003Csup\u003E(*\u003C/sup\u003E so landing had to make with wide turnings around KSC. And, of course, fuel was running out. No problem, said Jeb, cool down, gear down, plane down. And what Jeb does, Jeb does and plane landed on runway 27.
