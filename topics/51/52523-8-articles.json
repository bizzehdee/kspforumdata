It proceeded a number of F5/F9 attempts at loading it in a row to wobble increasingly violently and then spontaneously explode. However, after quite a few attempts, and some random release of nuclear warheads (I was desperate to try anything to give the random number generators a slightly different seed to work with) I finally managed a version where it only lost one of its RocketParts modules, rather than being annihilated entirely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then proceeded to maneuver the Orion onto a collision course with Duna (I re-used a Maneuver Planner setting from the Science Module- knowing that the high imprecision of nuclear pulse thrust would lead to a collision course), bleed off its extreme approach velocity as it more closely approached Duna, and then finally maneuver it into a reasonably stable orbit around Duna:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bydWj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This will cost me fuel, but greatly sped up the deceleration to a lower orbit by pulling the apoapsis down quite a bit as well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3bF1u\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
