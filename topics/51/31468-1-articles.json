I took way more fuel than I needed, but seeing as I was basically putting my college math/physics skills to the test, it seemed like a good idea. Plus, it allowed me to make a bonus pit stop, so I was rather pleased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy \u003Cem\u003ESkycrosser\u003C/em\u003E is the command module, and is a pretty basic design using Aerospikes and a Poodle. I found this to be the most stable configuration. I\u0027ve since used the \u003Cem\u003ESkycrosser\u003C/em\u003E to make Mun and Minmus trips with big landers that carry rovers, and an Orbital Trip to Eve with a lander probe. However, I originally designed it for this trip. My \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider\u003C/em\u003E is the lander, and the engine configuration is the same. The fuel capacity is half that of the \u003Cem\u003ESkycrosser\u003C/em\u003E. My idea was an Earth Orbit rendezvous, Trans-Duna injection, parachute assisted landing, Duna Orbit rendezvous, and then the trip home. However, for weight considerations on the return trip, I transferred the remaining fuel from \u003Cem\u003ESkycrosser\u003C/em\u003E, separated the command pod, and went home using the \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider\u003C/em\u003E. I actually got the idea from Apollo 13, and it has worked brilliantly. I attached a probe core to each vessel that allows the vessels to be operated independently. I took only two Kerbals for the first trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, Jebidiah was first down the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach part of the ship went up independently and docked with my \u003Cem\u003EOlympus\u003C/em\u003E Fueling Station.

I only took one screenshot of the descent. Mostly because I was too busy trying to manage the descent and worrying about the parachutes ripping my craft to shreds and worrying about the final touchdown since I had absolutely no idea (other than the appearance of the shadow) of how high/low the surface was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/DunaDecsent_zpsddd278a5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DunaDecsent_zpsddd278a5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything worked out nicely, I made a smooth touchdown just shy of a rather large canyon and Jeb and Bill took a walk outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/Touchdown_zps3586847b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Touchdown_zps3586847b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I got bored jumping around and using the EVA packs to splat-n-slide my Kerbals in the dirt, I launched \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider\u003C/em\u003E and maneuvered for a Duna Orbit Rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/dunaorbitdocking_zps71922619.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dunaorbitdocking_zps71922619.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI refueled, separated the \u003Cem\u003ESkycrosser\u003C/em\u003E command pod, and got ready to make the long wait for Kerbin to be in the right place to get home. At this point, I realized I had a ton of fuel and time, and Ike was just sitting there teasing me, so I figured, why wait in orbit for Kerbin to be in the right place when I can wait on the surface of a crazy shaped moon? A few quick maneuvers later, Jeb and Bill were dancing on Ike\u0027s face. This still ranks as one of my proudest KSP moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/pitstopatIke_zps07f21604.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pitstopatIke_zps07f21604.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Kerbin was in the right place, so I launched \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider\u003C/em\u003E and made my shot home. The pit stop at Ike and the shot home drained all of my fuel, and I had to make so pretty clever use of my RCS in order to get into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/homesep_zps5f63c532.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022homesep_zps5f63c532.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally though, the home fires started to burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/re-entry_zpsd575462c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022re-entry_zpsd575462c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had two good chutes, and after fluttering down to safety, Jeb and Bill made their final EVA of the trip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/goodchutes_zps78ae8ee4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022goodchutes_zps78ae8ee4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Trip/thekerbalhaslanded_zps4c1573b6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022thekerbalhaslanded_zps4c1573b6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any feedback, or suggestions on the design of my crafts, I\u0027m curious to read what people have to say.

I haven\u0027t had a great deal of luck with it, but I\u0027m also not nearly as patient as I probably should be when it comes to design. I will take the suggestion and lower the amount of RCS I am taking. Now that I am a little more experienced with the game, I realize I don\u0027t need nearly as much.

I actually took this weird looking craft to the Mun and Minmus (but really who needs a Minmus rover when you can have flying kerbals). I drop the rover like a bomb a few meters above the landing zone and then set the lander down next to it.
