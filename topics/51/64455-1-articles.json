It includes solar panels, batteries, lights, SAS and docking ports on each end. What the Kerbal designers forget were two things. They forgot RCS in any forms and failed to reading the warning label on the PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Container where it stated; \u0022No command module functionality\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it launched with 5 Kerbals. 1 in the launch vehicle command capsule and 4 in the Hitchhiker. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/487816872713877264/6FAE06D72A60BC08D32C7F7FC18574DA6924F58D/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter placing it into a Low Kerbin Orbit (LKO) I disconnected the launch vehicle and that when Mission controlled noticed they had no control of the Space Station. So they called the engineers to make a Retrofit Rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a rush job and after launched the engineers once again discovered they did not put any RCS in the craft... AGAIN. They also put the command module on backwards so it would look better when attached to the station. This resulted in all the controls being reverse when trying to dock with the main engine only. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/487816872713895329/0A6B8C261EA67E4607D7E0CAFB9FEEBCC782A039/\u0022 alt=\u00220A6B8C261EA67E4607D7E0CAFB9FEEBCC782A039\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see the docking completed before the the finale disconnect with the launch vehicle reentry to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now there are 4 Kerbals in my simple space station that can transfer fuel to out going missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-27T21:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2014 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nepos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed Typo O make many of them\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T21:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must say that\u0027s rather impressive.
