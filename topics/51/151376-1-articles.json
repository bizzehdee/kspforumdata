Since i had \u00A0contract to launch a satellite into an equatorial munar orbit i decided that she could wait in orbit for a while.

Val got out to plant a flag but for some reason she decided to put the flag right next to the craft... so when the flag sprung up the craft went flying off landing on its side. Once she climbed back in takeoff proved to be truly terrifying. At the moment before actually lifting off the surface Val was scraping against the mun at 20ish m/s. I looked at my fuel levels to see that i had 7 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E left.

I misplaced decoupler separating the lander from nose cone on top (don\u0027t ask how I came up with the idea, but it worked), so the cone got jettisoned, but decoupler remained in place. What\u0027s weirder, engine was burning fuel, flame was visible, but it didn\u0027t move a bit.

Just yesterday I sent a large space tourism ship up as a part of a much larger payload AND accidentally used that style of decoupler rather than the separator. Because it was on the front half of the craft it was the parent part, so when I went to deorbit, I got no thrust and as soon as the shroud overheated, the entire ship exploded. I tried to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to remove the shroud, but it wouldn\u0027t remove a parent part.
