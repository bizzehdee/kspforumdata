Many small steps before risking Kerballed flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first, a comms network had to be set up, and then a probe to the Mun and Minmus to map out the terrain. My first Mun landing was a bit improvised. I sent Bill off to do a simple flyby, and something went horribly wrong. He went for an EVA and for some reason lost all momentum, essentially dropping like a stone towards the surface of the Mun (this was quite early in the release and not all mods was entirely stable under 0.24 - not happened since). So, I admit, I cheated - activated infinite EVA-RCS and landed Bill on the Mun, sans a spacecraft as that was still orbiting happily along. Luckily this was before a 0.24 compatible version of TAC-LS, so I had some time to get a rescue lander built and sent off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_024/screenshot125_zps86462828.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot125_zps86462828.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some tinkering in the VAB, basically just adding some extra bits to my original Mun fly-by vessel that Bill managed to loose, I got underway.

I did miss Bill by about 3km - manual landings are not my strong suit. With some help of Smart A.S.S and Translatron I got down safely though. Bill of course, had to use his jetpack to get to the lander in a timely fashion. Mind you, my lander is basically just the fly-by vessel with some extra bits, so the fuel-budget was kinda\u0027 tight - hence the legs, fuel and engines for landing are detachable to save some precious dV for the trip back to Mun orbit and Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the slim science stuff all neatly packed under the pod using Universal Storage.

Now, I could of course have remoted the derelict back home if not for a little snag - to save power Bill had not deployed the antenna... So sent up two Kerbals, one EVA\u0027d over to the derelict and got it running again.

Something weird happening here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SP Firebug is not fit to land, that is for sure - and it\u0027ll hit the atmosphere pretty soon with its strange behaviour.
