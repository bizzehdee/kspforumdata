If the comms network drifts a bit too much, you\u0027ll get into trouble because that single location falls out of view. So adding one on the other side of the globe does make things a lot easier, but I feel it\u0027s something I want and also I don\u0027t think it\u0027s even that realistic to have a single tracking station anyway. So, I\u0027m going to RT2 folder and opening a file RemoteTech_Settings.cfg. There\u0027s two stations marked, so I\u0027ll copy one block. I\u0027m changing the latitude to -30.0 and longitude to 123.0. This will add another station on the Australian continent. I\u0027m naming it Down Under Comms and BBQ Station.

There\u0027s only one probe core available, so not much choise in it. It holds two experiments in it and a data recorder that can be only activated once reaching high atmosphere. The first experiment is also doable only in the upper atmo and the second one needs to be in low space. The idea is that once in the correct situation, you can engage the data recorder which starts gathering data and once enough data is collected, the experiment can be completed if you\u0027re still in the correct situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster is just a single piece of SRB, made from stretcy SRB, with an empty stretchy conic fuel tank to act as adapter. It was easy to tweak the burn time, dV and thrust with the stretchies and as you can see, with real sized planet, you need a lot of dV just to get into space, let alone orbit. The control surfaces are a bit bulky and they\u0027re made from pWing. I added a triplet of thermometers and gravioli detectors as well as antennas to keep in touch with the base. This because I didn\u0027t want to transmit anything while flying through atmosphere, so I could store the experiments from lower and upper atmosphere and also they keep the rocket nicely balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m naming it Dubious One.

The custome biome says I\u0027m over water, but the author has mentioned it\u0027s not 100% accurate, which is fine. After hitting 18 km, I\u0027m able to start the data recording and soon the fuel runs out. The rocket was so stable that getting a good apoapsis well above the atmosphere was much easier than I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/plbEXvO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022plbEXvO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing the atmospheric readings -experiment and begin transmitting it for 100 science, also transmitting the collected thermal readings. It looks like the transmitting doesn\u0027t use up much electric charge, it barely makes a dent in the batteries. After the rocket rises above 180 km, I can make the radiation experiment as I\u0027m officially now in low space. I\u0027m sending it to KSC too for 200 science and taking more temp and gravioli readings. At this point I\u0027m a bit unsure as to the antenna ranges, I\u0027ll have to check somewhere if the probe has an integrated one. Because the antennas I\u0027m packing aren\u0027t extended and honestly I didn\u0027t even think about the connection requirements until at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, the mission was a great success!

I still think that strapping explosives on your rocket to cleave it in pieces mid-flight sounds like an excellent plan. For now I\u0027m not even looking at engine setups or fuel choices in any detail, instead I\u0027m just building enough marginal into the probe. A total of 11 km/s of vacuum dV on the rocket will ensure I have enough. The rocket has three stages, the lower and upper run on kerbal juice (also known as kerosene) and the probe is hypergolics. I love kerosene.

There\u0027s a part that can make crew reports with probes and another that can take ground samples without a kerbal. I don\u0027t like this as it just takes away reasons to launch manned missions. Now the goo was named as radiation experiment, so I thought it would be a new kind of experiment. But it turns out it\u0027s just the goo. I think the point with the stock goo is that it\u0027s clumsy and big so it\u0027s also hard to use. This one however is tiny and light.

The orbit is surprisingly low and even though the periapsis is still way above the thick part of atmosphere, the end result is that the probe hits atmo somewhere in the middle of the Pacific and burns up long before it even comes close to getting a connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/syEH92r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022syEH92r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well, good thing we had insurance.

For example right now I\u0027m thinking about the lasagne that\u0027s for lunch today. With that in mind we decided that it might be a good idea to design a lifter that could be standardised and used for all consecutive probing missions. It\u0027s also quite a hassle to construct a new lifter every time. Additionally I will soon need to set up some kind of orbital relay network, because I\u0027d prefer if my probes had a constant connection to mission control. So, the project Greenlight was begun! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst decision was the payload. With the low tech engines and the generally tiny nature of probes, two tons seemed like a nice, round figure. I\u0027m also not overly concerned about efficiency so the total mass of the rocket should fall somewhere in the 150-200 tons range but to show some restraint, I decided to keep it under 200 tons. This won\u0027t get me to the Moon though but it should be enough for getting a high orbit but probably not enough for an actual geostationary orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESputnik here will be my two ton test subject payload both for the design process and the first test flight. It also has a scientific purpose so I\u0027m not just launching bricks into space. The core is actually aerodynamic and could go without fairings, but the lifter will have integrated fairings on it, so Sput will be inside them in any case. The dV on the probe will be a separate thing and not counted towards the lifters capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ln6Jtey.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ln6Jtey.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually here I\u0027m still using an old dummy payload in designing the orbital insertion stage so don\u0027t mind that one. I\u0027m adding the fairing base and a decoupler straight on the lifter so I can just snap it on any probe without having to fiddle with the fairings. The little green tank is an RCS fuel tank because I wanted to include an orbital maneuvering capability on the stage as well. The A9R engine is configured to run on hypergolic UDMH\u002BN2O4 so that it\u0027s restartable in space. I\u0027m naming this section Maneuverer. Some of the features aren\u0027t exactly necessary here, but this system will be a template for many future designs so I want to do it properly from the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZoQAeGA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZoQAeGA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is the actual upper stage. The Decurion engine is an optimal choise and it runs on kerbolox which is at the moment the most optimal fuel combination. To be honest I still haven\u0027t really found any reason to use anything else. But it\u0027s OK because I love kerosene. The entire upper part of the rocket weighs 21,4 tons with 5,5km/s of dV. Essentially all of this will be burned in vacuum so I can just ignore the poor atmospheric performance. Again with stretchies it\u0027s easy to change the tank size to give a nice TWR. I\u0027m keeping it well above 1,0 because of the Maneuverer has a bit low TWR and a long burn time, which in turn means that I might want to keep apoapsis a few minutes ahead of me when the upper stage is burning. Higher TWR should help with correcting any problems with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ozBl2bS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ozBl2bS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally the Big One. The upper stage of course needs to be lifted above atmosphere and that needs some serious thruster power. I\u0027m also using a wider tank in the lower stage to keep the rocket nicely shaped and reduce wobble. The Miles engine is similar to Decurion, but way more powerful. It\u0027s not powerful enough though and I\u0027m thinkin if I should use two of them, but then I\u0027d get doubled fuel consumption and would probably have to make the main tank a lot bigger to compensate. I don\u0027t like the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead I\u0027ll do it the fun way and instead of one engine, I\u0027ll add six! Yeah, six sounds good. That\u0027s what SRBs are for anyway, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m tweaking the burn time and thrust so that I\u0027ll get the beginning TWR a bit above one on launch and one by the time the boosters separate. I\u0027m not sure this is the most efficient way to launch, the first kilometers will burn literally tons of fuel just getting the rocket up to speed, but for now it will have to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout the payload\u0027s own dV I now have over 10 km/s of vacuum dV and on the lower stages the atmo and vac dV is pretty close to each other so I think this might get into orbit. A few winglets to help with stability and steering is added plus I\u0027m already locking the gimbals on the SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Neky27V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Neky27V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter changing the dummy payload back to good old Sput the Greelight One is transported to launchpad for a night launch. The mission objective is to deliver the probe to low space and attempt to attain a stable orbit without using the probe\u0027s own thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreenlight One is sitting on launch pad and ready for liftoff!

I\u0027m finally turning SAS off because it can\u0027t really handle the gimbal, which seems to react a bit slowly and in a very wide movements. I have to control by tapping it fast and then wait a bit to see how the rocket reacts. In the future I might just want to disable it all together and steer with winglets while in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dreaded SRB separation event! They don\u0027t really fly off the way I\u0027d want to, rather the decouplers just drop them but everything goes smoothly despite that. However I\u0027m not accelerating at this point at all (in fact for a second or two I\u0027m decelerating a bit) so in theory this might be a problematic event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w7xtrEL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w7xtrEL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stage separates at almost exactly 200 km\u0027s. The trajectory seems nice too, as I\u0027m 1m 26s from apoapsis, which is only about 30 kilometers above the craft. The upper stage has the same laggy and over-sensitive gimbal so steering needs to be delicate and careful. SAS handles this a a bit better though, as long as I\u0027m keeping a steady course. I eject fairings and perform the experiments and transmit while continuing the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lkEBqzB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lkEBqzB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen this happens. I lose connection to ground station while mid burn. The engine shuts down and the probe is sent drifting dead in space. Although I don\u0027t think it would\u0027ve made orbit. I don\u0027t know why, 10 km/s should be enough and even have some marginal for error too. Maybe it\u0027s the slow start or possibly the fact that apoapsis is at 257 km instead of barely above atmosphere. I\u0027ll have to test different ascent paths, I\u0027m guessing the problem is a combination of burning too long in atmosphere and not doing gravity turn properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SJpZKh6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SJpZKh6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreenlight One is left to burn up and fall into the Atlantic. The lifter seems to be promising though and the main issue here was losing connection. Even if I can\u0027t make it to orbit purely on the lifter\u0027s own power the remaining dV is so small I don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027ll just call it a feature that\u0027s meant to reduce orbital debris and raise the price of a launch by 5%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point my main concern is the lack of cool lights on the rocket, it\u0027s very dark during the night time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T15:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking good!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, does RSS cause any extra lag by itself?

In stock you rarely end up wasting/saving more than 100-200 m/s with the ascent profile but with this setup the difference is much bigger. Firstly it\u0027s because the kerbolox engines are not restartable at least at this stage of career so the whole upper stage burn must be done in one go. You can\u0027t casually coast up and always do the optimal burn. It\u0027s also not throttleable so you\u0027re just blasting at full power so mistakes cumulate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly the speed is of course higher so while the percentage of wasted dV may be similar compared to stock, the actual number will be roughly doubled, which means exponentially more mass for the rocket that\u0027s there just to compensate bad flying.

Meanwhile two things have happened. Firstly RPL has gotten several small updates, effectively rendering all my previous ship designs unusable because some parts have changed location. Secondly there was a Greenlight Three mission which was totally successful, but I had it in the middle of a mission when the ship was broken by an update so the flight was terminated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter since the Greenlight lifter wasn\u0027t performing as well as I\u0027d hoped to so it was time to redesign it! The new design was named Greenlight IV and I also decided to upscale it a bit, raising the payload to 4 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a dire need for a proper communications network so I\u0027m combining these two projects and I\u0027ll start with the comms satellite.

I don\u0027t have many dishes available but the 400 Mm dish reaches the Moon nicely so I\u0027m putting two of those on board. I\u0027m not yet sure about what kind of orbits the satellites will be in but I reckon I won\u0027t need more than two. There\u0027s a nice extendable omni antenna with a 10 000 km range that I\u0027m taking with me as well. The weight is balanced with a small science package. One initial possibility here is that I\u0027ll put these in 10 000 km orbits and use the omni to communicate with ground, one dish pointed at another satellite just in case it wanders out of the omni range and one dish for communicating outwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NaDM5wU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NaDM5wU.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KS0QZmn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KS0QZmn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the main instrument assembly. I don\u0027t have sun tracking solar panels and the comms take a lot of power so this is my solution to it. Also there\u0027s so much weight I can use for the probe that clumsy system like this doesn\u0027t matter. For the core I\u0027m using Vanguard \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 mostly because it\u0027s small and light but also because I need to do the science experiments on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Oddrv1i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Oddrv1i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the probe propulsion I\u0027m using hypergolics for infinite restarting ability and also long term storage. Because the solar panels are so light, I\u0027m coating the whole tank with them, just to be sure I get positive power generation. As for the engines, I chose the radial dual-nozzle E5R. Well, to be exact I\u0027m using eight of them \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 that\u0027s sixteen nozzles! For fuel config the choise is simple as the UDMN\u002BN2O4 is just better in every way. There\u0027s also a small RCS tank for orbital maneuvers as with RO there\u0027s really no reaction wheels.

At this point you can see that I have around 6 km/s of dV on the lifter\u0027s stages so in theory I need only 4 km/s for the lower stage to lift this thing up. Also I think the weights of the stages scale nicely from 4t -\u0026gt; 13t -\u0026gt; 40t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x2RSTag.png\u0022 alt=\u0022x2RSTag.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the lower stage I\u0027m choosing another dual nozzle, the D4-2, which needs some help from the two solid boosters.

I\u0027m aiming the dish back to KSC to keep in contact. But once I get to 36 000 km\u0027s high I notice something. The omni antenna works still. I\u0027m not exactly sure how it works, but after a little digging it seems that the huge antenna at KSC is boosting the antenna on the probe so that I don\u0027t even need the dish. Also, in fact this works even while the antenna is redacted (it still has 1000 km range like that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decide to leave the probe here for now and circularize the orbit. I\u0027m tweaking the orbital period to 23 hours, 56 minutes (it\u0027s still not quite there yet on the picture). If I\u0027ve understoond correctly this makes the orbit geosynchronous. It\u0027s not geostationary because the orbit is inclined, but the probe should stay above a spesific area and wobble around the sky a bit, but not drift too far out of sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P5kLKFI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022P5kLKFI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have no idea how the multiple antenna thing works, I\u0027ve read something about it but I don\u0027t know the details. However I do know that I now have omni coverage from the probe so any launcher can take a dish that can reach the 36 000 km orbit and be in contact with the KerbKom I, which in turn relays back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall the launch was a smashing success, the lifter was a breeze to fly and got the 4 ton payload to orbit and then some.

In stock this would be easy like eating a whole Kerberry Pie, but right now I have to deal with aerodynamics, re-entry heat and possible communication loss because I can\u0027t have antennas or dishes extended while in atmosphere. Not to mention I have to slow down from a much much higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis here will be the chute bringing the core back down.

The light decoupler will fire 5 minutes before reaching periapsis, soon followed by orienting the craft to surface retrograde and holding it for the rest of the flight. Parachute is manually armed so it doesn\u0027t need a staging event (I just right click the parachute and click arm -button), it should deploy based on altitude. Then 5 minutes after reaching the periapsis the heat shield will decouple in order to reduce weight on touchdown.

I needed something bigger. For some reason I was bent on not raising my rocketry tech level but I did open the next pod node with the gemini cabin and some engines which proved to be just what I needed. After messing around in the VAB for quite some time I finally managed to build everything I needed for two bold and daring manned missions. This is the first: Adventurer One.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new lifter for these missions is called Green Dreams. It\u0027s pretty similar in concept to Greenlight, with a lower stage, upper stage and orbital stage. There\u0027s no SRB boosters on this one though and I was limited with the tank diameter because of tech level so had to improvise a bit. The lifter can get 40 metric tons to LEO and has a bit more dV than strictly needed so I don\u0027t have to use snacks as reaction mass just to do the final circularization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere she is sitting on the launchpad, prepared for a night launch. The black section is the tank for orbital insertion, above it you can see the actual spacecraft, the Adventurer moon explorer craft. The whole assembly weighs a bit under 900 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rccR0OL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rccR0OL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom section doesn\u0027t have any drop tanks, it\u0027s just a central tank with four tanks directly attached to it. This is just a work-around for the limited tank size, the smarter way would be of course just to make one wide tank. Each tank carries it\u0027s own thruster \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a twin nozzle Aerojet LR-87. This engine is awesome! It has several configurationd, the LR87-7 I\u0027m using on the lower stage is using Aerozine and N2O4 as propellants for maximum thrust but it can also use hydrolox for maximum ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew for this mission is Bill and Jebediah Kerman who will be spending their mission time in the two-seater Gemini capsule. As with Kerbury, the safety of the crew is important and they have a launch escape system in case of emergencies. I tried to test it but it didn\u0027t really work out that well because the rocket had some other issues at that time, but I\u0027m pretty confident it will step up and do it\u0027s job if it\u0027s ever REALLY needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wFi0N2w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wFi0N2w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see the entire engine configuration. The outer engines burn out a bit before the central core after clearing the atmosphere. I could get a bit more dV by using decouplers but they always add up to the complexity and the increase would be so small that I decided against it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EZf9fJF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EZf9fJF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage is sporting another Aerojet twin nozzle engine. I told you they\u0027re awesome! That\u0027s why I put six of them in this rocket. Something that I didn\u0027t figure out at the first time with this engine is that it actually requires a but of aerozine mixture in the tanks to ignite but the engine is configured to run on hydrolox. Luckily it\u0027s really easy to do with realfuels as I can just add a tiny amount of it inside the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jWJJc2Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jWJJc2Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also detaching the fuselage fairings that protect the systems- and cargo bay which is essentially the heart of the craft.

I did some digging and it turns out that the gemini lander was designed to weigh about 4 tons and had these big side tanks so I thought it\u0027s appropriate to just keep the design as it\u0027s the correct weight and size even though the tank proportions are a bit off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines on it were vastly overpowered. I had to just tap them on and off in the final descent and on the other hand the RCS wasn\u0027t powerful enough to cut the vertical velocity at all so the whole landing was like hopping on a pogo stick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4h4tFcp.png\u0022 alt=\u00224h4tFcp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouchdown from inside the lander.

Jeb waits for the orbiting craft to pass over him and fires up the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eDs4px9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eDs4px9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to maneuver a bit on both the lander and the orbiter in order to get a good approach. The orbit was a bit too low and the orbiter too far ahead so I couldn\u0027t lower the landers orbit enough for it to catch up within one orbit without it hitting the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2IgV5xp.png\u0022 alt=\u00222IgV5xp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approach goes fine and Jeb closes in on the front docking port of the Adventurer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ODplpAa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ODplpAa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s view of the lander just before it spins around for final approach. I really wish you could see through the windows like this, it would be fun to see Jeb grinning and maybe waving inside the lander module. They should make kerbals react to each other and do some silly stuff together like wave and high five and stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HQVRWDI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HQVRWDI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally the docking. Jeb moves to the cabin through the docking ports. There\u0027s parachutes under the Adventurer front port but I imagine that the kerbals are able to squeeze through. From watching videos from the ISS it seems to be very claustrophobic there at times. I just hope Jebs head doesn\u0027t get stuck. The lander is undocked and left in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F6AWKqE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F6AWKqE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to go home. I\u0027m leaving the periapsis a bit high because the decoupling events will push it further down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7dZsZs3.png\u0022 alt=\u00227dZsZs3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr WOULD push it if I hadn\u0027t forgotten the decoupler. Talk about a silly mistake. The I-beams were supposed to be attached to a large decoupled instead of directly to the pod but the craft I loaded was a previous test version, which was identical to the one I was supposed to use except for that decoupler. The thing that distracted me was that there is some kind of decoupler in the cabin itself, but I\u0027m not quite sure what it decouples. It does the animation and sound though. Maybe it detaches just from the attachment node or something. Anyway, here I go blasting into the atmosphere with the entire craft. Good luck Bill and Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QpAMNqd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QpAMNqd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily for me FAR has the aerodynamic stress implemented now. The force breaks the weak I-beam connections and detaches the pod from the rest of the craft. Seems to work nicely! Bill and Jeb seem happy despite the 8 gees crushing them against their seats. One of the rare cases when I\u0027m really happy about the ship breaking apart \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WIuB4Bx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WIuB4Bx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the great adventure comes to a happy ending. I managed a manned Moon landing and the first orbital rendezvous both on the same mission so couldn\u0027t be happier \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SfmPrNs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SfmPrNs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this milestone reached, it\u0027s time for me to end this mission report series though. I have two reasons. One is that I don\u0027t have that much time to play and planning and flying all these missions takes a lot longer than in stock and since .24 is hopefully not that far away I don\u0027t think I\u0027d manage any big milestones before that. Also I\u0027d like to have a little break from KSP before the patch rolls out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond and maybe the bigger reason is that now when the crafts have become bigger I\u0027ve also encountered some serious lag problems. I have a pretty good gaming rig but as it is with KSP it\u0027s not much help here. So truthfully I\u0027m not enjoying the missions that much when everything happens in slow motion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut overall it\u0027s been a nice experience and I\u0027m happy I tried it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion and some thoughts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to sum up some of my feelings for the realism overhaul and all the assosiated mods. Overall it\u0027s been interesting and fun to play like this and I can only imagine the amount of work and background research that\u0027s been poured into these mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some ways they change the game a lot but at the same time the basics remain the same. Most notably the bigger planet makes launches longer but I would definitely not say it makes them any harder though. The rockets do need more dV but it\u0027s also easier to come by and while the payloads are smaller, it\u0027s not really something I\u0027d count as \u0022difficult\u0022 as such. With the fuel mod and having a lot smaller dry mass for the tanks along with the stretchies getting over 9 km/s isn\u0027t as daunting as it sounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do need to know the basics of rocket building farily well though but interestingly staging is not that big of an issue as it is in stock. You don\u0027t suffer nearly as much from lugging around emptied tanks and also because the rockets are much much heavier, also lugging around some extra engine weight is proportionally a much smaller penalty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know how to do a gravity turn with FAR in stock, then you know how to do it in RSS too. It\u0027s maybe more important to have the trajectory spot on in RSS if you want precise orbits at launch, but I didn\u0027t find this to be any more difficult, you just need to relearn the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main difficulty comes from the engine ignitor. When you have only one ignition and no throttle, you really need to design the whole rocket around that. Further you really need to have that ascent path correct. But here\u0027s where the size works in your favour because small mistakes are smaller and it doesn\u0027t matter if you burn a degree or two in the wrong direction for a short while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do wish that stock Kerbin was a bit bigger though, especially when playing with FAR. Mostly just because the launch process is so fast that you barely have enough time to sneeze before you\u0027re at the first staging event. But if it was the size of a real planet, I think it would be a bad idea. It\u0027s much easier to learn orbiting and launching on a smaller planet, you see the effects of different maneuvers faster and there\u0027s maybe more room for errors. However once you got that nailed down, adding to the size just means longer burns, longer distances and timeframes so it doesn\u0027t bring anything significantly different to the table. Further I did have a lot of fun with the longer launches, but I could see that becoming excessively boring after doing it a hundred or two hundred times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all the different fuel types and configurations my feeling was that it adds a lot of details but not very much in terms of raw gameplay. I don\u0027t mean it as a bad thing but the fact is that you\u0027re not going to pic an inferior fuel type for your engine in any situation. With the different fuels you have some options you might not have otherwise but essentially you\u0027re always gonna pick the one that suits your needs the best. In that respect I think Squad has made a smart decision in consolidating the fuels simply into liquid, solid and monopropellant. It does lose some detail but avoids a lot of extra micromanaging that would probably not be all that interesting to most players. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I also want to mention is the magical reaction wheels in stock that are missing with RO. They\u0027re an awesome idea! Yes they\u0027re far from realistic but when playing without them you run into micromanagement issues again. If you\u0027re realism oriented this is of course something you want, but if you\u0027re just learning the ropes it would be incredibly frustrating if you\u0027d have to finetune all the RCS placements and fuel flows correctly just in order to even steer your craft. With the magic reaction wheel you still need RCS for translation and fine tuning burns and stuff like that but the wheel cancels out most of the tiny placement errors very effectively. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all I\u0027d say that realism overhaul does it\u0027s job very nicely. It adds a lot of extra considerations into engineering, launching and planning the missions. Some things are more difficult, mostly it\u0027s just extra engineering required but you\u0027re using the same exact skillset you need when playing on stock. It\u0027s fun and interesting, definitely worth a try if you\u0027re into things like that and not as difficult as it sounds at first. Or rather I\u0027d say that it\u0027s easy to do the basics but making something work smoothly and precisely requires a lot of thought and planning. Wether or not you count that as difficult is a matter of personal preference. I don\u0027t think it as difficulty but as depth and challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Squad has done very good decisions on where to cut down on the detail and consolidate things for gameplay puposes as well as making the basics more approachable to the common gamer. It\u0027s fantastic that we have these mods for people who want to add to their game, but the decisions made for stock are clearly not made on a whim but there are some very good reasons behind them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a lot of fun with this mod and I hope the good people will keep developing it and maybe I\u0027ll come back to it at some point.
