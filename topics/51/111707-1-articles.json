The basic idea for the mission has been \u0022bouncing around in the CEO\u0027s head like a hyperactive kid in a bouncy castle\u0022 for some time now, thanks to the KRON Series, the bean counters are finally listening.\n\n**The Bifr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6st Program**\n\n**Mission:** Tour the Kerbol System, learn all that is learnable (well most not all, one of our engineers kept spouting about a \u0022V\u0027ger\u0022)\n\n**The Ship:** The Bifr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6st, the program\u0027s namesake she is the pinnacle of kerbal technology as well as the largest vessel ever built.\n\n**Mission Status:** Planning\n\nI\u0027ve been working on the Bifr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6st, I\u0027m on the third prototype, below are albums of each one\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

These include but weren\u0027t limited to: abysmal maneuverability \u0022makes a ore tanker seem fast\u0022-Bill, heat issues, over complex, and lack of a modular design meant a orbital construction facility would be needed.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/k5u9c)\n\nThe BIS-X2 didn\u0027t resolve all of the X1\u0027s issues, it provided several advances to the project as a whole. These advances are: sufficient greenhouse space for 8 kerbals, greater hab space, decreased length, decreased complexity, overhauled supplier(mod) list, new centrifuge design, better reactor and reactor cooling. Unfortunately it: lacks a drive section (the X1 is far to complex), relience on Gyros to maneuver, ore processing blocks internal passage to centrifuge B and again lack a modular design.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Orbital testing of \u0027a\u0027 has shown major improvement in: complexity, docking space, internal passages and for the first time a Science Lab(seriously someones\u0027 gonna get fired for that). Taking what was learned from these test X3a was overhauled and designated X3b, \u0027b\u0027 finally resolves the issue of modular design, and improved centrifuge stability from \u0027a\u0027.\n\nAs of this moment I need to work on the drive section, seriously all 3 current X3b modules total ~100parts and the old X1 drive module is 170\u002B parts!\n\nAlso if anyone has any info on how DSEV radiators work that would be great, X1\u0027s would overhead and detonate moments after deployment.\n\nUpdates will come as I have them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T04:24:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheSuperintendnt**\n  \nAdded more info for each protype"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T08:39:43Z","Content":"A very interesting concept, I wish you luck."},{"CreatedByName":"Alewx","CreatedById":102791,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T08:56:30Z","Content":"The BIS-X1 is a nice version but the pusher configuration might cause problems when it comes to precise navigation.\n\nAlso where did you get the shield from?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T09:06:32Z","Content":"Wow looks very, very cool!!\n\nHow do you set up the turning parts?

All of our operators are currently attending to other customers, but your call is important to us. Please stay on the line. If you\u0027d like to use our automated help system, please press One. no-\n\n\\*beep\\*\n\nPlease press one for help on how the radiator-\n\n\\*beep\\*\n\nBased upon the Cooldown ship-wide heat management system by Wild Blue Industries, the Hot Plate radiator and its larger cousin, the Graphene Radiator (a.k.a. the \u0022Plasma Screen TV\u0022) are designed to draw heat away from a vessel\u0027s parts and transfer them into the radiators themselves. At that point, stock heat mechanics shed the heat via radiative cooling.\n\nWild Blue radiators are calibrated to operate at approximately 85% of their maximum rated temperature of 2,400 degrees Kelvin, known as the working temperature. In accordance with the [Stefan-Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%C3%83%C2%A2%C3%A2%E2%80%9A%C2%AC%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%93Boltzmann_law) law, the hotter the radiator, the more heat it sheds; it pays to let the radiators glow. For safety reasons, should the radiator exceed its maximum working temperature, it will automatically stop transferring heat into the radiator, allowing it to cool down. As an emergency measure, you can switch to Open Cycle Cooling to dump Coolant in exchange for rapidly cooling the radiator. You can tell when a radiator is in Open Cycle Cooling Mode by watching for streams of coolant exiting the base of the unit (with the [latest update](https://github.com/Angel-125/DSEV/releases), of course).\n\nSome ship components, such as the WB8 Supernova fusion engine and all three of Wild Blue Industries\u0027 fusion reactors, generate significant amounts of heat and thus require the active cooling provided by the radiators. Determining how many radiators a ship requires is a bit of an art; it depends upon how many engines/reactors are running, and how long a typical burn lasts for your vessel. The Discovery II, for instance, with one Supernova and one WB-2, requires a dozen Graphene radiators to function properly under full thrust, and can sustain burns for up to 5 minutes with Closed Cycle cooling, sufficient for most transfer maneuvers. The current generation of FLM fuel tanks also require heat management, though newer models no longer need active refrigeration, and will be available in a future update. You can however, retrofit your tanks by simply removing the ModuleTargetTemp.\n\nWe hope this brief introduction on Wild Blue Industries\u0027 Cooldown technology helps with you fulfill your vessel design requirements.
