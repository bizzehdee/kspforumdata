In-between firing numerous sub-orbital and orbital tests to score \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cscience points\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 with meagre hardware, I ran into and out of the house, gathering our children, and putting them to bed. Once out of the way the real point scoring could begin, with an attempted moon landing (or \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMun landing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, in the cartoon world of Kerbal Space Program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile inventing the Heath Robinson-esque contraption in the vehicle assembly building, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t help thinking of Kennedy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s speech \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe choose to go to the Mun not because it is easy, but because we are stupid, and we should really be doing the washing up\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost unbelievably, I landed on the moon at my first attempt. It was incredibly tight on fuel and electricity, and navigation was performed in the same manner as Tom Hanks in Apollo 13 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 pointing the rocket in an approximate direction, and giving it some welly. More by luck than judgement, we scored a free return braking manoeuvre into Mun orbit, and had just enough fuel after filling our pockets with dirt to fall back towards home, and spash down with applause and broad smiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a saying about pride coming before a fall, isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moon shot scored a lot of points. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a second moon in the game \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 further away than the first. With the points I won, I researched construction techniques, and engines \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 which gave me everything needed to build massive multi-stage rockets. The kind you would need for a distant moon shot. Half an hour later a much bigger, much more complex moon rocket stood on the launch pad, with a happy looking astronaut live on webcam from the cockpit. He didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look quite so happy when the launch aborted a few thousand feet above the pad. I think the correct term would be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cinduced oscillation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the entire rocket turned into a jelly as it picked up speed, and the autopilot chased the problem \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 essentially shaking the entire thing apart. Luckily the explosive bolts and parachutes worked perfectly, and my little astronaut dude lived to fly another day (or ten minutes later in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter applying liberal strengthening bars throughout the rocket (the in-game equivalent of duct tape), the colossus left the launchpad cleanly, and ripped into the night sky. Staging went wonderfully. The transfer orbit to the distant moon went wonderfully. Descent in the lander to the surface went wonderfully, and the little astronaut dude has great fun doing 30ft leaps while recording notes about his superhero-like abilities. We filled our pockets with dirt, got back in the lander, and headed for home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfidence is a funny thing. Rather than go for a direct return to earth, I thought \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI know, lets try and circularise our orbit, and land back at the launchpad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. While heading towards earth and playing with using some aero-braking in the upper atmosphere, I pressed a wrong button, and watched helplessly as the rocket engines departed the re-entry capsule, and we floated on, powerless. We still had a chance to survive\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 a remote one, but a possible one. The capsule was going to aero-brake, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s elliptical return trajectory would reduce. Each time it whistled past the earth it would brake a little more, and each time it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit would come closer to re-entry. It was going to take days, but it was possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn day ten of watching my helpless astronaut play cards in the capsule, waiting for re-entry, something unplanned happened. The tip of the reducing orbit entered the sphere of influence of the closer moon. Suddenly our orbit changed, and we were not going home any more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 we were doomed to orbit for eternity \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 unless an audacious rescue mission could be mounted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was already past midnight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at the vehicle assembly building we pulled out the blueprints for the previous mission, removed the lander, and added an extra crew capsule \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 an empty one. In bright sunshine the new rocket ripped into the sky, and departed for something never tried before \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 orbital rendezvous with a stranded spacecraft on an eliptical orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter much head scratching, and much burning of rockets, we ended up within 80,000 metres of the capsule. Given the vast reaches of space, and being millions of miles from home, and travelling at thousands of kilometres an hour, I thought that rather a success. After another half an hour of head scratching, and further burns in this direction and that, using the alignment of the sun and planets as a sextant of sorts, we ended up within 16 kilometres of the stranded capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother half an hour, and the 16 kilometres became 100 metres. It would all have been much easier if we had invented RCS thrusters yet, but we had not, and it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t stop us. We also hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t invented docking ports yet, Jebediah \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the now bearded and rather smelly stranded astronaut \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 threw himself from the capsule, and floated over to the rescue ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe finally splashed down on the good earth at about 2am. Two hours to rescue a stranded pretend astronaut, from pretend space, in a pretend disaster of my own making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then went to bed, and couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sleep for an hour, re-playing the mission in my head \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 wondering how we are going to recover the stranded capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T11:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHereby i reward you with (\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eimaginary\u003C/span\u003E) NOGLB badge.
