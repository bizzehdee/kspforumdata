There\u0027s going to be a whole lot to keep you busy over the next few months so you need to crack on and find a location for the base soon. The Kethane Scanners have picked up a huge indication of a resource a few hundred clicks away from where you are and all indications are that this would be the best place to set up shop. What we need you to do is scout the location out and find a decent amount of flat land. Once the ships enter Duna SOI they will all automatically deorbit right on top of wherever you are, don\u0027t worry it\u0027s perfectly safe I assure you but the point is if you are in a craggy valley then the payloads are not going to arriving at the surface in one piece.

Let\u0027s hope it all goes well for our brave veggie. Luckily the tractor module has been designed with a super wide wheel base, 6 wheel drive and steering. The centre of gravity is very low, and torgue wheels provide a little more stability than would otherwise be available. Connecting the base module and the tractor is done with a single docking port on flexible and shock absorbent mount, and you will notice the lack of struts. While this may appear to work against Jeb in his drive across Duna, in actual fact the flexibility of the chassis, and the link between the base and tractor will allow the whole thing to wobble and bounce through the bumps like a pro, cancelling out some of the judder and instability that you get from super rigid vehicles.

The missions are so costly that the only way to get return on investment is to start a space tourism industry. As previously mentioned there are more modules on the way, possibly doubling the size of the base, but that\u0027s for another day. More launches are planned and some really silly designs will see the light of day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paladin061","CreatedById":101068,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T22:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat mod is used for the base?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
