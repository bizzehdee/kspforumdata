Ususally your trip looks like 1300m/s burn for transfer, 1200m/s of course corrections due to her inclined and eccentric orbit, then about 3500m/s burn for capture. Then you\u0027Re rarely on the inclination you want, and it can be up to 600m/s to change to yours. So this makes a total 6500m/s to have a good orbit, but I remember having to use up to 7500, and not even having the desired inclination. The problem comes from the speed at which you approach Moho. It being so close to the sun you take a tremendous amount of speed by closing in to Kerbol and you have to cancel it all when you enter Moho\u0027s SOI, and her gravitational force being so low it barely helps you at all on the capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finnerty","CreatedById":61457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T06:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt did take a long burn at the encounter to get an orbit.
