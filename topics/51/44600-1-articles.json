I didn\u0027t want to waste the first launch window on a probe so I gambled with a modified version of my Mun lander and Mun Rover Skycrane. Docked them together on in LKO and boosted for Mars. Couple of flaws so far but I hope to at least land, if not also return the Kerbals home...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mode7","CreatedById":40585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T14:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!

Only my 3rd time being in interplanetary. First time was a \u0022failed\u0022 mission to Minmus. Time warped to far and into deep space I went. Then with the same probe going for Eve I failed and made a close sun orbit. Then this one(same probe as the failed Eve one) I was able to get an encounter and I\u0027ve been doing some stuff to make my orbit closer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chickenman297","CreatedById":69091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T21:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done SRG.
