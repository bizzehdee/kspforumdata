The Kerbal Space Administration will build and launch a three man expedition to Duna that will return safely after more than a year of doing science on the red planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it\u0027s everyone\u0027s dream come true, the prime minister did request a hefty budget cut that required a last minute redesign of the Wotan mothership and its subsystems. Instead of a single use station design that would stay at Duna even after the crew returns, a modular system will be designed that will return to Kerbin orbit in its entirety, to be restocked and reused for later missions. The Plans are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w381/Szkeptik/Wotan/screenshot5_zps13be0902.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5_zps13be0902.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Wotan is constructed in orbit from the mission-expansion section and the engine section.

Jeb returns into Duna orbit, but on a very unfortunate vector... and runs out of fuel. It seems the scientists at KSC made a grave miscalculation when they believed returning from Duna would be more costly on fuel than from Ike. Bob immediately jumps into lander A to return the favor to his friend, but not long after he undocks, Bill contacts him and tells him the computer did the calculations, and he does not have enough fuel to randezvous with the stranded Jeb. After a quick redock, Bob insists that they use the Wotan\u0027s main engines to do the rendezvous, but the mission directive strictly forbids the use of emergency fuel supplies if the mission itself is not in danger. Bill, as the designated Kerbal in command decides mission protocol is primary, and Jeb cannot be helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the while, Jeb, knowing the rules better than anyone and realizing his predicament, starts to expend his precious remaining energy to transmit the scientific results he collected on Ike\u0027s surface. The transmissions towards KSC continue for several minutes before the connection is lost and Jeb\u0027s lander goes dark forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob and Bill are heartbroken, but they must press on and the launch window back to Kerbin is not open for much longer. If they stay now they might get stranded around Duna as well. Bill sits at the helm, plots the couse and engages the return protocols. The Wotan sheds all the used scientific experiments, extra monopropellant and the now useless lander to minimise the fuel needed to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w381/Szkeptik/Wotan/screenshot44_zps279519e3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot44_zps279519e3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w381/Szkeptik/Wotan/screenshot46_zps656ec908.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot46_zps656ec908.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a good return vector to Kerbin.
