It still has fuel and lots of monopropellant. Of course, the side tanks that had the landing gear attached were dropped when it boosted back up from the surface of Duna to the mothership...but who knows when it might prove useful in the future? There is also the Clark Lander in orbit around Duna from that same mission (that lander had gone to Ike and then returned to the mothership).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I1RWS2e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I1RWS2e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
