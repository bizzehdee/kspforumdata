With infinite EVA fuel, it turns out it works! Which is surprising because AFAICT there\u0027s not enough thrust to do this...or your man isn\u0027t as heavy as he looks!\n\nAnyway I decided to do a grand tour with infinite fuel with my man, to visit and land at every place you touch down safely. It took 17 earth years but he made it. By far the trickiest thing is doing burns. You don\u0027t really know which way you\u0027re pointing, so each burn requires a bit of a \u0027feeler\u0027 to see if you\u0027re going (eg) prograde. (Also, the camera has major gimbal lock problems.) It actually became pretty good fun doing this. I tried different landing techniques, and as all burns are totally manual long burns to be caught in an SOI means you can burn long before reaching the SOI. For example, getting into Moho orbit needed 3\u002B km/s of dV. I burnt for a long time before reaching the SOI, constantly adjusting the orientation to keep the periapsis just where I wanted. This is tricky when you\u0027re doing single burns with mechjeb in a real craft...\n\nRight\n\n- take off from Kerbin\n- off to the mun, plus landing\n- Minmus\n- off into interplanetary space to reach Moho - with overheating on the way!\n- landing at Moho\n- Moho-\u003EGilly, landing there\n- Gilly-\u003EIke, landing there\n- Ike-\u003EDuna, landing\n- Dres, landing\n- aerobrake around Jool\n- Bop, landing\n- Pol, landing\n- Val, and a very heavy landing there!\n- a very long journey to Eeloo \u002B landing\n- a fast return to Kerbin \u002B aerobrake\n- a rendezvous with my craft...still in orbit! (he hit it face first at 30 m/s)\n- landing at KSC\n\nI\u0027ll feed him next time along the route.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
