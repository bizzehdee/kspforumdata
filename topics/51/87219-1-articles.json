It\u0027s early, so I don\u0027t have solar panels or fuel cells, but I do have batteries, so I packed a bunch on his ship. My mistake was counting on using the rocket engine to charge the battery each time I burned. I overestimated how much it would charge. A lot. I believe I needed about 3X the battery capacity on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there I am, with Bill 90% of the way to the Mun, and that\u0027s when I figure out that I won\u0027t be able to charge the batteries enough with the remaining fuel to do the mission. The ship was close to a free return trajectory, but then I figured out that it would take far too long to get back home that way. So, I refigured for a direct abort. It would be close, but Bill would go about an hour and a half without power, reenter, land, and recover with a few minutes to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way back, I burned all the fuel, both to return faster and to build up charge to keep the heater running. Then I ran into another problem. I realized the trajectory was not deep enough in the atmosphere to slow him down enough to reenter in a single pass. Normally, this would be OK; the trajectory would just take him around one orbit and drop back down, so he could just go around and reenter successfully the second time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, though, he would have been out of power for over two hours and be dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOOPS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news was that his flight path would pass over KSP before he would run out of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERESCUE MISSION!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quickly modified an existing ship with a probe core and an antenna, and launched it to rendezvous with Bill\u0027s dead ship. Of course, I needed to make rendezvous while the rescue ship still had line of sight to KSC, since I don\u0027t have any relay satellites yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As Bill\u0027s time ran down, I \u003Cstrong\u003Emay\u003C/strong\u003E have sent Bill on an EVA to make sure he would survive, since it appears that TACLS has a different countdown for power loss when you go EVA, even from a ship that is without power.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched, made several quick orbital adjustments, and I made the rendezvous, just as the rescue ship went over the horizon from KSC. (Using RemoteTech, remember?) Bill transferred over, and all was well...OR WAS IT?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I realized a little too late that Bill didn\u0027t grab the science data when leaving the dead ship. As I maneuvered the rescue ship for another rendezvous, both ships started reentering the atmosphere and were losing altitude pretty quickly, so I dropped that plan.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bill\u0027s rescue ship was heating up on reentry, I realized another problem known as NO PARACHUTE!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, the ship I had QUICKLY modified had a nosecone parachute, which I removed to place the Stayputnik (the only probe core I have available). When I removed the parachute, I hadn\u0027t added a replacement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill wasn\u0027t doomed yet, though. I set up the rescue ship with both a high TWR and a lot of delta V, to ensure it could make orbit and the rendezvous quickly and sloppily if necessary. At this point, it still had a fair amount of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I just waited out the heat, let air resistance slow down the ship as much as I dared, then I started burning to kill the last 200 m/s of delta v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBILL MADE IT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a clean landing and nothing broke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I didn\u0027t realize until AFTER he landed was that the ship had juuust a smidge of fuel left when he set down; just 38 m/s of delta v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s what made this my Toughest Rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-13T20:05:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2014 08:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gryphon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T14:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned that same lesson about batteries also.
