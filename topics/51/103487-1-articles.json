This new save is modded and played on science mode. Ohh and don\u0027t worry.... there will still be stupidly hilarious mistakes.

He took a petition to the government for a great space agency to be born. Of course everyone knows the government only signed it because they were hoping there would be cheese on the mun, and mint dessert on minmus. (Does kerbin even have a government?) And so they constructed a great space center only to realize that they knew next to nothing about space travel. And so the konstellation program was born. The aim, was to see how space travel actually worked, and if in fact pointing the pointy end up actually wasn\u0027t as crazy as it sounds....\n\nKonstallation 1\n\n \\*Succses\n\n \\*9 Science Data\n\n \\*Jebediah \n\n \\*3,297 funds\n\n \\*Low atmo, KSC\n\nKonstallation 2\n\n \\*Succes\n\n \\*9.5 Science data\n\n \\*Bob\n\n \\*3,297 funds\n\n \\*Low atmo, shores\n\nKonstallation 3\n\n \\*Succes\n\n \\*11.6 science data\n\n \\* Jebediah\n\n \\*4,842 funds\n\n \\*low/upper atmo, ocean\n\nKonstallation 4\n\n \\*Partial failure (didn\u0027t reach apoapsis above 70K)\n\n \\*7.6 science data\n\n \\*Bill\n\n \\*5,700 funds\n\n \\*Low/upper atmo, grasslands\n\nKonstillation 5\n\n \\*Succes\n\n \\*26.6 science data\n\n \\*Jebediah\n\n \\*9,950 funds\n\n \\*Low/upper atmo, High low space, highlands\n\nTotal\n\n- science data: 64.3\n\n-Funds: 27,086\n\n-missions: 5\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/WdSkh#0](http://imgur.com/a/WdSkh#0)\n\nEdit: now you can see the album\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T21:26:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Andrewx21**"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewx21","CreatedById":140332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T00:37:04Z","Content":"Orbiter program\n\n \\*When the kerbals realized that even though there kerbonauts where weightless in space, they were confused. Why were there rockets falling back to kerbin by them selves? Then a new scientist, that went by the name of gene kerman suggested this... \u0022What if we get enough speed sideways we fall around the planet not into it?\u0022 All the kerbals dismissed this idea as ridicules, so gene set out to prove them wrong. And so he began a project to put a satellite in orbit of kerbin! He managed to get funding from jebs junkyard. Jeb hoping to get the missions to himself, but jeb was disappointed in finding out they were unmanned. But he still was interested in the fireworks, so with jebs lawn chair by the launch pad, and a rocket primed to fire, the mission began.\n\nEndurance \n\n \\* Failure - Failed to reach orbit, burned up in atmo\n\n \\* 15,000 funds\n\n \\* 0 science data\n\n \\*upper/lower atmo, low kerbin orbit\u0027\n\nEndurance 2\n\n \\* Partial fail (didnt reach stable orbit, only degrading)\n\n \\* 14,656 funds\n\n \\* 0 science data\n\n \\*upper/lower atmo, low kerbin space, high kerbin space\n\nEndurance 3\n\n \\* Outstanding success (extra delta V puts satellite in orbit of the mun)\n\n \\*19,346 funds\n\n \\* 3 science data\n\n \\* Upper/lower atmo, low kerbing orbit, high kerin orbit, high mun orbit\n\nTotal:\n\n \\*49,002 funds\n\n \\* 3 science data\n\n\\* Missions 3\n\n [http://imgur.com/a/Z20Fg#0](http://imgur.com/a/Z20Fg#0)"}]}
