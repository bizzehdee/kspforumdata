Yes, that\u0027s right - the whole thing can safely land on any airless body but Tylo, detach the miners, refuel, and then reach orbit again. dV numbers vary a bit based on payload and fuel mix (the Rhino provides a nice TWR boost when needed, at the cost of dV), but my calculations put the range at about 5.2km/s max. ISRU allows for refueling on any airless body but Tylo, though, so as long as Emerald can make it to a suitable moon, its range is infinite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EICT-03 Exogenesis\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://assets.enjin.com.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6534493/pics/full/3418843.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223418843.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spiritual successor to the Atlas and Heron from my Sandbox save, Exogenesis is a big cargo carrier made mostly out of spaceplane parts, courtesy of Nertea\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699-1-04-Mark-IV-Spaceplane-System-The-redo-everything-update-bigger-and-better-%2824-07-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMk IV Spaceplane System\u003C/a\u003E.

I took the tried-and-true Peregrine platform from my Sandbox save and started tweaking it to make it more practical, with more payload, while still keeping it easy and fun to fly. The end product has been the workhorse of my space program since the moment I unlocked RAPIERs (which was surprisingly early, because I focused on spaceplane research). It only carries four kerbals and about 3-4 tons to orbit, but thanks to miniaturization efforts by R\u0026amp;D, I can get a lot done with that. A good flight profile will get it to orbit without touching the forward LF\u002BOX tank at all, giving the Peregrine XL 560m/s dV in an 80x80 orbit. Standard payload for the Peregrine XL consists of a small satellite with some science experiments and 3km/s dV, and a Duna-capable 4-kerbal lander (External command seats, yay!). To extend its range beyond LKO, the Peregrine can dock with a booster module (basically a LF tank with 2 NERVs on it) that gives it 4.5km/s extra dV. The Peregrine XL is really useful for transferring crew, completing kerbal rescue contracts, and deploying satellites and small probes for contracts. It\u0027s also very safe on descent - all heating issues have been worked out, it glides nicely, is stable with or without fuel and payload, glides well, and, in an emergency, has airbrakes and drogue chutes that ensure that the payload and crew survive the landing. The nose may get smashed up, but that\u0027s preferable to losing expensive science equipment or personnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have other SSTOs (including some heavy lifters and a SSTM), but I\u0027m having kraken issues and technical difficulties with some of them, so I won\u0027t post them here until I can figure out what\u0027s wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T01:31:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Goomblah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CAKE99","CreatedById":150099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T01:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you add a download for the save and crafts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd do you have screenshots of the missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso those are really good spacecraft, \u002Brep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T01:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I can provide downloads.
