I have a 10 ton to Orbit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E designed and it has worked perfectly in computer simulations.

Wernher, we will pursue the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E route for smaller payloads, and the TSTO route for the larger ones.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n***************\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThus, a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E was prepared with the objective to send light 10-12 ton of payloads to orbit. With the assistance of C7 Aerospace and the knowledge of Wernher Von Kerman, the dual mode R.A.P.I.E.R engine was perfected and was the main power-plant on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. It was projected that the savings from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E in that payload market, even if not large, would still be enough to recompense the development and fabrication cost after 20 reflights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter months of fabrication and quality control testing, the completed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E was rolled on to the runway for it\u0027s first developmental flight.
