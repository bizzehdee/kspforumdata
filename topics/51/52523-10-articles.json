Microwave Power helps a \u003Cstrong\u003ELOT\u003C/strong\u003E with achieving that without too large of a vessel- with enough beamed power, I can utilize the (ATTILA) afterburning arcjets you saw on my Sentar/Inaccessible probes on launch vehicles straight from the Munar or Dunar surface, for instance (this wouldn\u0027t work in the thick atmosphere and strong gravity well of Kerbin- but it\u0027s possible to do efficiently where the gravity-well is weaker...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) High-powered nuclear thermal or electric rocketry (with all the power of the huge and sufficiently powerful reactor beamed instead of the reactor mass residing on the vessel) is probably the only way I can reasonably expect to send a manned mission to the Sentar system and back without building a huge pancake rocket (I tend to avoid those for realism) or assembling a gigantic interplanetary ship in a huge number of small pieces in-orbit, considering there is no option to utilize ISRU there to save on mass for return fuel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) As of 0.23.5, Orbital Construction Re-Redux and Extraplanetary Launchpads both seem to be stimulating Kraken attacks when I build anything more than a modest-sized vessel with them... (this is going to create \u003Cstrong\u003Eserious\u003C/strong\u003E problems for my Duna colony- my plan involved initially consolidating resources into a massive orbital station...) As such, I will have to find ways to get by with less massive vessels in general- the excellent ISP\u0027s and TWR\u0027s that Microwave Beamed Power enables are one great way to do this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) I have a strong interest in seeing just how far I can take this current-day technology, that we could be using \u003Cstrong\u003ERIGHT NOW\u003C/strong\u003E to launch small rockets in real life- but without having to deal with as many budget restrictions as in real life (it costs something like $2 million for a basic 1 Megawatt gyrotron capable of being used like this in real life- although I am fairly sure the costs decrease per-Megawatt greatly with economies of scale and more powerful transmitters...) It will be interesting to try and apply the same approach with a new save in 0.24 though, due to budgets- if the costs are accurately balanced by KSP-Interstellar vs. other parts, usable amounts of Microwave Power (you need at least 100 MW to start thinking about launching rockets with it in real life- and only ones with *tiny* payloads on disposable lifting-body rockets at that power level) will become a SERIOUS investment (though still attainable, and capable of paying for itself with enough launches...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that\u0027s all for now. I\u0027ve written too much text- but I hope you guys (the readers) are looking forward to seeing my Duna and Munar colonization in full swing, and my manned mission to Sentar (this will be a plant-a-flag-and-go type thing, no sticking around long-term like on Duna...
