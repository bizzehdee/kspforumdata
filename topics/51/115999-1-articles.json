The Munar Module is a little bit over-fuelled, plus I forgot to add RCS (these will be fixed for future missions) but I got the craft to work. Next job is a Skylab analogue launched on the same booster.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The size of the Munar Module meant a 3.75m launcher was needed. With the revised aero model in 1.0, I\u0027ll probably be making more use of these parts- in previous versions I tended to just mount several 2.5m stacks side by side."}]}
