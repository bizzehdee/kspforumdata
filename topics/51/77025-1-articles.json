I used the name Janus rather then Kerminai, because, well I can\u0027t follow the instructions exactly? That would be very not Kerbal! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also corrected the number (edited the Wiki too) because it was Gemini VIII that had Neil and the faulty RCS that spun out of control, not IX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, I had a \u0022Real life\u0022 experience eerily similar...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Neil used a computer, I did too, using MechJeb to perform the rendezvous and docking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst issue was the rendezvous, where for some reason I shot past the target vehicle at considerable speed. Then the RCS went dead, leaving me drifting and spinning, I had Jeb override the autopilot, but all controls were unresponsive. No RCS, no main engine thrust, nothing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen just as mysteriously, all control returned. So, I manually altered course to return to the target vehicle. As I got close I triggered the docking autopilot and the thing went a bit wonky. At first it was violently oscilating back and forth. Just as I was about to abort the AP, it settled down, so I \u0022rode it out\u0022. As it neared the end, I realized I was off target by a bit (this was my first time using the docking AP, I usually do it manually, so I wasn\u0027t sure what was \u0022normal behavior\u0022). Moments later I hit the target vehicle, sending tumbling away. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly then did I realize I had no mono-propellant left.... I must have used it up doing the jitterbug on approach. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I had Jeb execute an emergency deorbit burn and landing...
