Or rather: M.A.R.C.E.L, as in Mobile Auto-Refueling Circumnavigating Eve Laboratory.\n\nMarcel was launched on a SSTO-duet of BIG rockets:\n\n![kUHgO96.png](http://i.imgur.com/kUHgO96.png)\n\n![I5v9oys.png](http://i.imgur.com/I5v9oys.png)\n\n![cItiK1Q.png](http://i.imgur.com/cItiK1Q.png)\n\nMarcel drove to Eve this way, rolling all over the stars.\n\nMarcel tried to aerocapture naievely at Eve after transit:\n\n![1J1465V.png](http://i.imgur.com/1J1465V.png)\n\n![eBGs7ih.gif](http://i.imgur.com/eBGs7ih.gif)\n\n![z1rwbOu.png](http://i.imgur.com/z1rwbOu.png)\n\nSo Marcel paused and thought: \u0022I cannot enter Eve\u0027s atmosphere above 4 km/s and survive, let alone keep my wheels. I have to brake first then pass into the top atmosphere to drop my apoapsis down.\u0022\n\n![k9LwwZm.png](http://i.imgur.com/k9LwwZm.png)\n\n![cDtSGNh.png](http://i.imgur.com/cDtSGNh.png)\n\n![XfJQysY.png](http://i.imgur.com/XfJQysY.png)\n\n![a05RhDS.png](http://i.imgur.com/a05RhDS.png)\n\n![dUFRboQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/dUFRboQ.png)\n\nThen there was a dramatic pause for SCIENCE!\n\n![EUbPv4A.png](http://i.imgur.com/EUbPv4A.png)\n\nAnd finally, came the landing:\n\n![e3MuXyY.png](http://i.imgur.com/e3MuXyY.png)\n\n![4GCLzlb.png](http://i.imgur.com/4GCLzlb.png)\n\n![JsOv4D7.png](http://i.imgur.com/JsOv4D7.png)\n\n![iEmpzqu.png](http://i.imgur.com/iEmpzqu.png)\n\n![jIkOu4l.png](http://i.imgur.com/jIkOu4l.png)\n\n![YxliQyq.png](http://i.imgur.com/YxliQyq.png)\n\n![iPChbmL.png](http://i.imgur.com/iPChbmL.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:09:54Z","Content":"Then, it was time for MOAR SCIENCE:\n\n![tEyvBh1.png](http://i.imgur.com/tEyvBh1.png)\n\n![6qwcRJS.png](http://i.imgur.com/6qwcRJS.png)\n\nAnd some refueling, too:\n\n![c4ecTq5.png](http://i.imgur.com/c4ecTq5.png)\n\n![7jLVUQI.png](http://i.imgur.com/7jLVUQI.png)\n\nAnd now, CONTEXT: *The last time I did a rover mission was back in 0.24, when I visited every biome of the Mun with the same science lab rover. Which took* *forever*. I had landed near the creviced crater, then went north-west to the other crevice through the canyon and crater bottom, then up the \u0022walls\u0022 and onto plateaus, circling between the procedural craters West then South to the polar region while passing more crater biomes. I couldn\u0027t do anything else in KSP for weeks, so much so that by the end of it I quit the game for month -, giving up on a promising Jool-5 challenge attempt.\n\nThis time was hardly different. Though I landed in a 3-biomed region, navigating halfway through the continent to the other 3-biomed zone took hours and hours and then more hours:\n\n![Lf0MRnv.png](http://i.imgur.com/Lf0MRnv.png)\n\n![dzrDd6z.png](http://i.imgur.com/dzrDd6z.png)\n\n![dfEAIyK.gif](http://i.imgur.com/dfEAIyK.gif)\n\n![5PZESfW.gif](http://i.imgur.com/5PZESfW.gif)\n\n![KepBnvM.gif](http://i.imgur.com/KepBnvM.gif)\n\n![fFYo52x.gif](http://i.imgur.com/fFYo52x.gif)\n\nThe most annoying part was having to stop after every downhill dash to repair the wheels:\n\n![x9RbK39.png](http://i.imgur.com/x9RbK39.png)\n\n![N5Zw48i.png](http://i.imgur.com/N5Zw48i.png)\n\nWheels in KSP are broken. They hardly have any traction in normal operation because otherwise they would have too much forward friction to get any speed (which is paradoxical), they have good traction while turning because of the huge sideways friction value they use to simulate being wheels and not skis, and you can\u0027t control those XLR-2 past 13.2 m/s: you lose accelerating, braking and turning abilities suddenly. In a slope, it means you can control your rover\u0027s descent by keeping \u0022back\u0022 pressed while zig-zagging (so you get some traction from the wheels while pressing \u0022left\u0022 and \u0022right\u0022) until you reach 13.2 m/s, and then it\u0027s just a ski ride. And the wheels break at 30 m/s.\n\nAnd there was the occasional slip-off:\n\n![uQETq60.png](http://i.imgur.com/uQETq60.png)\n\n![66l07VU.gif](http://i.imgur.com/66l07VU.gif)\n\n![wTfXIZx.gif](http://i.imgur.com/wTfXIZx.gif)\n\nSo, excessively long rides and annoying quirks of the Unity 4 wheel stuff. Otherwise, some of the most beautiful vistas and the richest science harvest to date in any of my KSP careers.\n\n![n1BqBOO.png](http://i.imgur.com/n1BqBOO.png)\n\nMarcel still has to drive up the tallest mountain in decent range, for some yet-unplanned, future return mission."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T14:52:21Z","Content":"Congrats on getting this beast down safely.
