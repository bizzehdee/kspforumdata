So one of the first things I did in the new career was take Jeb into orbit and run out of fuel.. nice one lol. Learned quicksmart from that how to intercept (had to do it three times in a row cos the first two that other starter pilot V-something took the only seat in the pod I sent up to save him and I didn\u0027t notice till he was hanging onto the side and couldn\u0027t board)\u00A0and from there basically everything in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E seemed pretty easy and I\u0027ve been doing loads of contracts saving\u00A0stranded Kerbals and putting up satellites\u00A0to make bank...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally got to a million funds about 3 days ago and\u00A0decided to do something for myself because a contract for it hadn\u0027t come up yet... A land and return\u00A0mission to the Mun! And I just finally did it.. 3 damn days! I can\u0027t believe how difficult that was compared to everything else I\u0027ve done so far! A bit less than ideal lmao, landed on my side on the stage before the actual lander, didn\u0027t wanna ditch the 1/4 tank of fuel it still had incase I needed it to get back (winging it with no mods and no idea how to work out \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E). Getting that thing back of the ground was a mission in itself! Ended up using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and a tiny bit of fuel to taxi it to the top of a hill, levered myself up sideways on the landing struts and blastoff! I can\u0027t even believe that worked. And I made it back with just enough fuel to retro burn into the atmosphere just enough to slow down and bring the whole lander stage back 100% intact.
