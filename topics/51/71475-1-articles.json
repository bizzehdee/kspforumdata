I\u0027ve had some issues with parts/kerbals \u0022sinking\u0022 a bit like quicksand in some areas, especially hilly ones. Also, just in cse you didnt know you can imbed an imgur album by taking the letters off of the end of the album name in the address bar (in your case the album name is \u0022zIYF2\u0022) and put it in to an imgur tag like [ imgur ] zIYF2 [ /imgur ] (without the spaces after the brackets).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DreadZombie","CreatedById":61662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T14:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you! Do you know what causes the sinking? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, again.

I normally run an ungodly number of mods, so it could be related to that, but like I said I havent taken the time to do a fresh install and test to see if its a location thing or not. I normally try to make sure I have plenty of clearance with landing gear and that seems to help. It\u0027s not everywhere, but I have found quite the issue on Duna in my Kult of the Kraken save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DreadZombie","CreatedById":61662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T16:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, okay. I run quite a lot of mods as well so it might be that, I never seen it happen on any of Macey Dean\u0027s videos and he ran on a vanilla game. I don\u0027t seem to have the problem with ship parts sinking anymore, it\u0027s only with Kerbals really. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t actually been everywhere yet, but from those I\u0027ve been to it\u0027s anywhere with an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
