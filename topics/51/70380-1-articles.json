I\u0027ve landed on The Mun, Minmus, Duna and I was going for a Ike Landing. Everything was going as planned, The ship undocked from the smaller sized ISS i made compared to my sandbox ones, Refueled for the landing then undocked and proceeded with mission. (No pictures for the ISS sorry!) So once we had a landing spot on the lighter side of Ike (I forgot to put lights on them...) I proceeded to land, Had mechjeb\u0027s help with pointing retrograde but that was it, other than the orbit info. We we\u0027re going for the descent burn, We finally landed jebediah as happy as ever... Once he took a surface sample and did an EVA Report, He put the flag of kerbin on the surface of Ike. -Insert Dramatic Space Accomplishment Music Here- Once he made it back in his ship... (We haven\u0027t invented ladders yet...) He did a final crew report on the surface, Once we finally got docked with the ISS and refueled we wen\u0027t back to kerbin and got in an orbit. We had just enough fuel to burn for the landing trajectory. Once we we\u0027re headed to kerbin i did the last few science junior reports and decoupled from the rocket leaving the capsule and it\u0027s parachutes. I deployed them so they would open at the right time. I time accelerated until i couldn\u0027t do regular time acceleration. I then physic warped until we started re-entering. Everything was going good, Jeb was going to say something heroic about the plight of kerbalkind in the huge universe, Only then he was cut off by radio chatter saying the situation is nominal. We opened our parachutes, Once we we\u0027re heading twords the ground the parachute failed somehow (A Glitch I\u0027m Sure) Plummeting poor brave jebediah kerman into the ground. All the science was gone, But more importantly my space program lost one of our bravest kerbals. R.I.P Jebediah Kerman 1st Landing - Ike Landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead this to honor his braveness!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
