Note that to save weight (the parachutes that were used to reduce the landing thrust requirement to minimal were blown away before launch with radial decouplers) only the parachutes on the lander can remain. Hopefully there is sufficient fuel to soften the landing back on Kerbin. So, the sample from Laythe was some of that funky ocean. Bill complained bitterly of the smell in the lander can after he reboarded:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IhNO0JO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IhNO0JO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the remains after the side tanks were jettisoned comes back to dock with the reduced ship (note that the big orange tank has now been discarded a it was empty by the time the final orbit around Laythe was established.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hgkCiGr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hgkCiGr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the happy gang is at Pol:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/btbakdk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022btbakdk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe support modules and Bill and Bob stayed in orbit while Jeb went down. Now they are back in orbit with Jeb sneezing all over the place after exposing himself to the dust from Pol. They are also having a bit of a discussion about what to do next. Jeb is positive they can manage manoeuvre to Val, land and take off and make it back to Kerbin intact, Bill thinks they should go for Bop and return to Kerbin, while Bob says go back to Kerbin now \u0027cause he just wants to have plenty of margin in case anything goes wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
