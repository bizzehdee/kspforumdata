I made a fine tug, but it wasn\u0027t nearly maneuverable enough... Probably everyone already knows my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/sharpy/Claymore-Asteroid-Wrangler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClaymore\u003C/a\u003E, because I brag about it left and right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, after revival of KSP, as soon as I could afford it, I pulled up Claymore out of old save folder, and quickly grabbed a Class E asteroid. One afternoon, and I had it in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. At first I planned a base around it, but first, orbit of 100km is terrible for any large projects because not only night lasts 50% of the time, there\u0027s no good time acceleration and my early base designs were... um, faulty to say the least. Plus asteroid physics is really, really glitchy. Things get... explodey around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen... the game refused to spawn another class E for a long time. I launched a bunch of missions and occupied myself with other stuff, draining the one captured asteroid dry in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, at last the game spawned another one. Not crossing Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E so I had to send Claymore on a chase in Sun orbit, but it\u0027s a fine craft, the job wasn\u0027t a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI parked the new asteroid in 250km orbit, and began plotting...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need to dock it, like one docks a craft. I can\u0027t just do the trick with turning around to get the flight direction right. I need a true, fully-featured \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. But what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E can do a thing like this?? Lots and lots of vernors? No, that\u0027s an awful idea. Monoprop is right off. It\u0027s a goddamned asteroid, and it needs asteroid-sized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd thus, the asteroidal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E project was born.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I made a thruster block.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U2IixJM.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U2IixJM.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerospikes are small enough so that the thing doesn\u0027t grow huge, they have a decent ISp, decent thrust...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI clipped a small tank, probe core and a battery inside (they are actually attached to the node at the tip of the top-most thruster...) Klaw, a bunch of surface lights which I had planned to use as indicators until I realized with them mounted on the thruster blocks all over the asteroid I won\u0027t be able to read anything out of them. So the ones that would be toggled had to go, but the color ones stayed - as labels. And I knew I\u0027d need a control hub...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen came the trickiest part. Instead of switching the computer on, that evening I spent with a pencil and a sheet of paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dcO4jTq.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dcO4jTq.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpper left - action groups. 3 translations, 3 rotations, each in two directions - that\u0027s 12 action groups. I used all 10 for the more immediately needed ones, and gear and abort for roll, which wasn\u0027t as necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour thruster blocks around the asteroid. Hub in front. A fuel tank in the rear, because the first asteroid was depleted - later I planned using ISRU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I planned the markings for the thruster blocks. Each of the thruster blocks is unique. I named them for colors on the top thrusters - Blue, Cyan, Purple and Orange. All engines with blue light point up. All purple point down. Orange point left, Cyan point right. Red is for Forward, Green is for Back. Except each thruster was 90 degrees from the neighbor. I planned their locations in the carrier craft, then I wrote which action groups assign to which color engine on which thruster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I planned the hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt started with MK1 inline cockpit, due to its excellent visibility. And I built a hud of the surface-mounted lights offset from the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002212oxOLE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/12oxOLE.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one lit shows \u0022Pitch Down\u0022 active. The one below it is \u0022Translate Down\u0022. I\u0027ll post a screenie with all lit later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the thing grew. It would need to be able to connect the asteroids. It would be very inelegant if it was not reusable after the operation. It also needed the ISRU, and not the toy one, because maneuvering for an encounter we\u0027re operating on a tight schedule and we need the fuel fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe resulting form factor was... uh, so ugly it was pretty. I called the thingy Ugly Duckling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222z4BMJf.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2z4BMJf.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this is the Ugly Duckling carrying a crossbar, gripping it with airbrakes. (to align length-wise)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI packed the thrusters onto a rocket...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TRqwthW.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TRqwthW.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I made a rather simplish fuel carrier, and began the arduous work of docking it all to the asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022moAx4F3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/moAx4F3.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNight was my bane. I didn\u0027t think of wide-area lights for Ugly Duckling or the carrier. I docked the carrier at night, and since without the booster it flies on monoprop \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E only, I barely did it before running out of monoprop, so the alignment was poor. I decided to follow up with the rest aligning it to the carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut day was too short again, so I just docked the thrusters haphazardly and deorbited their carrier. Luckily, they *were* color-coded, and after resupplying their fuel, I was able to dock them \u003Cem\u003Eroughly\u003C/em\u003E at compass points respective to the fuel carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DXPW61O.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DXPW61O.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I moved the duckling to the center opposite, and began testing the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjaLqR_4nto?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt worked fine... with one exception.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrossfeed. The fuel just wouldn\u0027t flow up the Klaws. Aerospikes would drain the tiny tanks clipped in in matter of seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/146915-crossfeed-problem/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Easked \u003C/a\u003Ehow to solve this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while now I have solemn thanks to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166883-palaceviking/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022166883\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166883-palaceviking/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Palaceviking\u003C/a\u003E, at one point I wanted to curse him to hell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe told me to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports and pipes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s a Class E asteroid! The stuff is too far apart for single segments of pipe!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first, I sent a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E box of CB1 Ground Bases and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports. Did you know you can attach the Ground Base to a planet, but NOT to an asteroid?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo instead, I sent a carrier of tiny \u0022nodes\u0022 - probes, each equipped with two ports, Oscar B, HECS, two spiders and some solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I say asteroid physics is buggy? It is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224EUJfqo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4EUJfqo.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probes were quite agile, able to stop and hover right where needed above the asteroid, and the Kerbal engineer easily built the pipelines, sometimes three segments long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, as night came, I sent the engineer back to the cockpit... and before reaching it, I heard explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoad. Explosions again. Load and checking what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPipelines shaking wildly, throwing orange tanks ripped off the carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI retried it several times over. Time warp would calm the shaking for a couple seconds, so the kerbal managed to reach the cockpit with several segments of time warp. I went to the tracking station, saved my game and left it for another day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext day, the infrastructure would still explode seconds after loading the ship... but I noticed it takes good 30s from game load to explosions. So, the kerbal goes EVA, save, load. The kerbal flies a bit ahead, save, load. The kerbal reaches the pipelines, save, load. The kerbal approaches the thruster block rapidly, save, load. The kerbal crashes into the asteroid, sent spinning. Meanwhile, everything explodes. Load. The kerbal crashes into the asteroid... Load, and brake hard. The kerbal crashes into the asteroid...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I realized I didn\u0027t make any real progress since the tests of the asteroidal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, for which I have a named save. All I did were the pipelines, and they were a failure!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I went to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and just loaded that save, a good two game days earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI upgraded the \u0022nodes\u0022 with Klaws tweakscaled to MK0. I sent them again. I repeated the work, docking each node to the asteroid first. I didn\u0027t draw all the fuel lines to the carrier, instead drew them to one thruster, and then branched off to the remaining ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plumbing looked quite impressive... and it didn\u0027t explode!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QOcCjZN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QOcCjZN.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O2zrXHl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O2zrXHl.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I saved, set up the encounter, used the Pitch and Yaw action groups to get the node right, and when the time to perform the node burn came... I sent the asteroid into a wild spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thrusters were misaligned relative to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried thrust limiter to reduce the spin. It wasn\u0027t very effective, but it worked... kinda. I botched the first maneuver badly, good 30km away from my encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, correction after correction, node after node, I was learning to handle the asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemembering to switch off an action after I finish the burn. Increasing throttle just a little instead of pressing Z. Switching control back to the goddamned cockpit after the game decided to pass control over everything to one of the HECS on the fuel line nodes (ARGH!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe breakthrough came when I switched normal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thruster blocks were adequately supplied with Vernors, just to be able to maneuver them into place and dock where needed on the asteroid. I didn\u0027t expect the vernors to do much once docked. But they did. As I set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022Node\u0022, and started a burn, I saw the Vernors fight a losing battle to keep the asteroid from spinning, as the thrust limiter was set \u0022by hunch\u0022 on the off-center engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027d slide the thrust limiter until Vernors on that block would nearly switch off - and with the engines finally balanced, Vernors were all that was needed to retain that balance and adjust for all errors and imprecisions! Aerospikes provided the power needed to move the asteroid - Vernors were that \u0022last mile\u0022 needed for truly precise \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last, regretfully, I saw that I had finally mastered the asteroidal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I was left with 30m/s of delta-V to correct my past mistakes, make the encounter and dock. No way I could do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen even before that, the aerospikes sputtered out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sour note after the success. Oh well. I\u0027ll need to send another tanker, dock it, fix the piping, by that time the semi-decent encounter I had would be long gone...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere the heck do I still have that 30m/s of fuel if the aerospikes are starved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Truth of the matter - in Duckling\u0027s tanks and its single Terrier, but I realized that much later...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did the easy thing. Opened the Resources, and hovered over the Fuel bar... noticing it\u0027s depleted roughly halfway. What?! I hovered harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe carrier has three orange tanks. The pipe is connected to one. The others were hardly touched, only as much as the Vernors pulled out of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat really made my day. I began pumping fuel, and soon my delta-V was well over 200! I turned to the node, performed the burn, prepared a node for the encounter, and warped there. A neat retrograde burn, and save! The final approach began!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AgFsdGA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AgFsdGA.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kKiXXS5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kKiXXS5.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI approached at some 3m/s, then braked to 2...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep struggling with the navball to rotate the Klaw to target\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and... crashed. Surprisingly, no explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI switched time warp 5x to arrest rotation of the two asteroids, left it and unsurprisingly... explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI loaded and began the approach again. This time I switched \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off, and used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E manually to turn. I\u0027d no longer use the aerospikes - the very precise movement was done purely through Vernors.
