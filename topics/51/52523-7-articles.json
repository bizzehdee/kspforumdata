The idea will be to construct a space station large enough to construct an Orion in-orbit; which will both alleviate the roleplaying issues of detonating thermonuclear devices in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and also allow me to make use of this system\u0027s unparallelled ISP and thrust to move *MASSIVE* payloads to the Duna system...

When toying with my design of Heavy Fuel Lander for the Munar colony (I designed two classes of fuel lander- a light one designed mostly for rescue operations, and a heavier one designed mainly for servicing my Munar outpost\u0027s fuel-production facilities), the idea struck me for some reason to try out building it with Orbital Construction now that I had delivered additional RocketParts to the Munar Spacedock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c76avrj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c76avrj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027ll see, quite clearly this lander can be built at ANY of three spacedocks- the 350 km Depot, the Munar Spacedock, or the Duna Heavy Equipment Deployment Platform. This is despite the fact that *ONLY* the Munar Spacedock received any additional RocketParts, and previously vessels like this lander (and in fact much lighter than this lander) could not be constructed any of my 4 spacedocks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy new theory is that the issues I was having with OrbitalConstruction resulted from having the Spacedock Identifier and the RocketParts storage on two different vessels which were technically only docked with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, providing the Munar Spacedock with RocketParts circumvented the detection issue- likely as it was another vessel IN THE SAME SYSTEM as the 350 km Depot. Prior to that, only the Minmus Spacedock provided an alternative building location in the Kerbin system (which would explain the size limit of exactly 0.16 tons I was experiencing on vessels I could build prior to providing additional RocketParts to the Munar Spacedock- the Minmus Spacedock holds exactly 0.16 tons of RocketParts at the moment) as the DHEDP is somewhere out in Kerbol orbit en-route to Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this is the first time I have had this problem, and Extraplanetary Launchpads is known to be having some bugs/issues of its own with its orbital construction system at the moment, I will probably just persevere with using Orbital Construction Re-Redux mod for my orbital construction needs. I will have to be careful to build at the 350 km depot BEFORE I use up any of the RocketParts on the Munar Spacedock however, as I won\u0027t be able to build any craft larger than the current RocketParts stock of the Munar Spacedock at the 350 km depot until this issue is resolved (likely by building an intermediary craft with a Spacedock Identifier *AND* a RocketParts storage module at the 350 km depot, and then building the larger planned spacedock from there- as the new spacedock design weighs in at almost 120 tons- far more than the current RocketParts stock on the Munar Spacedock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll get things worked out somehow.

Nor did dumping the 350 km Depot\u0027s remaining RocketParts or undocking it from its Spacedock Identifier (in F5/F9 \u0022simulations\u0022) help either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Orbital Construction continues to act up like a spoiled child on crack/cocaine, and I have no idea how to fix it... I should have just stuck with building the rescue vehicle at the Munar Spacedock earlier when I still could, and then worried about fixing the 350 km depot later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best bet at this point is probably to send another RocketParts Tanker up, and top back off the 350 km Depot. Meanwhile, the fully-fueled RocketParts Tanker at 350 km will head off to Minmus to eventually rendezvous with the Minmus Spacedock when it arrives, if that doesn\u0027t fix the problem. Yeah, that should work... hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-25T22:49:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2014 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
