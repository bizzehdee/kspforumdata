Shocking! I call myself a veteran, with well over 1000 hours (though I don\u0027t have records of this, I\u0027m fairly sure) of play over the years since version 0.20.2, but I still haven\u0027t managed to actually \u0022complete\u0022 the game as far as actually visiting all the objects available. Thus, since the transfer window to Moho is the first to occur in my new Career (after spending the first 110 days or so completing the tech tree by thoroughly scrubbing Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus for Science), I\u0027m taking the opportunity to document the adventure as a sort of refresher course for myself before taking on the Ultimate Jool-5 Challenge once more (since it\u0027s been literal years since I last put down the game).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this expedition, I had been made aware that trips to Moho and back often take far more delta-V than one would expect, especially eschewing a gravity assist from Eve and the extra mission time that would entail, so I set my goal at 10 km/s and a maximum acceleration of at least 0.20 gees to avoid excessively long maneuver burns. I prepared what I considered the necessary payload and, based on its total mass, set about drafting some hull designs in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, whereupon I discovered that the ship could certainly meet my needs, but it would be very, very large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f4IuZFa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002271.11\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u00221080\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/f4IuZFa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of you may remember my \u0022Sights of Kidonia\u0022 thread from a few years ago wherein I built a grand mothership to tackle the Jool-5 Challenge. While I eventually finished orbital assembly and performed the ejection burn from Kerbin, while it was en route real life got in my way, followed by several updates to the game that altered part geometry and made some of the mission components unusable. The final fatal obstacle was that, once I picked up KSP again a few weeks ago, I discovered whilst doing a test run in a simple ion probe that Kidonia probably never would have been able to complete the full mission for lack of delta-V. It had been designed with just over 9 km/s in total, but that only meets the requirements of a Jool-5 Challenge mission \u003Cem\u003Enominally\u003C/em\u003E, i.e. in real life one is unlikely to pull off the mission with that much delta-V with extreme luck, extremely meticulous planning, or a lot of gravity assists and thus a very long mission time. In any case, this thing is... comparable in size and has less than half the payload mass. On the one hand, I\u0027m pleased that this gives me an excuse to build an even huger ship for next time, but on the other, increased sophistication in KSP\u0027s code base appears to have made the game less performant when operating ships with enormous part counts, so it might be a taller order than I can handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut enough about \u003Cem\u003EJool\u003C/em\u003E. This is a \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E mission!

This infographic explains more:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022v625Om1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002250.00\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/v625Om1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, those are the real figures. As I mentioned above this ship is very large and approaches the old \u003Cem\u003EKidonia\u003C/em\u003E in scale and complexity. It was planned to be assembled in orbit over the course of seven launches (though in practice more ended up being needed): The command and payload section, the drive core, the four side pods, and the payload. The latter is designed to be stowed and carried as a unit, but itself consists of a number of components:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe portable station core is designed to be a fully functional space station complete with relay antenna, mobile lab, housing for five Kerbals in total, reserves of all necessary resources, and a full suite of scientific instruments - and to stow within a single Mk3 Cargo Bay CRG-100 with no use of robotic parts so that it can be used by people who don\u0027t own the Breaking Ground DLC.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe light scientific lander attached to the core is designed to be (at least nominally) capable of landing on and ascending from Duna or any smaller object, most relevantly including Moho. It includes all scientific instruments except for the materials bay, and as a single stage, it can be refueled at the station and used again indefinitely.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Ion Surveyor is what the name implies, an ion-propelled probe that can launch from the station and perform orbital resource surveys. This may come in handy locating the Mohole or any other Easter eggs that might be present.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E upgrade is a separate package that can attach to the core and itself stows within a Mk3 Cargo Bay CRG-25. It features a small reusable lander with mining drills to procure ore and a facility for storing and refining the ore on the station in the form of a storage tank, a small resource conversion refinery, and four radiator panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the mothership would be unreasonably large and heavy to launch as a single monolithic unit, it is designed as two central sections that can be augmented with up to four side-mounted drive pods. Each of these attaches via two docking ports to ensure alignment and structural stability, while the central components join each other via a larger array of five ports. In theory this same hull can be repurposed for other missions with variable amounts of delta-V and thrust based on how many drive pods are installed. Each drive pod itself weighs over 100 tons and has the necessary thrust and delta-V to power an interplanetary voyage singlehandedly, though it lacks a probe core or any other facilities for executing a fruitful mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the front is a 10m Heat Shield. This isn\u0027t strictly necessary in the vicinity of Moho, but serves an aesthetic and roleplaying purpose as a debris shield and large dish to enhance the transmitting power of the communications antenna. Nestled under it are radiothermal generators, a large electric battery, the main control core, and four Science containers that allow the mothership to return to Kerbin on its own and deliver Science data from the mission. The ship isn\u0027t intended to land, but can rendezvous with a shuttle to retrieve the data and bring it to the Space Center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe command and payload section does also include an array of eight solar panels, which shouldn\u0027t be necessary due to the presence of the RTGs but serve an aesthetic purpose and may provide auxiliary power during times of high usage such as aligning for maneuvers and performing scientific research while the lab is stowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the option of adding additional crew housing to enable the crew to return to Kerbin in the mothership or to bring additional crew members, but decided against it in the interest of minimizing payload mass. I can prepare crew rotation missions later to retrieve the initial crew and replace them with new members so that no Kerbal is doomed to a lifetime away from home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny questions or suggestions are invited! Stay tuned for orbital assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-01T11:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EPart Two: Assembly\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfession time: I didn\u0027t manage to remember to catch screenshots of every critical part of the orbital assembly process. This is something I\u0027ll need to do for the Jool-5 Challenge later, so it was a good call practicing during this mission. Anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oPF2c8k.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oPF2c8k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first component launched was the command and payload section. As it consisted almost entirely of an empty cargo bay, despite its size it was surprisingly light and easily handled by my 50 ton launch vehicle. It was placed in a 305 km orbit just above the threshold at which Kerbin\u0027s procedural terrain system deactivates and thus the game\u0027s performance is slightly improved. This has the added benefit of providing a generous margin for the periapsis to drift during the later ejection burn without it entering the atmosphere and causing efficiency loss due to drag, or worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xZlEKKg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xZlEKKg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext the Drive Core was launched. I made a small oversight here: the drive core has no command modules and is thus unable to control itself, and the command and payload section has no propulsion systems. Thus the Drive Core was carefully parked near the command and payload section in a very similar orbit so as to minimize them drifting apart over time, and then a third launch brought up a heavy-duty space tug with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to maneuver the Drive Core and attach it to the command and payload section. The actual launch of the drive core was my first omission here; second was the attachment operation, which consisted of very carefully aligning all five of the docking ports seen here near the bottom of the image and docking them all at once. As is normal for such an operation, it was necessary to undock and re-dock a few times before all five ports attached properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bGmrUlF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bGmrUlF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour more launches brought the Drive Pods into orbit. Seen here is the new 100 ton launch vehicle I developed to launch the Drive Core. Unfortunately, it was not able to launch either the Drive Core or any of the Drive Pods while they were fully fueled, and thus additional launches were planned for bringing fuel to the ship. Later, though, I instead decided to build an even larger 150 ton launch vehicle able to carry each Drive Pod all the way to a 305 km orbit and rendezvous with the mothership so that there wouldn\u0027t need to be too many extra launches, considering that the transfer window was already open and there were less than nine hours left before the optimal point in the middle of it. Disappointingly I neglected to capture any shots of the 150 ton vehicle at work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223VczBpO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3VczBpO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince, like the Drive Core, the Drive Pods lacked their own control or propulsion systems, installing them was a more difficult task than anticipated. They had been designed to have minimal extraneous parts, and thus had no extra docking ports to use for maneuvering them into place. I didn\u0027t want to use the Advanced Grabbing Unit (\u0022Klaw\u0022) if possible, as past experiences have shown me that its use carries a risk of damage to the ship due to the parts tree being reorganized and rotation errors occurring due to the hinge on the unit, even if the hinge was kept locked the whole time. Thus what I had to do was detach each Drive Pod, leaving it to float on its own, and then painstakingly maneuver the mothership into alignment with its docking ports. This again required retries at a few points, but eventually I managed to get everything attached.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne last omission in this part was the launch and installation of the payload and the crew aboard it, which occurred just after installing the Drive Pods. Here, now that the payload has been installed safely, Benjamin Kerman, the engineer, has disembarked and is inspecting the docking ports, taking a close look at each pair to ensure they are all precisely aligned within a narrow tolerance. The most any pair deviated was a few barely visible centimeters, so with any luck this shouldn\u0027t be a source of issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nd0dDPj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nd0dDPj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that the ship was fully assembled, all that was left to do was to top off its fuel tanks before sending it on its way. It needed a total of about 16000 units, so multiple large fuel tankers had to be sent to accomplish the task. Two large fuel tankers, including the one shown here, handled the bulk of this, and then a third smaller fuel tanker (not pictured, sorry again) took care of the last bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CRL45Ec.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CRL45Ec.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I had made \u003Cem\u003Eyet another oversight\u003C/em\u003E during this process and forgot to lock the fuel tanks on the payload or disable crossfeed on the port attaching it to its launch vehicle, and thus during the launch the vehicle had sucked most of the fuel out of it, and I didn\u0027t end up noticing until after the assembly was complete. Thus I had to have the third fuel tanker refill every single one of the numerous little fuel tanks on the landers and portable station core and then properly lock them, which was, as one might guess, very tedious and frustrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo ALL the fuel transfers!\u003Cbr\u003E\n...Do \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the fuel transfers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT HEY, now it\u0027s (I\u0027m pretty sure, I did check like four times) finally completely fueled (I even had the last tanker put a little bit of extra oxidizer in the mothership to give the scientific lander an extra load) and ready to depart for Moho! I ended up about nine hours late for the midpoint of the transfer window, which is doubly bad in light of the hours it\u0027ll probably take executing the ejection if I do it over multiple burns, but honestly it should have a minimal effect on the delta-V expenditure overall. This marks as far as I got before starting this thread, so further progress will have to come at a later time. Stay tuned for departure to Moho and then the tale of my recovery of all the launch vehicles I had to send up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerballingSmasher","CreatedById":195689,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-01T14:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne question, HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU PRONOUNCE THAT NAME?!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-02T07:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EPart Three: Departure\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce all the pre-departure checks were completed and then themselves checked, the small fuel tanker and space tug attached to the Phthanophaneron were detached and a course was plotted. At first I cleverly set up a maneuver node that would bring the ship to Moho at its descending node, allowing me to skip an inclination correction altogether, and executed the 18-minute burn it entailed, but upon completion I discovered that not only had Kerbin\u0027s gravitational influence over the course of the burn caused me to waste nearly a kilometer per second of delta-V and caused my trajectory to be wrong, but the planned course wouldn\u0027t have even worked in the first place. When plotting the capture maneuver, I found it would require over 6000 m/s and thus use up nearly all of the ship\u0027s remaining fuel, leaving it unable to make a return trip. I could have resigned myself to performing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and thus doing a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E or repetitive trips with the mining bot and spending a very long time in orbit slowly processing all of the ore into fuel with the small refinery, but one might imagine how entirely unreasonable an idea that was. I shudder to think of calculating how many trips and how much time that would entail, let alone consider doing it.

Despite the massive inclination correction maneuver of over 2000 m/s, this course nominally only consumed 6532 m/s of delta-V, leaving 3483 for the return trip, more than would be needed for either the departure burn or the capture burn and thus presumably plenty for a rendezvous with Kerbin, though I would have to be careful about inclination and have to perform some aerobraking and possibly a gravity assist using the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022m6OjKsA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/m6OjKsA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus the Phthanophaneron departed and benefited from a shorter and more efficient ejection burn, resulting in a more precise trajectory and smaller gravity losses, even though the ship was pitched up nearly sixty degrees when the maneuver was finished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222LLjW4L.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2LLjW4L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a fortuitous turn of events, the resulting trajectory required smaller maneuvers later and thus a new projection of 3695 m/s of delta-V left after arrival, which was very satisfying.

Once construction was complete, the Space Program was again rather short on funding, but thanks to managing to land all of the remaining launch vehicles vaguely near the Space Center, much of the prior expenditure was recouped. One of the two remaining 100-ton launch vehicles ended up without enough delta-V to make it all the way to a suborbital trajectory, so instead it parked itself in a 200km orbit to await recovery at a later date, while the other managed only a barely suborbital trajectory and went through multiple aerobraking passes before landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227K0N90N.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002284.38\u0022 height=\u00221012\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7K0N90N.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext the fuel tankers were retrieved. One of the large tankers had a little extra fuel left, so the space tug and small fuel tanker docked with it and took most of the remaining fuel, leaving just enough for the tanker to deorbit itself. The two smaller ships proceeded to dock with my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E space station and then the tanker descended for recovery.

During this time, however, the Space Program has the rapidly approaching Jool transfer window to address. Some crew rotations have begun and some orbiting clutter (such as extraneous relays and outmoded station modules) is being cleaned up, and Mission Control is searching for lucrative contracts to build up as much capital as possible before attempting to construct a ship to explore Jool. That, however, is a mission for another thread.
