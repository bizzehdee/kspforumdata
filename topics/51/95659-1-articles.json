The two Titan stages provide plenty of fuel to put the capsule into a fairly high LKO, with lots of margin left over. (The Gemini here also has much more delta-v capacity with its O-10 Monopropellant Engines than the real one would have... but using any of the other monopropellant tanks would have messed up the vehicle\u0027s appearance, so I had to use the largest one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GIlkl2X.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GIlkl2X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI placed the capsule into a moderately high LKO with the GLV, circularizing at about 160km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UMpUal4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UMpUal4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur brave Kerbonaut replicates Edward White\u0027s pioneering EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter successfully completing the \u0022tethered\u0022 EVA, the capsule returned safely to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
