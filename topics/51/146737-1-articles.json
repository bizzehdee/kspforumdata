Stage 4 (2) was just barely enough to get me in a circular 400KM orbit of Europa, starting from just after my Jupiter Capture Burn. Stage 5 (0) is the Europa lander - it might be able to manage Luna if you make a perfect approach.

The RD-107s are a fair bit better than F1-As due to higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, which at this scale offsets the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E difference.

The central core is 6 SSMEs - it is sized in tandem with the Radial boosters to provide enough power to reach orbit. The third stage is basically a 2.5x scale Saturn V third stage using two uprated J2-X engines - they were the best large, restartable Hydrolox engines I had. The Fourth stage uses 4 Aestus-II engines - they have a 340s Vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E which is very impressive for Hypergolic fuel. Kerolox or Hydrolox boils off on the way to Jupiter, and a solution to this was simply to use storable fuels.
