The usual routine of waking up, trying to call their friends on the ground, then going about doing not much of anything. Only the scientists were busy, always devising some experiments to keep themselves busy in the lab. Right now Barbara was deep into some strange genetics experiment involving a Mystery Goo and some cheese doodles. It wasn\u0027t one of Rozor\u0027s experiments, and he wasn\u0027t sure he really wanted to know where she got the idea. All he wanted right now was kaffeine. Koffee. Khokolate. Anything to give him that kick. Maybe he could work something up in the lab? No, best not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had been years since their last resupply. So far the important supplies had held out, the snacks and water, but they were seriously lacking in the luxuries department. Rosuki had left many munths ago, promising to make contact with some of her friends on the ground. Arrange for a new supply launch, or perhaps even a rescue. None of them had heard much from her since. Just promises that disappeared into nothing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the last year or so their prisoner, The Party Boss, had fully integrated into the crew. At first they had kept him confined to one of the broken Nitrogen orbital modules. That proved to be more trouble than it was worth, so they agreed to let him join them in the station if he promised not to steal a ship or kill them in their sleep. This approach worked better than munths of interrogation, and he soon opened up to his new crew mates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Party Boss turned out to be an ok kerbal. He had once been a simple tourist, Enwise Kerman, husband of Kaigh. They had both taken an orbital vacation aboard the Exploration 13 O3. It was a simple flight; their craft rendezvoused with another couple aboard the Exploration 14 O3 and then returned to Kerbin. And yet sometime later, long after they landed, everything went horribly wrong. In the chaos Kaigh had been killed, and Enwise was taken with anger. They kept him locked away in an asylum, only to be released by The First Citizen himself. That was many cycles ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow he was just another Forgotten Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRozor spent most of the morning staring out at the stars, hoping a tin of koffee would float past. He wasn\u0027t sure at first, but he thought the stars were moving. They were always moving, he guessed, but now they weren\u0027t moving like they should. Or was it the ship? He tried not to look at Kerbin, tried to avoid that feeling of vertigo. Too late. One glance and his stomach turned. He snapped his head back up at the stars, hoping the feeling would subside. And that\u0027s when he noticed the solar arrays were waving at him.

An alarm sounded as one of the station\u0027s seals broke. The atmosphere was holding, mostly, but the vibrations were tossing kerbals around violently.

There were ten of them including Enwise, leaving only one empty seat between the Sulphur and the Titanium. Five in each. Rozor didn\u0027t grab anything except a helmet. How could he? It was a minefield of small debris inside the station now, and anything he wanted would\u0027ve been impossible to find. By the time they were moving down the tube to the Titanium 4 the station was shifting so much that anything they tried to grab was in a different place by the time their hands reached it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only good news was the whole ordeal had made Rozor forget his vertigo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe crawled into the Titanium to find Tetris bringing the ship online. Two other kerbals followed him in: Mardi and their prisoner, Enwise. Edsel called from the Sulphur, reporting they had five and were at capacity. Rondous, Steve, Verly and Elkin were with him. Rozor gave him the order to undock and strapped himself into the Titanium\u0027s cabin.

He radioed back the acknowledgement, then unlatched himself and turned to check the hatch. The lights blinked, casting the station into darkness. A dark shape appeared as he looked into the docking tube, working its way down towards them. Barbara. Had to be. A screech filled his headset as he reached up and pulled her in.

It took a few moments for her to get the ship under control. The station\u0027s writing and roiling only worsened as they backed away from it. Perhaps Sieta had been right about her ghosts. Kelgee was either haunted or cursed. Best to leave it behind and find saner lands. He didn\u0027t think it was possible, but the further from the station they got, the worse it deformed. No sane force could be responsible for such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsel called them up to report he had worked out a rendezvous, and would dock with them before they passed the terminator.

Where\u0027s the ship!?\u0022 It was Barbara, voice coming across the ship to ship radio. Rozor glanced around the cabin doing a quick head count. Tetris was in the cockpit; Mardi and Enwise were across the aisle. He unstrapped to look at the kerbal seated behind him, and was surprised to find Tetris looking back at him. Terror filled her face. He turned around and looked at the cockpit again, where Tetris was looking back with her hand raised up as if to ask \u0022what the hell?\u0022 Another glance to the seat behind him and it was empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She,\u0022 Rozor pointed at the empty seat, \u0022She was JUST HERE!\u0022 Oh dear, oh dear.

Before she knew it they were approaching the dark mass of recycled metal that was the Chlorine fleet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs was only right and proper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0155_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022559\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0155_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere wasn\u0027t as much fuel left as they thought there would be, at least until they remembered the pirates. Of course Hallock and Sieta had been siphoning fuel off from the Chlorines. Where else would they get it from? It\u0027s not like you could make fuel from empty space or the bits of rubble that populate it. No, it was much easier to just take somebody else\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter, they were fueled up now and on their way to the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey received word from Tetris just after they\u0027d completed the transfer burn.

She\u0027d spent most of it playing some game one of her friends had written. It was a text-based game, about little green creatures trying to build a fortress underground. These slightly larger pinkish creatures would occasionally invade, trying to steal all their metals and gems. Somehow it worked on the tiny calculator, for reasons she had never understood. It was addictive, despite the lack of a user interface. It was also impossible to win. No matter what you tried, the pinkish creatures would always get the best of the green ones.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way to have fun was to enjoy losing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan was to drop their three passengers at Pequoni 2. There was a lab there, which would hopefully entertain Elkin. They would also refuel at Pq-2 before dropping down to Pequoni 1. With luck, the lander at Pequoni 1 would still have all of their data in its memory banks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0183_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0183_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first part went off without a hitch. Pequoni 2 wasn\u0027t far off of their capture orbit, and Edsel had them there in no time. They transferred their friends into the station, made sure they were all settled in, topped off the tanks and then made a break for it. If anything went wrong there was another, fully working Sulphur lander at the station. And if that failed, the three of them could always EVA down to them at the Pq-1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second part didn\u0027t go as well as Verly had hoped. Mostly because she didn\u0027t want to land on the M\u00FCn again just now. The station was still there, in the same shape they\u0027d left it. The dead Sulphur was there, its cockpit still stripped of all its electronics. The old lander was there as well, still docked exactly where they\u0027d left it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept its memory was empty. No notes, no designs, no science results. Nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0202_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0202_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0206_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0206_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing to do but go to the surface. Edsel seemed eager, but Verly wasn\u0027t so sure. Why bother? If the mystery shuttle had lost its mind, then what hope would their little memory boxes have? It didn\u0027t make sense to her, but she had to admit she\u0027d only been through a couple of these events so far. Whatever they were. What made that lander special? Why did it have data then but not now? There had to be some answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was lost in thought over this new problem while Edsel was busy landing them on the M\u00FCn. This should be simple, really. All the pieces were in play, but when she tried to put them together something came along and scattered them again. Almost as though her own mind didn\u0027t want her to solve it. And there was something. Something strange. Something she couldn\u0027t place. She just shrugged and played more games on her calculator while they came in for the landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there they were, on the M\u00FCn. She still didn\u0027t have an answer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0223_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0223_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0226_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0226_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220161203_ksp0232_data.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20161203_ksp0232_data.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey least they had the data they were looking for. All of it. Verly had to hardwire the small box into the ship\u0027s computer to read it (why oh why hadn\u0027t they used some standard plug?). As luck and fate would have it there data was there. Somehow. For some reason. What made this little square box important? Surely it wasn\u0027t the small plot of land it rested on. What could their dead M\u00FCn possible have to do with anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they had a good radio link back to Kerbin. Somehow Jonbald had managed to wrangle all the various communications satellites into his corral in just the last day. Verly was impressed, and she guessed Macfred would be impressed too. It was no easy feat to convince some far distant lump of metal and silicon to do your biding, especially when it doesn\u0027t want to talk to you in the first place. She started streaming the data back to Jonbald.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe could almost hear his smile through the radio.
