I\u0027d only ever returned a Kerbal from beyond Kerbin\u0027s SOI once before (from Duna), and the prospect of returning one from a Joolean moon had always felt particularly daunting to me. I would likely need to construct a large, part-heavy ship powered by LV-N\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s which would then require long burn times in addition to the hours-long process of actually getting to one of Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons. I imagine it would have felt like work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ARM parts were released, I recognized that they could give me an opportunity to perform the mission using fewer in-game and real-life resources. I had wanted to do this mission for some time, of course, and over the previous couple of months I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d developed a number of reliable SSTOs; one of which was built specifically to be taken to Laythe, in anticipation of this. When the transfer window to Jool was near, I designed a rocket to be placed underneath the Laythe SSTO and ferry it there (and hopefully back). Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s how the mission went:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/z5zHJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was rather surprised to find that I had taken more fuel than I needed to get back. I fully expected the SSTO to have to finish the transfer burn back to Kerbin, which is why I designed the transfer stage to be docked with instead of including a pod and leaving the SSTO in Laythe orbit. Future missions will probably be done the latter way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while this mission was returning to Kerbin, I decided that I then had the capability to return from anywhere (except Moho and the surfaces of Eve and Tylo, of course). So, naturally, I made a trip to Gilly and back, though I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really document it beyond a few key images from the landing. While I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be doing any more missions of this type very soon, when it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time, my next targets will be Dres and Vall (the last place I have left to visit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, and feel free to comment on this or offer advice about the trip to Vall, for when I finally decide to tackle that goal; I hear it requires more power and delta-v than people expect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KingPhantom","CreatedById":110881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T07:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice plane...... i\u0027m to dumb to build something like that. it looks that easy to reach jool... but i failed everytime with a lander for duna... yes duna... the easy one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T08:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA seven year journey?
