In theory it has enough power to get into orbit but the technology limitations mean it wouldn\u0027t be a very good or reliable way of doing it though as you\u0027ll see it comes very close. It is somewhat large for a basic orbiting satellite but then it lacks any way to seperate stages, so there must be enough engines to carry all the dead weight, and in turn enough fuel to power those engines. Basic operation is very simple - all the engines start at the same time, then cut out as their fuel supply runs out. You can see this splits the engines into 3 groups based on how much fuel they have. The layout of the engines, in particular the 3 with the largest fuel supply, is deliberately along the east/west axis to support some experimental guidance. The payload includes the GravMax and enough power for 2 transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uPwrs6L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uPwrs6L.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WL4SHcV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WL4SHcV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA gravity turn is started using the fins but it can only go so far. The gravity turn needs to take advantage of the thinning air but at the same time this reduces the effectiveness of the control surfaces. At launch all the engines are tweaked to 80%, this prevents them from overheating even with the throttle at 100%. As the ship climbs and the fins become useless an experiment is conducted to determine if thrust control can be used for a gravity turn. While far from a perfect control mechanism the experiment proves the technique is viable - for example to lower the nose the engine thrust for the east side engine is lowered for half a second, then as the ship begins to nose down it is put into overdrive to cancel out the rotational velocity before being returned to 80%. Since this was still being worked out the ship overshot it\u0027s orbital target with an AP of 138km, the gravity turn was not completed within a good timeframe so even with fuel remaining there is not enough for the 800\u002B m/s that would be needed to make proper orbit. A circulization burn is made anyway (if only to extend the orbit and ensure good opportunities to use the GravMax), using a very small amount of thrust to help rotate the ship into alignment for the manuever and it comes within 300 m/s of a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S4lLEEv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S4lLEEv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/54m3Sk0.png\u0022 alt=\u002254m3Sk0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA pair of GravMax readings are taken of the ocean and grasslands before the ship begins reentry. Since it was nearly orbital the ship enters the atmosphere at over 2 km/s causing it to burn up. There are 2 techs that I want for spacecraft development - RCS for control and decouplers to bring up larger payloads. In order to get RCS I\u0027ll need to unlock the capsule and parachute and I have enough science for one of the two major techs. When I designed Chandrasekhar 1 I included the ability for RCS to be added later without the need for additional fuel. It was my plan that Chandrasekhar 2 would have RCS control and be able to enter stable orbit. However with the success of the thrust control experiment I decided it would be more useful to send up a ship with more batteries so that it could transmit GravMax readings for more then two biomes, and that means using decouplers to make a more efficient ship (yes it could be done without decouplers but that would be a giant ugly thing that abused the joints too much). So the next ship will be designed with decouplers to bring up more battery power; I need to cover at least 3 more biomes around the equator and could get some extra science by boosting into high orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AO04yo5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AO04yo5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3na3mvM.png\u0022 alt=\u00223na3mvM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterPan","CreatedById":101101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T10:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of maneuvering the vessel by short thrust reduction is brillant!

It carries a fair amount of extra delta-v in order to facilitate using thrust moderation to turn and actually needs more fuel and engines then normal for this kind of payload because of the need for the final stage to carry 3 engines/tanks. However issues begin appearing very early in the flight. While Chandrasekhar tipped a bit in the compass direction it was stable along its own axis. However Drake does not appear to be stable (possibly because of the small bit of flex where the decouplers link the stages, possibly because Chandrasekhar was much wider) and has a small bit of spin. In the lower atmosphere this can be corrected with the fins and I struggled to keep it nulled out. By the time I ran out of air for the control surfaces the spin was practically nothing, but even a tiny bit was enough to seriously throw things off as soon as I started trying to turn with thrust - in the second shot the ship should be going to the right but thanks to the rotation combined with the use of imbalanced thrust it is now rotating around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QqrRqD0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QqrRqD0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/unZ8mgO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022unZ8mgO.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pt3c2pp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Pt3c2pp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made an effort to get it into orbit, or at least a useful suborbital path where it would pass over some mountains, but these efforts where not enough.

Chandrasekhar 2 flies like the first one, only I\u0027m directly it a little west so it will pass over the highlands and mountains while in space.

In my previous game I collected a lot of debris in orbit - I only pointed it out a few times but it became almost a certainty that I would pass near some debris while launch and even some interplanetary returns passed within 20 km of orbital debris. So I\u0027m going to try and clean up as much garbage as possible this time. I can\u0027t quite reach the AP so I setup and burn the last 8L of fuel about 2 minutes before I\u0027ll run out of power. That lowers the ship to a 56km PE, but by then dumping the contents of the monopropellent tank I lower that to 37km with 8.07em left. As it enters the atmosphere the ship slowly breaks up piece by piece. Realtime it took 30 seconds before the probe core exploded but I\u0027ve sped it up. Apart from the pieces sitting in the field west of KSC I have left no garbage so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6XYOQAS.png\u0022 alt=\u00226XYOQAS.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gmjNtt7.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022gmjNtt7.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have enough science to unlock Science Tech which gives me a bigger battery, pressurized cockpit and goo container.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T17:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PeterPan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PeterPan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I like the mission\u0027s naming too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the upcoming names are getting hard to pick.

I\u0027ll want to expose 4 of them to the pair of biomes in the atmosphere and Kerbin orbit and then return them safely to the ground. Since I\u0027ll be visiting high orbit I might as well record temperature data too. I did some quick figures to see what kind of ship would be needed but quickly found that the Drake class, designed to carry a large quantity of batteries but shelfed due to the stability issues, fit my needs. It also possessed two important attributes, it used decouplers so it limited the amount of weight that had to be returned but at the same time it also used a 3 fuel tank final stage (because it was designed for thrust control). I need the radial tanks as a place to mount parachutes. So the Drake design was dusted off and most of the batteries where replaced with Goo containers, parachutes where added and finally the same RCS control unit added to Chandrasekhar 3 was added to Drake 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent is straight up and while Drake 2 has the same spin instability as Drake 1 it doesn\u0027t impact things since the RCS system can keep it on course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MPWO37s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MPWO37s.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uFzN2E1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uFzN2E1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3IRLSGW.png\u0022 alt=\u00223IRLSGW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KDfdPfa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KDfdPfa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoo is exposed to the atmosphere on the way up and as the ship enters space the AP reaches 260km and the engines are throttled down. Drifting into high orbit the last 2 Goo containers are sampled and the 2Hot readings are recorded. On the way back down RCS is used to hold attitude and at 80km traveling 1.4 km/s the engines are throttled up again to start braking. At 40km the speed has been reduced to 300 m/s for a smooth reentry and the engines are cut again. The parachutes are already armed (they where staged to arm as soon as the 3rd stage engines lit up since by then the ship would be well above the 6km deployment altitude). It looks like the ship is descending into the mountain range west of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mvEhZYX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mvEhZYX.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3BFV80E.png\u0022 alt=\u00223BFV80E.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IQIxSjA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IQIxSjA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally my 6km parachute deployment isn\u0027t an issue - only the highest points on Kerbin are that high and my opinion is that if you land there you\u0027ll most likely be destroyed rolling down the mountain. As you can see the probe can very close to the mountain, it is just reaching the 6km point for parachute deployment but has already passed the nearby peak. Fortunately the probe misses the peak and the parachutes deploy, though some RCS was used to help keep the probe aligned to minimize the shock when they semi-deployed. With all the weight speed is still 17 m/s with the chutes fully deployed so some engine power is used for a gentle touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ojky4FN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ojky4FN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mRogyn8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mRogyn8.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RGDQlve.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RGDQlve.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3HB9CNn.png\u0022 alt=\u00223HB9CNn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I received 8 science for returning my first object safely to the ground in addition to the 150 for the Goo and 8 for the 2Hot.

At this point I don\u0027t think there will be enough remaining life support to attempt it as the pod carries only a little over an hour (and I\u0027d prefer to use anything past the 60 minute mark as a safety margin). With Aldrick piloting I have SAS so launching is easy. The second stage is fired up just as the gravity turn starts. I slightly underestimated the average ISP the T15 engines would perform at in the atmosphere leading to the second stage being enough to get all the way into orbit (it was planned that the third stage would provide about 100-200 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/afwKF7e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022afwKF7e.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1nQAE46.png\u0022 alt=\u00221nQAE46.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VPldILl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VPldILl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dgTXLEl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dgTXLEl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn making sure the first launch was a success Aldrick missed the atmospheric crew reports.

Nearing the end of his first orbit he passes over the desert where he makes both a crew report and activates one of the GravMax instruments.

A second orbit would be risky on life support supply so plans are begin to deorbit. Aldrick is aiming to return to the KSC, since it was the only inhabited area he observed during his entire flight. The return burn finishes up the second stage allowing the third stage to kick in. This is useful as it also simplifies reentry by removing the bulky 2nd stage ahead of time and leaving it far behind (though the last orbital projection before staging showed that it should enter the atmosphere and impact somewhere on the far side of Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zCPM3zD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zCPM3zD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9IOgLJo.png\u0022 alt=\u00229IOgLJo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry goes as planned - the RCS thrusters don\u0027t seem to mind - and the parachute is deployed at 300 m/s to slow down and land close to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t3ufNPC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022t3ufNPC.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0xlS9iq.png\u0022 alt=\u00220xlS9iq.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zhVRP0C.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zhVRP0C.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a soft landing the capsule with an alive and well Aldrick are recovered.

The goal here is a pass over in the poles from orbit and a visit to high orbit. To do this I burn to put the initial AP past the north pole and in high orbit, accomplishing both objectives in a single orbit. Technically it\u0027s not even an orbit though, since there is no specific need to burn at the AP to raise the PE high enough to avoid reentry at the south pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sY4p5YH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sY4p5YH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mE9zdoe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mE9zdoe.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IsKwmQy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IsKwmQy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPassing over the pole and taking readings I realize that my polar orbit is very close to passing over the exact north pole, as evidenced by the rapid vertigo inducing camera movement as the auto camera passes over the pole. Reaching high orbit another reading is taken just as the sun begins to fall behind Kerbin. Coming back into the light over the south pole the ship also begins reentry. A final report is taken of the upper atmosphere since I forgot to grab it (a lower atmosphere one was taken during the initial ascent) and then the service module is jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lmKlYqx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lmKlYqx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J91CeeZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J91CeeZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fS7sBQm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fS7sBQm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry and splashdown occur without incident and the pod is recovered with Kenby and his reports.

I understand that BTSM now has antenna range - each antenna has limits to how far away it can transmit science from and still be received by KSC. That won\u0027t be an issue for the first mission beyond Kerbin\u0027s immediate vicinity as I will be landing a probe on the Mun and return samples of Goo exposed there. This time around my booster designs are coming across a big square. Part of this is because I haven\u0027t unlocked an engine with more thrust, another is that I simply needed 3 tank rockets early on for the mounting space and I\u0027ve just sort of stayed with them. I\u0027d like to think that if I used some part clipping and the tail section piece (I don\u0027t remember if that\u0027s even in BTSM) that I could smooth out those square edges - they should naturally be curved to form a smooth rocket in a manner similar to many Soviet designs. The gravity turn is executed immediately after the first stage booster is discarded. This second stage is intended to take the ship to within 300 m/s of a stable orbit and carries it\u0027s own monopropellent supply. A difference from the first placethrough is that .23.5 now ensures that monopropellent is drained in relation to staging, so I don\u0027t need to close the valves on the final stage\u0027s tanks to prevent them from being used during the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BgXrtwv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BgXrtwv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W5k3Suh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W5k3Suh.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jMLkVl9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jMLkVl9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wh63LlV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wh63LlV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did encounter a small oversight for the next part of the ascent. On the one hand when I cut off the 2nd stage engines for the coasting phase I found that they had run out of fuel at that exact same moment, leaving me on target and ready to engage the third stage orbital/injection engines. However the circulization burn shows that I needed 385 m/s, putting me slightly over budget since some of that should have come out of the 2nd stage. A bigger issue is that I didn\u0027t correctly take into account the much lower TWR of the 3rd stage engines. As a result my burn timing is off and the resulting orbit will actually pass as low as 68.9km. On the bright side my course projection to reach the Mun show that I will save over 100 m/s of delta-v over the injection portions budget. I also notice that the display is a little different, I think I must have clicked one of the conic options in PreciseNode. It looks fine, in fact I actually find it more useful this way to visually see my PE without even reading the number so I\u0027ll keep it for now. Making the burn confirmed that it makes it easier to visually tell how close my PE was, letting me cut my engines based on sight and get a PE of 13km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J9O87Gd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J9O87Gd.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UxbvGqH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UxbvGqH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at the Mun some information is recorded in high orbit before arriving for capture after which a additional experiments can be done in low orbit. A good deal of fuel has been saved so the transit stage will be able to provide some delta-v for the descent. One other thing the transfer stage has provided is electrical power. Prior to starting the landing the batteries in the landing stage need to be activated. They\u0027ll provide several more hours of operation without having to carry the weight of the batteries that brought the probe the Mun in the first place. The landing site chosen is a flat looking area in the midlands which should pose little danger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Meg3w1y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Meg3w1y.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AIdxBXm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AIdxBXm.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZJ8U3LZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZJ8U3LZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the fuel situation good a very soft landing is made at 1.4 m/s.

In hindsight it would technically be possible with just Advanced Landing but I\u0027d need to stack at least 4 Mk2 Lander Cans together and that would look stupid. In order to reach Advanced Exploration I need to unlock Electrics first (I can see Advanced Exploration without it, but it\u0027s grayed out and Electrics is the only nearby node that might assist in unlocking it).

At the very top of the tech tree I could pursue the large diameter fuel tanks and the Keel Haul (prototype Skipper). Next down I could unlock better engines with thrust vectoring. Going further down I have already unlocked the 90pt portion (so I\u0027d still spend 90 on either orange tanks\u002Badapters or T30 engines and small fuel tanks). In the aerodynamics area I could spend 180 to unlock the large heatshield and radial parachutes - I can\u0027t realistically land the big Apollo capsule without a heatshield. Or I could spend 180 to get the upgraded batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have a lot of trouble with the first part of the choice - a heatshield or batteries are much better then the engines or fuel tanks. I can still spend 90 to unlock the T30, which gives me better thrust over the T15. That leaves heatshield or batteries. Initially I was actually leaning toward the batteries, since electricity was my limiting factor in my Mun and Minmus flights. I considered the idea of a direct ascent, single kerbal mission. It would carry a Mk1 escape pod on top for reentry. I loaded up my old save and mocked up what the direct descent lander would look like (I did accidently use a ladder I wouldn\u0027t have access to). However while I stayed with direct ascent I decided it was better to go with the heatshield after running some numbers. First was that the mass of the landers was very close - the heatshield weighed less then the Mk1, but the primitive batteries added slightly more weight in return, however in order to use the Mk1 I would need to brake before reentry to lower my speed. That resulted in an extra 7 tons of fuel in the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4NR5cYI.png\u0022 alt=\u00224NR5cYI.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o3EFUpZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o3EFUpZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8htrBia.png\u0022 alt=\u00228htrBia.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EMockup of direct ascent lander using Mk1 pod for heatshielded return\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went with spending science to unlock Super Sonic Flight for the heatshield and Heavy Rocketry for the T30 engine and T200 fuel tank.

Even though I had the lander can (since I needed space suits) the direct ascent profile was still important because of the complexity of having both a lander and the mercury style recovery capsule. Once I decided on getting the heatshield instead of batteries I could have changed the profile to a munar rendezvous but I wanted to do it direct ascent simply because I had already done it the other way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main mission objectives where simple: Launch from Kerbin, burn to the Mun and capture into low orbit there, perform an orbital survey, land and do an EVA, launch back into orbit and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data I recorded from Fleming 1 proved invaluable in planning this mission. I determined that the smallest reasonable time to reach orbit and begin landing was 6 hours (remember that reasonable means itaking into account less then perfect orbital alignment and burns) and that padding it out to 8 hours would ensure safety. This estimate wasn\u0027t that much smaller then my old play through\u0027s mission plan. The second estimate was a bit more daring. It told me from Mun descent to final splashdown on Kerbin could be reasonably done in 8 hours, though with an imperfect return 11 or 12 should be budgeted for safety. That gave me a total of 20 hours, again not very different from my first play through, but I intended to use the Fleming profile of carrying some batteries in an injection/capture stage which would be discarded at the beginning of the Mun descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final rocket weighs in at 598 tons, only 10 tons more then my original Uniform 2 mission.

It also doesn\u0027t have a lander sitting on top which makes escape easier in a launch failure (if I had the escape lower unlocked I might have thought to use it, since it would easily integrate into this design). Lift off is smooth but a little slower then usual, I cut it close with the thrust calculations which is why there are those little solid boosters to get it over the top. Those big XL control surfaces combined with the pod SAS keep the first stage flying straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qtUTJhH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qtUTJhH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ta9g75.png\u0022 alt=\u00226ta9g75.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e8ypyda.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e8ypyda.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 10.5km the first stage booster is exhausted and discarded. The ship is going about 30 m/s slower then my usual launches as the second stage booster takes over and begins a gravity turn using RCS for control. The SAS system is turned off at this point as it would only waste monopropellent - I\u0027m not so much steering with RCS but using a bit of it to tip the rocket and then let it turn by itself, using RCS to slow down the turn a bit as needed. This seemed to be the scariest portion of the launch judging by the crews reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yi9EUY9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Yi9EUY9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jIgZcr6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jIgZcr6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xcrbOiH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xcrbOiH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage runs out at 50km, leaving about 600 m/s for the orbital engines to pickup to reach orbital speed (~2.3km/s). Fortunately they are T30s and where designed to handle this portion of the ascent. A 172 m/s circularization burn is used to complete the setup of a 72km orbit. This orbital section is carrying the only active batteries besides the one in the command pod (which I kept on for safety). All the batteries on the next stage are currently on stand by. Due to symmetry I ended up with more batteries then I needed on this stage, 9.6 hours worth instead of 8, but it wasn\u0027t too much of an overage so I kept it instead of splitting things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VoufE5j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VoufE5j.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2LsO5yw.png\u0022 alt=\u00222LsO5yw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T22:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a question about Gamow 1 over in the BTSM mod thread but I thought it would be better to answer it here rather then derail that discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Poddster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Poddster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you have this constructed?

You clone something by holding down the alt key and clicking on it. You\u0027ll now be holding a copy of that part along with all the parts attached to it as if you had just removed it from the parent (but the original is still there!). Below I\u0027ve created a basic copy of the top of the landing stage of the ship - a Mk1-2 capsule, a heatshield and a decoupler. Below that is a fuel tank and an engine. By alt clicking on the fuel tank I get a copy of the tank and engine.

Sometimes when you are placing things with symmetry, especially when they are close together like I\u0027ll be doing here, you\u0027ll find that it rejects some or all of the placements (some or all of the parts show up in red instead of green and you can\u0027t place the group). This happens if you have accidently clipped parts together but can also seem to happen for no reason even on parts with no possible clipping issue. The solution is to move the camera a bit and try again. For some really close placements it can get tricky to find just the right angle you need to get it to register but it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext we\u0027ll create the injection stage. We\u0027ll start by building the center tank assembly first using a decoupler, 2 of those long fuel tanks and an engine. Just like before we\u0027ll clone it but instead of cloning it from the tank we\u0027ll alt\u002Bclick on that decoupler, cloning the entire assembly including the decoupler. With symmetry mode on we\u0027ll then attach the decoupler to the bottom of one of the 6 exposed lander engines - symmetry mode will automatically duplicate it to create 6. Struts can be added at this point to ancher the 6 long tanks so they don\u0027t sway around, but I\u0027m not going to cover that part. At each stage assume a single set of struts is used to ancher any long sections together. It doesn\u0027t take many, the final rocket has about 1 strut per engine (including the 6 struts used to ancher the command pod at the top).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p14Deq0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p14Deq0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MjvipJ9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MjvipJ9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XPa1G5S.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XPa1G5S.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K2AOM6U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K2AOM6U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe injection stage had 7 engines, but the 2nd booster stage is going to need more to lift all that weight. It\u0027s going to need 19 engines. That means in addition to the 7 \u0027inner\u0027 engines we\u0027ll need an outer layer of 12 more. First we construct the inner engines (which are composed of a decoupler, T200 tank, T400 tank, T800 tank and LV-T30 engine) the same way we did with the injection stage. Next we clone the engine assembly but without including the decoupler. Much like when we constructed the lander portion we attach it radially. You\u0027ll notice that you only have two symmetry options when touching the tank - 1x or 6x. The VAB won\u0027t let you use any of the others because you are attaching to/extending an existing symmetrical group (there are some tricks for assembly with multiple layers of differing symmetry but that\u0027s for another day). You can experiment with the exact angle to attach them in combination with the next step. You\u0027ll want to be just off the straight on attachment angle in order to make the next set of tanks you add appear seamless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PsyL74A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PsyL74A.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/52Svxgg.png\u0022 alt=\u002252Svxgg.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4hWBIXJ.png\u0022 alt=\u00224hWBIXJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xDl9qpO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xDl9qpO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we can start creating some fake 12x symmetry. Clone the tank again and attach it to your outer most tank, but instead of extending them out again you\u0027ll do the opposite, try to place them as close in as possible without clipping (if it turns red you are clipping and can\u0027t place). Look closely and you\u0027ll see the small T200 tank I\u0027m attaching the assembly to, it\u0027s highlighted one on the left. In this arrangement the tank is technically attached to the one to its left, but the gap between it and the tank to the right is small enough that they appear equally space for all but the closest inspection. If the gap is big then go back to the previous step and adjust the attachment angle. You can now add some nose cones. You\u0027ll notice that they only attach to 6 tanks at a time, this is because you\u0027re really still using 6x symmetry, but wrapping it around to fake 12x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iGHaBky.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iGHaBky.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F0zkdXn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F0zkdXn.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5FLWCJ5.png\u0022 alt=\u00225FLWCJ5.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I53oJaz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022I53oJaz.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ih6C5Ue.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ih6C5Ue.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the bottom of the rocket, the first stage booster, we\u0027ll need 37 engines in total. The first 19 are placed the way we placed the first 7 engines of the previous stage. We start with the very center and build a single assembly consisting of a decoupler, T400, T800 and LV-T45 engine. Now clone that at the decoupler and attach it to the bottom of the other engines with symmetry on. Each placement will automatically be copied to 5 other engines so you\u0027ll need to place it 3 times to get all 18. At this stage you will probably start encountering those placement issues so rotate the camera a bit if it doesn\u0027t recognize all 6 as valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AMRbhM1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AMRbhM1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8oH5nLq.png\u0022 alt=\u00228oH5nLq.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VDIg6bZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VDIg6bZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6bLhSxL.png\u0022 alt=\u00226bLhSxL.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vaijopx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vaijopx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo form the outer most layer we\u0027ll need 18 engines.
