And I decided I wanted to do an adventure around Kerbin, using satellites as little as possible, and aircraft and ground vehicles as much as possible. The idea would be to spread out, build fuel depos, and eventually have access to the other side of the planet even with the heaviest of aircraft and ground vehicles, through Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start with, I built a simple satellite check for Kethane on the far side. I had no intention to use this to find nearby Kethane, only to test if the mod was even working. A big BIG deposit shown up, but its far too far away to do anything about right now. (well, i could probably fly something real small capacity there, but its not worth the bother - and dropping down from orbit isn\u0027t my goal here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JFVkLqO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JFVkLqO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane Scanning Soarer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo once that was done, I built a small fleet of scanning planes. To start with I built a Jet powered Kethane Scanning Soarer to scan from the air. It was fast, but limited by range and maneuverability, and didn\u0027t find anything (But did scan about half the height of the starting continents width) I got away with two refuels before an accident on landing damaged the engine, leaving it out of service. The second plane used solar power and an electric prop for massive range, but less speed. After searching for a long time though... still nothing!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TxFUSPn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TxFUSPn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unfortunate landing incident which disabled the Kethane Scanning Soarer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eDc0e6c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eDc0e6c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar Electric Kethane Scanning Soarer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oirCKj1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oirCKj1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA long time of flying later, the fruits of my search... (satellite tracks from testing can be seen as the scattered pockets of detection)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually got desperate and built a kethane scanning satellite made for the job, put into an orbit for the job (near polar). It detected a large deposit to the north east, as well as a smaller deposit to the east (but how large not confirmed) but still not exactly close, as well as some useless ones in the sea, one on the other side of the north pole (reasonable size) and of course a massive one on the absolute opposite side of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4gLdPlO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224gLdPlO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESending Solar Electric Kethane Scanner to investigate Easterly site (south here of aircraft here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter sending the Solar Electric Kethane scanner to investigate the smaller nearer site in the east, I decided this was a prime spot. So, needed a mining base to go get that Kethane, didn\u0027t I? Made this for the job:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ypqi8iU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ypqi8iU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in theory, it should have been light with empty Kethane tanks and only 4.5 tonnes of liquid fuel reserve. I was quite wrong. It flew at a rediculous angle of attack and was difficult to fly, with low ceiling (5km) and low speed (~170m/s) On landing, I was concentrating so much on holding heading I forgot to shut off the throttle... resulting in the loss of both wingtips and engines. On the other hand, it got where I needed it with all the equipment surviving, so its now full of Kethane and ready to settle later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nxe9UcM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nxe9UcM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny landing you can mine Kethane from...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dilema now was what to do about the higher up deposit. with some changes, I decided I should be able to make the plane get there and fly better. The wings were made longer and the piping for fuel improved (I had to manually shift a bit of fuel last time) and I set out. It was a quite easy journey aside from landing again. There was a stability issue that arose that meant roll control wasn\u0027t possible, or didn\u0027t seem so. But by combining yaw and roll it did become controllabe, and was successfully landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Any2xQp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Any2xQp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what to do next? well, I\u0027m thinking either deliver some more equipment (storage tanks, maybe a manned outpost) to the sites. Actually if I did this to the northen site, I can probably drill up all the Kethane and use the same plane to keep moving north.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YopZOwp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YopZOwp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to come up with a better name than Site Alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : I\u0027ve also just noticed on the East of the Planet another good direction to head in...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C9AQs1E.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C9AQs1E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-06T14:57:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2013 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TouhouTorpedo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T14:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*reserving a post incase I want this later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agent30632","CreatedById":58734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T16:42:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on finding the kethane!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how much big kethane pockets have you found?
