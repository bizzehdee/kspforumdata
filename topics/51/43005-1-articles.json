Therefore, I used the following mods to construct craft for this challenge, under certain restrictions as specified:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Subassembly Manager (all subassemblies used were constructed from scratch expressly for this challenge, as were the craft they were attached to)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* RCS Build Aid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Engineer Redux (for calculating Delta-V and TWR only; the Engineer part was not left on ship for launch)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Editor Extensions (non-standard symmetries were not used, nor were the radial attachment or part clipping features)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file used for the primary mission can be found here, for anyone who might want to try flying it, or perhaps just check it out in more detail: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60350861/Apollo%20K.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo K craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods were used in flight.

(I tend to start fresh with each new release of the game anyway.) This was my first attempt to land on the new rendition of the Mun; and of course none of my flags helpfully marking the various Munar anomalies were there anymore. This meant that some preparation for the primary mission was in order; around the Kerbal Space Center, this became known as the \u0022Apollo Pre-K Program\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T16:52:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KevinTMC\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EApollo K-X added\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T17:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAPOLLO PRE-K PROGRAM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhead of the primary mission--and following a bunch of explodey simulations and unmanned tests--there were two manned, full-dress test flights.

It\u0027s the sort of thing that happens when there were significant, untested changes to the final launch vehicle at the last minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the last test flight, there had not been enough fuel left in the second stage to put Ronely, Hanbin, and Dunvis into the free return trajectory around the Mun, and so they had had to stage and then complete the burn with the Command Module engine. This posed two problems. First, having less fuel available than expected for the munar and return phases of the mission is quite obviously a bad thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond--as will soon be seen--this particular staging creates quite a lot of debris due to the fairings, debris which would remain in a highly elliptical orbit around Kerbin forever. Whether or not bonus points are tacked on in future for returning all debris to the atmosphere or crashing it into the Mun (the suggestion has been raised in the challenge thread), I like to run a tidy operation, and this just wouldn\u0027t do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the decision was made to shed weight by removing some of the fairing. On the version of the rocket used in the Apollo Pre-K program, the fairing around the junction between the second stage and the upper stages was more elaborate, and the fairing that can be seen between the fuel tanks on the second stage had been extended all the way down the first stage as well. Removal of these extra panels saved a good bit of weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, some weight had to be added to the top when engineers realized they had forgotten to add the munar sub-satellite called for in one of the bonus goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Apollo K was launched with the hope--but not the certainty--that the second stage would have enough fuel to put the craft on its free return trajectory. If not, the backup plan was to split the transfer into two burns, an orbit apart. The first burn would nearly exhaust the second stage, leaving just enough fuel for it to be tipped back into a low-atmosphere return. Said tipping would be done at apokee; then, after staging and related maneuvers, the Command Module engine would restore an orbital trajectory; finally, back around perikee, the CM would complete the transfer. (Hopefully, the Mun wouldn\u0027t have moved far enough in the interim to require costly course corrections...mission control\u0027s best guess was that the extra delta-v expenditure would be minimal.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with two sets of checklists in front of everyone, and with a careful watch being kept on fuel, the trans-munar injection burn was started...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v440/KevinTMC/Apollo%20K%20Project/screenshot7-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECAPCOM: \u0022Apollo K, we have confirmed munar intercept and free-return trajectory.

Everyone at Kerbal Space Center knew in their hearts that this was what they were created to do, and to keep on doing, whether it brought success or catastrophe or some mixture of both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo Pre-K test crew of Dunvis, Hanbin, and Ronely Kerman was particularly eager to get back into space and complete the mission. Before they could do so, an important question had to be addressed: was the Apollo K lander capable of making a precision landing on the Mun and then returning to orbit, or was it fatally underpowered? Most were inclined to believe the latter. (Jeb and Bill had fired up all three engines and still barely made it down safely, after all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacecraft engineers were able to save some weight when they realized that including an old-style ASAS module on the lander was excessive (it was especially preposterous in the descent phase, seeing as no fewer than five reaction-wheel-containing parts were already attached to the rover). They also got rid of the deck chairs, since not even Jeb had been crazy enough to use them. Even so, as simulations got underway it still seemed a stiff challenge to land the Munar Module using only the single Rockomax 48-7S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Commander Dunvis Kerman and Munar Module Pilot Hanbin Kerman kept at it, enduring simulated crash after simulated crash until they started to feel their way towards a solution. By starting from a lower, 20km orbit, angling the burn carefully so as to not let vertical velocity get too high (about 20-25m/s seemed right until horizontal velocity was canceled), and coasting very little if at all during any phase of the descent, Dunvis and Hanbin were eventually able to simulate a safe landing using just the descent engine. Prospects for ascent looked fine as well, as leaving the less-efficient radial engines off during descent helped the fuel situation considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, after having considered more radical changes, spacecraft engineers made only modest tweaks to the Apollo K craft in the end. Along with the changes to the Munar Module, a better place for the sub-satellite was found (under the Munar Module, instead of on top of the Command Module), a proper stack separator was added between the Command Module engine and the Munar Module, and the weight of the escape tower was reduced a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo K, Revised spacecraft (or Apollo K-R) was ready to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v440/KevinTMC/Apollo%20K-R/screenshot18.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunvis, Hanbin, and Ronely launched at dawn, and reached orbit safely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v440/KevinTMC/Apollo%20K-R/screenshot20.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot20.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but the second stage had less fuel remaining than would be needed to complete the transfer burn.

I reloaded to try it again...and this time I decided to not chance the staging system, activating the descent engine via the right-click menu on the part instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The solar panel providing power to the last of the MSEP modules was in a broken state on delivery.

The bottom two stages, in fact, are completely unchanged from the Apollo K-R mission. Here\u0027s what has changed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A new third stage has been added. (More delta-v was needed of course, but the craft now also adheres more closely to the requested mission profile for this challenge, and to the real-world Apollo design: unlike the earlier Apollo K missions, Apollo K-X is three stages to orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In the payload, the single, engineless Apollo K subsatellite has become a pair of subsatellites powered by LV-1s, and they are mounted on the Command Module instead of below the Munar (now Dunar) Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* To better accommodate the subsatellites, the Command Module\u0027s monopropellant tanks have been tucked inside the Advanced SAS module; also, a pair of FL-T100 fuel tanks have been slipped inside the decoupler, to provide additional delta-v for interplanetary return. (It does not require part clipping or any other sort of sorcery to place things inside SAS and decoupler rings in the VAB...just a careful and patient hand.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The Apollo K rover has been radically redesigned for greater stability...and also for better durability on those occasions when stability fails. A pair of them are packed for the journey instead of just one; and they do not remain mounted below the Dunar Module for landing, as the single rover did before, but are instead remounted radially in-flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The change in rover mounting led to the bottom of the Dunar Module being rebuilt, and to the shifting of some side-attached parts to accommodate new docking ports; but the biggest change to the lander is the addition of parachutes.

It is designed to separate from the main mission upon entering Duna SOI, collect a sample from the icecap, and then return to Kerbin independently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Finally, most of the structural panels in the fairing have been replaced with wing connectors, to help compensate for the heavier payload. (I think this also brought the part count down slightly...and every little bit helps, as the twin rovers add up to a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of parts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction and testing took place in my main installation of KSP 0.21.1, where I\u0027ve installed various mods--but no modded parts were used on the final craft, nor were mods used to build anything that couldn\u0027t also be built in an unmodded game (if a bit more laboriously), nor was part clipping turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace programs interested in examining the Apollo K-X more closely, and perhaps taking it for a spin themselves, can find the craft file \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60350861/Apollo%20K-X.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor flying the mission I used a new, unmodded installation of KSP 0.21.1, into which the required save file and my completed craft were copied.
