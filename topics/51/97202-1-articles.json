This is the only contract I\u0027ve seen so far over 2 million funds. My station is total overkill as was the launcher I used, but I think it cost me less than 300k for a payout of 2.7 mil funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a custom difficulty based on normal settings (I started with normal and made the checkboxes match moderate and left the sliders and everything else the way they are for normal difficulty). This is also after I have unlocked the entire tech tree late in this career, so the only contracts worth doing any more are the fun ones or huge payout ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it interesting that the archive view of my contracts only shows a handful of contracts, it must only show recent ones -- I\u0027ve done dozens on this career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SPge0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
