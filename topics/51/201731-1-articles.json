The carrier craft had splashed down at Laythe, after an uncomfortable re-entry in a submarine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Jeb had been far away from kerbin before. he never really thought it was lonely, until he landed on Duna. On the Mun, Minmus and Gilly, there was the company of the stars, which\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealways\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0warranted a smile, looking out of the command pod, or in rare cases, the observatory\u0027s windows. But there was only a hazy red atmosphere. The thought\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etruly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dawned on him. The closest kerbals, beside his friends next to him, were about 20 billion kilometres away. The same thought happened here, as he exited the landing craft and only saw ocean, blue skies, and the green giant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0He throttled up the engines, and pointed down. At 800 meters, it was getting dark, but there was no clear sign of the bottom. Bill, next to him was terrified, refusing to look out of the windows. He was 2 kilometres deep when he saw the bottom. He requested bill change the altitude relative to terrain, but refused as that would require him to look up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Jeb started to get it. There was\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on Laythe. The oceans were completely silent, other than the engine. Back on Kerbin, there were tons of fish and whales that could be heard, and he was just off the coast of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E(If he looked, he could probably find vectors from failed booster recoveries)!\u00A0The oceans weren\u0027t even deep enough to be close to what one could call darkness. But here, the only light was of the sub\u0027s own. 1. The sun was dim this far away, and 2. it was blocked out by the ocean. Jeb looked up, confirming this. He was too terrified to continue the mission. He ditched the ore tanks, opened the ballast tank, and ascended at 8.0 m/s. It was too slow, but going faster would result in damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Ever since this mission, my mind process has been different. Before, I went wherever my next milestone is, sending small crewed missions\u00A0with 1 or 2 person landers.
