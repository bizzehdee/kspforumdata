First mission to Eve on this save and I think my first mission to Gilly ever... Then decoupled and discovered my mistake, I thought it wouldn\u0027t be that much of a drama, looked like the rocket might just lean a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I was feeling lazy and had never used it before I used Mechjeb landing guidance to get me down. It did a great job, gently landing me at 0.5m/s but on the edge of a 45 degree slope!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VSjqouP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VSjqouP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I tried to correct it as it fell over I discovered that Mechjeb had put the RCS on and hadn\u0027t turned it off! To my amusement I discovered how one could fly around using only RCS on Gilly... Started fooling around and crashed into it headfirst breaking my rocket into what seemed like about 20 different pieces!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas really funny watching the rocket fall apart in that low gravity, was like my fail was on slo-mo. I put Desbro on EVA so that he could appreciate the view and jetted around for a bit. [picture above] Then I thought had best get back to Mermore and rescue him from the lander can. So i used the [ and ] keys to make my way through the debris field. Eventually I got to some still connected docking clamps that KSP called a probe. It told me that I \u0022couldn\u0027t change from a vessel that was about to crash\u0022. So I had to wait until they landed, but then it started rolling and rolling and rolling - with KSP insistent that they were on the verge of crashing. Took about 5 minutes of real time with me laughing the whole way - with explosions from other parts in the background, one that I now know was the lander can and spelt the death of Mermore \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E - before it stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow with no input from me Desbro had managed to land safely so I took him on a 3km journey to reunite with his last piece of home and got the picture above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then went to these forums, planning to share my experience and ask if anybody else has had a low-gravity disaster only to discover that 0.90 was out!
