The tower has been named \u0022Minmus Acres\u0022 and is being assembled by landing each module directly on top of each other module. When completed, Minmus Acres will be a high-class luxury condominium for hundreds of discerning Kerbals of taste and adventurous spirit to live and play in the frozen wasteland. The tower itself features individual living units for families, luxury penthouse apartments, stunning views of the Minmus landscape, and easy access to and from the Kerbin system and interplanetary space. Time-shares will be available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do this? Mainly for a challenge for myself. I wanted to get better at targeted landings, and there really is no better trainer than having to do it over and over again with a margin of error measured in fractions of a meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, because Googling for \u0022kerbal space program skyscraper\u0022 or \u0022kerbal space program tall tower\u0022 yields almost no results. At least, not the type of results I was envisioning. So I wanted to fill that gap, and start a series of missions for building tall skyscrapers on the various low-gravity moons in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus was an obvious first choice because: it is easy to reach; it\u0027s close by, so it can handle multiple launches/captures per day; and it has low gravity and no atmosphere, meaning fuel savings and easy maneuvering. All of these things add up to an environment that lends itself to trial-and-error experimentation. And there have been lots of error so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout a third of the way into the project, when I sent my first kerbonaut to the construction site, one of those errors sparked the idea for a plot involving that Kerbal. So in addition to the pictures of the mission, there is also an episodic story line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story line and the pictures are only loosely related! They are not 100% accurate reflections of each other. Artistic license was taken with the story to make it a bit more interesting (I hope), and the pictures can be viewed independently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027m doing a lot of things less efficiently than I could be. I\u0027m learning a lot for my next attempt, probably also on Minmus to get a few things sorted before attempting one of the other moons in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minimus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minimus?p=1736229\u0026amp;posted=1#post1736229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter I\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minimus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minimus?p=1742287#post1742287\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter II\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1752841#post1752841\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter III\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1759639#post1759639\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter IV\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1768459#post1768459\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter V\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1774953#post1774953\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter VI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1785877#post1785877\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntermezzo\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1799168#post1799168\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Hulk\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1813524#post1813524\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter VII\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1829805#post1829805\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter VIII\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E - dramatized story, no pictures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1830727#post1830727\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPictures VIII\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1841294#post1841294\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter IX\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E - \u003Cem\u003Edramatized story, no pictures\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1841455#post1841455\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPictures IX\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1855384#post1855384\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter X\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110681-Minmus-Acres-A-Skyscraper-on-Minmus?p=1876912#post1876912\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEpilogue\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T23:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAD_Interplanetary\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JAD_Interplanetary","CreatedById":134778,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T18:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EChapter I: A What on the Where?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGusdard Kerman enjoyed his work at KSC. Well, he enjoyed most of it. The small design and engineering team he headed was always given interesting work on modular construction systems for orbital stations and bases. Much more interesting, he thought, then the launch vehicles team. All they had to do was punch some numbers into a well-known equation for how much fuel was needed for a given payload mass, then design a booster to hold that much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe also enjoyed to atmosphere at mission control during liftoff: the awe of watching the huge rockets rolling from the VAB to the launchpad; the deep chest-caving boom of the launch shockwave rattling the windows. And most importantly, the satisfaction of his team\u0027s designs assembling flawlessly, deploying their docking systems through the mostly automated system he had built early in his tenure at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most of all, he enjoyed working closely with Maryenny, over at mission control, who monitored the rendezvous and approaches of the modules his team was responsible for. She was incredibly smart, had a wickedly witty sense of humor, and was an amazing problem-solver under pressure. And she smelled like lavender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Gusdard enjoyed most of his work. Most of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe glanced up from his drafting table at the sound loud guffawing and back-slapping passing by his workroom. It was pilot Commander Jebediah having a raucous conversation with an unknown Kerbal with an expensive suit and slicked-back hair. Gus watched the two of them through the glass windows of the workroom, until they disappeared down the corridor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t that Gus disliked Jeb. No one could really disklike Jeb; he was too much of a lovable clown to really dislike. And he absolutely was the greatest pilot of his or any generation, a true legend. What Gus found irritating was Jeb\u0027s blatant disregard for everything Gus loved about engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Jeb, no amount of fuel was too much to waste, no maneuver was too stressful on the ship, and everything had to be manually piloted. It was that last bit that really grated on Gus, who had devoted his university studies -- and his whole tenure at KSC -- to researching and developing automated systems to eliminate pilot error from the dangers of space exploration. And Gus suspected that was the reason why Jeb didn\u0027t like him much, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few moments after Jeb and the unknown stranger had turned the corner, Wernher von Kerman, KSC\u0027s lead scientist, and Bill, chief mission engineer and Gus\u0027s boss, walked past the workroom, deep in conversation. Wernher was shaking his head, and looking discouraged. Bill was talking quietly but emphatically. As they passed by, Bill glanced through the large windows of the workroom, nodded to Gus, then gestured at him while saying something to Wernher. Wernher scratched his chin and shrugged, and the two of them continued down the same corridor as Jeb and the stranger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it wasn\u0027t that big of a surprise later that day, when Gus found himself in a mission design briefing with Wernher, Bill, Jeb, and the slick-haired Kerbal in the expensive suit and bolo tie. Maryenny from mission control, and a few Kerbals from other departments were also seated around the conference table. Wernher got the meeting underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027d like you all to meet our special guest today, Rocco Kerman Jr., president and CEO of Rockomax Conglomerate. I will let him explain why we are here.\u0022 He gestured to Rocco, who stood up and flashed a wide, blinding smile at the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Y\u0027all can call me \u0027Rocky\u0027. Everyone does.\u0022 He grinned widely at Jeb, and the two of them bumped fists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We know each other from way back. We both attended Krashlands High School together,\u0022 explained Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And that\u0027s why I knew this was the place to bring big, bold, fresh ideas. A place where Kerbals can get things done without worrying about things like \u0027budgets\u0027 and \u0027the laws of physics\u0027,\u0022 Rocky said, making quotes in the air with his fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The truth is,\u0022 he continued, \u0022The Rockomax board is looking to rustle my company right out from under me! Rockomax Rocket Parts division revenues are down. Kerbodyne is eating our lunch on high-end launch equipment. If I\u0027m gonna keep control of the company my dear departed Pappy started, I need to take us in a bold, new direction.\u0022 He gestured to Wernher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rockomax, with the help of the KSC research, engineering and mission control teams are going to build...\u0022 Rocky\u0027s eyes gleamed and his voice edged with excitement, \u0022...the largest, most expensive...\u0022 Rocky continued, pounding his fist on the conference table, emphasizing each word, \u0022...high-end, luxury-class...\u0022 Rocky was practically preaching at this point, \u0022...condominium skyscraper on the Mun!\u0022 Rocky finished, slumping back in his seat with his arms outstretched, eyes flashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe room was silent. Gus could barely process what he had just heard. Rocky couldn\u0027t have just said \u0022skyscraper on the Mun,\u0022 could he?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe room erupted into shouting. Gus looked around startled. Half the room was pounding the table, explaining exactly how the plan wouldn\u0027t work. The other half was yelling, explaining how KSC had never backed down from a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Quiet!\u0022 shouted Bill. Then he looked pointedly at Gus. \u0022Gus, I wanted you here to get your opinion. Your team would be lead on this project. What do you think?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s...possible,\u0022 conceded Gus, after getting over the initial shock at the scope of the challenge in front of them. \u0022I\u0027d designed a concept for a hyper-large colony in Eve orbit back in university. But it was just a concept, and it certainly wasn\u0027t meant to be built planetside. Far too large. Even for the Mun. Maybe Minmus...\u0022 he mused to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mun, Minmus, any random hunk of rock in space. I don\u0027t care where you put it, four-eyes, as long as it\u0027s got the Rockomax flag flying from every balcony!\u0022 exclaimed Rocky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What about constructing it in orbit, then de-orbiting it?\u0022 asked Bill. Gus shook his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Once it\u0027s built, the fuel needed to de-orbit it and soft-land would be prohibitively expensive, even in Minmus gravity. And it wouldn\u0027t be maneuverable at all. You\u0027d be as likely to land it on a mountain slope as you would your target site.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t you worry about the landing, kid. I got that covered,\u0022 assured Jeb. Rocky slapped him on the back, grinning. Gus kept his mouth shut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What about assembling it in pieces on the ground, like any building here on Kerbin?\u0022 asked Wernher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That...could work,\u0022 answered Bill. \u0022No less fuel, of course, but if we broke it into small maneuverable pieces it might be possible.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Construction equipment would be unwieldy in the low gravity,\u0022 countered Gus. \u0022You\u0027d be as likely to fling pieces back into orbit as you would to connect them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pinpoint landings,\u0022 muttered Maryenny. All eyes turned to her. She was looking intently at Gus. He turned away from her gaze and cleared his throat. \u0022Dozens of them,\u0022 she continued, speaking up with excitement. \u0022De-orbit the modules, and land them right smack on top of one another.\u0022 She smiled at Gus. \u0022You were talking about that at lunch a few months ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus blushed, remembering that lunch, then blushed even deeper when he realized Maryeeny had remembered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re talking about accuracy in the range of millimeters,\u0022 Gus said, looking anywhere except at Maryenny. \u0022Over and over again, no margin for error.\u0022 Bill cast Gus a sidelong glance. \u0022But,\u0022 he continued, starting to work over the design in his head, \u0022yeah. Yeah, it could work. With the right guidance systems.\u0022 The others around the table started chatting excitedly about their parts in the historic endeavor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The right guidance systems, and one heck of a pilot!\u0022 exclaimed Jeb, shaking hands with Rocky and Wernher. Gus bite his tongue, and didn\u0027t mention that he had already planned to install his automated piloting system in every module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe meeting quickly collapsed into small, loud discussions about planning, development, schedules and budgets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcross the table, Maryenny smiled prettily at Gus. He felt his face flush again and looked away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Zj8cw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

All eyes in mission control were on the large monitors that covered the front wall. The base plate of what was now known as \u0022Minmus Acres\u0022 was already on the ground. The first of the major components, a stack of batteries and generators called a \u0022power pylon\u0022, had just completed its orbital insertion burn around Minmus. This was the first of the three dozen pinpoint landings that would make or break the entire project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGusdard watched the monitors closely, running over the mission plan in his head.

Gus held his chin in his hand, and closed his eyes. In addition to the pylon and the base plate already on the ground, four huge fuel tankers orbited Minmus to resupply the four construction drones, also already in orbit. The drones (nicknamed Alpha, Beta, Carrot and Django) had already shown their capabilities for orbital maneuvering, dragging the tankers into their proper orbits, performing fly-by surveys of the chosen landing site, and precisely positioning the base plate exactly on target (twice! since the first base plate was scrapped due to misaligned docking ports.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus hadn\u0027t been around for those maneuvers, but he hadn\u0027t heard anything negative about the drones so far.

All of KSC\u0027s top-level personnel were in attendance for this. Wernher, Bill, chief science officer Bob, head of mission control Gene, Rocky and other VIPs watched from the mezzanine of the large auditorium. Everyone was there. Except Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus looked around the room. Jeb was conspicuously missing. And no one else seemed to be looking for him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where\u0027s Jeb?\u0022 he whispered to the tracking intern at the monitor next to his.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022On the remote flight deck,\u0022 the intern responded, surprised at the question. \u0022Flying the drones.\u0022 Gus stared dumbly at the intern for a moment, then leapt to his feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What!?\u0022 Gus shouted, pounding his fist on the desk and not noticing he had keyed open his microphone. Feedback blasted through the intercom systems, causing everyone to cover their ears or toss away their headsets. Dozens of heads turned to look icily at Gus, who waved a meek apology and sat down. Maryenny watched him with concern, and keyed open a private communication channel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everything alright?\u0022 she asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, fine,\u0022 he began. \u0022No, I mean, it\u0027s not fine. Why is Jeb on the remote flight deck?\u0022 Maryenny cut off the comm and walked over to Gus\u0027s station. She had a worried look in her eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s where he\u0027s been for every maneuver,\u0022 she explained. \u0022Piloting the drones. All of them...at the same time.\u0022 The color left Gus\u0027s face, and his head went all swimmy. He tried to speak, but he only heard squeaks and wheezing come out of his mouth. \u0022I thought you knew,\u0022 Maryenny said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus shook his head slowly, trying not to pass out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well,\u0022 she continued, \u0022Jeb knows all the boys in flight systems engineering. He made some tweaks to the design, for better maneuverability. But they conflicted with your autopilot systems. So they took the autopilot out. The drones are all on manual remote control. By the time I heard about it, they were halfway to Minmus.\u0022 She looked at him apologetically, then hurried back to her station. Gus stared after her, still squeaking in disbelief. It was only Maryenny\u0027s voice over the intercom that snapped him back to the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fuel transfer complete,\u0022 she said, as the fuel finished draining from the pylon\u0027s orbital insertion engines to the drones\u0027 fuel tanks. \u0022Transfer engines separated and prepped for de-orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Gus watched the now-empty transfer engines plummet to the surface of Minmus, he felt his entire body shaking. Jeb was going to manually land the pylon with the drones. Orbital maneuvers were one thing, landing the base plate a few meters from a target was not much harder. But this operation required precise timing and almost superkerman accuracy. He turned away from the monitors, his eyes closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pylon normal burn,\u0022 the intercom said, and then \u0022Orbital inclination nominal, prep for de-orbit burn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus buried his head in his hands. If the pylon docking ports were off by even a fraction, the whole assembly would tip over, the nuclear generators would go critical, and the batteries would explode. He could see months of planning and the endless stream of Rockomax money disappearing in a flash of fiery failure. A mistake like that, in addition to the scrapped base plate, would ruin all the work so far and probably end the entire project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pylon descent over target. Target in sight. Descent speed 57 meters per second.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo fast, much too fast, thought Gus, burying his head in his hands. Everyone would blame his designs for the failure. He imagined what his career afterwards would look like. No other agency would have him. He probably wouldn\u0027t even be hired to design landing struts. Beads of perspiration dripped from his forehead onto his console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Descent burn complete, hovering. Lateral motion canceled. Horizontal offset, 3.28 meters north by northwest.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is it, Gus dreaded. It was all over but the endless resignation paperwork.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Offset corrected, descending point five meters per seconds. Touch down in 5...4...3...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe began to hyperventilate quietly into his hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Two...one...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus\u0027s vision went black.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was brought back to consciousness by loud cheering and slaps on the back. Through his grogginess, he vaguely heard the staff of mission control congratulating him. Maryenny ran up and hugged him tightly, and this more than anything brought his mind back to sharp clarity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe words \u0022TOUCHDOWN\u0022 and \u0022DOCKING CONTACT\u0022 flashed on the big monitors. Gus looked around wildly, and saw Jeb up on the mezzanine, flight suit jauntily half-unzipped, sharing celebratory champagne with Rocky, Wernher and Gene. Jeb caught his eye and raised his glass, nodding in approval.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pylon had landed perfectly. The drones had already separated and were back in orbit for rendezvous with the fuel tankers. The mission was a huge success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was all Jeb\u0027s fault.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/MsBhX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The tiny window of the habitat module didn\u0027t afford the greatest view, but he was still impressed by the size of it. Even though it was Kerbin\u0027s smallest satellite, it was still imposingly huge compared to anything else Gus had experienced. And somewhere on the surface of one of its frozen oceans was the half-completed lower phase of his magnum opus: the skyscraper \u0027Minmus Acres.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus had assumed he would never see it in person. He was content to monitor the progress from mission control, each nail-biting landing of each module, each the last-minute adjustment to the flight programs. And of course, each new way for Jeb to give him gray hairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Jeb\u0027s credit, he had managed ten perfect landings so far, eleven if one counted the tower base. And yet, he managed to make each one uniquely terrifying for Gus. In the most recent one, he waited to fire the descent braking burn until less than 200 meters above the target. \u0022I\u0027m finally getting a feel for what these bad boys can do,\u0022 he had explained. \u0022Great job with those, egghead,\u0022 he added, flashing the impish grin that everyone else found endearing, but only irritated Gus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb was, of course, the reason Gus was currently in orbit over Minmus, preparing to land at the construction site. The project plan called for direct on-site supervision of the subsequent phases, once the first phase of construction was complete. But Jeb had no interest in the job once he learned that the drones would still be doing all of the flying, and that the on-site role was mainly managerial and troubleshooting. Bill was the next obvious choice, but he was off-world on another mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus didn\u0027t know how his own name had been brought up for consideration, but he was fairly certain it was Jeb that had volunteered him. After Gus had been chosen, Jeb had come down to the workshop to congratulate him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You deserve it, egghead. That\u0027s a heckuva design you put together. Now you just gotta see it through. Plus, a stunt like this? It\u0027ll sure impress that pretty tracking engineer over in mission control you\u0027re always staring at.\u0022 Gusdard thought he had been hiding his feelings for Maryenny fairly well, but Jeb seemed to have a savant\u0027s talent for figuring out what made Gus nervous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe night before his mission, Gus had shared a long late dinner with Maryenny. He hadn\u0027t quite told her how he felt about her, but the evening had ended with the two of them sitting on top of the VAB, watching the sun come up over the launch pad where his ship was waiting. He hoped she felt something of what he had wanted to say to her. All he knew was that before dinner, he had been feeling anxious about the launch. After dinner, he was feeling anxious completely different reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for his ship, he couldn\u0027t even really call it that. The entire transfer from Kerbin to Minmus was on autopilot. And once in orbit, the drones would dock with the habitat module for it\u0027s final descent to the nascent skyscraper. Not only would Gus\u0027s masterwork of engineering be in Jeb\u0027s hands, but this time his very life would depend on the pilot\u0027s ability to perform yet another pinpoint landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because he was waiting for the next way in which Jeb would somehow annoy him, he was unsurprised when mission control contacted him mere hours before his scheduled descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hab 1, this is KSC, do you copy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Copy KSC, this is Gusdard for Hab 1.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gus, we\u0027re, ah, we\u0027re gonna need you to de-prep for descent.

Hold on one moment.\u0022 Gus switched off the comm, and screamed into the empty habitat module. After he caught his breath, he screamed again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis laptop blinked cheerily from the desk in the corner. He switched the comm back on. \u0022KSC, scratch the return mission. I might have a better idea.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours later, Gus beamed a new mission design back to KSC. The bold plan called for a second habitat module (with correctly installed docking ports and stabilizers) to be sent up. After Gus transferred fuel and supplies, then the useless module would be lithobraked onto the surface, far away from the construction site. Mission control gave the thumbs up, and the new module was soon on its way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDays later, Gus was in the new habitat module watching the old module drift away. He glanced at his watch, counting the seconds until the busted module made its retrograde de-orbit burn. But when the burn began, the engines were pointed the wrong way. Instead of de-orbiting, the busted module was heading for a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus opened the comm channel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022KSC, this is Hab 1 Prime.

It wasn\u0027t a bad plan. He wondered who had come up with it. He keyed open the comm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger that, KSC.

If his legs hadn\u0027t been strapped in, he would have flung himself into the ceiling in the minimal gravity. He was covered in a light sweat, and breathing heavily. His heart pounded.

It was dark outside his window, but the soft glow of monitors on the walls bathed him in a dim light. The sun wasn\u0027t due up for another hour or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus unstrapped his legs, then pushed himself off the bed gently. In the low gravity, he slowly floated towards the equipment locker labeled \u0022Snacks\u0022 and got himself a juice box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he sipped his juice, he went over the last few weeks in his mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission to land his habitat module -- with him inside -- had been terrifying. Gus had mentioned being excited to see the tower up close and in person. Then Jeb had flipped the module upside down only a few hundred meters above the ground. \u0022You get one heckuva view from this high up, egghead! Enjoy it!\u0022 he had quipped before righting the module and continuing the landing. When Gus yelled at him for it, Jeb had said it had all been in good fun, and he had complete control the whole time. He seemed hurt when Gus filed a formal complaint against him. Since then, he and Gus hadn\u0027t spoken outside of what was required for the landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landings had been getting more complex. As the tower grew taller, it was getting more top-heavy. Each landing had to be perfectly straight to avoid tipping over. More complicated still, the separated column design meant that Jeb didn\u0027t just have to land on target, but he had to avoid hitting any of the other tower columns while he did it. The margins for error had all but disappeared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Gus was living in the half-complete structure, watching each landing from up close, which added a whole new dimension to his anxiety. A few times, Jeb had been too cavalier with the landings, and only Gus\u0027s newly designed stability rings had saved the tower from disaster. From the observation deck, Gus felt every tremor as the stability thrusters corrected the tilt back to center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the nerve-wracking landings were nothing compared to the loneliness. After each delivery, Gus spent a few hours double checking connections and pressurization, wiring up electrical conduits, and patching software. Then came long days with nothing to do, except run through the designs and project plans, and report back to KSC every evening. He quickly lost interest in the few books he had brought, without finishing most of them. Until the parts for the new high-gain antenna were brought in, he couldn\u0027t even watch movies beamed from Kerbin. Only the occasional recreational EVA provided a break to the monotony, but even those couldn\u0027t distract him for long. He now knew what the other kerbonauts meant when they talked about, \u0022Long weeks of boredom separated by minutes of sheer terror.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus only had to hold on to his sanity for another month or so. The tower was almost habitable enough for KSC to risk sending more support personnel. Only a few more column module deliveries, and then it would be time for the mid-connector plate, the module that would tie the freestanding columns together into one structure. After that, everything would be simpler, straight up the center, as high as they could go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they got that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the last delivery, Jeb had accidentally targeted the wrong column, and only realized his mistake a few meters above the tower, on the opposite side of the central column. Gus told him to ascend back up to 100 meters and come down on the correct side, but Jeb hadn\u0027t listened. Instead, he had kept the module hovering, and used thursters to maneuver around the central column. Gus had watched in horror as the module swung dangerously close to the observation deck. The exhaust from the descent engines had washed over the deck, and Gus could feel the heat even inside the command pod. In the end, the module docked in the correct position, but it had left him shaken and angry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus had put too much work into the project to see it all come crashing down. He remembered his nightmare, and shuddered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had to protect the tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had to protect the tower from Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis laptop blinked from his workbench across the room. His autopilot software was saved on the drive. Over the weeks, in the down time between module deliveries, he had been tweaking it, feeding it the data from each of Jeb\u0027s landings, and letting it learn how to correct the pilot\u0027s erratic moves. He sucked a glob of juice up through the straw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis eyes flicked up to a cabinet above the workbench that held the diagnostic and interface cables for the construction drones\u0027 remote pilot systems. He took another gulp of juice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe glanced at the monitor on the wall that gave the realtime overview of the tower. The construction drones, Carrot and Django, were still docked to the top of their columns, waiting for sunrise before they would head back into orbit to grab more modules. Gus gave one final suck on the straw, drawing the last bit of juice up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe juice box collapsed with a satisfying crush. Gus dropped the emtpy box into the waste drawer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrabbing his laptop and the interface cables, he headed for the airlock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/VgdhP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I throttled up to about 15%. I had done this procedure for every landing. But this time soon as I did, the drone didn\u0027t lift off.
