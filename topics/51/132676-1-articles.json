The tour boat was for tourists to examine the wide debris field in the waters east of the KSC, not strictly profitable but good for PR and it gave engineering a chance to experiment with designs stable in liquids.

Many of the lower-ranking members of the Academy of Science are quite satisfied with the program\u0027s progress, though the truly influential members continue to look upon us with disdain. It has been discovered that the out-of-control behavior exhibited by the KSP\u0027s flying craft is an error deliberately introduced into the standard flight assistance programs by, we suspect, elements related to the Academy of Science. The programs are quite useful and functional in some contexts, but in any context where the craft is\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0flying horizontally using traditional airfoil flight, the pilot assistance programs confuse the reaction wheel stability programs and we wind up with things like the pool incident.

The KSP has opted to emulate many of the missions of these programs, resulting in Spudnik 1 becoming the first orbiter, getting the KSP paid five\u00A0times (Spudnik 1, first orbiter, first artificial satellite contracts, first orbiter, 2,500 m/s speed record). Spudnik 1 was returned to Kerbin for recovery of it and its scientific data.

For no discernible reason, four (!) major sponsors angrily canceled their contracts with the KSP. Mortimer advised us to pay the penalty clauses for failing their contracts, as fighting a legal battle with several large corporations would cost more and endanger the KSC\u0027s ability to secure future contracts. As a result, rumors of the KSC\u0027s incompetency and financial insolvency hit the airwaves around Kerbin, severely damaging the program\u0027s reputation. When all was assessed, the KSC stood in the red. But all was not lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene Kerman leveraged the KSC\u0027s remaining reputation to secure three contracts with yet another major company, Fuel Tanks Plus. FTP \u0026amp; the KSC already enjoyed a friendly relationship - KSC appreciates the extra-large fuel tanks manufactured by FTP, and FTP values KSC as one of their primary customers. Specifically, FTP contracted the KSC to conduct temperature and visual surveys of Kerbin, and to make a crewed Mun landing. In addition, a government grant became available for conducting research in one of the many places on Kerbin that defy explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advances on these contracts offered just enough funds for the KSC to send out some flights. But there were complications - FTP\u0027s surveys required either breaking the unbreakable air-breathing altitude limit of 18,000 meters or de-orbiting a capsule in exactly the right place at exactly the right time (The latter was immediately rejected unceremoniously as being \u0022too complicated\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe situation seemed hopeless, until an intern happened to notice a toggle switch labeled \u0022dry\u0022 and \u0022wet\u0022 on the side of a Panther 404 jet engine during routine ignition testing. The resulting inferno fortunately dealt little damage due to the nature of the testing ground. Post-testing analysis indicated that the Panther 404 has an in-built \u0022afterburner\u0022 that can be used to increase thrust at the cost of increased fuel consumption. An existing KSC craft, the Explorer F1, is both very lightweight and equipped with a Panther 404.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, KSC decided to send out two flights - a Seamen F1 with a reliable J-33 would tackle the low-altitude surveys and the government grant, while an Explorer F1 would attempt to fly higher than any air-breathing craft had ever flown. Unfortunately, the Seamen F1\u0027s camera was \u0022off\u0022, or so pilot Valentina\u00A0Kerman claims.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uciCa/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Explorer F1 performs with flying colors, demonstrating the value of its military-licensed components.

As government grants for research became available, the space program fulfilled them. Two kerbals were rescued from orbit - Triigh and Melvie, with a rescue ship launched for Versia Kerman. A duo orbiter - Joefen and Melvie - was sent up to orbit Kerbin for a full week. A SCANsat was launched to create a comprehensive orbital map of Kerbin, followed by two more SCANsats bound for Minmus and the Mun.

He briefly thought back...over the past week, the program had rescued two kerbonauts launched by other programs with no real provision for retrieving them, as well as placing a permanent satellite each in the orbit of the Mun and Minmus, as well as performing a flyby in space high above Minmus to gather data. The Minmus probe had showed every sign of being effective, so the odds of future probes being deployed to land on Minmus were high. He was particularly proud of the probe - somehow, her launch, Minmus burn, and flyby of Minmus itself had coincided with his shifts. And soon, another important mission would end - two kerbonauts, Joefen \u0026amp; Milvie, had been sent up in a modified tour shuttle to orbit Kerbin for seven whole days.

Accordingly, many competing companies - Rockomax, Fuel Tanks Plus, Kerbodyne, C7 Aerospace, among others - were perfectly willing to cooperate in order to limit the spread of MRS. \u0022How many of these tanks does the KSC see itself requiring?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Twenty to thirty in the immediate future.\u0022 Gene quoted. \u0022The subassembly only uses one MRS tank, but it\u0027s a powerful subassembly that, as demonstrated, can send probes to Minmus or the Mun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar away on Kerbin, seven kerbals sat around an octagonal ottoman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sam?\u0022 One of them asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes?\u0022 Another replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can we use an actual table for once? I\u0027m sure this is great as a footrest, but we can\u0027t snack on this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No.\u0022 Sam replied. \u0022We have to be different from the KSC. Now, everyone, put on your Science hoods. We have some science discussion to do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs one, the seven kerbals lowered their blue science hoods over their faces, obscuring their identities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now then,\u0022 Sam continued. \u0022Operations reports?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wizard, the testing of the JE-1 Mule engine is complete. It\u0027s not as efficient as the latest C7 engines...or indeed any of them...but it has an unprecedented amount of power for a turbofan. It should allow transport of any size of space debris from KSC launches, if we get there before their recovery teams. More importantly, our organization can build it in-house so no one can notice a sudden increase in the purchase of atmospheric engines.\u0022 The first kerbal answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Based on the reports from the Change Detector, we\u0027ve determined that the KSC are getting numerous rewards for emulating space programs that don\u0027t seem to exist in what we define as \u0022The observable universe\u0022. Penetrating their security and finding out exactly how this is possible should be our number one priority.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The loss of the space program\u0027s orbiter changes everything. With that, we can inflame doubts in the public consciousness about the suitability of a space program. In particular, since the ship was based on a standard tourist shuttle, we can put a complete halt to space tourism for the foreseeable future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Sam. Do we really have to call you Wizard?\u0022 The third kerbal spoke in a wheedling voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we use each other\u0027s names, is it really a secret society?\u0022 Sam replied sharply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But you\u0027re my brother! We all already know who we are! And can we please turn the light up?

She looked over - the pilot, Valentina, carrying a tray of nondescript foodlike substances \u0022milled\u0022 from algae and microbes, a trial for long-term life support, standing by the table. \u0022May I sit here?\u0022 She asked in her somber, matter of fact way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I suppose.\u0022 Verisa replied. Valentina did so, somehow managing to place the uneven cheap tin tray on the even cheaper plastic table without making a sound. She made a face as she bit into a \u0022protein bar\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe duo ate in an odd silence. After an interminable time, Verisa spoke. \u0022Val? Can I ask you something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina paused for a moment, placed her food down, then answered \u0022Sure. Go ahead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does coming back from space scare you?\u0022 Verisa asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course.\u0022 Valentina replied immediately. \u0022It\u0027s exhilarating, but also terrifying. I don\u0027t doubt I\u0027ll make it, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWny?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u0022It must be great to have your confidence.\u0022 Verisa replied automatically, eyes dropping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look.\u0022 Verisa looked up to find Valentina staring directly into her eyes. \u0022Every spacecraft is an engineering compromise, and as long as it functions within those tolerances, it will be just fine. As long as the spacecraft is fine, there is absolutely no reason to doubt that we will return home. It\u0027s bumpy and hot, but we will make it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Joefen and Milvie didn\u0027t.\u0022 Verisa argued. \u0022They, they....\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAll alone, freezing in space...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022 Valentina replied. \u0022Their re-entry profile exceeded their spacecraft\u0027s tolerances. They burned too long, so they entered the lower atmosphere too fast. They came in at too high an angle of attack, so instead of catching the air and gliding they were flipped over and started coming down tail-first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarkness suddenly flashed across Verisa\u0027s eyes. \u0022Are you saying they deserved to die?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Of course not.\u0022 Valentina replied quickly. \u0022Joefen apparently did exactly what I would have done in the situation - start to yaw and roll to get some kind of drag, any kind of drag. But it\u0027s important to recognize what went wrong so it isn\u0027t repeated if we send up later winged re-entry vehicles. Besides, you came back from space fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Yy7Cqyn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yy7Cqyn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe silence, no longer comfortable, dragged on. \u0022Hey.\u0022 Valentina said suddenly. \u0022It\u0027d be dishonest to admit that I wasn\u0027t asked to talk to you. You\u0027ve been down lately, more than most others. Is there anything you need?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVerisa recognized the subtle change of tone from two friends having a conversation to a supervisor checking in with a subordinate. \u0022I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m good to go to space right now.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EIdiot.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0She heard herself answer truthfully, on a whim. \u003Ci\u003EThey won\u0027t have a use for a Kerbonaut who can\u0027t go to space...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina nodded. \u0022Alright.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright?\u0022 Verisa questioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright.\u0022 Valentina replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVerisa stopped eating. \u0022Excuse me, but how is it alright for a Kerbonaut to not be able to go to space?\u0022 She asked suddenly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Verisa, nothing is worse than forcing someone to do something they\u0027re not ready to do. Maybe you\u0027ll be ready to into space someday, maybe not for the foreseeable future. Maybe never. In the mean time, you\u0027re still part of our program.\u0022 Valentina explained matter-of-factly. \u0022Bob hasn\u0027t gone to space since some of the first kerbaled suborbital flights. Would you benefit from being taken off the active roster? There are a number of scientific instruments that need to be calibrated around KSC and Kerbin, and we can always use another pair of eyes looking at spacecraft blueprints before we actually build the things. Maybe you can double or triple check the re-entry section, just to be sure.\u0022 Valentina fidgeted slightly as she spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think...I think that\u0027d be for the best.\u0022 Verisa admitted slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay.\u0022 Valentina acknowledged. \u0022In that case, Milvie and the engineering department has prepared a rover with instruments that needs to be driven around the space center. You\u0027ve got the training to operate the instruments, and don\u0027t worry about the rover - it\u0027s a test for Minmus rovers, and it needs to be...crash-proof.\u0022 She winked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Crash proof?\u0022 Verisa asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go nuts.\u0022 Valentina replied, plopping a set of keys next to Verisa\u0027s meal. \u0022I have to run though, so let me know how it works out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/52862/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam Kerman stretched luxuriously in his hammock.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EWhat a beautiful morning.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0He placed his unclad feet on the ground and retrieved a cup of coffee and a donut from his kitchen storage unit.
