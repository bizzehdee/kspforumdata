In the upper atmosphere, tiny charges have destabilised the structure of the rocket. Air resistance tears at small holes in the skin, and the rocket quickly turns off course. Seven and a half kilometres from the surface of the ocean, it breaks apart while still travelling at almost mach 4. Four minutes and forty five seconds after launch, the flight of HARP-1 ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base went crazy after their first successful flight.

Thirty seconds later, the booster ignited, letting out a throaty roar. A streak of smoke shot from the engine, followed by a tongue of flame.

The sixteen meter long rocket took up barely a quarter of the assembly hanger and yet it looked huge to her.

She poured a cup of coffee from the jug, a jug that from the small taste she took must have been there since HARP-1 was launched. Looking around she smiled at the gathering. Most of the site staff was either watching here or from sites further to the north, out of the blast zone. She saw the Corporal, standing with Arthur\u0027s secretary. The Chief and the Doctor, discussing something in hushed tones in one corner, both of them glancing out at the pad when they thought the other wasn\u0027t looking.

She can hear footsteps behind her, following her into mission control as she bursts through the door. Charlie has a map spread across his desk, tracing paths as fast as he can lay his ruler, while Lieutenant Macmillan makes hurried calculations.

In the quiet that follows their outburst, the Major speaks again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do I have to build a wall between you? Or can you act with some sense of decorum for the rest of the meeting.\u0022 The pair deflate, a little, and turn back to her. \u0022Thank you.

Essentially, Ma\u0027am, in order to be useful we can\u0027t fix it.\u0022 The Chief is glaring at him as he speaks, making him stumble over his words. \u0022I, uh...

She bites her lip, hoping he\u0027s right. They had spent the two weeks since her return from Washington in near-desperate preparation for this launch. The engineers had barely left their hangar and workshops other than to wince at the sun as they trekked between the building and their cars so they could go home and sleep. The chief hadn\u0027t even done that, falling asleep on the couch in his office most nights.

The Doctor\u0027s staff had worked just as hard as the Chief\u0027s, but on the payload rather than the hardware. Orbiter-1 was a unique design and not meant to be copied. Instead it\u0027s construction had informed the design of Orbiter-2 which was now balanced atop the rocket out on the pad. A cylinder topped by a nose cone, it was equipped with a second repeater antennae to improve the \u0027view\u0027 a receiver would have of it. It was slightly lighter than Orbiter-1 at 21 kilograms as well. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ENeither Arthur nor Harriet MacMillan had decided to join them in the Mission Control room.

Orbiter-3 was an almost exact copy of Orbiter-2, prepared in a hurry so that SREP could meet their launch date and not fall even further behind the Germans. Under it was the Finckley booster, a barely tested design which the Chief showed only grudging respect for. That little gave Jane confidence though. The Chief was both showing that he could work to others plans and that he thought it would get the job done. If he hadn\u0027t, he wouldn\u0027t have let it fly on Orbiter-3. At least, she hoped that he was smart enough to object to anything that would compromise this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was becoming something of a tradition for her, watching the rockets being erected.

The tension mounted as the day went on, as people went about the final launch preparations as if their lives, rather than just their careers, depended on it. Finally midday came, the rocket casting barely a hint of a shadow thanks to the sun hanging almost overhead. Everyone either assembled at safe distances from the pad or descended into the control bunker. The day saw two firsts for SREP, the first gathering of public viewers to a launch, and the first time the media had been given access to Canaveral. A TV crew had set up to record the flight. Jane thought they were secretly hoping for a failure early in flight, which they could tear apart on the nightly news. Perhaps she was being too cynical, due to the way the media had lambasted her over her public congratulations to the German space program. It had been the right thing to do, to present a public image of friendship and amicability. Even so, it made her twitch when the papers implied that perhaps she wasn\u0027t working in the best interest of these United States of America.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe let out a short sigh and tried to settle more comfortably into her chair at the back of the mission control room. Everyone who could fit was either down here or up on the observation deck, although admittedly that didn\u0027t say much considering how cramped this room was. Upstairs wasn\u0027t much better, but she understood that 30 or so staff were packed in there even so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually the last of the pre-flight checks were finished and the final counts came.

A month ago, I doubt they thought that we would manage it. But we did, and I\u0027d like you to know I am proud, and honoured to have worked with you through this.\u0022 She leads them in a brief round of applause, smiling broadly. \u0022Not that our success means we can stop, of course. I know some of you have approached me with ideas for the future of SREP, and they are magnificent ideas.\u0022 She gestures to Arthur who nods in acknowledgement. \u0022These long term aims, especially putting a person in space, are admirable. But SREP needs some shorter term aims, especially now we\u0027ve reached our first... milestone. So, to put it simply, has anyone got any idea\u0027s?\u0022 She opens her hands invitingly, and the Chief\u0027s hand immediately goes up. She nods to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have something, before the others say their piece. It might save them some worry, actually. It\u0027s a two fold hardware development program. Steven, Finckley that is, thinks he can extend the usefulness of the RL-3 by expanding on his booster design. Initial projections show that almost the same hardware that launched RL-3 could put 100 kilograms into orbit.\u0022 He pauses, letting them absorb that before continuing. \u0022On a more long term level, SREP needs to expand into designing and constructing it\u0027s own large lift capability. 100 kilograms is fine, for now, but if Mr Roth wants to see a man in space some day, we\u0027re going to need to be able to build a rocket that would put him there. I would like to propose a booster with a payload of around two tons to be put into service inside of a year.\u0022 He looks around as Lieutenant MacMillan snorts, looking at him incredulously. \u0022Problem?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Two tons? Really? We barely managed twenty kilograms a few days ago, and you think you can design something that can put a truck in orbit?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Given free reign, yeah, I can. Engineering can. Think you\u0027ll be able to cope with flying it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022People, enough please. Thank you chief. Anyone else?\u0022 There\u0027s a brief pauses before Dr. Pickering leans forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m going to assume from the success of Orbiter-3, we\u0027ll be continuing with the program and launching more rockets which the Chief builds his newest creation?\u0022 The Major nods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, I\u0027ve had confirmation of that. We\u0027ll be receiving a new RL-3 every two months. The Army claims that\u0027s all it can spare for the time being.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, if that\u0027s all we have... I\u0027d like to suggest further launches of the Orbiter program. I was informed before Orbiter-3 that the Finckley booster had more capacity than we were using. I decided to play it safe with the third launch, but with that under our belts, well... I believe we could outfit an Orbiter payload to function as a research satellite. The data it transmits back could be invaluable to the programs future, especially to determine just what a space vehicle for a human would need.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Agreed.

Orbiter-3 achieved orbital speed moments prior to the initial loss of connection, and it\u0027s given me an idea. The current way of expanding the communications range of a surface transmitter is to use the ionosphere to bounce signals, yes? What if we were to use a satellite to forward transmissions, unrestricted by the vagaries of the atmosphere. Not only would we be able to use it to maintain telemetry and data transmission from future missions, but I imagine it would be of great use to the government and the armed forces as well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I assume you have a plan of how to go about deploying something like this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If we could develop a way of using a satellite like Orbiter-3 as a... relay, we could do it relatively cheaply I imagine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is that even possible?

Everyone she saw was hard at work, preparing for the next stages of the space program, not a single person slacking off after the successful Orbiter-3 mission. Meanwhile, she had been dealing with the exhausting political side of the program. SREP was going to need a larger budget and more rockets if they were going to do much more than fly tiny satellites into orbit. Luckily she\u0027d managed to secure at least a little more funding, enough for current development strategies. It would need a major coup to truly expand the program though. She had so many plans, and barely enough money for half of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow she was sitting back in their meeting room, waiting for the other department heads to arrive with what promised to be an array of expensive but overall useful projects which would be necessary to be flown. She hoped she wouldn\u0027t have to cancel anyone\u0027s dream project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe stood as the various department heads came into the room, papers under their arms, and waited until they were seated before sitting herself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Welcome back. Shall we get straight too it?\u0022 The doctor nods and the Chief, looking tired, puts his thumbs up. \u0022Well then. Doctor? What do you have?\u0022 The man hands out some sketches before he speaks, gathering his thoughts as he does so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Orbiter-4, as we have so creatively christened this payload design, would be a scientific variant of Orbiter-3. Fitted with gravitometers, thermometers and Geiger counters, we hope to establish a baseline of information for the exo-atmospheric environment which would assist the program in building future satellites and in studying the necessities for allowing the survival of humans in space.\u0022 He looks up from his pre-prepared speech and glances at his audience. \u0022It also includes a biological study which may allow us to explore what exposure to space would do to living creatures. We could, however, cut that if mass becomes an issue\u0022 He says with a smile, almost apologetically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay... Chief, this is quoting 88 kilograms, can we lift that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Certainly should be able too. I\u0027ve got a few plans here that should help.\u0022 He fishes through his papers until he finds a specific one. \u0022There we go. Finckley\u0027s put together an expansion on his original design, calling it the block 2.\u0022 He places it in the centre of the table. \u0022Higher fuel capacity, and with an additional engine to shorten burn times for large payloads. He think\u0027s it\u0027ll help reduce burn-out stresses as well, I know that was an issue with Orbiter-3. He says it should be possible to shut down the engines two at a time, maintain the centre of thrust but reduce final TWR.\u0022 The major nods, gesturing for him to continue. \u0022It should allow for 90 kilogram payloads from the RL-3. Though the Doc will be pushing the absolute maximum.\u0022 He says, grinning at the other man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When will the block two be ready for launch?\u0022 All of them are focused now, talking about major leaps forward in their capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022January, most likely. As much as Finckley\u0027s confident, I\u0027d like to test fire it at least once before we throw it into space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good. How about it Doctor?\u0022 Jane says, turning to the other man. \u0022Will you have Orbiter-4 ready in two months?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course. It\u0027s mostly already available hardware. The transmission of scientific data is handled by similar systems to those on Orbiter-3, with more capacity. Two weeks after the new year?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It works for me. What about your other project Chief, the new booster? As much luck?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Some. The, uh, \u0027Ajax\u0027 booster is in the initial phase of design. Mostly we\u0027re looking at machinery design and fuel choice. We\u0027re almost certainly going to use RP-1, a refined kerosene product with liquid oxygen, it\u0027s simply a case of getting proper performance out of it. Early tests are good though, we should be able to test a prototype of the rocket motor around February. Add upper stage design, prototyping and testing, and we\u0027ll hopefully be flying a test model around... May, but I\u0027ll say June to be safe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m impressed Chief. I can\u0027t wait to see one out on the pad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Me neither Ma\u0027am. It\u0027ll be one hell of a sight.\u0022 He smiles at his own imagined images and she fights down an amused chuckle. After a moment she takes a deep breath and turns to the Lieutenant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay, MacMillan, last but not least. What have you got for us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um... Ma\u0027am, I think what I have, essentially, is more problems than solutions.\u0022 She hands out a drawing of her own. \u0022That\u0027s the concept for Relay-1. As imaginative as the Doctor\u0027s suggestion.\u0022 he gives her an amused look and she blushes slightly. \u0022Essentially it would be a tape recorder in space. The parabolic dish antenna would allow it to receive \u0027play\u0027 or \u0027record\u0027 instructions, and content. Then, the pole antenna\u0027s would be used to broadcast the pre-recorded message.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And it works?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The theory does. We can control a tape recorder remotely in one of the Doctor\u0027s laboratories. We have two issues though, one of range, the other of power consumption. We\u0027re not completely sure that the signal will be strong enough to control the recorder at orbital distances, though that isn\u0027t the main worry. For constant broadcasting, the satellite will quickly drain the battery. Instead, we\u0027re going to have to use it sparingly, leaving it for periods of time in between each broadcast to recharge its batteries.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah...\u0022 The Major pauses for a moment, thinking hard. \u0022I\u0027m... going to approve Relay-1. It will serve as a fine demonstration of capabilities, even if they are more limited than any of us will let on. We\u0027ll schedule it for launch on the second RL-3 delivered, around May next year, okay?\u0022 The woman nods, visibly pleased. \u0022There\u0027s more, and you might not like it. Your communication program won\u0027t progress to another launch unless power generation issues are dealt with. Low capability we can deal with, but I refuse to put unusable hardware into orbit unless it is demonstrating developing technologies, as relay-1 will. Is that understood?\u0022 She nods again, less happy than the last time. \u0022Okay people, get to work. These are going to be exciting times for SREP, and I expect great things in the next twelve months.\u0022 They exchange pleasantries on the way out, laughing and joking with each other, even the Lieutenant. They were confident about the future now. They had a focus, an objective, and by god if she didn\u0027t believe that they would manage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedia:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Quwzpetl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Quwzpetl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EOrbiter-4 scientific payload design\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rFALMkgl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rFALMkgl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EFinckley block 2 concept design\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bwmXpNnl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bwmXpNnl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ERelay-1 communication satellite design\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-25T18:44:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2014 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HMS Sophia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMS Sophia","CreatedById":122688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EChapter XIV - First Discoveries\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18th December 1957\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe last month of 1957 was a quiet one for SREP. The work going on was neither as rushed or as tense as it had been before the success of their last launch, and everyone was still riding the wave of enthusiasm that Orbiter-3 had created. As Christmas approached most of the staff whose families still lived away from Canaveral and the growing city left the base, taking accumulated leave to go home for the holiday period. As the base was reduced down to a skeleton staff, the Major took to taking almost daily walks around the various buildings, mainly so she could find out who was left without reading interminable reports. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIt was on one of these tours, one cool Wednesday afternoon, that the Major came upon Lieutenant MacMillan, almost alone in one of the labs.

She almost laughed at herself. The first Orbiter failures had infected the program with a sense of despondency and, at least for her, it had been creeping back in on the run up to the launch of Orbiter-4. She hoped it was just her, at least, as she looked out from the observation deck at the distant rocket sitting upright on its stand. It was very slightly taller, thanks to the larger booster and heavier payload, but not enough that you could see it at this distance. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHer breath caught as the final moments of the countdown came over the intercom, surprising her.

It grew into a cloud of smoke until the umbilicals fell away, swinging to the side, and the rocket began to lift ever so slowly from the ground. Soon it was just a bright dot and a trail of smoke, climbing away from Canaveral and into space. The Major took a cup of coffee and a chair, and close her eyes to listen to the mission control crew.

Thanks to him, she\u0027d had to promise the Commander Atlantic Fleet that the cost of the deployment of a single carrier patrol force would come out of SREP\u0027s budget, not the Navy\u0027s. As if the sailors didn\u0027t have enough money as it was. Not only that, but they\u0027d had to put back the launch by a day so that the ships could get into position. Maybe she should dock the Chief\u0027s pay to cover it. She sighed heavily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the relaxed atmosphere around SREP facilities was getting a little too relaxed, but it had been so nice to be able to kick back and do without the formality of military service. Even so, it was making it difficult to manage the program adequately. Maybe she needed more oversight, or more people she could trust to delegate work too. She thought the Chief could handle that, but apparently not. Maybe she needed more officers in senior positions, no matter how stiff they might be. Maybe she needed one officer. She pulled back from the parapet of the observation bunker and blinked. Where had\u003Cem\u003E that\u003C/em\u003E come from. She shook her head to clear it and was about to go back to her thoughts when the last moments of the countdown interrupted her. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAjax lifted clear from the pad, ascending slowly. She watched it through binoculars until it was just an orange glow atop a pillar of smoke, as it turned away from them and sped into the sky. Three minutes into the flight, the first stage was split from the rocket by explosive bolts, and the smaller second stage fired, pushing it further and faster. At six minutes, it reached the highest point of its flight despite the second stage still burning. It was flying exactly as expected on a fast sub-orbital trajectory, even as it started falling back to Earth. Two and a half minutes later, the second stage separated from the little probe, letting it fall alone into the atmosphere. Faster than the speed of sound it fell, as the first wisps of atmosphere began tugging at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it was falling instruments first. The expressions in the bunker were dour, despite the success of the Ajax flight. If the re-entry section failed, future plans would become much more complicated. But their luck held. Two minutes after final separation, the probe righted itself and began punching into the thicker atmosphere, heat-shield first. There were cheers briefly, until contact was lost with the probe.

The two meter wide probe dominated the room, despite it\u0027s relatively small size. It was charred along the bottom and edges, where the heat of re-entry had stripped away the surface layers and torn at the pad underneath it. All but a tiny stub of the antenna was missing, presumably torn away as the craft fell back to the surface. The Major looked it over as she leaned against the wall, keeping out of the way until the Doctor noticed her. He looked up from a set of papers and handed them off to a junior before he looked her way at last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Major. I thought I\u0027d see you down here at some point.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I could barely keep away. Have you learned anything?\u0022 He smiles and nods, turning to look at the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, yes and no. Obviously it\u0027s going to take a lot of work to really get everything out of this that we can. Even so, we have learned some basics from it. The pad functioned exactly as it should have, absorbing heat and burning away in layers as it became too hot. The fact that the probe survived at all implies that though.\u0022 He said, cane tapping on the ground as he thought. \u0022Then there\u0027s the accelerometer. We had a basic one mounted simply to figure out how touch re-entry was on the probe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That makes a lot of sense.

Except the meter came back stuck at 15 G\u0027s, and it seems to have reached that around eleven minutes after launch. We\u0027re not sure how much higher it might have gotten, or how long that level of force was experienced for, but even brief exposure to those levels might be...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022An issue for a person, yes.

As the tiny satellite span around the Earth at monumental velocities, the men and women who had successfully put it there stretched, drank the thick, bitter coffee that SREP was becoming infamous for and ate cold meat sandwiches. It wasn\u0027t much of a meal, Jane thought as she shared in it from the back of the room, but it was something to keep them going for the few hours it would take them to complete the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt quarter past three the team began the steps to restart the hardware on Relay-1, one of the first real tests of the system. As expected, bringing it back on was simple, as was initiating the program for a circularisation burn at 15:25. As the space craft left Canaveral\u0027s line of communication, it was circling the planet between 660 and 780 kilometres up. It would be nearly two hours before it was back with them and they were ready to perform the last stages of the mission. Even so, the control team wasn\u0027t allowed to leave other than for brief comfort breaks. No one was taking the chance of a loss of mission-critical staff because someone chose that moment to take a tumble down the stairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, at quarter past four, on the afternoon of the 20th, Relay-1 was ready for it\u0027s final preparations.

Arthur, after the Doctor\u0027s experiments, I thought we had decided-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, it is not a problem of safety, as much as an organisational one. For this mission we are going to need, along with everything else, pilots, yes?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course. Without the people, there\u0027s not really much point of having a crewed mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Exactly. But Major, none of us are pilots. Oh, I\u0027m sure the Lieutenants in mission control might have done some flying, but they are certainly not the sort of people we\u0027re going to need for flying rockets, are they?\u0022 They\u0027re silent for a moment, looking at each other wordlessly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where are we going to get experienced- Military test pilots.\u0022 She leans her elbows on the edge of the desk and puts her head in her hands. \u0022The Chief already cost me enough with the Navy, now I\u0027ve got to go begging to the Air Force as well?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Actually, I think all the services have test pilots.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thank you Arthur, yes.\u0022 She sighs quietly before drawing herself up. \u0022Okay. Have you given any thought to the sort of training program they\u0027re going to have to go through?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I believe a three phase program of medical, physical and intellectual training would suffice for our first group.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our first?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of many, I would hope. After initial selection, training would last 18 months to two years to prepare them for every aspect of space flight and for further missions beyond the simple attainment of placing a human in space. If we can select our first group in the next six months, I predict the first of them achieving flight readiness in late 1960 to early 1961.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re serious.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Totally Major. I simply hadn\u0027t realised how short time was until I began putting down on paper a more rigorous plan.\u0022 She bites her lip, tapping a finger on the edge of the desk, thinking hard. Eventually she shakes her head and smiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay. Corporal!\u0022 She calls out. A moment later her aide pokes their head around the office door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Major?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come in, please. I need you to draft up a message to all armed services and major flight industry suppliers with test flight programs. Inform that SREP is interested in recruiting a limited number of pilots for a confidential space flight program, and request a list of names, with records, by... September.\u0022 The young NCO notes the Major\u0027s request down quickly before leaving again without a word. A moment later, the clatter of a typewriter can be heard from the outer office.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well then Arthur. You\u0027ve got your wish. You get to figure out what facilties and staff you\u0027ll need though. I\u0027m giving you a new title, head of the astronaut program.\u0022 She\u0027d hoped for at least a little surprise, but all she got was a bright smile and a happy grin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thank you Major, I am very grateful. I wont let you down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sure. Just, please, don\u0027t be asking for too much of my budget. I realise how expensive this is going to be, but if SREP can\u0027t control its budget infaltion...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then the government will have to learn exactly what it is asking of us, and pay the price.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know it doesn\u0027t work like that Arthur.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know, Major. I wish you luck with your budgets. I\u0027m going to go and plan some additions to the base.\u0022 He leaves with a grin and what can only be described as a spring in his step. She smiles and goes back to her work, though inside she is pleased that things are progressing so rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23rd June 1958\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, Major? There\u0027s two officers from the Air Force here to see you.\u0022 The Major stands, gesturing to the Corporal to let them in. The two men, both in full uniform and with Colonel\u0027s rank pins. One closes the door, the other standing in front of her desk. She glances at the somewhat crumpled uniform jacket slung untidily over one end of her desk and feels a brief moment of self-conciousness at the state of what she was wearing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sorry gentlemen, no-one informed me you were coming. I hope you found your way easily enough.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Considering what we\u0027re here to discuss, we figured it would be best we not advertise ourselves particularly.\u0022 The Major fought the urge to roll her eyes. Despite the service separation, a pair of full-bird colonels could still break her.\u0022I\u0027m Colonel Taft, this is Colonel Jameson.\u0022 They all shake hands, finally sitting. Jameson opens his briefcase and hands the Major several papers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve been following SREP\u0027s work with some interest, especially the recent launches of the Ajax rocket. In particular, we\u0027re interested in the theoretical ability to return an object from orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Army\u0027s been doing what we did for years, why are you coming to us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I said orbit, Major, not a sub-orbital trajectory. We\u0027ve seen the flight plan for your next Ajax test.\u0022 She was almost surprised by that. They were trying to keep it relatively quiet. But then when could any part of the United States keep a secret from another. She looked down at the papers for the first time, scanning them quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Cartographer?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022On the face of it, a geographical mapping satellite. The payload will be a camera package, with one or more capsules for the safe return of undeveloped film to CONUS or the surrounding waters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022On the face of it? If I took a wild guess and said this wouldn\u0027t be taking pictures of our allies coast lines, I wouldn\u0027t be far wrong, would I.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The satellite would need to be placed into an orbit that would cross both Central Europe and Central Asia, yes.\u0022 She\u0027s silent for a long minute, studying the papers. \u0022I\u0027m sure if we could work this into SREP\u0027s plans, the Air Force would be more than happy to consider allowing additional test pilots to volunteer for your space flight program.\u0022 The Major gives the Colonel a sharp look, frowning. Eventually she nods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well. I\u0027ll have to take these for our engineers to look at. I\u0027ll be sure to keep them secure, don\u0027t worry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thank you Major.\u0022 And with that the two senior officers leave without a second glance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T18:58:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HMS Sophia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMS Sophia","CreatedById":122688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T15:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter XVIII - Orbital Return\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd July 1958\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix weeks after Relay-1 was deployed and performed the first transmissions from orbit, SREP launched the second of its new Ajax rockets, testing it\u0027s ability to deliver a satellite into orbit as the RL-3 combination had been doing for some months. The Major watched from the observation bunker as the powerful looking rocket lifted from the pad and sped into the sky, leaving her wondering when she\u0027d see a person board one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETen minutes after the launch, the two metre wide probe was in orbit and still attached to the booster that had placed it there. Thanks to Relay-1\u0027s efforts, the staff had learned the value of a stable near-circular orbit, and the test craft was rotating around the earth between 400 and 460 kilometres up. An hour and a half later, the probe was coming back into communication range of Canaveral and the Major had descended into the mission control room to watch the final stages of the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Spec, begin hardware restart.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hardware restarting, Control... board is green.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight?

Craft prepared for re-entry burn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay, set for burn and lock controls.\u0022 The team settled down to wait as the small craft continued its rotation around the planet. For the probe to come down in the landing zone just off the East coast, it would have to fire its booster on the other side of the planet. There had been some concerns of re-igniting the booster, especially without having a connection too it, but after the success of relay-1\u0027s second burn placing it in a higher orbit, everyone felt confident. Even so, nothing had ever been brought back down to the surface from orbit. Hell, it had only been six months since they first put something up there. The Major silently gave thanks for the armies research in how to return weapons to the surface from extremely high altitude. Without that, this mission wouldn\u0027t have been possible for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hour and a half passed quietly, as the team tried to relax. Cigarettes were lit and smoked, followed by more. Soon the room had a thin haze, and the smell of boiled coffee was heady in the air. Finally, the probe came around and everyone prepared for the few moments of connection that would let them confirm the landing zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Control, we have a problem.\u0022 Madeline, the flight planning officer, said into the quiet. \u0022Craft is still in orbit. Looks like the booster has failed to ignite.\u0022 Every head in the room swivelled to look at her, and Lieutenant Howarths jumped out of his seat and went over to her console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve checked everything?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s all good, everything should be working.\u0022 The man slaps his hand down on the edge of the console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Goddamn...\u0022 The room falls silent, expressions downcast at the thought of another failed mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Control? I\u0027ve got an idea.\u0022 Charlotte says quietly a minute later, sketching on her pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll take anything you\u0027ve got.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The orientation control system on the probe.

Then go see if you can help.\u0022 The senior of the two officers nods, and gets to work securing the control stations the two women had left. Sam walks over to the Major, frowning. \u0022Major, if this plan works... It\u0027s going to take a while. The control systems weren\u0027t designed with long burns in mind, not the sort that they\u0027ll be making to bring the probe back down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is that going to be a problem?\u0022 Jane says, standing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not for us. The recovery crew is going to be hanging around for a while though.\u0022 She smiles at him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll talk to the Navy. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll absolutely hate a few more hours of flying one our dollar.\u0022 He nods in agreement, returning her smile. She left and headed out of the control room and back to the administration building. She had a few calls to make which she was sure would lead to an even \u003Cem\u003Ebetter \u003C/em\u003Erelationship with the navy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral hours later, the tiny probe had separated from its booster and begun the first of its re-entry burns. Sam had been right, the nozzles on the probe would not stand up to prolonged firing, but the team had come up with a unique solution. The probe would fire it\u0027s motors for a minute, then spin 180 degrees and fire the unused nozzles for another minute. It gave the nozzles time to cool as it span again and again, repeating the manoeuvre several times. Then it span around the planet once more until it was back in position to fire its motors again. A slow process, the staff at Canaveral had no option but to wait through the incredibly lengthy set of manoeuvres as the probe pushed itself down towards the denser atmosphere. Finally it dropped low enough for the atmosphere to cause noticeable drag on its wide base, creating considerable deceleration. It finally splashed down in the ocean as the sun began to sink behind the horizon, ready to be picked up by the small fleet of Navy ships stationed around its landing zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5th July 1958\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Call for you Major.\u0022 The corporal says, leaning through the door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Put it through please.\u0022 She picks up the handset and waits for the click of a connection being made. \u0022Major Wolcott speaking.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Major, Colonel Taft here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I wondered when I\u0027d hear from you Colonel.
