True to W.I. attitude, they decided to bite off far more than they could chew. They decided, as always \u0027go big or go home\u0027. And so, after many small tweaks on their ultra secret prototype, they unveiled their hard work and labour of love and took it for a test fly out over the nearby ocean. Wildcat Industries presents the first iteration of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFat Cat 1 v1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cUYlKvv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cUYlKvv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version barely even hit 7,000m before failing (partially due to ineptitude of the pilot\u0027s training)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut none the less!

First time seemed to be a fluke, until I remembered how I\u0027d done it. I went through multiple redesigns, shed as much weight as I could think of and tried different methods of getting into orbit until I remembered how to do it. I need to take rollercoaster dips and hills, moving up and down between about 16,000m and 26,000m, slowly rising a little more each time as I shed fuel and gain speed until finally I can project myself off one of the crests and into space.
