Sure, that \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E cool and the same goes for other common achievements such as circumnavigating Kerbin or building a Kerbal ISS, but I\u0027ll tell you about something else that\u0027s cool: flying a robotic aircraft to the airbase island - with ion engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s right! Even a seemingly trivial achievement can be super-cool. All it takes is that you waste enough time reaching your destination!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, let\u0027s cut the small talk and get to business, shall we? Allow me to introduce you to the slowest aircraft ever flown, the Trollaris! Also known as \u003Cem\u003Ethe snail\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Ethe cash shredder\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003Ethe flying pitch drop\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/soiCeJr.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022soiCeJr.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETakeoff:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful, isn\u0027t she? On this picture, you can see her taking off after long wait for decent weather. That\u0027s much easier said than done, however, as the Trollaris suffers from a crippling inability to navigate any airspace windier than the average cave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QYUrtRD.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022QYUrtRD.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETransit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a successful takeoff, the Trollaris slowly climbs towards its final cruising altitude of 600 meters, where the slightly lower air resistance will allow it to travel at speeds up to 20 meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T24mFsL.jpg?2\u0022 alt=\u0022T24mFsL.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinal approach:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a long, boring journey, the Trollaris has finally reached its destination and is now descending towards the runway. However, as dull as the flight was for mission control to watch, it was by no means uneventful. In fact, the flight almost had to be ended when it was discovered that the control tower was cheaply built and had to be replaced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m5JpaXs.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022m5JpaXs.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELanding:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt last, the Trollaris has landed safe and sound on the runway of Runway Island!
