Not just any council chamber. This was the chamber of the galactic council - a tremendous space station orbiting just above Sagittarius A. The space station was comprised of four modules - a reverse time dilation device invented by the Illasticonians, a docking array several kilometers long, a simple quantum device to derive power from the black hole below, and, of course, the council chamber - a\u00A0room with four tiers of 25 seats each, for a total of 100 seats. There was also the aforementioned stage. Atop it stood a podium and microphone. This is where Jebediah Kerman, member seventy nine of the Galactic Council currently stood, nervously.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe\u00A0council itself was composed of eighty-six members, each a representative of their species. The council had been established eons ago after the great war between the Illasticonians and the Ziquunods. Neither of them won the war. They eventually decided to band together all of the intelligent life in the galaxy and attempt to maintain the peace. It worked. Most of the time.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFast forward a few hundred years. The council had eighty-six members. Meetings were held at Sagittarius A every Ziquunodian year, or somewhere around that time. Which, Jebediah concluded, must really stink for the Jslans, who lived 0.8 Ziquunodian years on average. This meeting was different, however. It had been called on short notice only a few Kerbal days before the actual annual meeting was to occur. It was nearly unheard of, which is why Jebediah was so nervous to be standing before the Galactic Council.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Members of the Galactic Council,\u0022 boomed the Quiiiiizniuvo representative, \u0022There is no point in delaying this announcement any further.

That does happen to be exactly what I was going to talk about, however. This species has been seemingly hanging on for years, turned against themselves. Their world is rampant with discrimination and injustice. The seven billion members have divided the planet up amongst themselves, into territories. Some of these territories coexist in peace. Others? Not so much. Their entire planet has been involved in at least two massive wars, and possibly more. The second ended with the use of one of our forbidden weapons - the type which unleash the power of the nucleus!\u0022 The crowd let loose another tremendous gasp. \u0022As if this wasn\u0027t enough,\u00A0after the war\u00A0these territories began assembling more of these forbidden weapons - Peaking at over fifty thousand warheads!\u0022 Another gasp. \u0022And today, some of those are mounted on tremendous missiles - and given the right circumstances, they could annihilate everyone on the planet in a matter of minutes!

I believe I have gone on enough about this specie\u0027s shortcomings. We have determined that our traditional welcoming method will not work on them. We intend to bring them to a peaceful state and include them into the Galactic Society of United Planets..

Way back when the Council was established, it was determined that every violent species that we encounter would be given a test - a Final Warning, if you will. A test to see if they could unify themselves to accomplish a common goal - and become peaceful. Fortunately, we have only encountered four species violent enough to be considered for this method. Three of them have now been integrated into the Council.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022And the fourth?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022They failed the test sent for them. It was the easiest test out of the four, and it ended with the species rebelling, declaring anarchy, and stealing the Hiuuns spaceships. They ended up destroying themselves.

When you return to Kerbin, you will find the full guidelines for this test in your personal office. The test will start in forty of your Kerbal days. If the species of that planet succeed in the test you administer, they will be integrated into the Galactic Council. If they fail, but become more peaceful as a result, we will leave them alone but monitor them. If they become more violent as a result of this test, and begin to reach for the stars with their violent ways, we will have no other choice. They must be eliminated.\u0022 Thousands of thoughts raced through Jebediah\u0027s head. Why? He didn\u0027t want to be responsible for the death of the species. But what if he made it too easy? What if he made it too hard? There were so many ways this could all go wrong. He secretly hoped to himself that this was all one nightmare.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u0022Jebediah, you are dismissed.

They called themselves humans, and they lived on a planet they called Earth far out from the Galactic Observatory. They had two arms and two legs, were about twice the height of Kerbals, and had the same overall build as Kerbals, but they had much smaller heads and\u00A0existed in a variety of colors, ranging from dark brown to\u00A0pale white.\u00A0Their system was home to either seven or eight other planets - the humans were even divided about that.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBut the thing was - they had an extraordinary amount of creativity. They had created massive buildings and monuments even in their state of near destruction. They had gotten surprisingly far on the Galactic Index of Technology in the last two hundred years of their history - twice the previous record. The only problem was that it was not applied properly - instead of focusing on ensuring a future by building renewable energy plants (or quantum plants, but that was beyond their technology)\u00A0they spent billions of their monetary units - called dollars, euros, pounds, yen, or whatever. each territory\u00A0(called countries by the humans) had a different system for everything. The closest thing the countries had to a unified system was their measurement system, and yet one of the most powerful countries on the planet had completely rejected this idea. That same country spent over forty times as much on bullets and bombs than they did on space exploration. And the initial strive for space exploration had been because of political tensions - and earlier, the need to bomb targets from far away.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EThe galactic council seemed convinced that they were savages without hope.

The holograms were of a strange alien person called \u0022Jebediah Kerman\u0022 (who is now sitting a few feet away from me). He began a speech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022People of Earth, my name is Jebediah Kerman. I am what you call an alien, and this is your Final Warning.\u00A0I come from planet Kerbin, a small, super-dense planet on the other side of your galaxy. You are, in fact, currently standing upon Planet Kerbin.\u0022 There was a pause as a ton of people looked down at their feet. \u0022You are probably wondering what just happened. I, unfortunately, do not have the clearance to tell you exactly what has happened. I can tell you this: You are on planet Kerbin. All seven and a half billion of you. And the only way you can get home is to complete the test we have set before you. I ask that you will be kind to the planet you are on. You will be treated well by the inhabitants, the Kerbals, provided you treat them well. You will stay in the cities we have built for you. You should note that while you stay here, you will not age. When you complete the test, you will be sent back to your home planet. I am not allowed to disclose what will happen if you fail. Get settled in. I will present the details of the test to you in an hour.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that, the holograms vanished. That hour was a bit of a blur for me, but I can tell you that there was a whole lot of fighting. Eventually, most of the people realized that they should stop. A few of them tried to convince the fighters that we were reflecting badly upon the human race. However, it was a bit hard to communicate, as all of the people from all of the different countries appeared to have been mixed up. For example, a Chinese person (I think he was Chinese, at least) spent a good deal of that hour trying to argue with me. It didn\u0027t work. Wait, how did we all understand the hologram? Was it some sort of universal translator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 45 minutes in, I decided to actually pay attention to my surroundings. We were standing inside a giant circular enclosure ringed by a cylinder of skyscrapers.\u00A0I\u0027d imagine that there had to have been dozens more of these cities - they were huge, yet they were nowhere big enough to hold seven billion people. It was about then that I realized I was alone. I hadn\u0027t seen a single person I knew. None of the people in the theater. No parents. No teachers. No sister. No - no Andrea, or Winter. Not even John.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, I ended up in an apartment in one of the skyscrapers. I don\u0027t know how I got there, but shortly after that, the holograms turned back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah Kerman here, I am back. As I was saying, here is your test: You will send ten thousand of your best engineers and scientists to the stations at the edge of your city. There must be at least one from each of your old countries you had back on Earth. These people must be of all ages.\u00A0The rest of you will live in these cities - you will be free to move between them. These ten thousand people will be in charge of building a spaceship that will travel to the distant planet Jool. The spaceship will visit all five moons, and return the eight crew members alive and well. You will have thirteen rocket launches. The rockets\u00A0have already been manufactured\u00A0- they are replicas of the active lifters you had on your planet, scaled down to have similar payload to orbit capacity on Kerbin as the real ones did on Earth. You may not conduct additional launches, and you must use all thirteen launches. All thirteen launches must contribute a piece to the spaceship you will build, and the spaceship may not break apart until it reaches Jool. The payload has not been designed yet, that is your job. There are more specific guidelines, of which I will go over when I talk to these the ten thousand people. For every guideline you break, you will be docked points. If you fall below a certain point value, you fail. I realize I am being very vague. Any specifics you desire will be provided on your communications device, which your species refers to as a \u0022computer.\u0022 These computers are located in your living units, which are located in the skyscrapers ringing your city. If I were you, I\u0027d try to get to the top of the skyscrapers before anyone else does - the tops of the skyscrapers have very good views, I\u0027m told. You may communicate between cities using your computer, and move between cities should you desire to. You are not our prisoners. You are our guests. You will send your engineers and scientists to the gates of your city within an hour. Kerbin wishes you all luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the hologram switched off, and there was once again stunned silence, followed by a roar of voices, some angry. Very angry.\u00A0And me? The first thing I did was run to the elevators and snag the top apartment. It was a nice view - and, what? You could see the curvature of the planet from the building. I got on the futuristic looking computer in the corner of the room and looked up a few things, such as \u0022radius of Kerbin\u0022 and \u0022height of skyscrapers. Wow, Kerbin was tiny. Then, I tried out the communication features - and attempted to send messages to the people who I knew. Then I got a bit nauseous as the gravity of the situation hit me full on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EEvery single person on Earth had been teleported to an alien planet, whose inhabitants have challenged our species to a space mission.\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got more and more nauseous at the thought, and I eventually threw up. Good thing these \u0022Kerbals\u0022 had provided a bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. Whoever these Kerbals were, they had certainly gone through quite an effort to make the humans comfortable. These cities must have taken a ton of effort to build. The question was, why? Were they going to eat us? Were they trying to confine us to one planet? Wait, that didn\u0027t make sense. We were tasked with conducting a manned mission to Jool - whatever the heck Jool was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quickly searched Jool. It was a large, green gas giant and the fifth planet in the Kerbol system. I searched \u0022Kerbol system.\u0022 The Kerbol system had five planets and two dwarf planets. There was Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, and Jool, with Dres and Eeloo thrown in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI searched \u0022Moons in the Kerbol system.\u0022 Gilly, moon of Eve. Ike, moon of Duna. The Mun and Minmus, moons of Kerbin. I quickly poked my head out of the window, and sure enough, there was the Mun. It looked a little bit like the Moon, but way bigger. Then I hit moons of Jool, the ones we supposedly had to conduct a mission to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was Laythe, a moon with an oxygen atmosphere and oceans made of... ammonia and water? There was Tylo, a Kerbin sized body that also looked like the Moon. There was Bop and Pol, tiny asteroids, and there was Vall, an ice world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, the power went out and my computer shut off. I looked out the window and there appeared to be a riot going on across the city, near what appeared to be a power conversion station. Suddenly, a bunch of flying things appeared, and used - force fields of some sort to repel the people. Almost as quickly as it had gone out, the power turned back on. Wait, where was this power even coming from? I took another look out the window. Upon closer inspection, the exteriors of the skyscrapers\u00A0appeared to be\u00A0completely covered with solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what I was thinking, but for some reason I decided to go and check the situation with the engineers and scientists. Ten minutes later, I was at the so-called \u0022station\u0022 at the edge of the city. It existed in a huge arch in the city wall. There was a single - Kerbal? Standing on a floating stage addressing the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Attention everyone, we have now met our quota for engineers and scientists in the age range of 60-80. We have one hundred openings for people under 20, as well as two hundred openings for those over eighty. Those numbers are now 92 and 187. 84 and 162. Space is limited.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was what the Kerbal said. Then, someone approached me and said, \u0022Hey! Are you an engineer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I sort of play orbiter, and I like legos, so I replied \u0022Sort of.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then he said \u0022Well, right this way!\u0022 and then I was ushered into the station. Up until this point I had put no thought into what kind of station this was. I had subconsciously imagined it as a train station. But, oh, was I so wrong. As I entered the station, I was greeted by three rather large winged vehicles. A Kerbal took my name and age, then ushered me onto one of them. I was in shock the whole time - I couldn\u0027t believe - were these vehicles really -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then my train of thought was interrupted by the pilot saying \u0022Hello, Scott Kerman here, and this will be the first flight of the \u0022Hype Plane\u0022 serial number 37. Please \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo not\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E fasten your seatbelts, seatbelts take away from the experience. We will arrive at Kerbal Space Center in approximately thirty minutes after a brief suborbital hop. Standby for chamber ignition in three, two...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat the...? Suborbital hop? Chamber ignition? Countdown? Was I actually on a -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, there was a roar as the rocket engine - An actual\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EROCKET ENGINE\u003C/strong\u003E - ignited and catapulted the spaceplane out of the city limits, and\u00A0into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLittle did I know, my adventure was only getting started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PK4ETgI.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PK4ETgI.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-18T06:55:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2023 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Ultimate Steve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T03:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOoo!

We don\u0027t have nearly enough Delta-V to get home!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Both of you, we are doing perfectly fine on fuel! And it was Ethan\u0027s fault, not mine!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t consider having 1.5 kilometers per second remaining as \u0022fine\u0022.

We can reconfigure the ship once we get to Jool and ditch the empty fuel tanks!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It won\u0027t be enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can get a Tylo assist into Jool orbit easily enough, so capture is free. From there we need to enter a stable orbit and carry out our mission using the ion tug. Then, we\u0027ll still have 1km/s of delta v to get home with, which should be plenty given that we\u0027ll ditch the command section - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ditch the command section?

There are eight seats in the return module, and we can stand the cramped seats for six months - sorry, two Kerbin years -\u00A0because all of Earth\u00A0depends on it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what about Jack?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We covered this already!

We won\u0027t have any contingency for a low fuel situation, which is what we built Emerson for!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey guys. Ethan here again, back to reality. As you can probably tell, we\u0027re running a bit low on fuel, but once we get to Jool, we should be fine. Should. You\u0027re probably wondering what the heck \u0022Emerson\u0022 is. It\u0027s a long story, but I\u0027ll get to it eventually. I promise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere were we? Oh, yeah, we were on that spaceplane. Right before I met Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tlwqmFX.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tlwqmFX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was screaming my head off for two reasons. One, it was generally a terrifying experience being in an untested spaceplane built by an alien race (the pilot did say \u0022first flight\u0022), and two, I was screaming with some amount of Joy. I was actually going to go into space! And I had a window seat! So I looked out the window and saw that Kerbin was definitely curving away. I tried to do some quick math in my head. If Kerbin was ten times smaller than Earth, then it should reasonably have an atmosphere to ten kilometers. Wait, but the gravity is roughly the same on Kerbin... What was Kerbin made of? Whatever it was, it must be denser than osmium! So, where did that put the edge of space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, can you move your head?\u0022 asked someone from my right. \u0022It\u0027s not every day you get to go into space, and I\u0027d really like to see out of the window!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI spun around in my seat to find a girl about my age, maybe a year or two older sitting in the seat next to me. \u0022Oh, sorry,\u0022 I said, \u0022I\u0027ve been really distracted these past two hours. I mean, who hasn\u0027t?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I think a bit of window hogging is forgivable. Let\u0027s see, in the past two hours we\u0027ve been abducted from our home planet, transported to an alien planet, and challenged to a space mission to compete for the survival of our species.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, go over that last part again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t know for sure, but that\u0027s what I think it is. It makes perfect sense, doesn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You really think it\u0027s that sinister? I mean, they\u0027re being awfully nice to us. For example, I\u0027m about to enter space!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is your captain speaking. We have engine cutoff, and we have entered space!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221dFWrlS.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1dFWrlS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If this were a real plane, I would encourage you to fasten your seatbelts as we are currently spinning and in a zero gravity environment. However, as this is a spaceplane and you have never been to space before,\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, my name is Peggy Whitson, and I have been to space before!\u0022 shouted Peggy Whitson from a few rows back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Correction, most of you have not been to space before. Please do not fasten your seatbelts and enjoy your four minutes of zero gravity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that it was silent for a few seconds, and those who were not already by a window floated over to the windows. And half of the people in the plane vomited. Luckily, the Kerbals had stocked the plane with barf bags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe seats were a bit cramped, as they appeared to have been made for Kerbals. The girl beside me got up out of her seat with a \u0022WOOOOOHOOOO!!!!\u0022 and tried to do a zero gee backflip in the aisle. However, the ship was slowly spinning and she hit a wall and began to fall down the corridor due to the centrifugal force. And then she grabbed one of the overhead bins and pulled her way back to her seat, where the centrifugal force only pulled outward instead of down the corridor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, can I have the window now, uh, what\u0027s your name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure thing. It\u0027s Ethan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina.\u0022 With that, I switched places with Evelina and then she looked out the window the same way I had - with a sense of wonder and amazement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, Evelina, where are you from?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sweden. I mean, Kerbin now, I guess. We all are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you speak excellent English.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks! You also speak excellent English, but that\u0027s understandable. You are an American, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I come from Illinois.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s a state, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep. Does Sweden have anything like states?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have - well, had - 25 provinces and 21 counties. I think.\u00A0Sometimes people also make a reference to the four historical Lands of Sweden.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks for the information, I don\u0027t really know anything about Sweden besides the fact that Wintergatan is based there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know Wintergatan? Oh my goodness, I love Wintergatan! I went to one of their live concerts once! It was amazing! Favorite song from them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Easily Starmachine 2000!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Me too! But the original where they used the modulin. I prefer it to the live version using the melodica after the key change. But, really, any live Wintergatan performance is awesome! And what a coincidence! One of the band members has the same name as I do!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was about to reply with something like \u0022If I could have any instrument in the world, it would either be the marble machine or a modulin,\u0022 but then the captain said:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Attention passengers, we have entered the atmosphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QsLs5du.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QsLs5du.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You may experience gee forces up to ten times normal gravity. You may feel heat emanating from the forward section of the craft. I assure you that this is normal and you need not fasten your seatbelts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to be completely honest, I almost fastened my seatbelt right there. Unfortunately, I got distracted\u00A0a few seconds later when\u00A0the airframe began vibrating and I thought I could see the melting wing out of the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225OoaOtF.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5OoaOtF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScratch that, I\u0027m pretty sure everything was melting at that point. Everyone began getting nervous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Scott Kerman, your pilot here, and we are experiencing heightened G forces. The maximum you may expect is now fifteen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, Evelina, do you know how these \u0022Kerbals\u0022 measure gravity?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Their gravitational units happen to be nearly the same as ours!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, then, I suggest that we - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Brace ourselves?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, that would probably be a good idea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the whole plane sort of tilted sideways in a matter of milliseconds and I felt around fifteen gees. I think half of the people on the plane passed out. That lasted for about ten seconds. Evelina was one of the ones that actually did pass out, and her head ended up\u00A0crashing into\u00A0the seat in front of her. I really wanted to help her somehow, but I literally couldn\u0027t have moved if my life had depended on it. I feel really sorry for that poor guy who ended up in the aisle during all of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is your captain speaking, we have had a bit of a structural failure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oMNAfR4.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMNAfR4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane was now upside-down and I was on the roof, as was everyone. I shifted my eyes briefly towards the window and saw that one pair of wings had completely sheared off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is your captain speaking. Thank you all for tolerating that minor turbulence. Due to an unfortunate turn of events, we have lost our neutral dihedral and it is now negative and we cannot roll back to vertical. We are going to landing mode eight and will attempt an upside-down water landing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWHAT?!??!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please fasten your emergency seatbelts located on the ceiling.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the time I was thinking \u0022We\u0027re all going to die! What idiot thought it would be a good idea to transport us on an untested spaceplane? What is the logic in that?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Evelina came to and\u00A0moaned \u0022Ow, my head,\u0022 shortly followed by \u0022It\u0027s all a dream. It\u0027s all a dream. It\u0027s all a dream,\u0022 before opening her eyes and looking at me and saying \u0022Dang it. What did I miss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I said \u0022Fasten your seatbelt if you don\u0027t want to die!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then she looked out the window and screamed. I think. I\u0027m not sure it was her, it might have been me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XzeUGBQ.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XzeUGBQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J9cSv9h.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J9cSv9h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the 128 humans on board were either screaming bloody murder or unconscious at this point. Thankfully, the plane wrecked plane was still watertight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter things calmed down a little bit, the captain announced \u0022I believe there is a saying on your planet, it goes something like \u0022Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing.\u0022 Unfortunately, as far as I know, none of you can walk on water...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the heck just happened?\u0022 asked a seriously freaked out Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We just rode an alien suborbital spaceplane into space, which then crash landed in an alien ocean.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pinch me, I\u0027m dreaming.\u0022 I pinched her. \u0022Ow! Nobody is ever serious when they\u00A0say that!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, now you know you\u0027re not dreaming, Evelina.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, Ethan, I\u0027m pretty sure this will go down in history as the weirdest day of my life.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Really? Just \u0022pretty sure?\u0022 I think that\u0027s pretty much a given for all seven billion of us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we both started giggling. It grew into uncontrollable laughter. From the back of the plane someone yelled \u0022Hey, pilot! Why haven\u0027t they fired you yet? Nothing should crash this badly this often!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScott Kerman\u0027s response was \u0022Here on Kerbin, crashes aren\u0027t disasters. They are Tuesdays.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=======================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, the boat showed up and we were all brought onto land near the space center. It was the first time I had been to any sort of actual space center - and the design of it made almost no sense whatsoever. I mean, there was only one launch pad. If it got destroyed, then nothing could launch for a few months as it was repaired. And if the pilot was right, and crashes were \u0022Tuesdays,\u0022 it must happen often. There was a giant vehicle assembly building - only a few hundred meters away from the pad. It could also be easily destroyed. And all of the other important buildings were within two kilometers of the pad! It literally made no sense! The runway was literally used to store planes, as well. Fifty of the so called \u0022Hype Planes\u0022 were sitting on the runway, crowded in there. As I watched, another one landed on the runway and stopped a few meters short of the plane in front of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe were being herded towards the flagpole area, which was in front of some sort of arc shaped building. There was\u00A0a flag on the flagpole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022120px-Kerbinmunflag.png\u0022 height=\u002275\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/7/77/Kerbinmunflag.png/120px-Kerbinmunflag.png\u0022 width=\u0022120\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce all ten thousand of us were in front of the building with the flagpole, a stage rose out of the ground with four Kerbals on it. Three of them looked alike and one of them looked different - At the time I guessed that she was a member of the other gender of Kerbals. I was right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Attention all engineers, this is Jebediah Kerman\u00A0speaking. These are my good friends Bill, Bob, and Valentina Kerman. I realize you are all very angry and confused. I know you want answers. Some of the answers can be found on the provided computer devices after I am done with this speech. Please use good conduct. You may regret it if you don\u0027t.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a murmur from the crowd. Some of them appeared to be considering the option of fighting. It was ten thousand versus four.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Welcome to the Kerbal Space center, where you will work on the test we have set before you. First off, you will be divided into thirteen teams, and each team will be in charge of designing one section of the Jool mothership. This mothership will be constructed in a low Kerbin orbit below 120 kilometers and must stay in one piece between when the engines are lit for the escape burn and the arrival in Jool Orbit. Also, don\u0027t consider trying to fight your way out of here. We have taken certain precautions. For example, we are not really here, we are merely holograms. Each of the thirteen teams will be assigned one of the carrier rockets we have built. Each team will have thirty days to build a piece of - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone went into outrage at that. Thirty days? Nobody had ever built a spacecraft in such a short time. This was looking more and more hopeless by the second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Silence! As I was saying, each team will have thirty KERBIN days, which are only six of your hours long to build their part of the spaceship. Each section will be made up of parts we have prefabricated - engines, structural beams, etcetera. It is up to you to assemble them in any way you see fit. A few more important things, you may not modify the lifters unless you clear it with us, each module will be subject to inspection by us, and each module will launch over a two day period, one module every thirty minutes as your mothership orbits the planet. The mothership will contain eight beings - four humans, and four Kerbals. The four Kerbals will be Bill, Bob, Valentina, and myself. Bill, Bob, and I will launch into space on the first module. The rockets we built for you have been given numbers, and you may only launch one of them out of order. In order to successfully complete the mission, a human must have walked on each of the five moons of Jool. Samples of the surface are preferred. It does not have to be the same person for each landing. The four space travelers from the human race will be selected by us at a later date. It is also important to note that none of the objects launched on this mission should interfere with Kerbin\u0027s own space missions. After the thirty days you may stay at the space center at mission control, or you may travel between any of the hundreds of cities we have built for you. In case you were curious, most Kerbals live underground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe murmuring continued during the pause in Jebediah\u0027s speech. Some thought the prefabricated parts would make everything easier. Some still thought that the task was impossible. I personally thought it could be done - wasn\u0027t this close enough to what we did with the international space station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022One final thing - there will be no communication allowed between the thirteen teams beyond a five minute meeting of 130 select members - ten from each team. \u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You all heard me. You all will find a custom built cellular communications device in your pockets. It will tell you what team you are on, and if you have been selected for the 130 member meeting. The meeting will start in about thirty seconds. That is all. Jeb out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that, the hologram disappeared, leaving everyone slightly more confused and hopeless than they had started out as.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan?\u0022 asked Evelina, who I had honestly forgotten was beside me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What team are you on? I appear to be on team one, with the Ariane 5 rocket, whatever the heck that is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. One second.\u0022 I pulled out my \u0022cellular communication device\u0022 (alien smartphone) and the first thing it decided to tell me was that I was indeed on team one, Ariane 5, and that I had been selected for the all-too-important planning meeting. I briefly wondered why and then opened my mouth to tell Evelina that I would be on the same team as her. I would have told her how glad I was to be working with her, and that I had to go to the meeting that was starting in a few seconds. But then I was teleported into the meeting room. It had a long table with presumably 130 seats. There was a large countdown timer hanging from the wall. I, and the other 129 members of the meeting, were sitting in surprisingly comfortable chairs. Almost instantly everyone stood up and began arguing, not at all about the design of the spaceship. About thirty seconds in, the first punch was thrown. And it became somewhat of a free for all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe next three minutes made me ashamed of my species\u003C/strong\u003E. Absolutely no productive work got done. Unless somebody did something, we would almost certainly fail. And then, I thought \u0022Hey! I\u0027m somebody!\u0022 and made my way to the head of the table, dodging punches all the while. During some of that I found a piece of paper that had (presumably) been teleported into my pocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E1. Ariane 5 - 17t\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Atlas V 441 - 12t\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Delta IV Heavy - 30t\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Falcon 9 - 10t\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. HII-A - 13t\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Long March 2F - 6t\u003Cbr\u003E\n7.

Shavit - 1t\u003Cbr\u003E\n13. Pegasus - 0.25t\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I didn\u0027t memorize it all right then and there. That would have been a waste of time. I could tell a few things from the short glance I got. It was a list of the thirteen lifters, along with presumably payload to low Kerbin orbit. And although the payloads were close to the Earth values for the lifters, they weren\u0027t the same. I made my way towards the microphone at the front of the room, which nobody had seemed to notice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022EVERYBODY SHUT UP!\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat certainly got a few people\u0027s attention, but the vast majority of them thought winning their fight was more important than the future of humanity. So, how did I get their attention?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=images\u0026amp;cd=\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU4rLgjM3TAhUi5IMKHZPyDpMQjRwIBw\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.shure.com%2Fhow-to-control-feedback-in-a-sound-system%2F\u0026amp;psig=AFQjCNEiJnVt3zqQs19o1-sT50279vvuAw\u0026amp;ust=1493673251913658\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image result for microphone feedback\u0022 height=\u0022300\u0022 src=\u0022http://blog.shure.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/feedback-loop1.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022margin-top:57px;\u0022 width=\u0022550\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah. Ow.\u00A0I think everyone in there lost a year of hearing. But it needed to be done. Then I started\u00A0screaming like a drill sergeant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now that\u00A0I have your attention, we have less than two minutes to plan this mission! So, common sense. The heavy lifters will lift the propulsion modules. The lighter ones will deal with landers.\u00A0I don\u0027t know what size docking ports we\u0027ll be able to use, 0ut the core, which\u00A0will be the fuel, engines, and crew quarters will\u00A0use a medium to large prefabricated port size. Use your best judgement when\u00A0choosing, I don\u0027t\u00A0know what parts we\u0027ll get. On top will be a docking port the next size down for mounting antennas and stuff. There will be radially mounted ports of that same size around the ship! Everyone got it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What gives you, an idiotic underage American, the authority to tell us how to conduct a space mission?\u0022 shouted a large Chinese man. Wait, how did translation work in here? I could hear everyone in English. Oh, well. Not the time. We had about a minute left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t see you helping. So, everyone listen up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Objection!\u0022 said another person. I ignored her for the sake of humanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quickly glanced at the list in my hand and made some hasty assumptions based on launch order and payload to orbit. I screamed \u0022Assignments: Ariane 5 will launch the living and command section. Atlas will launch a large fuel tank and a robotic arm to dock things. Speaking of fuel, if it is available, we will use a hydrogen fueled nuclear thermal rocket for propulsion. If there is something more high tech that is not as low thrust\u00A0as\u00A0an ion engine, we will use it. If none of those exist, we will go with cryogenic hydrolox!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nucelar thermal rockets? I want to know what he\u0027s drinking!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Delta Four! More fuel and a small lander for Bop and Pol! Falcon Nine! Tylo lander! H-II-A! A Laythe lander of sorts, and if you have space, a crew return vehicle!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Again, we are not going to let our plan be decided by a ten year old babbling idiot!\u0022 I ignored him again. Ten years old? I was easily five foot ten and a high school freshman!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Long March team, you\u0027ve got the Vall lander.\u0022 We had about fifteen seconds left, so I tired to speed up. \u0022PSLV, communications! Soyuz, the crew!\u0022 At this point, someone tried to wrestle the microphone out of my hand. It was about five seconds\u00A0before I managed to get it back with just enough time to say \u0022Protonlaunchtheengineseveryoneelsemakesomethingupgoodluckthefutueofhumanitydependson-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we were each teleported to our respective teams, with no communication allowed between the teams for the next thirty days. The ten people, including me, who played witness to the meeting were now on a stage at the front of a giant underground hangar, hangar number one, according to the giant sign hanging from the ceiling. Throughout the room there was a multitude of pallets - full of the aforementioned prefabricated parts. 297 pallets, to be exact. Some of them contained dozens of a part, like the solar panel pallet, and some of them contained a single part - like the one with the giant fuel tank on it. They each had plaques in front of them with a part name, number, manufacturer and description inscribed into them. Along the side of the massive room were around eight hundred... apartments? There were about\u00A0four hundred per side. There were also forklifts, meeting rooms, tool tables, and at the very back of the room, there was the replica\u00A0Ariane 5, standing on the ground, and a movable scaffold a few meters away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BNTg8vN.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BNTg8vN.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI observed all of that in about five seconds, still frozen about to say \u0022-you.\u0022 Everyone was eagerly staring at the stage.

When I opened my eyes a few seconds later, I saw Evelina standing over me\u00A0hefting a large white cylinder that said \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022BIG ROCKET THING - DO NOT DROP\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E in big red letters on the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Sepratron.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Part image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Part image\u0022 height=\u0022187\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/b/bb/Sepratron.png/190px-Sepratron.png\u0022 width=\u0022190\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u0022Hey. You okay?\u0022 she asked.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Owwww,\u0022 I said with a groan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You owe me one. Psst. Everyone\u0027s looking at you. You might want to tell us all what we\u0027re going to do. Nobody here has a plan. At all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody anywhere has a plan, except for the one I came up with in five seconds, and I\u0027m pretty sure nobody will follow it. Also, I think we\u0027re even now. I did give you the window seat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Save my life, then we\u0027ll talk. Better to have a bad plan than no plan. So, your inspirational speech?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh... Yeah. What the heck are you holding?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Long story. Plan first, story later. Got it?\u0022 She gently set the \u0022big rocket thing\u0022 down and offered me her hand to help me up. I accepted it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got it.\u0022 I stumbled over to the microphone. My legs and arms and, well, my everything hurt all over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was almost to the\u00A0microphone, the Chinese dude reached over, grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and said \u0022This isn\u0027t over, Kid!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few seconds later, the microphone was in my hand and 800 pairs of eyes were on me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, hi. As you probably heard, my name is Ethan.\u0022 I probably sounded like an idiot. \u0022Uh, I realize I probably sound like an idiot right now,\u0022 Oops. Did I say that out loud? \u0022But, uh...\u0022 Crud. I had no comeback for this at all. \u0022So. During the meeting, the other engineers and I created a vague plan for how this spaceship will be built.\u0022 There was a few coughs and facepalms from the other nine engineers who had just beat me up. \u0022This mothership will involve a core module with radially mounted docking ports for the return craft and moon landers. The fuel source is currently in dispute, but I gave the teams specific directions as to what fuel we should choose once we know about the parts.\u0022 More facepalms. I needed to turn this around fast, and get the focus away from the lack of a plan. \u0022Our job is to make the living quarters and command section. I will send a detailed description of the plan to your alien smartphones (I mean, I hoped I could do that. I really didn\u0027t know) sometime in the next day. For now, however, I believe we should all familiarize ourselves with the task at hand, and with the parts we have been given. Everyone, when you have a spare minute, search \u0022Jool System\u0022 and \u0022Kerbol system Delta V map.\u0022\u0022 Hey, I was doing a bit better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, what should we be doing now?\u0022 asked a voice from the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, uh... We should familiarize ourselves with the parts we have.\u0022 I could see fourteen different colored zones on the floor, with pallets in each. From the ceiling hung fourteen color coded signs. They read \u0022Pods, fuel tanks, engines, command and control, structural, coupling, payload, aerodynamic, ground, thermal, electrical, communication, science, and utility.\u0022 \u0022You see these nine people standing behind me? These nine, as well as Evelina here, will be my second in commands. You!\u0022 I pointed to the closest of the nine. \u0022You are in charge of the pods section. You! Fuel tanks. You, engines. You, uhh...\u0022 The command and control section looked tiny. I would have to rope it in with something else. \u0022Structural. Hey, you, the guy I assigned to pods! You\u0027re also command and control! You, coupling and payload!\u0022 I went on for about two minutes before I had listed all the categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Everyone not onstage, get into groups of two or three and find a pallet of parts. Your job is to find out exactly what that part does. You will report the description and function of the part to the supervisor of your group. You have thirty minutes. Dismissed!\u0022 Phew. I was sweating enough to fill a whole Olympic sized swimming pool. But my job was not over yet. I still had to address the nine people standing behind me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m going to be completely honest with you guys, I only have a general idea of what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027d also like to say that - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Haha! You admit it! Your idiotic plan\u00A0wasn\u0027t even worth bringing up!\u0022 It was that Chinese guy again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, first off, my plan was pretty dumb, but considering I thought it up in about thirty seconds, I think I did fairly well. Second of all, someone needed to make a plan, and everyone else was busy trying to kill each other. And right now, do any of you have a better idea?\u0022 It got quiet for a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I support you, Ethan, but not because you have a good plan. I support you because you were the only person with enough sense to make one.\u0022 It was an old man who had an Australian accent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you. What\u0027s your name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oliver.\u00A0G\u0027day, Ethan. Sorry for the whole fight thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay. Everyone, find something to write on and start taking part functions. I want a full list within the hour. Dismissed.\u0022 Miraculously, everyone listened and went to their sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that certainly went well,\u0022 said Evelina from behind me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No kidding. I have no idea what I\u0027m doing at all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I\u0027m serious. At the very least, you\u0027re very good at pretending you had a plan, at least to the actual audience. I was sold until you talked to those guys. And, with any luck, you will be able to fool those 800 engineers long enough to come up with an actual plan. No pressure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, it\u0027s not like the future of humanity depends on me having a plan, or anything.\u0022 Ooh, I got a giggle out of her!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, I guess we should find a part or something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good idea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=============================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... think this is a jet engine, but I\u0027m not sure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, look on this side. The plaque literally says \u0022J-33 \u0022Wheesley\u0022 Turbofan Engine.\u0022 Manufactured by the C7 aerospace division. Stationary thrust, 120 kilonewtons. Hey, they converted their values into metric for us! How thoughtful!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. What does this do?\u0022 I pressed the button marked \u0022reverse thrust.\u0022 A giant cone moved backwards and the contraption made a strange sound. \u0022Uhh... I think I might have broken it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, look at this cool thing!\u0022 Evelina was now on the other side of the aisle in the \u0022ground\u0022 section. \u0022Rove-max model XL3. Hmm. Wait, it says something on the back of this... \u0022\u003Ci\u003EThe RoveMax Model 3 was developed in total secrecy by Kerbal Motion\u0027s R\u0026amp;D team over the course of a year and a half. When it was finally revealed to the company\u0027s chairman, he stared in shock, screamed \u0027WHY\u0027, and subsequently dropped dead on the spot.\u003C/i\u003E\u0022 Uhh... Okay, then. Ooh, what\u0027s that!\u0022 Evelina then ran over to the next section, utility, and proceeded to observe the plaque in front of another pallet. \u0022Mark sixteen parachute. Manufacturer: Found lying by the side of the road? What? That sounds, uh...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe kept running around, with that grin on her face. Like a kid in a candy shop, or like a space nerd at the Kennedy Space Center, or, well, like an engineer in a rocket parts warehouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, something exploded over in the coupling section. It was really loud and echoed for quite a long time. Whatever it was shot up towards the rock ceiling, hit it, and knocked out a few of the lights. But then it fell downwards. It was heading straight towards Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022EVELINA!\u0022 I ran towards her. She was engrossed in reading another plaque, and had jumped at the explosion but had not looked up. Just as the thing was about to hit her, I slammed into her and knocked her out of the way. The thing - whatever it was - slammed down in front of us with a very, very loud noise. All was silent for a few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me, but did I just almost die?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep. Now, we\u0027re even.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, so that\u0027s what\u00A0a \u0022hydraulic detachment manifold\u0022 does!\u0022 shouted a voice from across the hangar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI shakily stood up and offered my hand to Evelina, who took it and started giggling again. Soon, we were both laughing our heads off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n======================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, 45 minutes later we were done collecting all of the part information. Some of the nine, uh, I\u0027ll call them \u0022commanders\u0022 from now on, decided to write down some of the funnier quotes they heard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But that\u0027s impossible! A 2kn ion drive?!?!? What sorcery is this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What drugs are these reaction wheels on? These are impossibly powerful!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is this, an engine for ants?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This yellow sewer pipe is pure magic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why is this command pod so darn heavy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022An actual NERVA? I am in HEAVEN!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dude, don\u0027t touch that! It\u0027s radioactive!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bro, you\u0027ve got that song stuck in my head now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have no idea what we\u0027re ever going to use this micronode for.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What the heck would you need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters this powerful for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These aliens have force fields, but can\u0027t figure out how to make a battery that will last for more than half an hour. Logic!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mystery goo? Can I drink it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, that happened. We now had a full parts list and 29 days, 5 hours remaining. Which would be 7 days, 11 hours remaining in Earth time. I needed to come up with an actual module plan. So, I told my commanders to ask the people to prototype designs for the proposed habitation module. At least, that\u0027s what I thought I\u0027d asked them to do. Somehow, we ended up with a reaction wheel powered merry go round (I\u0027ll get to that later).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI locked myself in one of the apartments for a few minutes to get some things straight. I took a look at the parts list, and sent it to the other 800 members of my team using the alien smartphone. Thankfully, there was a \u0022Send to all team members\u0022 button. From there, I took out a notepad and paper and wrote a few key points down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I had divided up the lifters and payloads in a mostly logical way. My plan wasn\u0027t as stupid as I thought it had been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. There were\u00A0indeed Nuclear Thermal Rockets, with hydrogen for fuel. This, if people had listened, would be the source of propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. There were only three sizes of docking ports. Thank the lord. If the other teams had any common sense whatsoever, they would realize that the core would be made from the large size, and the landers should use the normal size. But someone should probably launch some normal to tiny adapters just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Speaking of sizes, there were a few main sizes. There were the tiny parts, which happened to be very close to 5/8 of a meter. The next size up appeared to be close to 1.25 meters, then 2.5 meters, then 3.75 meters. There were a few other odd shapes thrown in there, which appeared to be designed for spaceplanes. Man, I wish one of our lifters could have been a spaceplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Speaking of lifters, all of the lifters were ones that were in active service, one from each family.\u00A0If only the Kerbals had found us two years later. Then we would have Falcon Heavy, and if we were lucky New Glenn. Electron would have been cool to have, but about as useful as Pegasus, which had a useful payload on Kerbin of less than half a ton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. I had told one group to make a robotic arm. There was absolutely nothing to make a robotic arm out of. I hoped the other teams would realize that and equip their modules with docking capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Every part had a terrible mass fraction, but had electromagnetic fields for radiation protection and nanocamera suspension (neat!), extreme structural integrity, and\u00A0the ability to transfer fuel through itself, which was the neatest thing ever, and made in-orbit refueling simple enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Speaking of fuels, the only available fuels were liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, a variant of Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant (referred to as solid fuel), hydrazine, and xenon, along with niche ones like \u0022ore\u0022 and \u0022ablator.\u0022 I guess that made the fuel choice easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. The crew modules used a mostly regenerative life support system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. The parts can attach in a stack by using specially made bolts. Radial attachment is done using welding, or in some cases drilling a hole in the skin of the pa-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to stop writing at that point, because I heard another explosion. I scrambled to the door and tried to unlock it (missing the handle three times) before getting it right and stepping outside. Then I realized that the explosion was actually a rocket engine firing. I looked to where the plume of smoke was coming from, and saw that a few of the other teenagers were using one of the smaller rockets to roast marshmallows over (where did they get marshmallows? I wanted some!) before looking to my right and seeing the reaction wheel powered merry go round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was very crude and rickety, being a few plates bolted together around what looked like a cluster of reaction wheels. It was hooked up to a giant battery, and appeared to have a few of those wheels that made that guy scream \u0022why\u0022 and die hastily bolted to the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!?\u0022 I shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022FASTER! FASTER!\u0022 shouted Evelina, who was currently in the rider\u0027s seat. The operator that sat in the center, who was in some sort of external command seat, appeared to be getting very dizzy. He obliged and pushed his control stick further to the left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022TEN GEES! ELEVEN! TWELVE!\u0022 And then, the thing started vibrating and tipped over and exploded. There was a chorus of gasps which continued for a few seconds until Evelina shouted \u0022I\u0027M OKAY! CAN I DO THAT AGAIN?!?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I would have loved a ride, but we had a planet to save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=========================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn hour later, I was back on the stage again. Thankfully, nobody had tried to roast marshmallows or make a reaction wheel powered merry-go-round. People had, however, tried to build an ion drive grill, an iron man suit, and a rocket powered merry go round. I was tempted to let them continue, but one of the Kerbals politely informed me that these were all of the parts we would get, so I had to put a stop to the solid fueled version, as we were quickly running out of \u0022Big Rocket Things,\u0022 which I later\u00A0found out were called \u0022Separatrons.\u0022\u00A0The liquid fueled version of the merry-go-round,\u00A0however...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Attention, everyone. I would like to say a few things.\u0022 Everyone got silent as I stood in front of the microphone. \u0022First of all, I know this has been a weird day for everyone. Alien abductions don\u0027t happen every day. But I have confidence in our mission. We will complete our module!\u0022 There was some cheering, at least. \u0022I have sent you all a few things on your alien smartphones, including a list of parts, a list of things you should know about the parts, information about the Kerbol system, the list of lifters and teams, and\u00A0of course the preliminary plan for the mothership. I thank you all for your dedication to the project so far, and I look forward to working with all of you tomorrow. An important thing to note is that Kerbin days are six hours long, although you probably already knew that. Depending on what time zone you came from, you either just woke up or have been awake for eighteen hours straight. So, do what you must, but I am officially synchronizing our team\u0027s clock to my watch here, it is currently eleven oh nine PM, so synchronize your watches.\u0022 There was a chorus of beeps from the crowd. \u0022So, thanks again for your dedication and cooperation. I suggest we all get some rest. We will begin\u00A0design work on the command section of the mothership tomorrow. Good night everyone. Also, the restrooms, kitchens, and recreation areas are at the far end of the room. Oh, I almost forgot!

When they found out about the test, a few of the cities (Most notably Drakesville) revolted. In Drakesville, one human stood atop the fountain in the middle of the city square and tried to shift the crowd\u2019s view to one against the idea of Kerbals. He succeeded, and 90% of the population of Drakesville began attacking the Kerbals, and destroying anything they came across. Fortunately, the Kerbals were equipped with force fields. The greatest injury sustained by my people was a broken arm (and that was because Mayl was pushed off of a building. Fortunately, Kerbals are very resistant to high speed impacts. Humans, not so much). My kind are doing their best to provide a safe and enjoyable environment for these humans. We have gone as far as to divert half of the planet\u2019s power to force fields, some of which are designed to catch humans in the event that they would be pushed off of tall buildings (which has happened dozens of times, already).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:2.4;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#434343;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EI really just wish that Stratovogmnolian force field technology wasn\u2019t such a closely guarded secret.

I am completely okay, and I hope you and Winter are as well. Just so you know, I am at the Kerbal Space Center (Oh my! We literally went there in these giant rocket powered spaceplanes - I WAS IN SPACE!) working on the Jool ship. I wonder what John is thinking right now (after I totally roasted him. Take that, flat Earthers!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ethan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. AGH! The play ended on such a cliffhanger!

AND I ALMOST GOT MURDURED! And I met this cool girl named Evelina! And WE\u0027RE ON A FREAKING ALIEN PLANET! BTW, I\u0027m at the space center working on the huge spaceship (top secret at this point, sorry) and I hope you haven\u0027t been attacked or anything (happened to me at least twice so far).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Your bro Ethan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDear John,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDA ERTH IZ ROWND!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was at this point that I realized I hadn\u0027t eaten in quite a while. So I made my way down to the cafeteria section of the warehouse. I tripped over at least ten strewn about parts, as someone had turned out the lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I finally got to the cafeteria, I found it deserted, spare one Kerbal at the counter. He looked young. And Exhausted. And bored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, uh, what are the food choices here?\u0022 I asked, trying to be somewhat polite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pretty much everything you want, we have food synthesizers in the back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks. Uh, I\u0027d just like a sandwich at this point. Peanut butter and jelly, if possible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming right up. Hey, you\u0027re the leader here, right?

Aubrey is a girl name on my planet. Not to offend you, or anything. I actually knew an Aubrey on my planet...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No offense taken, thanks for being polite about it. Today was terrible. I got a lot of rude remarks from the rest of your kind.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, on the behalf of the human race, I apologize for the way you were treated today.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks. That\u0027s nice of you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, it\u0027s just - well, should be common courtesy in my opinion. It\u0027s just that some people can\u0027t see beyond the end of their noses.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbals don\u0027t have noses.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Sorry again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No offense taken. Funny, everyone else who said that was extremely rude.

I see your kind was thoughtful enough to replicate the effect.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our planet had a nuclear accident a few decades ago. Ever since, we\u0027ve been living underground. If we want to go to the surface, we have to use special suits. Your species is way more tolerant to radiation than mine, so that\u0027s why nobody\u0027s died due to that yet. I\u0027m not old enough to remember the age of cities.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nuclear accident? Like an act of war?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, silly. My ancestors never even considered using nuclear devices as weapons. The accident was this giant spaceship that hit Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah. That would make sense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tell me something else about your planet!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, uh, the deepest points in the ocean are in these weird trenches in the shape of a smiley face.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Your turn!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On my planet, we have this one musical instrument called the piano.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my goodness, I heard about that! It must be so cool! On Kerbin, we didn\u0027t have any concept of music until when we joined the galacti - oh. You\u0027re not supposed to know about it. Anyway, we\u0027re not that great at Music.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Today has been the weirdest day of my life. Its been so chaotic - I long for one constant I can hold onto. I would do anything to have a piano right now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tell you what, I have been given permission from Jebediah Kerman himself to test out their new object teleporter service on a few Earth items. And because you\u0027ve been so polite to me, uh, where exactly is your piano?\u0022 I told him where it was. \u0022Of course, you\u0027ll have to teach me some.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure, if you tell me why you all have the last name \u0022Kerman.\u0022\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody can remember. It might have started off as a polite gesture like your \u0022Sir\u0022 or \u0022Mr.\u0022 or maybe it is a last name, and every other name died out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. Interesting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And your last name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edwards.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nice name.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One more question\u00A0- when you teleported us away from our planet, what happened to all the planes and trains and everything? It would be a real shame if they crashed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, your planet is frozen. Don\u0027t ask, it\u0027s all very complicated, only a few people understand it. When - if you return, it will be unfrozen and you all will be put right back where you were! Oh, the piano is arriving!\u0022 All of a sudden, there was a flash of energy accompanied with a muffled \u0022BOOM,\u0022 and sitting in the middle of the cafeteria was my old, dusty, out of tune spinet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my goodness. Thank you oh so very much.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, Ethan. Thank you. You are the one person here who has treated me with any kind of decency all day. So, what do these things do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, these are the keys. Most pianos have 88 of them. For every key to the right you go, the pitch - that\u0027s how high or low the note is\u00A0- goes up by half a step. You\u0027ll notice there\u0027s black and white keys. The black ones are called sharps - or flats, depending on what type of key you\u0027re playing in - a key in this sense is like a selection of notes you use to play a song. There are about fifteen of them - can\u0027t remember at this point. I mean, there are more, but those are just the regular ones.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can I touch it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go ahead, Obbury.\u0022 Obbury stepped forward, as if afraid, and pressed one key - g sharp, I think - and then stepped back as if frightened. He cautiously stepped back and pressed a few more keys, before basically pressing as many of them as he could at once. It sounded awful - to me at least. But for someone who had nearly no concept of music...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022THIS IS SO AWESOME! MUSIC IS SO COOL!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was like being an engineer in a warehouse of rocket parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can you play an Earth song for me? PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, most certainly!\u0022 I sat down at the bench with my hands hovering above the black and white keyboard and began playing my favorite song ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is this called, it sounds AWESOME!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s called \u0022The Final Countdown.\u0022 Some people love it, some people\u00A0hate it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Play another one!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But I\u0027m not done with this o-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I want to hear them all!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um... okay, then.\u0022 I played the opening sequence to \u0022Dragonhearted,\u0022 another song I knew well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022More!\u0022 I played Wintergatan\u0027s Starmachine 2000. Then 99 Red Balloons. Then Seven Nation Army. Then \u0022My Heart\u0022 by Different Heaven. Then \u0022Heart and Soul,\u0022 that piano song that everyone knows. After a good half hour, I had completely exhausted my supply of songs I knew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, have you written any songs yourself?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sort of. Fragments, mostly - I\u0027ve only ever written and recorded one complete song.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ooh! Play it for me, please!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, it\u0027s a bit personal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is it like a love song or something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d prefer not to say, but there\u0027s a decent chance she doesn\u0027t know I exist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Story of my life as well, but without the song. Which, if you don\u0027t want to play it, then...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll play it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I played and sung my heart out. I hammered the very fabric of my soul into those white and black keys. For a whole six minutes - from the double chorded intro to the articulated transition - through the second and third verses - and through both key changes - all the way to the most beautiful conclusion piece I had ever written.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow. Just - wow. I wish I could play like that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s what I am here for.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd that\u0027s how I spent the next four hours teaching an alien to play the piano.\u003C/strong\u003E Then he fell asleep. He had been awake for almost two of his days straight, so I can\u0027t really blame him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI carried Obbury back into the kitchen, then wheeled the piano back to my atpartment. I fell asleep playing \u0022Starman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe peanut butter and jelly sandwich sat uneaten on the counter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n======================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin Day Three (Earth Day Two, 12 noon Ethan Central Time) - Launch Minus 27 Kerbin Days (6.75 Earth Days)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI woke up to the tune of Wintergatan\u0027s \u0022Sommarf\u00E5gel.\u0022 I briefly remained in bed with my eyes closed, absorbing the melody for a few seconds. I reached over to turn off my alarm clock, and my\u00A0hand hit empty space. I reached further, thinking \u0022Where is it?\u0022 and trying to recall a funny dream I had. Something to do with space aliens. Funny, it felt like that had actually happened. I reached further, my eyes still closed. I thought \u0022Wait a second, my alarm clock doesn\u0027t play music!\u0022 a few milliseconds before I reached too far and fell off the bed and yelped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, you\u0027re up now!\u0022 said the voice from behind the piano.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I guess I wasn\u0027t dreaming then, Evelina. Why the heck are you in my room? How the heck did you get in here?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never underestimate what I\u0027ll do for a piano. How\u0027d you get it here in the first place?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s a really long story. Uh, did you hear about the-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Murder attempt? Yeah, Oliver told me. He is currently in the process of building a better lock for this place. I was able to get through that one in a matter of seconds.\u0022 She could pick locks? \u0022Hey, do you know the accordion part for \u0022Emerson?\u0022 I don\u0027t have eight hands, you know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t know you played piano. Uh, if I remember correctly, that song was actually around eighteen hands and two feet at it\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/g8X0nJHrJ9g?t=844\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eheight.\u003C/a\u003E But with some tweaking, you could get that down to - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022About\u00A0twelve if you combine the two drum parts and the two accordion parts, as well as only using one hand for some of the other instruments. But in case you didn\u0027t notice, all we have is a piano, and no precussion section. The accordion and modulin parts, thus, can be played one handed, the dulcimer part is mostly the same as the vibraphone part, and the glockenspiel part is pretty simple. So, four hands.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, forgive me, but first off, I still can\u0027t play Starmachine 2000 all the way through without messing up and Emerson is orders of magnitudes more complex, second, we have more important things to be doing, like designing a spaceship, and third, how did you get the sheet music for that? It\u0027s an unreleased demo!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, by laboriously staring at the video and writing down what notes he hit. And, yes, the spaceship. Speaking of which, meet me downstairs in five minutes. I\u0027ve got a few things to show you!\u0022 She got up from my piano and walked out the door, closing it before I could respond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, okay, then!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I went to change clothes, as I had fallen asleep in the previous day\u0027s outfit, but then I realized that I didn\u0027t really have any more clothes. However, that problem was solved when I found the stash the Kerbals had left for us (they\u0027re surprisingly good at sewing and stuff, considering our body shape is literally alien to them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour minutes later I was on the warehouse floor, which had been transformed over the past six hours into a spacecraft design studio. Most of the pallets had been moved to the side of the gigantic room, the ones we shouldn\u0027t need (like rover wheels and jet engines) had been moved into the back. The engineers had assembled massive tables out of some of the structural panels we had been given. Around each table sat a few dozen people, sitting on whatever they could find - chunks of wood from the pallets, small fuel tanks, micronodes, and those weird cube shaped probe cores. The teams worked around large sheets of paper which had been covered in sketches, mathematical equations, and coffee stains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pretty neat, isn\u0027t it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, it all changed overnight!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No kidding, Ethan. Uh, I gave these guys some general criteria for the habitation module, basic stuff like \u0022must comfortably seat eight crew,\u0022 \u0022must be under seventeen tons,\u0022 and \u0022must have a lot of docking ports.\u0022 Anything else we should know about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh... not much right now. I mean, we should probably have some sort of power system -\u00A0D\u0027oh! I forgot to mention that during the initial meeting!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The engineers thought about that already.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Uh, can I see some of the designs?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure!\u0022 Evelina led me over to one of the nearest tables and introduced me to the leader of that specific group, Dimitri, a middle aged Russian. His team\u0027s design was a very compact, space effective module composed of eight of the Mk2 spaceplane seat modules, arranged in two layers of four each. Unfortunately, it lacked actual control capacity, and only had two docking ports. Dimitri assured me that the design would be refined greatly over the next day or so, and that it would be much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, how will we choose which module gets built?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, our current plan is, that after a day of design, we\u0027ll combine design teams using a bracket system. The two teams will debate over which design is better, then they will choose one, or combine elements of both modules to make a better design. After this has been done several times, we\u0027ll end up with two final designs, and we\u0027ll build both of them, just in case something happens to one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow - you came up with all of that yourself?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, to be honest it was mostly Oliver.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was all her!\u0022 shouted Oliver from across the room. Evelina rolled her eyes, blushed a little, and then led me to another table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe leading design at this table looked insanely cool. It had this large cockpit (that looked strangely similar to the cockpit of the Space Shuttle) in front of a crew compartment (that looked similar to the ones that were on the spaceplane we got here in). Behind that were two six way nodes\u00A0- the first housing the solar panels, and the second being a four way docking adapter. It was, in my opinion, a better design than the first one, but it still had its shortcomings. The shuttle cockpit\u0027s forward node was off center, and anything mounted there would be off center. The other four docking ports were close to the large rear port, and looked a bit obstructed. It would be terrible to get it to orbit and then realize that it would be impossible to dock to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBut it\u0027s biggest problem was that it wouldn\u0027t fit inside of the fairing. Until I said that, none of the engineers appeared to notice.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third design we witnessed was a more conventional design, which looked sort of like an Apollo capsule attached to a module of the ISS. It had a cone shaped command module above three \u0022Hitchhiker\u0022 storage pods, with two sideways docking ports, as well as one on the bottom. It also had a basic deployable solar panels, plus a hefty antenna on the front. I kindly reminded the team that the top should have an open port, and that I had assigned communication to another team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it went on, design after design. There were about forty in total. Most of them looked promising, except for that one group that got the decimal place wrong. (Bro, 17 tons! Not 170 tons!) Minutes blurred into hours, and before I knew it, it was eight again, and I hadn\u0027t eaten (or drank) in an entire day. I told Evelina this, and she immediately said \u0022Oh, it\u0027s funny how time flies when you\u0027ve been teleported to an alien planet. I haven\u0027t eaten anything in a while as well, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll tag along!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we walked and talked. Ate and laughed. Then we went and played the piano.\u00A0I taught her \u0022We are Number One.\u0022 She taught me part of \u0022Emerson.\u0022 And when it came time for her to leave, she told me good night with a smile on her face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sat at my desk in my \u0022apartment,\u0022 staring at the schematics that people had sent me. Everyone was making great progress, considering that this was the fastest anyone had ever had to design a spacecraft. It reminded me of that one part from \u0022The Martian,\u0022 where NASA had just a month to build a spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was then that it occurred to me that my life could just as well be a novel right now. I mean, a ton of awesome stuff was happening! There had been an alien invasion, I had been to space, I had been named the head of a spacecraft design team, I had almost been murdered, and I had met this really awesome girl who liked all the same stuff I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the sort of stuff people would write stories about back on Earth. \u003Cstrong\u003EI mean, nobody would now, as I was nothing really special now \u003C/strong\u003E- everyone had been abducted by aliens. Ten thousand people\u00A0had been to space. Ten thousand people were designing an interplanetary spaceship. There were twelve others who had been appointed to the position of team leader. And, with the Earth\u0027s population scattered and the language barriers removed (I was told that after a Kerbin day the translation device was turned on for the entire planet), a good deal of people had probably made new friends as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen - I mean, if - we get back to Earth, the stories will be written about the four lucky people who get to go to Jool. Not me, who would almost certainly stay on Kerbin for the time being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027d always have my own story - one that I\u0027d tell if anyone was willing to listen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI heard another large explosion that shook the entire warehouse. I quickly undid the complicated locking mechanism Oliver had devised and exited to see the long arm of the rocket powered merry-go-round (Or is it merry-go-centrifuge?) firmly embedded in the wall of the hangar. You could actually see another hangar through the hole - wait, was that team two?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing to see here!\u0022 announced a Kerbal from over the loudspeakers as they removed the arm. A large metal panel appeared out of nowhere, obscuring our view of the other team. I later learned that the rocket centrifuge was undergoing a (thankfully) unmanned test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EKerbin Day\u00A0Six (Earth Day Three, 6:00 AM\u00A0Ethan Central Time) - Launch Minus 24 Kerbin Days (6 Earth Days)\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday was the first round of design bracket elimination. I\u0027m going to be perfectly honest, that part of the day was fairly dull. Since this was the first round of a 5 round bracket, with 32 competing designs, the most diverse designs were brought together, and there was - well, war. The most notable was the battle between the generic eight docking port station core, and the two pronged science-oriented module.\u00A0This ended up taking most of the day, because the two teams of engineers were fully convinced that they needed to win. I tried to tell them multiple times that this process was to make sure we ended with the most practical design possible, but it seemed that these people were more concerned about getting their name on the final report. It ended with a design compromise - it would be a two pronged generic science station module. It would not have fit in the fairing by a long shot, and was two tons overweight, but I let it pass, knowing it would be eliminated eventually. The argument had been going on for twelve hours, and I wanted it to end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the designs had easier times - the Apollo/ISS hybrid I mentioned a while back happened to be paired with a very similar design - and compromise was much easier. The final design had a revised solar panel layout as well as four radially mounted docking ports, instead of two. In fact, that was actually one of the more popular designs. The aforementioned shuttle group had gone for a nuclear powered design (Apparently the Plutonium Problem doesn\u0027t exist on Kerbin) instead of a solar powered one, making it so their spacecraft could just barely fit inside the fairing. Their main compromise had been to replace the huge mark three module with a hitchhiker, and adding room for more radial docking ports. All in all, I thought it was becoming a great design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, yeah, and the two worst designs - Dimitri\u0027s cluster of crew cabins and the 170 ton monster - were pitted against each other. They also entered a long argument like the first guys did, but the difference is that their design didn\u0027t end up looking like either of their initial designs. It somehow ended up *shudder* worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other news, I got messages back from Andrea and John. Andrea told me how much she had missed me, and that she had indeed found her family and Winter. John was all like \u0022This is all a hoax, you idiot. This is a government conspiracy to make us believe in aliens. Even your message was a fake scam!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlbbh. I\u0027m not wasting any more of my time on convincing him the Earth is round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what really happened today? I introduced Evelina to Obbury. We all three played the piano for a bit. I taught Evelina a fragment of \u0022Smiling at the thought,\u0022 another song I had started writing but never finished. She taught me more of Emerson. Even with how many wrong notes I played (and there were a lot) Obbury still thought it was the best thing ever. I tried to teach him about keys and chords. He got it pretty well, but that was mostly because Evelina could explain it way better than I could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, every five minutes I had to poke my head out the door to make sure nobody had exploded yet. The funniest incident was when one guy tried to build a test rig for docking ports to test how well magnetic docking really worked. But, uh, he sort of put the docking ports on backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and there was this guy who tried to open one of those giant solar panels, but it was facing the ground, so when it deployed it lifted him off of the floor. A few seconds later, the panel tipped over and the poor guy fell right onto the table of Dimitri\u0027s engineering group, which led to coffee spilling all over his design. Oh, well, it wasn\u0027t really a good design anyway...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was nearing six o clock. Evelina had to go deal with some business regarding the rate at which the separatrons (IDK if I spelled that right) were being used up, and I had to go review some of the designs that had made it to round two. That lasted an hour or so, and during that time I let Obbury play my piano.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I got back to my apartment, Obbury was still in there, and evidently had not heard me come in. He was working on a sort of melody. It sounded nice enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, play that again, will you?\u0022 I said, startling him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, uh, sure. You sure startled me!\u0022 He turned around and tapped out the one hand melody again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That sounds great. Almost like a sort of march. All we need is a snare drum.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s a snare drum?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Long story.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Those four measures are really all I have. It\u0027s not much yet. I know it\u0027s really nothing compared to any of our Earth songs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, to be fair, you\u0027ve only been playing for, what? A day or two? Write that down, it could end up becoming something awesome soon!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, how do you do that again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, first you make a five lined staff...\u0022 I explained it to him the best I could, and five minutes later we had the beginnings of a song.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could have learned piano in two days. Obbury\u0027s a smart kid. I can\u0027t wait to see how the song will turn out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZErGjH0.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZErGjH0.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLittle did I know that day, that those four measures would not only change\u00A0the word, but multiple worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecial thanks to the reddit user Wisear, as that is his sheet music.
