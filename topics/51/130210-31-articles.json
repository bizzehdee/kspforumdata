Lines of standard issue Buffalo rovers snaked across the plains towards the homesteads or blockaded the cave entrances. The team back at Barreales would have had the chance to report, and everyone would be on the lookout for their little aircraft.

They had agreed to take turns, but she let him sleep. He looked so sweet when she turned to watch him, head pressed up against the side of the canopy with his mouth open, breathing slowly and peacefully. Poor Raylo. She knew he was feeling guilty for screwing up and getting them both into trouble. All because he\u0027d tried to protect her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThey\u0027d known each other for a couple of months. Raylo had arrived in Barreales with \u003Cem\u003ELabrihe\u003C/em\u003E and a couple of technicians for a test campaign in the southern hemisphere summer where the long days and tall mountains were ideal for flying on sunlight. It was as if he\u0027d answered her prayers. After two years of rattling around the tiny outpost with not much to do and nothing to fly, he\u0027d turned up with a job offer for additional local pilots to try out his aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAgainst the advice of the old airship maintenance technician that Sidke had assigned to shelter and protect her, she\u0027d signed on immediately.

Improbably, he\u0027d managed to secure substantial funding for the development of an aircraft that required only free, renewable energy from a company who\u0027s main activity consisted in selling hydrocarbons. Go figure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDeep down, he probably knew that solar aviation was a pipe dream. His team had pushed the limits of solar panel efficiency, battery density, airframe design, and still \u003Cem\u003ELabrihe\u003C/em\u003E could only carry a token payload. A drone version of his craft might have its uses for scientific research or as a local communications relay, but it would never upset the balance of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDespite this, he remained determined to demonstrate that his design was capable of almost unlimited endurance. This explained the need for a second pilot. All Lisabeth had to do was make sure that the second pilot was her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCan you fly?\u201D he\u0027d asked at the start of the first interview.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCan you sit on a stool and eat fish paste?\u201D she\u0027d replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe ultimate goal was, of course, non-stop circumnavigation with zero fuel, he had confided once she\u0027d proved herself to be far more capable than any of the other candidates. And because she admired his idealism and felt that she could trust him, she\u0027d told him who she really was and why it would be impossible for her to take part in such an attention-grabbing event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIf we do it, the Company will be waiting to arrest me the minute we land, y\u0027see...?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nRaylo had shrugged and kept her on the roster, regardless. And he hadn\u0027t betrayed her. That was when Lisabeth began to suspect that his interest in her was more than merely professional. The thing was that, well... she kinda liked him, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNo, it was more than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHis enthusiasm and optimism were refreshing. His scruffy appearance and cheeky smile were disarming. She found that she could relax in his presence, a luxury she had never felt possible with anyone else during her long and dangerous mission to Mars, or during the time she had spent as a fugitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut most of all, she loved his dogged determination and single-mindedness. He was incapable of calling it a day until the problem at hand was solved. He would get that damned solar aircraft to fly around planet Earth at least once, or die trying. And once it was done he would move on to the next challenge. In this, at least, Raylo reminded her of someone else...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe looked out at the gibbous moon that was rising above the plains to the Northeast. \u003Cem\u003EDon\u0027t go there, Lis...

Ten endless years had crawled by since they had last been in the same room together. Since they had last breathed the same air. Since she had last felt his touch...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe had known him for a cosmic blink of the eye, and yet life had somehow tricked her into thinking that those few days had been both the beginning and the end of everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe remembered the months of flings and superficial relationships that followed his departure to Mars. How desperately lonely she had felt when they\u0027d lost contact with the first Martian mission. The joy at learning that he was alive followed by the gnawing guilt when she\u0027d finally decided to get on with her life and career, join Bartdon\u0027s crew and leave Camwise to a cold exile in Antarctica... even though she had been powerless to do anything about his situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMost of all, she remembered standing on the surface of Phobos and looking up at the breathtaking sight of a planet that was not her homeworld dominating the sky. Within their reach. What a beautiful moment for kerbalkind as a whole. But the realisation that her Camwise had stood almost on that same remote spot a few years before and had perhaps experienced the very same emotions had hit her with the full force of a sledgehammer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe was one of a handful of Kerbals in existence who could claim to know what the loneliness of a spacefarer was like. A true soul-mate. And she hadn\u0027t even had the nerve to go say goodbye, or say that she was sorry for what had happened. Or, rather, what hadn\u0027t happened between them. How pathetic was that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCamwise, wherever he was now, must surely be sure that she had died when Quissac had come down. Due to no fault of her own, she couldn\u0027t travel to seek him out and she had no way of contacting him. Their paths had been separated by a chasm of tragedy that neither could hope to bridge. This was the hand that fate had dealt them, and it was time to accept it at last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEmbrace it, even.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe turned to look at the sleeping form of Raylo once more. \u003Cem\u003ENever give up, \u003C/em\u003Ehuh..?

Lisabeth knew, however, that the observatory there was a trans-company venture and that the entire staff consisted of scientists. In a sense, it was even more isolated than some of the polar bases. There was no need for a security team up there: if you lived and worked at Atacama, you weren\u0027t going anywhere else in a hurry.

It had apparently rolled out while we had been on top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and was in the process of being loaded with cargo pallets as we pulled up in the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IpjNUzr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IpjNUzr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002252eO9iR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/52eO9iR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe accessed the cockpit via a ladder that dropped into the cargo-bay and made ourselves comfortable behind the two pilots as they powered up the craft in readiness for departure.

His actions were the catalyst that was necessary for us to overthrow the Board of Trans Atlantic. Tifal, I and others merely did the groundwork. Look, Bartdon, you\u0027ve missed a lot while you were at Longwood. Let me start from the beginning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002226WC2fG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/26WC2fG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs \u003Cem\u003EThil\u003C/em\u003E sped on above the ocean, Sidke told me about his years as CEO. It had been a position of apparent power, but in practice it had consisted in executing the Board\u0027s directives with little say in anything that mattered. Nevertheless, with help from Investigators such as Tifal and loyal friends from within the security teams that he had once been part of, he had managed to mitigate some of the crueller aspects of the Board\u0027s rule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe had cooked the books to conceal credit granted to impoverished communities. He had managed to sway the Board from introducing ruinous tariffs, convincing them that they would prove impossible to apply in practice. But all of these actions had been covert. Disguised. Risky. Sidke and his cabal had lived on a knife\u0027s edge. The slightest mistake, the slightest betrayal, and they would have all been eliminated in a heartbeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAnd the withdrawal of Trans Atlantic funding from the space programme back in Year 7, that was your doing, I expect.\u201D I said, thinking aloud. Sidke gave me the sideways look once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAs a matter of fact it was. I managed to convince Trans Atlantic that we needed our own space programme. I pitched it as a contingency plan, just in case cooperation with the other Companies was compromised for some reason. This is how Bonny Island was eventually built, and why we have already developed a launcher of our own. We had several ready to fly when the rebellion started, and a rudimentary communications network is already in place.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CA contingency plan?

Only the inner circle at Tanegashima knew exactly how he had managed to pull off such a feat, but it was common knowledge that Camwise had managed to infiltrate the space programme under a false identity. I must confess that I found the whole affair really fishy. Camwise had never seemed like the radical type, to me. I just couldn\u0027t imagine him flinging bits of himself all over our night sky just to make a damned point. I kept these thoughts to myself, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIt was the snowflake that triggered the avalanche,\u201D said Sidke. \u201CCamwise had brilliantly demonstrated how fragile the Resource Companies could be if their own employees turned against them. The next morning I gathered my most loyal security teams and arrested the members of the Trans Atlantic Board. I then made a public announcement, declaring that the Company would become a cooperative, lead by a new board elected by - and answerable to - every single employee and consumer within its sphere of influence. It was a huge gamble, but it worked. Just not quite as well as we\u0027d expected it would.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI sat listening in a daze. This was just too much change for me to process in a single conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWe had hoped that Trans Pacific and Trans Indian would follow suit,\u201D Sidke continued, \u201CBut neither Company harboured an organised nucleus of dissidents like ourselves. The Boards were able to smother the rebellion within their core settlements, and Trans Pacific has even managed to take over most of our territory on the South American continent. Only Kourou remains under our control, thanks to a costly airbridge, and it is under direct threat.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tbXltoS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tbXltoS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI gathered my thoughts together. \u201CSo you\u0027re telling me that as things stand, you\u0027re on your damned own.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes, but-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI was gaining momentum. \u201CThat\u0027s just great.

It was Tifal who broke the silence at last. \u201CDo you hear him, Sidke? Is this who you want to lead the mission? I warned you that he worked for the Board members for too long. He thinks like them. He talks like them-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C-and yet he interrupted the Martian Transmission, Tifal,\u201D said Sidke, turning to face her. \u201CAn act which, I believe, did not obtain the desired result. Indeed, an act that backfired in a spectacular manner, both for him and for us. I\u0027m not sure he realises how obvious this was from our perspective back here on Earth. Is this not the case, Principal Investigator?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis stopped me in my tracks. I closed my eyes and drifted back to that dreadful moment in the shadow of the Kerbal Face. My shattered fingers raining blows on the rover\u0027s antenna. A few seconds, just a few words. A few too many. \u003Cem\u003EShould you fail to do so\u003C/em\u003E...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI was too damned slow...\u201D I admitted. \u201CI cut it off too late.
