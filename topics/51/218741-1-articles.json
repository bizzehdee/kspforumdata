Continents form differently, with there being 20 major continents and a few thousands islands. 5 major oceans (colored differently) are spread across the planet, acting as navigation in the planet\u0027s (very) confusing oceans. The deepest points in the oceans reach -2,131 meters, while the highest point on land is located at 11.56N 7.03W at an altitude of 22,000 meters. About 25 mountain ranges also have peaks of up to 13,000 meters and typically form deep inland, with notable exceptions such as the one at 30S 120E. The whole polar region is a giant ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTemperatures at the equator range from 28-32C at sea level to 11-16C at an altitude of 5km. At the peak with an altitude of 22000m, the temperature can be -20C during the day and -75C during the night, cold enough to freeze CO2. At the mid-latitudes, temperature ASL drops to 25-30C at 38N and 10-15C at 60N (the northern/southernmost points). The poles can be very cold at -22 to -24C.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe route that the circumnavigator will take it obviously not an optimal route, as it aims to pass over the planet\u0027s major features and landmasses. The circumnavigator has not been designed or named, but it will take off at 0.02S, 68.42E and travel an estimated 16000 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission will start on 5 August 2023!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RevanX_LSR","CreatedById":216972,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-03T09:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027m thinking of a single RAPIER engine ~30 tons of clipped mk0 (109 tanks, 5450 fuel) and a lot of wings to fly at 22,000 meters. Probably will have to be very stable and fuel efficient, not sure if it even has the range to circumnavigate. This is more of a design challenge than a piloting challenge actually, didn\u0027t expect this to get so hard\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
