So when you do go to land, pick a nice flat spot or it might just topple over. For landers, I always go for a three or four-way symmetry with as low a center of gravity as possible to ensure stability even if landing on rough terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, since this is a \u0022one-shot-to-the-mun\u0022 mission, no docking involved, you strictly speaking don\u0027t need RCS. A Reaction Wheel or Advanced Stabilizer is more than enough to keep your craft tilted in the right direction. What you will need though, which I can\u0027t see on your design, is a couple of small batteries and solar-cell panels. Run out of electricity, and your craft becomes a derelict you can\u0027t control - at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last tip, Zeb isn\u0027t entirely lost on the Mun. Yes, his middle engine is out and I\u0027m guessing the two outer fuel-tanks are empty whereas the middle one still got some juice.

First off, the Eta lander was much more robust than expected. With proper fuel management, it can easily serve as KASA\u0027s primary landing vehicle.

That may get scaled down and tweaked a little bit for future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBret: But wait, you glossed over your mysterious first return from the Mun, from the Eta 4 mission, without benefit of rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: What can I say, Bret?
