This is something that I have wanted to do for quite a while now, and never had the inspiration to do. Long story short, this is going to be an ongoing half storytelling, half mission report, filled with hand-drawn illustrations! Now for the little details about the save itself: It is a Science Mode save, filled with a bunch of mods I really enjoy together, along with a changed up tech tree! The main focus of the save will be to conquer the solar system, or in other words, have a kerbal presence everywhere I can.

The payload, a small 0.125m probe carrying simple instruments like thermometers and Geiger counters, was fitted with the finest metal sticks (later renamed to antennas) and had two small solid rocket motors attached to help it get into orbit if the liquid-fueled stages weren\u0027t enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nDue to it looking like a little tube, it was suggested that it be called \u0022Tic-Tac\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe 4-chambered main engine fired, and the rocket... didn\u0027t \u0027up\u0027 off the pad.

Except the main piece of the operation, the balloon itself, didn\u0027t inflate during prototype testing. Some say sabotage had a hand in this, but at this point it was too late, since the engineers had half the rocket done already and had stuck the balloon capsule on top of it all.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s how the Hi Series of rockets was born. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PJeIjBk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PJeIjBk.png\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe flight itself was rather simple; it has to be. Otherwise all personnel that had anything to do with it would bail in fear of disaster. 5 minutes before launch, Jeb was put into the capsule, and locked inside. Afterwards, we had the hatch welded together with some solder we had in hand.

He kept saying things about how the parachute cover was loose, and when we asked him how he could even see the parachute cover from the inside of such a small ball pod, he said he went out to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nLovely.

His parachute was actually floating free in space before re-entry and got ripped off and burnt and all that good stuff, and he had to bail. Out of the welded hatch.

He was fine, although the real worry here was the science. Luckily, it was also just fine. And that is how Jeb got into the no-fly list for experimental and/or single crew space vehicles and a building was converted into an astronaut training facility, to filter out any crazy elements in our rooster of pilots and general space-going kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe savefile is giving a bunch of errors for some reason, where I can\u0027t switch the part tabs and the part selector becomes unresponsive.
