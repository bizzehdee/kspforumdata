It is a convenient target for ambitious and lazy players alike as it is nearby and Duna\u0027s atmosphere provides aerobraking assist which helps save fuel for landings and the return trips, and because it has relatively low gravity which makes driving hard but landing easy. I am now testing the same basic tech package on trips to Jool.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first image is a quick-look at the tech-package that I have developed. The caption specifies which craft is which. The second image is one look at some of these vehicles.\u00A0 Here is a list of the vehicles built for these missions I have mission photos and launch photos for each if folks are interested!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1 - Crew Ship\u003C/strong\u003E (2 in service, 1 orbits Duna and the other serves as the ferry for crews).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 In order of their entry into service,\u003Cem\u003E Hermes, Duna, Mars, Europa, Aurora,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003EJuno\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Ethe Crew Ship is the backbone of I.S.O. Capable of carrying 18-21 Kerbals direct from Kerbin - Duna or Jool in a 2-stage launch, the crew ships later couple with landers, Icarus Station, and Assist craft in situ. Crew ships are re-usable but it is typically quicker to recycle them from Kerbin orbit and launch direct than it is to refuel them in orbit after a round-trip mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2 - Phoenix Lander / Phoenix Heavy Lander\u003C/strong\u003E (1 per Crew Ship / Station).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 The 3-person Phoenix Lander and the upgraded 7-person Phoenix Heavy Lander are the vehicles that take Kerbals through entry descent and landing. Landers have safely delivered Kerbalnauts to Duna, Ike, Kerbin, and now Laythe. Each crew ship and every station is assigned a lander, at least so far as Duna is concerned the landers are capable of the return trip to Kerbin if necessary. Typically flown attached to station components on top of a 3-stage launch vehicle. The Halo Lander is the next-generation heavy lander currently in development, it will be capable of ferrying 23 Kerbals to and from Ike\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3 - Assist Craft\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Assist craft come in various sizes, they are non-piloted flights consisting of fuel and supplies. 1 Assist craft can refuel a crew ship and support 2 - 3 landings in the Duna system.

After about a year of trial and error I used Mech Jeb to check my orbital techniques (running it to compare to what I did to see if there were more efficient ways) and I\u0027ve read about ISRU and while I think it\u0027s really neat I still appreciate the challenge of assist-missions. I also really want to build a lander that is nimble enough to dock on Ike\u0027s surface with a landed fueling depot but so far anyhow that\u0027s been pretty tough to do. It\u0027s a fun challenge though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m attaching some images of the surface assets that I do have. The first is the rover with the landing stage that brings it to the surface (and later becomes an outpost/service module), the second is the original Phoenix Lander on descent to Duna (with the Europa Crew Ship and Assist trailer visible in the background), the third is the Challenger 1 rover, the Oasis Habitat, and the Phoenix Heavy Lander (7 crew capacity instead of 3) parked together, and the last 2 are Challenger 1 on its way to Ike\u0027s North Pole. 20km from Oasis on the way back from the pole a faulty saved game (the rover would only load with it\u0027s wheels in the ground) caused a catastrophic explosion throwing the rover 400m into the air. I was able to bring it down using RCS without killing the crew but the rover was lost.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last picture is hard to make out but it gives some perspective on the air you can catch on Ike driving along at 30 or so m/s (taken on the way back from the pole about 100km from where the Rover would ultimately die). The fact that the rover could tolerate landings like the one pictured was pretty neat I thought though getting it up to speed the low gravity is a bit of a chore.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YLdw6/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
