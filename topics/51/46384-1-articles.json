I kept adding fuel and it kept finding a way to burn every last drop. I took it as a challenge to do SSTO on the default MechJeb ascent path - while simultaneously developing the new lander. If only there was a lightweight way to keep all of the booster held together after cutting the lander loose. The three bi-couplers are connected to the lander\u0027s side engines with stack separators and by struts to everything else. The booster splits into four parts on staging and since I stuck three Okto B\u0027s on it the main piece can split again into four chunks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that\u0027s done, I\u0027ll be redoing it with asparagus staging for what should be much better efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3780/9913456815_d5d592a365_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229913456815_d5d592a365_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithobrake landing of an early test version of the Two Step Lander. The can landed upside down and smushed partway into the (fortunately) muddy ground. This one only had two side engines and Jeb decided to see if it could land with the central Poodle engine shut off. Not quite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7421/9913663843_597851debb_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229913663843_597851debb_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful landing at KSC of the finalized Two Step Lander.

Alan Aerospace Recycling and Packaging needed a way to bring down engineless vehicle parts. Thus - The Deorbitizer! Basically a tiny fuel tank, tiny RCS tank, tiny probe body, tiny engine, some solar panels, three RCS jets and a docking port. (The next to last stage hasn\u0027t been staged off, it has its own self-deorbit ability.) Naturally, the port can be changed to adapt to anything that needs kicked downstairs and has a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3772/9913548044_04bd7511e7_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229913548044_04bd7511e7_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore pics in my KSP set \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/27748767@N08/sets/72157635319720861/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/27748767@N08/sets/72157635319720861/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
