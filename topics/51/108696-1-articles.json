Similar to Kerbin. And I haven\u0027t been to it. I\u0027ve traveled to the Mun and Minmus, but Duna is left untouched. And we need to touch it. A lot. touch it all over\n\nANYHOO\n\nGoing to another planet in KSP looks to be an amazing and wonderful experience. I am glad to be part of this magnificent community and beautiful game. And part of the experience is visiting other moons, and eventually, other planets. So I decided to show all of you my experience. I hope you enjoy this as much as I will.\n\n**SCHEDULE:** \n\n-New parts every weekend!\n\n-Edits whenever I feel like it!\n\n-Always make it awesome!\n\n**PARTS:**\n\n**IT\u0027LL BE HERE BY THURSDAY I SWEAR**\n\n**Previous missions to things:**\n\nAs I have mentioned, I have gone to the Mun and Minmus. Mun with a sort of Apollo-like lander, and Minmus with a tiny thingy. Also I hate trying to get captured by Minmus. so annoying. But my body is ready for Duna.\n\n**THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA SUCK**\n\nAs of my knowledge, getting to Duna is going to be... not fun and games. I have a \u0027You\u0027re probably too dumb to know this so here\u0027s a calc thingy, you stupid\u0027 mod installed. (I\u0027d say the name of it but I forgot). Second of all, I am going to make a kind of mothershippy rocket, and now that LV-Ns aren\u0027t as beautifully good anymore, this is gonna be even harder! Yay! Here\u0027s what I know about motherships:\n\n-Have engines pull the ship, not push\n\n-Put in space with individual parts, then dock together\n\n-Try to be sane\n\n-Don\u0027t forget stuff\n\n-Don\u0027t put too many things on\n\nI\u0027m not gonna even go into having enough fuel, the lander, blah blah... I\u0027ma just say there will be mining and probes. Foreshadowing, amirite?\n\n**FORESHADOWING OF NEXT PART:**\n\n-*Designing the rocket!*\n\n*-Showing my design of mothership!*\n\n*-Explosions!*\n\n*-Failure.*\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n\nThis was partially inspired by Developing Duna. I need to read that, and I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s great. Kuddos to Brotoro. Next, I am pretty much a noob, as probably said in the title. I am not trying to be very professional, I just want to have a good time and make people laugh. Have a good day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T00:30:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by polan**"},{"CreatedByName":"polan","CreatedById":131811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:28:57Z","Content":"The first part will come out on Wednesday or Thursday!
