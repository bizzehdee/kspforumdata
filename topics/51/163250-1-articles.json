After multiple attempts to create a chemical reaction that launches instead of explodes, a group of government scientists discovered an \u0022excellent propulsion substance\u0022 classified as \u0022Solid Fuel.\u0022 Soon the scientists received only 10,000 funds as a budget to create a space program, to which 6 out of 10 of the scientists agreed. They purchased a small amount of land near the shoreline for \u0022weekly vacations,\u0022 and made another contract with the government for the cheapest construction of the center available. Within 1 week, the Kerbal Space Program began operations at the questionable Kerbal Space Center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EWorking on Chapter 1, will post it soon.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-18T21:12:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2017 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Casualnaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Casualnaut","CreatedById":178396,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-24T18:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENote, the certain purposes for some rockets were not the real reason.

Surprisingly, Jebediah\u00A0was not the first kerbal to fly a spacecraft; he would be the first kerbal \u003Cem\u003Ein space\u003C/em\u003E, a much larger title. Bob Kerman, once a biologist, took the title of first kerbonaut. He was in 2 out of 3 of the launches for the Loki program, which was made\u00A0for early testing to create a standard way of launching a rocket. Loki 1 blasted off about 2 minutes after midnight, testing the first legitimate rocket engine.\u00A0It was recovered 3 minutes later near the shore of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. After only a day of preparation,\u00A0Loki 2 was already due for launch. It was testing how much gravitational force a kerbal could withstand, with Bob freaking out and eating all his snacks\u00A0instead of passing out like the scientists had expected. It had 5 engines attached to it, which would decouple and float down to the ground with parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The last Loki, Loki 3, was just\u00A0parts of Loki 2 refueled and reattached without 1 booster and the decoupler.\u00A0It was launched\u00A0on the same day Loki 2 launched and\u00A0was the first craft launched by a female kerbal, Rosetta Kerman (Valentina would become the first female kerbal \u003Cem\u003Ein space\u003C/em\u003E, a much larger title.) The reason for Loki 3 was to show female kerbals that they too could be kerbonauts, and to test a new system.\u00A0Loki 3\u00A0was known shortly after it\u0027s launch as the Loki Disaster, due to the system accidentally\u00A0arming\u00A0all 4 parachutes while the rockets were still firing. The parachutes ripped, and the craft fell like an arrow near the R\u0026amp;D. From then on, the flight director, Gene Kerman, announced that the first space station that the KSP\u00A0launches, would be named the Rosetta Kerman Space Station. \u0022Poor kerbal\u00A0didn\u0027t even get to munch on the cookies!\u0022 one of the founding scientists, Wernher Von Kerman says while eating the cookies from the Loki 3 Capsule, or what was left of the capsule. The staff will be taking a week off at the beach near the space center. Further questioning about the fate of the Loki Program ended in Gene Kerman replying\u00A0\u0022We are shutting down the Loki Program, but using what we found in it for future missions.\u0022 before heading to the beach. The president, Joseph Kerman, responded sternly to this, \u0022We will not let disasters like this\u00A0happen with the Kerbal Space Program. The 10 scientists and their crew we funded need to show us reports of success, not failure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-24T20:37:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2017 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Casualnaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded the president\u0026#039;s opinion\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
