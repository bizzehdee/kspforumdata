I\u0027ve been playing KSP long enough that I think I\u0027m ready to take on the Grand Tour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, first off before anyone comments about mods etc, I do realize that many have done this all stock. I am not. I also realize that people do this from kerbin orbit and to the entire tour using only the fuel they carry. I\u0027m going a different route. One thing I don\u0027t like about some of the grand tours is that they aren\u0027t very realistic. Yes I know, it\u0027s a game about little green guys that can sit in a 1-man pod forever with no food/water/oxy and so on. But I was never a fan of the tiny pods that the Kerbals are supposed to sit in for years at a time. And, I also don\u0027t like those landers that are just a seat on top of a rocket. No, they should be INSIDE a lander can of some sort. Let\u0027s get a bit of realism here... Another thing I really wanted was a habitat section for the Kerbals to live and play in which includes a centrifuge habitat (From LackLuster Labs) so that they have some gravity on their trip and don\u0027t come back with bones like crackers (do they HAVE bones?) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This of course added a lot to the weight of the ship...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my design. I will admit that I DID use lander crafts that others have built and modified them to suit my needs. The landers that I built were close to being as efficient as the best ones I found, but I wanted that extra 100 DeltaV.... And as Picasso said \u0022good artists copy but great artists steal\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire ship with all tanks fully loaded weighs in at 740 tons with a part count of 657. It only has about 6000 Delta-V but that\u0027s ok because the ship is tugging an unmanned Karbonite mining rig. The mining rig will drop down to moons, drill, and process the Karbonite into fuel and monoprop, then dock back up with the mothership to refuel everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I\u0027ve used.

There are 2 more science kits on the left and right docks ready to be used if needed. You may also be wondering what the box next to the lander hatch is. That\u0027s the Radial Experiment Storage Container. I\u0027m bringing these just in case I run into problems storing science in the pods. Science can be stored in these containers.

These 2 large booster rockets are not SRB\u0027s and they can be throttled and turned off. They will only be used to get out of Kerbin\u0027s orbit and make it to Eve, and after that it will be Nerva\u0027s only. With the Nerva\u0027s and boosters, I get a TWR of 1.49 with the entire ship. After they have been spent and are decoupled, the ship is left with 0.25 TWR. But that\u0027s ok because the first stop is Eve. After landing and returning from Eve, I\u0027ll no longer have that giant lander stuck to the front of the ship. In between the 2 boosters is the mining rig which will refuel the ship along the way provided I find enough Karbonite. I will be scanning for Karbonite as I go along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the individual parts so you can get a better view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landers.

Except for Moho. That calculator does not factor in Moho\u0027s high inclination or eccentricity so it can give you a poor launch window. And believe me, you do NOT want a poor launch window for Moho. A poor launch window from Eve or Kerbin to Moho can easily cost you 5-6 km/s in Delta V for a complete transfer. Its even worse if you transfer from further out. This is where the launch window planner excels. It factors in Moho\u0027s inclination and eccentricity and as a result, it can give you a much more efficient transfer,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d advise you visit Moho while you\u0027re still at Eve where a typical transfer is ~4 Km/s Delta V. If you transfer from further out such as Duna, the requirements are even more and your ship (which you say has about 6 Km/s of Delta V) might not be able to complete the transfer. Just to give you an idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest case scenario estimates:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna-\u0026gt;Moho: 5.8 Km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres-\u0026gt;Moho: 6.6 Km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe-\u0026gt;Moho: ~6 Km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo-\u0026gt;Moho: 7.3 Km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that these values are for extremely rare (once every 10 years) departure windows that you execute perfectly. Factoring in human error and a more timely launch window adds 0.5-2 Km/s of Delta V to each of these values. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust something to keep in mind...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
