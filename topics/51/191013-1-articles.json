The emphasis is on development of safe, reliable, economical craft even if desirable scientific progress is delayed.\u00A0 Fuel is cheap. Parts and vehicles are more expensive.\u00A0 Dead pilots are really costly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReport #1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe program is in the early stages. Joining it in progress, there are three parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Science. Bob Kerman, chief scientist, operates the Slugbeast S; a jet propelled ground vehicle designed to gather scientific information around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 This is thrust limited to a velocity of about 10 m/s and has two pair of wheels for stability. Thermometer and barometer are hidden on the right hand side of the vehicle. \u003Cimg alt=\u00221KxP9Yq.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1KxP9Yq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Aircraft. The aircraft division is intended for the design and test of, well, aircraft.\u00A0 Jebediah Kerman and Valentina Kerman alternate as test pilots. We are currently doing runway tests of what we have named the Mothra series, with minimal fuel loads and increasing power each run.\u00A0 The first version tested, the Mothra 1, can fly, but is prone to porpoising as it accelerates down the runway and repeatedly stalls after initial liftoff. There are several variants with different placing of fins, engine, wings, and rear wheels, in order to attempt to reduce the porpoising and stalling behavior. The Mothra 2 is identical to the Mothra 1 except for addition of elevators to the tailfins. The Mothra 3 is identical to the Mothra 1, except that it uses Type B Wing connectors instead of Mothra 1\u0027s Structural Wings Type C.\u00A0 The Mothra 3 has been most successful so far. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022lKUlzDk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/lKUlzDk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Rocket testing. This at present has three sub parts. Jeb and Val alternate as test pilots for this program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3a) Single stage testing. This involves attaching a module directly to the engine and recovering the entire craft. Testing involves partial fuel loads to determine height and range with differing Delta v.\u00A0 For solid fuel rockets, testing of the \u0022Flea\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 is essentially complete; the \u0022Hammer\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E has just begin, the \u0022Thumper\u0022 is available but not yet tested. For liquid fueled rockets,\u00A0 the \u0022Swivel\u0022 with one small tank has been tested and successfully recovered. The engine bell is comparatively fragile and requires multiple parachutes to land without damage. Small FL-T100 tanks can be stacked and\u00A0 larger FL-T200 tanks have become available. Which configuration is preferable will be tested in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0 The \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine\u00A0 is available but not yet tested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3b) Two stage testing. This involves separating the command module and the engine with a stack separator. This is little different from single state testing at lower levels.\u00A0 On the one hand, this involves discarding the engine and tanks in flight and is significantly more expensive than the single stage. On the other, as rockets become larger and heavier, the survivability of high velocity and\u00A0 high altitude single stage craft becomes questionable. As revenue from completed contracts comes in, the two stage program will become more important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3c). Three stage testing. Calculations and simulations indicate that these craft will be able to reach space and Low Kerbin Orbit and return.\u00A0 We envision an extensive program of high altitude, high speed, and long distance testing with various configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe anticipate that once we have qualified for the Basic Science R\u0026amp;D grants, there will be a fourth division: Payload\u00A0 testing, with unmanned and manned versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-15T21:24:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2020 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Confutus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confutus","CreatedById":171610,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-14T04:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesign, build, fly, and test. \u003Cstrong\u003EHeavy \u003C/strong\u003Eon the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReport #2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Science. Bob gathered a crew report and an EVA from the Flagpole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Aircraft testing. A 40% power run on 3 variants of Mothra 1 had mixed results. On the first test, Jeb maxed the throttle instead of shutting it down.\u00A0 By the time he got it right, the craft went out over the ocean. It was going so slow in an attempt to ditch it that an attempt to bank went the wrong way, and it plunged into the ocean, still going about 27 m/s.\u00A0 Jeb survived,\u00A0 but the plane was a loss.\u00A0 The second variant was still going too slow at the designated throttle cutoff point. The third showed the least porpoising, going 46 m/s at the designated cutoff point. This vehicle will be taken as the new baseline for further tests. Mothra 2 behaved similarly. Mothra 3 lifted off so smoothly that Jeb was in the air before he knew it. He belatedly cut the throttle and landed safely on the runway, near the end\u00A0 A variant to be called Mothra 3a was designed and built but not tested. Another variant to be called Mothra 4 was designed but not built.\u00A0 This one will extend the wings using Type E wing connectors. The first of a new series of craft to be called Monarch 1, which has an\u00A0 extended fuselage, was built but not yet tested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Rocket testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3a) A Mark 1 capsule atop a \u0022Hammer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 fueled to 20% and held to 20% thrust reached a top speed of 110 m/s and an altitude of 2342 m.\u00A0 A test of the \u0022Thumper\u0022\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E was postponed due to safety and overspending concerns.\u00A0 A test of the \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine was also postponed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3b) Measurement in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E revealed no significant different in weight or fuel capacity between two FL-T100 tanks and one FL-T200; Which is preferred seems to be a matter of part count and convenience in attaching fins. A single stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ELRB\u003C/abbr\u003E sent a Mark 1 command pod over the ocean\u00A0 to gather a crew report and EVA of Kerbin\u0027s waters. Based on simulations, there was some fear that tilting as far as 45 degree angle to the vertical would cause the rocket to lose control but apparently it was going fast enough that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and aerodynamic forces compensated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3c) A three stage rocket with the second and third stages consisting of \u0022flea\u0022 boosters with the thrust set to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2 achieved an altitude record of 31, 517 m (in the upper atmosphere), a speed record of 250 m/s and due attempt to turning the flight of the second stage to a 45 degree to the vertical, set a distance record of over 10 km.

Wernher Von Kerman wanted a 50% test of the original Mothra 1, and its variants,\u00A0 but Jeb and Val refused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3a). The Mark 1 command module atop the Hammer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, dubbed the \u0022Airhammer\u0022 was tested at 30% fuel and 17% thrust, Delta V of 615 m/sec, reached an altitude of 4662 m.

The rocket failed to reach 200 m, but the already-deployed parachutes brought it to a safe landing. The test was repeated, at 10% fuel and 14% thrust, with a Delta V of 364 m/s and reached approximately 1100 m altitude. The vehicle was recovered safely.\u00A0 The test of a Mark 1 module atop a \u0022Reliant\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ELRB\u003C/abbr\u003E with 15% thrust and a 40% fuel load was computed to have a\u00A0 delta V of 265 failed for the same reason as the Thumperjumper.\u00A0 The same tech committed the same error and was fired for it. A repeat of the test reached 460 m; dangerously low, but Jeb survived the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3b) The separable \u0022Swivel\u0022 with 2 small tanks of fuel was fully loaded and sent out over the ocean, tilting its trajectory at 45% to the vertical. The command module was fitted with a 0.625 heatshield for testing at splashdown. This test was successful and fulfilled a contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3c) A 3 stage vehicle was tested. Third stage was a bare Mark 1; second stage was a 1 tank \u0022swivel\u0022,\u00A0 first stage was a \u0022flea\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E. The flight plan was to roll the ship while the first stage was boosting to put it on the correct heading for Danfrey\u0027s Awe, and then pitch the second stage toward it for a high altitude observation. The test failed when Jeb performed a yaw instead of a roll and sent the ship on a near horizontal heading well below 5 km. The second stage appeared not to fire correctly. Jeb jettisoned the stage and landed the command module.\u00A0 Since this was pilot error, the test was redone. This time everything worked correctly, but there was too little fuel to reach the minimum altitude needed for the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPayload testing can now begin. It has been observed that the placement of the CF behind the CM which works well to maintain attitude on ascent turns into a disadvantage on descent.\u00A0 The aerodynamic forces acting at high speed may overwhelm the controls on the command module and force it into a nose down attitude. Since this lacks the aerobraking effect of the usual nose up attitude, the craft then goes plunging at high speed into the ground. At high speed, parachutes may fail to deploy or be ripped apart if they do. This cannot be allowed, hence there is a\u00A0 need for careful payload design and testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-15T21:29:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2020 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Confutus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded motto, report number\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confutus","CreatedById":171610,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-15T22:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesign, build, fly, and test. \u003Cstrong\u003EHeavy \u003C/strong\u003Eon the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReport #4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Slugbeast S had a ScienceJr 9001 added to its rear and two battery modules so that full reports can be transmitted.

A new craft, Apis 1, with a short body like the Mothra series, but twin engines mounted on the wings and a conventional tail (horizontal tail fins for elevators, and a vertical tail for a rudder) underwent a 5% power runway test.
