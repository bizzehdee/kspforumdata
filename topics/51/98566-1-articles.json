I would like to point out though, when you have little to lose, you don\u0027t miss it nearly as much as those who have lots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do however intend to at least attempt a circumnavigation of the Mun on foot. And I use that word attempt very loosely. As one astute observer of my preview to this thread pointed out, what I am mostly likely creating is Krakenbait. There\u0027s a very good chance this mission will be a dismal failure. If it\u0027s not, it\u0027ll take me, at the very least, weeks if not months to complete. This will be somewhat of a part-time mission and I will work on it as I have time (and patience).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also use that word \u0022foot\u0022 rather loosely. If you are assuming I\u0027m going to walk some Kerbal EVA around the Mun, well, I haven\u0027t lost THAT much of my mind. My first thread in the mission reports forum is my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105372-Eve-A-ground-based-circumnavigation-13-m-s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eground-based circumnavigation of Eve.\u003C/a\u003E Usually though, you find me in the Challenges forum. Those of you reading this who have seen some of my creations in that forum may recall that I build walkers.

I know. It\u0027s not blazing fast. But, Octo wasn\u0027t designed to be fast. It was designed to be rugged, durable and sturdy enough to traverse the Mun. Those of you who have been to the Mun know exactly what that terrain looks like. And, if you\u0027re like me, you\u0027ve probably flipped more than one rover on it\u0027s roof. And you also know exactly what speed on the Mun does to rovers... it turns them into low flying space craft. Octo is designed to climb up, over and down the sides of craters, and stay on it\u0027s feet doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you know what Octo is and what it\u0027s intended to do, let me describe this mission. It\u0027s probably going to be unlike most other mission reports you read here. While there is a crew of 5 on board with supplies to make repairs if needed and they will be traversing the surface of the Mun as this thread progresses, the primary goal of this mission won\u0027t be a circumnavigation. It\u0027s my hope that this mission will pique your curiosity in walker design and encourage you to build your own. I\u0027ve been designing and building walkers for months now and I can tell you honestly that I\u0027ve only begun to scratch the surface of what\u0027s possible. By passing this knowledge along in the form of a mission, I\u0027m hoping some of you will take up the challenge of creating you own and teach me things I haven\u0027t thought of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though I have gotten... decent... in walker design, I\u0027m far from a master. I can also tell you that Octo is far from perfect. I\u0027m already aware of some flaws in the design that have and will cause problems. But, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re anything I can\u0027t work around. As long as I don\u0027t end up with yet another corrupt save from wandering parts, Octo should survive this. And, if it doesn\u0027t, since the Mun is only a hop, skip and jump away from Kerbin, repair parts and a replacement is close at hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the basic format will be first, a mission report of our progress (and most likely failures) followed by a specific topic in walker design. It\u0027s my hope that you guys will also fire off as many questions as you have about walkers and I\u0027ll try to answer them as best as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn with the mission -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPre-Mission\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you hadn\u0027t noticed, my walkers are not small. Getting Octo off the launch pad was a challenge in it\u0027s own right. First of all, it\u0027s heavy on the nose. Secondly, it has no self-righting mechanism which means, it had to be launched upside down so that it could land right side up. Now, imagine strapping a 38 ton dead bug to the top of a rocket with all 8 legs waving in the air... and launching it. I believe the part count was 540\u002B with a lot of that being struts. Thirdly, Octo is not short. In order to make a proper lander for it, I had to use 12 FL-T800 Fuel Tanks to lower the thrust below Octo\u0027s center of mass. By the time I was done building the lander, I had over 100 tons of dead bug and fuel. Landing 100 tons with 4 nukes was asking a bit much from the nukes so I ended up tweaking out most of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo/Day%200-1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Day 0-1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe launch vehicle and orbiter was the same one I used to get Walkabout to Eve in my previous mission report. Though the screen shot below doesn\u0027t show them, I strapped on 18 srb\u0027s just to get the thing off the ground. This does show how to get a 38 ton dead bug off the launch pad though.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo/Day%200-2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Day 0-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOnce at the Mun I had tons of fuel left. But, I also had tons of mass. Since the lander only had 4 nukes, I used the 6 engine orbiter to help slow things down. I\u0027ve pointed out a 10 ton counterweight I used to help move Octo\u0027s center of mass toward the center of the lander. The plan is, just before touchdown I would stage and separate the counterweight and simultaneously decouple the docking port on top of Octo from the lander. Octo would land gently on the Mun, I\u0027d leave the lander thrust at whatever setting it was at touchdown and with any luck, the counterweight would be thrown clear of Octo and the lander, with it\u0027s center of mass restored, would fly off and land... somewhere preferably not on top of Octo.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo/Day%200-3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Day 0-3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJust before touchdown.

If, you could find a way to rapidly lift and drop the walker\u0027s leg and by using lots of reaction wheels, you could keep it upright and stable and, move it forward. Parallax is still designing walkers and many of them are amazing. However, after studying his designs, I realized there was a key piece to his designs that limited their widespread usage. All of his designs require a script. Parallax uses \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.autohotkey.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAutohotkey\u003C/a\u003E to essentially program his walker\u0027s leg actions. While it obviously works and in a stunningly stable way, and while I do write code as a hobby and had no fear of learning Autohotkey, I made the assumption that most people didn\u0027t want to get into a scripting language to make a walker... walk.\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s when I hit on the idea of cam operated walkers. The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecam\u003C/a\u003E is an ancient mechanical device. If I could replicate one in KSP, there was a good chance I could convert rotary motion into linear motion. The cam in KSP is essentially an extension of the counter rotating rotors but with more lift and finite control. Plus, it wouldn\u0027t be attached directly to the walker leg. I could link that cam to the legs via struts and get linear motion. In order to achieve fluid movement, I would use IR\u0027s Free Docking Washers for the joints. It was immediately clear to me that if I could pull it off, I could create a \u0027fire and forget\u0027 walker. You turn it on, it walks. No buttons to jam to keep it walking, no scripts and no slow clunky movements. It would emulate actual walking with the cam and strut acting as a muscle. It took me several weeks of tinkering but I finally achieved that goal with a 12 legged version that looks a lot like Octo (link to the video below). The next logical step was to go biped. Roughly 2 weeks later, I created my first biped, Mun Runner (link to video below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then I\u0027ve tried to keep apprised of any new design theories in the field of walker design and, not to be egotistical, so far, the only two viable designs I\u0027ve seen are the scripted walkers by Parallax and my cam walker designs.

I seem to have found what caused the demise of Walkabout on Eve... saving. Already I have rotors on top of Octo getting badly out of part alignment and after spending a good bit of time experimenting, I know why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all know parts on our vessels tend to move around a bit. Mostly, this is caused by warp physics. We\u0027ve all seen the flexing of parts. Octo can\u0027t warp. There\u0027s just too much going on for it to hold together as it warps. But, because these are rotating and moving parts, many of those parts have some extreme stresses on them. It appears that whenever you save the game, it doesn\u0027t save the vessel with the parts located where they were designed and should be, but rather where they are at the instant of the save. And, when you reload that save, the parts don\u0027t typically \u0027snap\u0027 back into their designed place or realign to the part creator\u0027s connection nodes. Wherever they are at the save are where they\u0027ll be when you reload. This... sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt means, after multiple saves, if your parts are not perfectly aligned each time you save, they\u0027ll keep getting further and further out of alignment. The bad news for this mission is, trying to complete it in one setting simply isn\u0027t possible. The circumference of the Mun is on the order of 1.2 million meters. With Octo limited to 10 m/s max speed, I\u0027m looking at 50\u002B hours to complete it. My intent was to break it down into 12 missions of 100 km each. And because Octo is no race car, it\u0027s taking me multiple saves just to make 50 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo/misalignment.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022misalignment.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of what I\u0027m referring to. About half of the rotors on Octo have gotten badly out of alignment through saving while some of the legs were off the ground. This caused some of the rotors to receive all the weight of Octo and thus, push them upward. Once they\u0027re pushed up, there\u0027s no way to pull them back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t really claim that this is a design flaw as Octo does work and work well. It would appear that any long term mission that\u0027s subject to physical forces and moves is doomed to have mis-located parts due to game save mechanics. I already know that this is going to create corrupt saves with parts inside of parts or result in some bastardized Frankenstein of what I originally designed and I really have no desire to spend hours editing save files each time I want to log in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, KSP is intentionally designed to have things go wrong. Whether this is part of that intentional mechanic, I can\u0027t say.

You see, I assumed that when you did a quicksave that everything was just dandy. And for most spacecraft that don\u0027t endure the effects of gravity, that would be a good bet. Ground based vehicles however, I\u0027m fairly certain it\u0027s a bad idea to quicksave when they\u0027re moving. My Eve rover \u0027Walkabout\u0027 suffered some pretty badly misaligned parts. I had a habit of hitting the F5 button while still roaming around. I believe the first time I quicksaved while moving and then reloaded with F9, the parts went out of alignment. Every time I quicksaved while moving and reloaded again, the misalignment just got worse. I doomed the vessel to become a Frankenstein of misaligned parts by thinking I was protecting my investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcto is MUCH more complex that Walkabout was. There are lots more stresses on it\u0027s parts than just gravity. Because I was quicksaving while walking with Octo, and because of the added part stresses and parts being misaligned while walking, it failed a lot sooner than Walkabout did. So, if I\u0027m correct in this guess, it\u0027s not a design flaw in Octo. Rather, it\u0027s a habit flaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmed with this new information I have developed a plan to test this theory and hopefully, restart, and complete, this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new quicksave plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStop all motion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERetract all landing gear (toes) so there\u0027s no gravitational stresses on the legs and struts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDeploy the LLL \u0027Skids\u0027 I mounted under Octo (originally, the idea was if Octo had problems with craters I could \u0027slide\u0027 down them.

Because Octo\u0027s center of mass is different from it\u0027s physical center, I used a 10 ton counterweight to bring the lander\u002BOcto\u0027s center of mass in line with the center of thrust. Once landed, the counterweight was discarded so that I could power up the lander and decouple it from Octo. When this technique works correctly, your payload lands safely and the lander vehicle flies off... hopefully... to a safe place to crash. This lander, the last I saw it, was heading for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all the excess discarded and with high hopes that we were finally off on this mission, Pomeroy drew the short straw and got to plant the flag. As you can tell from the description of the landing spot in the screenshot, Pommy isn\u0027t the most articulate Kerbal. But the flag got planted and we began heading east across, according the the map, Farside Crater. You would think that would imply there\u0027s a Nearside Crater, but we haven\u0027t found it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, we\u0027ve made it 30km from our starting point and we\u0027re still walking with no issues. We did have to stop once to reattach our \u0027rover\u0027 because we forgot about it and it was flopping around a bit.

While everything here may at first appear blatantly obvious, I want to make certain that when I get into more advance tutorials that you know what I\u0027m talking about. So that there\u0027s no doubt as to which part I\u0027m referring to, I\u0027ll point out the major ones and give a brief description of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo%20II/screenshot439.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot439.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeet \u003C/strong\u003E- This may sound a bit odd, but Octo\u0027s feet are the most critical part of the entire vessel. On any walker design, the feet determine whether you propel your walker forward or if you come to a screeching halt and fall flat on your face, or just as bad, go nowhere. I\u0027ve spent, God knows, how many hours trying to perfect walker feet. And I\u0027m still not satisfied. About the only option for creating feet are to use some sort of landing strut. I\u0027ve seen other parts used, and I even used RBI tracks on my Mun Runner to go roller skating... which ended in disaster, but nothing yet matches the balance of landing struts. Feet need brakes. I know this sounds odd, but most parts in KSP don\u0027t have brakes. If you put a fuel tank on a slope, even full of fuel, it\u0027ll slide down that slope. If you add landing struts or wheels with brakes, it won\u0027t. Any part that doesn\u0027t have brakes, slides. Want proof? Here\u0027s the master... or disaster... of KSP design (no offense Scott), Scott Manley and his \u0027Munwalker\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Il6Zd9JVp74?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big thing you\u0027ll notice is that he\u0027s using girder\u0027s for his feet. If you pay close attention, you\u0027ll also see those girders slide across the surface of the Mun rather than propel the walker forward. Why? Brakes. Girders don\u0027t have them. Landing struts do. And that\u0027s why Octo has 4 LT-2 Landing Struts on each foot as it\u0027s toes. There\u0027s also a LT-1 Landing Strut attached to each of the outer feet pointed outboard. Those add a bit of stability when turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHips and Knees\u003C/strong\u003E - While these are both pretty basic in their design, a single free docking washer with some 90 degree parts, you\u0027ll find they\u0027re not that easy to create. Reason being, very few mods make a 90 degree part. And, for making a walker, it\u0027s a lot simpler if you have one 90 degree part rather than making one out of several parts. That\u0027s why you\u0027ll see something rather unique on Octo, a part I designed and created myself. The knee uses 2 of these and the hip uses one. For those interested, as soon as I get a few moments between posts, I\u0027ll set up a zip file where you can download this part and link it in the OP. While you can make a walker without them, they\u0027re damned handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like to learn how to make your own using a really simple 3D modelling tool, I recommend \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3232-Part-Modding-Tutorial-1-5-Modeling\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis tutorial\u003C/a\u003E. It taught me what I needed to know to make that part using Wings 3D, which is a LOT easier to use, but a lot less powerful, than Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Cam\u003C/strong\u003E - This is essentially the heartbeat of any walker using my design techniques. Without it, you\u0027re destined to constantly press buttons to open and close hinges or slide pistons. Or, if you prefer the designs by Parallax, scripting in AutoHotkey. This simple cam design allows you to turn your walker on and watch it walk. As a matter of fact, the whole time I\u0027ve been writing this post, Octo has been strolling across the Mun on it\u0027s own. The theory is simple. To take a rotary motion and turn it into a linear motion, to go from round and round to up and down. The rotary motion is created by an Infernal Robotics (IR) Rotatron. Attached to that is an IR gantry rail. On the gantry slide I have two FL-A5 Adapter\u0027s with an IR Free Docking Washer sandwiched between them. The outer FL-A5 Adapter has a strut connected to the knee of Octo. When the Rotatron is turned on, the entire process begins to spin. But, because the outer FL-A5 Adapter is attached to the Docking Washer, it doesn\u0027t spin. When the gantry rails are slid, the rotary motion turns into a linear motion which in turn, moves the knee up and down. The more the rails are slid, the more the knee moves up and down and the more forward motion Octo achieves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, you have a very basic idea of the major parts used to build a walker. In future posts, I\u0027m going to go much more into detail on each of these specific features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T18:58:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Error","CreatedById":58941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T16:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it begins...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with this!

This is sorta in the middle of day 1. Our first day on the Mun was spent dodging craters. If you haven\u0027t been to the Mun in a while, the craters are still there. Ludfal, our braniac scientist claims it\u0027s because there\u0027s no geologic activity on the Mun. Pommy asked when was the last time Ludfal saw a volcano on Kerbin. So, that argument ended rather quickly. While still stomping around in Farside Crater we quickly remembered a design flaw that I sorta forgot to fix before I launched. I designed Octo with those silly square lights. Every Kerbal knows round is better. So, we couldn\u0027t see where we were going when it started to get dark. And, we ran into another minor problem. With the new method of quicksaving while lifting all the legs off the ground, the skids under Octo turned out to be a really bad idea. They... well... skid. And they don\u0027t stop skidding till you find a flat spot. Have you ever tried to find a really flat spot on the Mun? Mostly, we\u0027ve had to turn sideways to the hills. While this works for the moment, there are going to be some spots where we\u0027re going to have to stop and turning sideways to a hill is going to be more dangerous than quicksaving while moving. So, the boys fired off a message to KSC and in no time, a care package arrived. The fellas back on Kerbin loaded up KAS container with four round headlights, a grappling hook and a ground pylon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChad, our rover driver, was all excited when the care package landed 100m away. That was all the excuse he need to dig the rover out and go for a spin. He even got mechanically creative and mounted the KAS box onto the back of the rover and drove it back. When he pointed out that carrying a grappling hook on their back was not something anyone else really wanted to do, everyone nodded in agreement and decided he wasn\u0027t playing, he was working. I don\u0027t think you could have wiped the grin off his face with a sledgehammer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Chad brought the goodies back to Octo and since he was already out there, he turned the jet pack on and installed 2 lights on the forward rotor pod and two more on the sides of the cab. We can see now. We\u0027ve already got two KAS boxes on the roof so Chad mounted this one under the nose of Octo. He figured that would be the perfect place. The plan now is, if we\u0027re in a situation where we have to stop on a hill, we can attach the grappling hook to the winch and then attach it to the ground. Octo may still spin around a bit, but it won\u0027t slide down the hill. And, if that doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027ll try the ground pylon and some piping. And if all that fails, we\u0027ll just jam the rover into the side of Octo like a wedge. Chad doesn\u0027t like that plan though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we were stopped, Chad decided to go ahead and mark the spot with a flag even though we were only 60km from where we landed. We\u0027d hoped to make 100 before planting a flag but, we took the first day pretty cautiously. We only had the rotors running at speed 6 so our ground speed stayed around 7-8 m/s. Not horribly fast but horribly safe. After that flag planting though, we decided to push the envelope a bit and wound Octo up to speed 8. Now that may not sound like a huge change but our ground speed jumped to 12-13 m/s. And that\u0027s about as fast as we want to go. Even that speed is a bit iffy. Even on some of the little hills, Octo leaves the ground for a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe finally crawled up and out of Farside Crater and began our trek across the highlands. There\u0027s a few anomalies on our path and we\u0027ll probably stop to check them out, but they\u0027re several days away near the North West Crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, everything it working pretty well.

Plus, Octo has another lifting capability. All of the legs are IR pistons. While the one between the knee and the hip isn\u0027t used as it tends to bend things, it\u0027s there to match the size of the one between the foot and knee. By extending those, Octo gets some really good ground clearance (and a lot higher COG). And, when crossing the pointy lips of craters, that\u0027s a good thing. The nose and tail pretty much never get close to the ground until I lift the landing gear. It... should... be ok there. The other point to those pistons is a longer stride and thus, more speed. I was just goofing off with them while running Octo\u0027s rotors at 8 and by extending the legs, I managed 18 m/s. Not too shabby for an 8 legged walker. But, there\u0027s also a lot of sideways twisting motion in the legs and I didn\u0027t design Octo with a lot of clearance between the feet. They almost touch when passing each other. At those speeds with the legs extended, one wrong turn or badly planted foot and they\u0027ll get tangled up pretty quick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you watch the video in the OP again, most every shot is with the legs extended.

For Kerbals, this is a striking new invention. Capable of converting rotary motion to linear motion, those of us living in both worlds are only beginning to understand it\u0027s implications for Kerbals. In this tutorial, I\u0027m going to delve into the cam and how it works and how to build one in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an animation from Wikipedia that I like to use to demonstrate just how a cam should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Nockenwelle_ani.gif/220px-Nockenwelle_ani.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022220px-Nockenwelle_ani.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cam is basically a wheel with a bump on it. As it goes around, that \u0027bump\u0027 is used to push and pull on what\u0027s known as the cam follower. In the image above, the yellow part is the \u0027follower.\u0027 In order to understand cam\u0027s a bit more in detail, you\u0027ll need to understand a few of the parts of the cam. Here\u0027s an image I created with the various sections named.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo%20II/Cam.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cam.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lobe of the cam is the part that does all of the work. It determines how far the follower is pushed and for how long it stays pushed. The lift is the measure of how far in distance, and the duration is the measure of how long in degrees. The heel determines the position of the follower when it\u0027s at rest and no work is being done. There are lots of different shapes of cams to perform different kinds of work. A spiral cam will slowly build up lift and suddenly drop to no lift. An \u0027S\u0027 cam is shaped like the letter S and has two lobes. It will slowly lift twice per rotation and rapidly drop off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cams I use are essentially double lobed or, offset like a crankshaft. They both push and pull. In the image below the crankshaft is red.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Cshaft.gif/300px-Cshaft.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022300px-Cshaft.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purpose of walker design, I\u0027m going to show you how to build this basic cam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s lots of different way to build a cam in KSP. If you look my OP , the first two links in the list, you\u0027ll see my very early attempts at making a cam. They were basically adapters from the B9 mod with docking washers and another adapter on top of the washer in a fixed position. Whenever I turned the rotors on, the cams began spinning and producing work. While this cam did it\u0027s job, it had one major flaw, it wasn\u0027t adjustable. That meant that whenever I turned the rotors on, it was at full speed. It also meant that stopping was a chore. Rather than gradually slowing down those walkers came to an abrupt stop and I had to use a hopping method to completely stop moving. If I needed to adjust the lift of the cam, I had to go back to the SPH and move the washer location. This became a chore so I began looking for a way to make an adjustable cam. Below is what I came up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an assembled image of a cam I use on most of my walkers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo%20II/Cam1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cam1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s an exploded view with the parts labled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Octo%20II/exploded.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022exploded.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic theory is, when the gantry rail is at the center position, there is no lift and no duration. Even with the rotor spinning, it produces no work. As the rail is moved outward from center, the lift increases, thus producing work. While neither of the FL-A5 adapters are truly necessary, they allow me to visually determine how much lift my cam is producing. With traditional cam\u0027s the lobe pushes against the follower. While that\u0027s doable in KSP, I\u0027ve found it more beneficial to physically attach the cam to whatever I want to push against. The docking washer allows the outer adapter to spin freely so that as the cam rotates, the outer adapter can always remain oriented toward the follower and push or pull against it. Without the washer, whatever you attached to the cam would flail around in a big circle. For my walkers, I use a basic strut connector. If you want to have a bit more visual appeal, B9 has invisible struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, you should have a pretty good idea of how the cam should work. In building a walker you\u0027re going to need to manage a few things like stopping and starting. Here\u0027s the basic process I use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of my rotors are in action groups and I toggle them on and off. All of the rails are in a single action group to start and stop them sliding. Depending on when I want the lift to occur, I may rotate certain rails 180 degrees from others. If you look at Octo\u0027s video, you\u0027ll see that all of the cams are rotating in the same direction when moving forward, but half are lifting while the other half are pulling. This allows me to stagger the leg movements. You\u0027ll also want to play with action groups that cause your cams to spin in different directions. Reversing the direction of all of my cams allows Octo to walk backward. Reversing the cams on one side or the other allows Octo to neutral steer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy playing around with rotor direction and rail orientation, you can have your walker doing any number of motions from running, spinning in circles, and a gentle stroll to hopping like a frog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I do is start all of the rotors spinning. If the rail is centered or zeroed out, there\u0027s no lift and I have no motion. As I hit the action key to slide the rails, I start to develop lift. Until you learn how your walker reacts, do this slowly. As I increase the rail slide distance, the legs get more lift and more travel distance and Octo picks up speed. Stopping is just the reverse. I gradually click the \u00270\u0027 button for the rails on the IR control panel. As they start moving toward the center, there\u0027s less lift and thus less leg travel distance. Once I\u0027m at a slow enough speed, I center the rails. The rotor speeds never change. With the rails centered, all motion stops and then... I can stop the rotors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECam direction, cam speed and rail slide direction are going to be very dependent on how you design your legs. Every single walker I\u0027ve ever designed has it\u0027s own personality and prefers these settings a certain way. In my tutorial, the stock walker rotor speed was 15. If I set Octo\u0027s speed to 15, the legs would fly apart. It prefers speeds between 6 and 8. The only way to really determine the \u0027perfect\u0027 speed and settings for you cams is experimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcto uses a single cam per leg. Other walkers I\u0027ve designed use 2 cams per leg. If you look at the video of Mun Walker, you\u0027ll see that the cams are of different sizes, the rear one producing much more lift than the forward one. In that design, I wanted to lift the foot a lot higher than I did the knee so, it used two different cam sizes. As you learn where to place your cams and how to attach them, you may discover you can get by with 1 cam for 2 legs or you may need more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one final note on cam\u0027s. If you physics warp, expect bad things to happen. With most craft, the physical forces on them are relatively small. With cams running, you\u0027re constantly yanking and pushing on parts. Pieces will wobble around. Engaging physics warp seriously magnifies these forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s a thought experiment for you. Octo uses a single strut per cam to lift the legs. It\u0027s duration is essentially zero degrees. Suppose, I wanted to create more duration on my cams. How would I accomplish this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to ask any questions you may have if I failed to describe this properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elowiny\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Elowiny\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you use TAC ?\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what mod do you use to get the IVA seen in the last picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not use TAC.

Part misalignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now convinced that it\u0027s due to saving and I have no way to fix it. It\u0027s a choice the dev\u0027s made. Basically, if I save a game with Octo\u0027s feet on the ground, gravity pulls down on the center of the walker. This causes parts to become misaligned. If I save, then the restore is misaligned. If I save with the feet off the ground, then gravity pulls down on the feet, causing... parts to become misaligned. Once a part is misaligned, it just gets progressively worse with each save and restore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to have perfect saves, either this game needs to be fixed so that part misalignment is no longer an issue or I need to find a way so that gravity has 0 effect on every single part of the craft, and I\u0027m really not please with the idea of having to hack gravity every time I want to save my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means, that any other rover that doesn\u0027t have \u0027shocks\u0027 absorbing gravity when you save, will eventually suffer the same fate. Now you know why all \u0027wheels\u0027 have and/or need shocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, I made it roughly 200km before I started to notice rotors being misaligned.
