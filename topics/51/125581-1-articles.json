With the improved fuel transfers in 1.0, I was bound and determined to use the opportunity for refueling to return surface samples from Moho. No mods. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m like Kevin Bacon in Apollo 13, when he jumps to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to manual\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in the simulator, and everyone rolls their eyes before they are simu-killed on re-entry. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I thought, I remember that need fast stopping power on Moho injection, and nuclear engines are supposedly \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnerfed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, so let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s build a return lander based on chem rockets. I have a fueling station running on Minmus, so I can get off Kerbin, top of the tanks, and go there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the lander design, I should also say, I like landers with full Kerbin return capability, rather than light landers. I like to bring down Science Jr, lots of goo, etc, so if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m bringing all that weight, why not a single Kerbin capsule? If I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going down with all that, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m bringing all that weight back to Kerbin, why not make it a full return vehicle? That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worked for all my other Duna / Jool moon / Eeloo missions. And without mods, docking is a pain. And with the ability to not go down with my Moho return fuel, it\u0027s a fine strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo- first issue, single Kerbin capsules don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t handle full size docking ports well, which is what I have on my Minmus fueling station. No problem, I stick an empty Lander Box on top of the capsule, connected with the capsule\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Junior docking port, and the big docking port on the outside of the lander. Dock for fuel, transfer, and jettison for the rest of the trip. I know I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need another refuel tanker sent to Moho, but I can design that later with a Junior docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get to Minmus, spend a good 30 minutes docking, and while transferring fuel, I run my calculations on my dV so far. Based on what I can carry, I can barely transfer to Moho, but NO CHANCE I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to be able to stop when I get there. Damn. OK, jettison the lander box portion still attached to the fueling station, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have a Junior docking port for the next design, return the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew design- nuclear rockets with liquid fuel. Back of the napkin calcs (no mods) indicate with a refuel, I should be fine, as long as I send another tanker to Moho for the return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/mojouab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mojouab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp it goes, and we prepare to dock with the fuel station. Hm\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t select the target. When we come back into daylight, I realize the problem- the original Capsule had a Junior port, but the back side of the lander did NOT having a flipped port to mate to- VAB just attached the lander to that port as is. I have NOTHING to dock to!!! Well, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just as well, because I realized on the way that my fuel base is mostly designed around fuel/ox mix- I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d strip the base of all the regular fuel and leave lots of oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/missingport.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022missingport.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENotice anything missing on the can??? Oh yeah, the friggin\u0027 docking port!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was really feeling dumb at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution- make a new refueling tanker, similar to the one I will send to Moho, dock it to my nuclear Moho vehicle in outer Kerbin orbit, transfer and then be on my way. For the new tanker, I used pretty much the same design as the lander, without the legs, an OKTO in lieu of a capsule, and no science. The lifter is a stage of 5 orange tanks with Mainsails, a second stage of 5 more orange tanks with Swivels, where the outer tanks can be jettisoned and the center tank used by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that worked well- too good, in fact. I had 2/3 of an orange tank from stage 2-B on each system. So I joined them nose to nose for the journey to Moho, transferred what I could from the tanker\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orange tank to the Moho vehicle and began the burn. In fact, I first used a little of the tanker\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s main engine and remaining fuel for the first part of the transfer burn. Needless to say, when that fuel was done, turning this monster around took a while, but I had plenty of RCS fuel. Docking the two of them was incredibly painful, as you can imagine. But I did it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 all manually. (Drop mic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/MohoAndTankerKerbinOrbit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MohoAndTankerKerbinOrbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELesson learned- engines had to run slow (20% to 25%) throttle to avoid oscillating the two sides to death, as they were only joined by a narrow Junior docking port. Since most burns were long windows anyway, this was just more an exercise in patience (many burns were 15-20 minutes of real time). Once I placed into orbit with enough nuclear fuel to land (but not lift off yet), I began to plan Tanker#2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I decided to give in. I installed MechJeb2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EONLY for docking intercepts, mind you. I will still do all my launches and transfers manually. But 30-40 minute docking episodes just aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fun anymore. I know I can do it, and I have better things to do with my time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flew my fuel tanker to Moho (new design with some serious lift), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/fuelderlaunch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fuelderlaunch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFuel tanker to go to Mojo. Note that Mk1 fuel tanks clustered in 4-way symmetry overlapping. It worked!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..got it into orbit, docked, and gave the lander just enough fuel for descent and ascent. Then I found a strange bug- when I used \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to extend all 4 landing gear, my ship would explode. But they touched nothing. Restarted KSP, still the same result. So I manually extended each leg one at a time. No problem. Go figure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was a bit hard (more gravity than expected). They say any landing you can walk away from is a good one, but this was cutting it close, losing two landing legs and several struts, but at least I was upright. Those landing struts just didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to come back to Kerbin for some reason, they had a death wish. So be it, I was done with them. Should make aerobraking interesting, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/BadLanding.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BadLanding.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELeaning Tower of Kerbal.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly, takeoff was interesting. I got up into a very low orbit, and took the tanker down to meet them. Then I gently (10% thrust to avoid horrible oscillations) moved the pair out, transferring fuel as I went. I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have been happier when I finally got to jettison the tanker and use full thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/FuelerDocked.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FuelerDocked.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EVERY wobbly!!!

I used 8 cycles of aerobraking at 56 to 47 km to get into a low enough orbit to move one of my Science Labs into place. Actually, it was such a polar orbit, I just launched a new science lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I found out my design only had 2-way symmetry on the RCS, not 4-way, which makes autodock useless. Tried it for a while by hand, then just decided to launch ANOTHER science ship with the additional RCS thrusters. Autodock worked like a champ. LOTS of data for the lab to process, these guys will be up there a while. But now I have the science tree 100% filled out, and I have *finally* conquered Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40956047/KSP/ScienceDocked.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ScienceDocked.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELessons learned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf I had it to do over again, I would have taken the additional weight for the CM to have a full size docking port, in the hopes they would be more structurally sound and less oscillation.
