I set myself the goal of chaining together one of each type of asteroid in Kerbin orbit. In all this took between 30 and 40 individual launches. If you guys want to see pictures of the asteroid tugs and docking ships I used, just let me know. I\u0027ll have to do some work to get screenies of those. I was in a rush to complete yesterday and didn\u0027t document everything. \n\nSo here\u0027s the original post for your enjoyment. \n\nWell here she is!\n\nZellena Kerman was very happy to receive the largest rock necklace ever made by Kerbalkind. Weighing in at an exorbatent 2,800 tons and just shy of 400 parts, this svelte moon-ish necklace will make that special Kerbal squeal for joy!\n\n Getting the class D and E asteroids docked together was very difficult. From there it was all downhill, though. \n\n I think this is the largest thing I\u0027ve made in KSP. Rather, I think it\u0027s the largest single thing I\u0027ve assembled in orbit. Yeah. Lets roll with that.\n\n![F23938C873255B995BB8F18F167F201D4FDE8283](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/634230361580963160/F23938C873255B995BB8F18F167F201D4FDE8283/)![29283770E350FB279D6D13135880D0FD82A4EB74](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/634230361580962828/29283770E350FB279D6D13135880D0FD82A4EB74/)![98651A411C88CD2C0A3395B0D05C1ED8CF43BD51](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/634230361580963016/98651A411C88CD2C0A3395B0D05C1ED8CF43BD51/)"},{"CreatedByName":"diegzumillo","CreatedById":4869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T21:56:56Z","Content":"Haha \u0022Why\u0022 is not a suitable question when it comes to KSP.

I\u0027m impressed, especially at the dedication to getting them lined up in a straight line! I know your pain on getting the D and E class asteroids into place. [My own version](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/68737-asteroid-family-portrait/) was much more messy, it was lagging badly so I just chucked the asteroids together the first place they\u0027d fit - didn\u0027t try to form them into a line.
