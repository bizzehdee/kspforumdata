The rocket was designed for a sub-orbital flight above the atmosphere. The gimbal-less thumper engine did most of the altitude gain while the Swivel was meant to give it a less straight-down fall. The rockets highest altitude being 365,854 meters, crushing any record previously made by commercial companies. Better thermal protection is definitely needed due to 2 thermometers exploding. 32 science was earned and a contract completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-14T23:06:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2022 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Console_Player\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot to add science gains and explosion details\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Console_Player","CreatedById":221445,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-14T23:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIota 3 Orbiter Logs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket consisted of 2 Liquid fuel boosters with one main stage, pretty boring flight.
