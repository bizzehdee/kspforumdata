First of all. the boosters are on the front (bottom) and so the shuttle flies upside down. Second. Because of this, the engines are at an angle, making the shuttle harder to fly. (I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure if they can rotate or not, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know anyone who worked on it). And last. If NASA went through the trouble of saving even the skeleton of the SRBs (solid boosters) or the fuel tank, they would save MILLIONS of dollars on every launch. The majority (sort of) of the shuttle isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t reused. To give credit where it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s due, the shuttle is the most reusable spaceship we have right now.
