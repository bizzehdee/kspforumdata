We\u0027ve crossed most of Mordor and did the requested sampling. What would you like next? I can see a lonely mountain peak in the distance to the northeast that\u0027s lighter in color. Do you want us to explore that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Lonely Mountain? What other books have you been reading?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Books? No other books. But the visual downlink from the orbiting station shows some mountains to the northeast, even though Jeb\u0027s maps don\u0027t show anything. One peak is by itself...it looks like we could drive up it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022OK.

It was about this time that I was getting a bit tired of driving that day, and started experimenting with MechJeb\u0027s Rover Autopilot feature... But, again, it was a disappointment. At least for my rover design, the autopilot\u0027s speed control function is not very useful. When the rover is coming downhill, the autopilot does not use the brakes to keep the rover from exceeding the set speed (even though the brakes can easily handle this), so the rover ends up going at unsafe speeds if left to the rover autopilot. I suppose that a rover with the newer stickier tires would work better, since simply controlling the throttle might slow those rovers down OK. Also, when the rover reaches an upslope where the older, non-sticky wheels don\u0027t have enough grip to keep going straight uphill, I have to take manual control anyway to start tacking left and right as needed to maintain headway. So: Rover Autopilot...not very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sPilCf2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sPilCf2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KHjGRTF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KHjGRTF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner and Nelemy were able to follow a ridge up toward the peak of Lonely Mountain. The west side of the mountain was very steep (way too steep for the Fido), and the south slope was also fairly steep (which would have required a lot of switchback driving), so Aldner swung wide to the east where the slope was shallower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2oWHF0n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222oWHF0n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, a wider-angle view of Lonely Mountain from the south ridge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WhtCJin.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WhtCJin.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Aldner to Laythe Base.

Do you see where the ground suddenly ends a ways off there? That\u0027s where the serious slope starts. Now, if we were on Laythe and had a BirdDog, it would be fun to run down that slope and take off when we reached takeoff speed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022We need to order some air for Tylo, Dude.

But I finally got the plane to a height and speed where a short burst of the rocket engines pushed the apoapsis up to 116 km, and it didn\u0027t decrease too much from that as the Ladyhawk coasted out into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y0JBez1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Y0JBez1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the orbital insertion burn, the plane had 1570 m/s of delta-V left onboard. Not bad, but certainly not my best showing. The apoapsis of the Ladyhawk was left at 115 km because the ship was ahead of the Vall Ship, so it needed to slow down and let the Vall Ship catch up.

The Ladyhawk was docked to the Space Station opposite from the Raptor.

You must be very careful when doing Hohmann transfers between the moons of Jool (as I found out before when sending off Tugs to temporary parking orbits out between the moons). It\u0027s tricky to get the ship sent on its way with enough speed to escape, but not so much speed that you overshoot the target moon\u0027s orbit (because Jool\u0027s large moons are quite close together and have large SOIs). After the ship leaves Laythe\u0027s sphere of influence, heading out into its slower orbit, it can end up re-encountering Laythe\u0027s SOI. This happened to the Vall Ship...but when I slowly advanced the time, the ship made it back out of Laythe\u0027s SOI with its trajectory intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT... if you go barreling through these SOI changes at even moderate time warp factors, the ship could end up in a very different orbit (or could collide with Laythe). So it\u0027s vital to step through these SOI changes at 1X time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could expend some extra delta-V to boost the ship away faster (not in a perfect Hohmann trajectory), and that would make it less likely that the ship would run into this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: As the Vall Ship approached Vall, the extra Tugs were separated. The Vall ship would be braking into Vall orbit, while the extra Tugs would whip past the planet to be placed in a parking orbit out between Vall and Tylo (where they would wait until the next transfer window opens to send them back to Kerbin for re-use). I had to do a burn by the Tugs once they were beyond Vall in order to keep them from re-encountering Vall\u0027s SOI, and then later I circularized their orbit between Vall and Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ac2dyDr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ac2dyDr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vall capture maneuver is shown below. The ships were targeted to pass within 10 km of Vall. A burn of 46.7 m/s would brake the Vall ship into an orbit with 1,000 km apoapsis. The extra Tugs would pass Vall and escape (although their trajectory shows up as a complete ellipse here, rather than showing their escape point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XJHFNuO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XJHFNuO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vall Ship\u0027s capture burn was in the dark, so I have no pretty pictures. After the capture burn, when the Vall Ship swung out to its 1,000 km apoapsis, a 42 m/s burn was done to raise its periapsis to the 167-km altitude of the Vall Lander\u0027s orbit. Then shortly after than, a plane shift burn of 2.6 m/s was made to match planes with the Vall Lander. And it so happened that a small 11 m/s burn was all it then took to target the Vall Ship for an intercept with the Vall Lander. Finally, a burn of 171 m/s was needed at closest approach to bring the ships to rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The view from the Vall Lander of the Vall Ship braking for rendezvous (with its nuclear exhausts pointing at the Lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kNjdAxw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kNjdAxw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Emilynn brought the Vall Ship and the Vall Lander together for a perfect docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hd3LTdu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Hd3LTdu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Annnd...we are docked!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022OK!

This Tug (which had brought the two rovers to Vall) had extra fuel, and it especially had extra RCS (because I had used an RCS tank as a spacer to mount the rovers on top of this Tug). Also, the Tug happened to be well positioned, so it could be brought over to the Vall Ship using only RCS power (no need to turn on its nukes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5zFNC1X.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225zFNC1X.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extra RCS tank (and its attached Senior docking port), which was nearly expended by then, was separated from the Tug before the Tug made its final rendezvous maneuvers with the Vall Ship.

Emilynn was busy transferring fuel from the Vall Ship to the radial mounted tanks of the Vall Lander. Once that was complete, Emilynn buttoned down the Vall Station Ship for automated mode, and transferred over to the Vall Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022How are your samples?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Everything looks good.

I\u0027m assuming that Aldner and Nelemy would really be taking a couple weeks doing this drive, with breaks along the way for sampling, sleeping, and rest \u0026amp; relaxation. But, in truth, I drove this whole way up to 70 degrees north latitude during just PART of ONE Taylo daylight period. Now, Tylo daylight periods are over 30 hours long, but still, I was covering ground pretty fast (usually at 2X or 3X physical time warp). For me, this drive took four days of driving, two or three hours a day. Thank Kod for audiobooks to entertain me during the drive. Also, it helped that once they got to Forodwaith, the land had settled down to low and gently rolling terrain, so I could actually use MechJeb\u0027s rover autopilot to do most of the driving (only keeping an occasional eye on it to watch for runaway-downslope-excursions).]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 80 degrees north latitude, the boys started running into the problem that the low angle of the sunlight on the solar panels resulted in the Fido using energy faster than the solar panels could provide power. This dictated frequent stops to allow the batteries to recharge (less than 10 minutes of game time to recharge). There was never any danger of the Fido getting stranded in a dark valley where the sunlight could not reach, because the rover has two RTGs that can recharge the batteries in about 10 minutes. But parking on a south slope made the charging faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VjlyaLn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VjlyaLn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner and Nelemy started seeing some strange terrain at about 88 degrees north latitude. It appeared at first that there might be a mountain at the pole...but it eventually became clear that the mountain was off to the side of the pole. But there were jagged ridge lines running radially from the polar area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9YFREC5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229YFREC5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not unusual for planets and moons in KSP to have anomalous terrain at their poles (such as the deep \u0022Mohole\u0022 at Moho\u0027s north pole), and apparently this is also the case for Tylo. Below is a zoomed-out overview of the polar region (the arrow marks the location of the rover, a couple kilometers from the pole). Well...this was a bit exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ibVO76i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ibVO76i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner decided that it would be beneficial to drive over to the radial ridge line so that he could drive along the sunward-facing slope of that ridge (to keep the batteries charged). But when the Fido approached the radial ridge, it ran into strange gravitational anomalies (below). You can see that despite having the forward throttle floored, and the rover actually pointing downhill alittle, the rover was only able to creep along at about 3 meters per second (also note that the battery charge is fine). And when the rover hit the areas with an up-slope, it actually SPED UP. Freaky time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WA9fPYX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WA9fPYX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys persevered, and plowed northward down Anomaly Canyon, sometimes creeping along downhill at full throttle...sometimes zipping uphill at no throttle...sometimes driving along normally. It did not help matters that the lights of the rover were often ineffective in lighting up the terrain (This actually was happening further south as well...on some patches of land, the lights simply did not light up the ground. But it was particularly annoying when trying to drive in the far-north dark areas).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually Aldner decided that it was safer to drive in the less-freaky areas a little ways away from the radial ridge lines, even if that necessitated occasional stops for battery recharging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ETIxvWX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ETIxvWX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was nice that even this close to the pole, the boys were never long out of line-of-sight communication with Laythe or Vall.
