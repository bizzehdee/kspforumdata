Been hinting at this a little bit and now its finally a thing (again, technically). Few people have asked to follow my mining operations on the Mun, so back up comes my mission report site, complete with that as the first content. Gonna be hammering out a buncha content real quick this week so stay tuned, keep reading, and don\u0027t forget to come back here to discuss.\n\n[**Check it out!**](sierraspaceindustries.weebly.com)\n\nCurrent mission ribbons:\n\n![EHcWZUf.png](http://i.imgur.com/EHcWZUf.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T22:17:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra**"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T00:28:08Z","Content":"Good news for people. I think I figured out an acceptable way to get all the trusses to the Mun in just 2-3 launches. I still have to figure out the exact layout I\u0027m going for but once that\u0027s settled, stuff will be rolling onto the pad. Expect this post to get updated after new content is added.\n\n-Sierra"}]}
