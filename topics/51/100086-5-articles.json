If I understand correctly, the biome map you\u0027re looking at there doesn\u0027t just *label* the biomes, it *defines* them: when the game needs to determine what biome you are in, it looks at that map (or rather the .gif from which that map is generated), finds your current coordinates, and checks what colour that point is. However, the .gif has a finite resolution; if you\u0027re right at the boundary between two biomes, the game ends up picking up both adjacent pixels and averaging them, and sometimes the average colour ends up being neither of the two biomes in question.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t a boundary effect. I was checking the biome often as Adly and Kelby drove east. It went from lowlands to highlands to midlands to highlands to lowlands (as they went over that first bump), and then went from lowlands to highlands (again with no midlands in between) in that wider second bump with the probe on it. When they continued east off of that bump, they went directly from highlands to lowlands (again with no midlands in between).\n\nThe resolution and accuracy of the biome overlay on the map does indeed leave a lot to be desired, but in this case (compared to everywhere else I\u0027ve looked around Duna), it appears that whoever made the biome map designated these areas in the wrong order.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T15:34:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T16:50:58Z","Content":"Cool, you landed right where my Duna base is! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAh well, I second Scotius\u0027 question; will you explore the face, the Curiosity rover, or the SSTV hill?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T00:08:19Z","Content":"Glad I\u0027m not the only one that saw weird biomes on Duna.

Emilynn Kerman had landed her DunaDog plane at Barsoom Base, and a fine party was had by all.\n\n![jlx7Eym.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jlx7Eym.jpg)\n\nThe next morning, it was time to refuel and refurbish.

Do you want to ride on top for a better view of the ground?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Well...I usually like to ride inside...Emi\u0027s driving scares me sometimes.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022I promise I\u0027ll drive safely. I have a lot of experience driving. Plus, you\u0027re actually safer riding on top in case of an accident -- the cabin is pretty fragile, and also contains your explosives for geological experiments.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022OK...I\u0027ll ride on top to start. I really do need to see the landscape better, anyway. OK, I\u0027m in the seat. Let\u0027s go.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022And we\u0027re off!

But eventually the slope steepened, and the rover needed to start doing some switchbacks back and forth to keep making headway. If the rover used the grippier tires, this would not be necessary -- but I also find that the grippier tires make a rover much more prone to flipping. Also, in Duna\u0027s weaker gravity, the turning traction from the wheels is not enough to overcome the torque of the cockpit/cabin when the SAS is activated, so it\u0027s necessary to hold down the \u0022F\u0022 key to temporarily disable the SAS when making turns.\n\n![4HwBGqj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4HwBGqj.jpg)\n\n![yF2kHKc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yF2kHKc.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022There\u0027s another outcrop of rock ahead. Please stop there.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Yes, Ma\u0027am. Are you learning anything interesting?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Sure. Down low I was seeing outcrops of sedimentary rocks that had been exposed by a lot of erosion. Higher up here I\u0027m seeing igneous rocks, but they\u0027re also showing signs of water scouring. I think a huge flood of water must have come down Barsoom Canyon from that basin located northwest of here at some point.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022So Barsoom Canyon is a river valley?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022No. I think it probably originally formed as a tectonic crack between the two parts of the highlands...but that allowed water in the northwest basin to cut loose and rush through here when some natural dam broke, digging out the canyon more. The wall of water would have been gigantic! I wish I could have seen it.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022...from the safety of the highlands, I assume you mean.\u0022\n\n![3iFhge9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3iFhge9.jpg)\n\nThe slope of the land started to level off above 5000 meters, but there were still locally steep ridges. I generally choose a driving angle that allows the rover to move at around 10 m/s (which usually allows it to make vertical headway of at least one m/s). The rover handles well at 2X or 3X time warp...but on steep slopes, the rover slides sideways down the gradient too much to make the high time warp useful.\n\n![G5oLB4a.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/G5oLB4a.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022Ah! Look at this big bowl feature ahead of us. Looks like a classic caldera feature. Pyroclastic flows from here were probably the source of those outcrops of tuff we found below. Let\u0027s stop so I can do some digging to see what\u0027s under the sand and dust here. If you help me dig, I\u0027ll make lunch afterward.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022How could I resist such an enticing offer?\u0022\n\nBelow, the yellow arrow indicates the location of the Jessica rover, topping the lip of the caldera at over 6000 meters.\n\n![4h2tAqt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4h2tAqt.jpg)\n\nThe eastern slope of the ridge just to the east of the caldera was the steepest terrain yet encountered during the drive, so Kurt took that at a shallow cross-angle to keep the rover at a safe speed.\n\n![CVL6xoY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CVL6xoY.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022You really are a very careful driver, Kurt. Thank you.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022I practice a lot.\u0022\n\nThe highlands to the east turned out to be mostly gently rolling or flattish stretches that were very easy to drive. And somewhat dull.\n\n![jk0sFBs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jk0sFBs.jpg)\n\nKurt continued driving east over the mostly unexciting terrain...because the next phase of their planned trip was to head south down from the highlands into the large basin to visit the lowest-elevation spot on Duna (blue arrow path on the map below). By driving to 50\u00B0 30\u0027 W longitude, the rover would be straight north of the low-point -- and the slope down from the highlands also happened to be less steep at that location.\n\n![ZhsCYdL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZhsCYdL.jpg)\n\nI was initially concerned about the drive downhill, because that\u0027s always more dangerous than driving uphill (it\u0027s too easy for your rover\u0027s speed to run away on you). But the drive went surprisingly well, and even on the steepest part (with a slope of about 30 degrees), the rover\u0027s speed was able to be kept in check with reverse throttle and occasional taps on the brakes. I guess Kurt really is an excellent driver.\n\n![HlTJufo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HlTJufo.jpg)\n\nThe slope leveled out to a more gradual descent below 1600 meters as the Jessica rover entered the very large basin, which Hellou named Helium Planitia after something or other in the Karter Kerman, Warlord of Mars book.\n\n![6WapQfQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6WapQfQ.jpg)\n\nThe lowest point they found was at an elevation of 124 meters above the datum, located at 5\u00B0 55\u0027 25\u0022 S latitude, 50\u00B0 33\u0027 08\u0022 W longitude. The whole area was just red sand and dust, and even the power core sampler built into the rover failed to hit the layer of sedimentary rock Hellou expected to find below the sand.\n\n![RYY2DZ4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RYY2DZ4.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022I\u0027ll run over and sample that rock, since it\u0027s the lowest rock on Duna.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022OK. Let me know if you have fun.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022I always have fun sampling rocks. Huff, huff. Umm...I keep running, and it\u0027s not getting any bigger. I guess I still can\u0027t accurately judge distances in the thin air. Huff, huff. Ooof! Nearly tripped.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Careful, Hellou.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022OK. Well. It\u0027s a big house-sized rock. Sneaky. And igneous. It must have been blasted here by some impact in the highlands. Could you please drive on over to pick me up?\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Certainly. Always a pleasure.\u0022\n\n![XEbvBPn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XEbvBPn.jpg)\n\nThe original plan was to drive back to Barsoom Base at this point...but that changed with a radio call from Thompbles.\n\nThompbles: \u0022Duna Base calling Jessica rover.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Hey there, Thompbles. Kurt here...what can I do for you?\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022We got lucky on a couple passes of the polar-orbiting BANT D6 and Fido 3. On two consecutive days they both picked up a pulse from an alien marker, so we were able to triangulate an accurate position. It\u0027s in the southeast corner of the basin you\u0027re exploring, down at thirty point three degrees south latitude and twenty-eight point eight degrees west longitude. That\u0027s quite a distance, but I wanted to give you the option of checking it out.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Ah. That\u0027s a drive...but doable. Maybe better to do it now since we\u0027re already partway there, rather than go back to base only to have to backtrack later.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022I think we should go see. The terrain is easy in the basin, so I can do part of the driving, no problem.\u0022\n\nThompbles: \u0022The brass hats at KSC are certainly interested in seeing what\u0027s there.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022OK...We\u0027ll go. But I hope we get overtime pay for this.\u0022\n\nBelow: the path from Duna Low-point to the mysterious alien marker.\n\n![tAcZO2F.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tAcZO2F.jpg)\n\nSo Kurt and Hellou headed southeast for the long drive...\n\n![YKFyAnC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YKFyAnC.jpg)\n\n;\n\n**Fido Canyon Flight**\n\nOver at Fido Canyon Base, it was time to test the effectiveness of the DunaDog at making a surface-scanning run. So far the planes have mainly been used for long, mostly straight-line flights. But their main job is supposed to be performing surface scans with their belly instruments in support of surface exploration.\n\nKelby mapped out a flight plan for Aldner to basically scan the perimeter of the end part of Fido Canyon where the base is located. Of particular interest is getting scans of the walls of the canyon (since the bottom appears to be mainly full of sediments) and some of the highland areas around the canyon. So Aldner headed out in the Aragorn toward the northeast. He\u0027d start by rovering over to the base of the canyon wall, the make his flight around the canyon\u0027s perimeter.\n\n![USAb8dT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/USAb8dT.jpg)\n\n![JyBbmn6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JyBbmn6.jpg)\n\nBelow: Located about 22 km northwest of base at an elevation of 1000 meters (before the wall starts getting steep), Aldner pointed the Aragorn northwest, mostly uphill, to start his flight. During this flight, Aldner would try to primarily use the liquid fuel engine, and not use the ion engine too much, because Xenon is in shorter supply than liquid fuel and oxidizer.\n\n![okxGXo6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/okxGXo6.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022OK, I\u0027m ready to go. And, yes, before anybody asks, the science instruments are all running.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Good. Get me some good data.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Brakes off, rear rocket engine activated, throttle one hundred percent. Slow. Slow. Come on. Forty meters per second. Fifty...the bird is up! Raising gear.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Be sure to overfly different elevations of the wall.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Climbing nicely. Lots of interesting looking rock outcroppings. Nice layered effect in these lower ones.\u0022\n\n![UFlRRyJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UFlRRyJ.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Approaching 6000 meters. Cutting back throttle to 25%...that\u0027s about the same thrust as the four ion engines give.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Data feed looks good. Angle back more to the south.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Hmmm...I can\u0027t seem to hold altitude on a quarter thrust. Probably because I\u0027m banking. I\u0027m going to have to raise the throttle to fifty percent.\u0022\n\n![33i2bYS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/33i2bYS.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Heading southwest. Fuel down to fifty-five percent.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022A sharper turn south, if you please.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022The DunaDog flies like a cow at 6000 meters. I can\u0027t turn as fast as I\u0027d like. I\u0027m going to switch over to ion engines for a while as long as I still have a good sun angle here.\u0022\n\n![x0FLdeR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/x0FLdeR.jpg)\n\n![V5VM0xe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/V5VM0xe.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Heading one ninety. The terrain ahead is higher, so I\u0027m trying to gain altitude.\u0022\n\n![cctzvY8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cctzvY8.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Nope...the terrain to the south is getting too close. I\u0027m switching on the rocket engine as well as the ions to gain more altitude.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022It\u0027s a good idea to stay above the rocks.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Doing my best. And I\u0027m starting to lose the sunlight on the solar cells. Maybe I should have done this later in the day.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022But the shadows help in the visual mapping.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022OK...ions are off...batteries got too low. I\u0027m at 7700 meters...and the plane really does not want to turn fast. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to be able to keep following the wall.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022OK. You can head over the highlands to the south and scan those.\u0022\n\n![w2vNTMQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w2vNTMQ.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022I\u0027m having to keep full throttle to maintain altitude with the bank angle. Turning is still very slow. How high are the hills here?\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022Sixty-eight hundred.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022OK...I think I\u0027ll clear them. Fuel at forty-two percent.\u0022\n\nKelby: \u0022And you\u0027re over three quarters of the way around. Looking good.\u0022\n\n![7INIFva.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7INIFva.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022...And the friendly radar altimeter is showing a lot more space below me now. I\u0027m over the tall stuff and heading back into the canyon. Fuel at thirty-four percent. I\u0027m going to cut the engines and drop to a lower altitude where I can turn sharper to head back toward base.\u0022\n\n![TF4sycA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TF4sycA.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Fuel at twenty-six percent. Hey, I\u0027ve got a nice sun angle again. I\u0027m switching off the rocket engine and activating the ions again. Lining up for landing.\u0022\n\n![fMgHuhm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fMgHuhm.jpg)\n\nAldner: \u0022Oops. Looks like I didn\u0027t need that extra ion boost...I\u0027m going to overshoot the base\u0022\n\nAdly: \u0022Better than landing on us.\u0022\n\nAldner: \u0022Pulling up to lose speed. Deploying the chutes...\u0022\n\n![CK40Gi7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CK40Gi7.jpg)\n\nAldner landed 5 km from the Fuel Station, with 18.6% of his rocket fuel and 94.4% of his Xenon remaining. He repacked the Aragorn\u0027s parachutes, then drove back for refueling at the Fuel Station, and then back to the Lander to have some lunch and an afternoon nap...two of Aldner\u0027s favorite things to do on alien worlds.\n\n![cLA74jy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cLA74jy.jpg)\n\n![dqS7UNN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dqS7UNN.jpg)\n\nAfter Kelby analyzed the DunaDog data for a couple days, the boys planned for the \u0022boots on the ground\u0022 part of the mission. Aldner would take the old Fido KD (which still seemed to be in perfect working order) and head West back along the path his DunaDog followed when it originally flew into Fido Canyon, while Kelby and Adly would take the Dune Buggy (Duna Fido 2) on an expedition to check out the surface below Aldner\u0027s more recent flight path.\n\nBelow, Aldner heads West in the Fido KD.\n\n![dYchRzU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dYchRzU.jpg)\n\n![06qzws2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/06qzws2.jpg)\n\nWhen the Fido KD made its unmanned circumnavigation of Duna, it had driven along Fido Canyon to the northeast, and eventually came back around to enter the western end of the canyon when returning to its initial landing site. At that time the canyon floor was perfectly flat, and the western wall of the canyon was a very steep incline...so I was interested to see how things look on the revamped Duna.\n\nThe canyon floor is now rolling sand dunes, and the rise at the west end of the canyon is much more gradual. The Fido KD was able to head straight west up the slope without the need for any switchback driving. At an elevation of 4000 meters, the Fido Canyon Base vehicles dipped below the horizon for the last time.\n\n![Kzu7MbE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Kzu7MbE.jpg)\n\nBy the time Aldner approached 5000 meters of elevation, the terrain had leveled off into rolling dunes, and Aldner was able to \u0022catch some air\u0022 zipping over bumps at 20 m/s. The ancient rover was perfectly stable. Of course, Aldner was a good boy and stopped regularly to take surface samples.\n\n![FuGmI20.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FuGmI20.jpg)\n\nKelby and Adly in the newer, less stable, Dune Buggy headed northeast along Aldner\u0027s path from a few days before, then turned to head back westward, slowly working their way up the canyon\u0027s north wall along the swath of land scanned during Aldner\u0027s flight.\n\n![XKCKM4X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XKCKM4X.jpg)\n\nAdly handled the driving while Kelby rode on top in the Granny Klampett chair where his geologist\u0027s eyes could spot places where interesting outcroppings of rock poked up through Duna\u0027s ubiquitous red sand and dust (which I assure you are there, even if they don\u0027t show up in the pictures). They stopped a lot more often than Aldner did for surface samples.\n\n![oT4FBZE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oT4FBZE.jpg)\n\n![rt2S8yo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rt2S8yo.jpg)\n\nWe\u0027ll leave the boys to their explorations (map below shows their current locations), so we can return to check on Hellou and Kurt\u0027s progress to the southeast corner of Helium Planitia.\n\n![qHycISA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qHycISA.jpg)\n\n;\n\n**Curiouser and Curiouser**\n\nKurt and Hellou\u0027s drive southeast across Helium Planetia was uneventful. The rover was stable enough that it could be pointed in the correct direction and left to do its thing with the throttle locked on full (which was accomplished with the help of MechJeb\u0027s Rover Autopilot). I\u0027m sure Hellou stopped often to sample the dirt...but I just let it run.\n\n![8UeMfjG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8UeMfjG.jpg)\n\nOnce the Jessica got close enough, the waypoint marker that I had set for the target loomed over the horizon (the waypoint auto guidance was not active). Drives like this won\u0027t be so simple if Squad ever implements collision meshes for the ground scatter, of course.\n\n![p3ak3Uy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/p3ak3Uy.jpg)\n\nThe anomaly is located in a finger of the Helium basin that projects off to the southeast, and as the rover got closer, highlands began to show up on either side of the rover\u0027s path.\n\n![g3Xo4HF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/g3Xo4HF.jpg)\n\n![jLrbhGz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jLrbhGz.jpg)\n\nBelow is a nighttime camping stop. Kurt and Hellou traded off each night who got to sleep in the comfy rear cabin and who had to sleep in the cockpit. I think maybe they need a little pressurized pup tent. They were far enough south that the sun was no longer eclipsed by Ike during the day.\n\n![Gl8CmLI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Gl8CmLI.jpg)\n\nBelow: With the waypoint guidance activated, MechJeb draws a yellow (maybe it\u0027s yellow...colorblind me isn\u0027t sure) line projecting to the target point, which is cool. But most anything seems cool after a long, boring drive.\n\n![QyL5Bug.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QyL5Bug.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022OK. We have arrived at the target coordinates. Do you see anything?\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Red sand. Rocks. Low hills in the distance. Anything on the radio?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022I have the frequency scanner working. Nothing on any of the bands so far. Any idea what were looking for? I was kind of hoping for something obvious like Vallhenge.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Hmm. How about running your core sampler into the dirt to see if we hit an underground chamber?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022I can do that. I can also put a sonic sensor down the hole to see if it detects anything.\u0022\n\n![XKGKIK2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XKGKIK2.jpg)\n\n![TT4Zm6P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TT4Zm6P.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022Well, we aren\u0027t finding anything.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Indeed. I guess we should start driving outward in a spiral pattern around this point to see if we can locate anything.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022We should stop and check every boulder. Maybe they have something written on them.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022You just want to sample them all.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Oops...I\u0027ve been found out.\u0022\n\nIt actually took me a while to find the target. After not seeing anything immediately, I explored around a different set of coordinate two degrees away based on numbers in the Easter Egg Stocktake thread in the KSP Forums...to no avail. So I went back to the original location and turned off surface scatter. Ah ha!\n\nHellou: \u0022Hey! I see something off the the right ahead.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022An interesting rock?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022No...something odd. Not very big.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022OK...let\u0027s go see.\u0022\n\n![SCL4OnE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SCL4OnE.jpg)\n\nKurt: \u0022Well...that\u0027s certainly not natural. A box on a pole.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Let\u0027s take a closer look.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022First I\u0027m going to plant a flag so the flag\u0027s beacon can be used to locate this beastie in the future. There we go. So what do you think?\u0022\n\n![A8L8BRs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/A8L8BRs.jpg)\n\nKurt: \u0022No markings.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022I can\u0027t hear anything with the microphone pickup pressed against it.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Hey...this black dial on the front twists. Doesn\u0027t seem to do anything. May it pulls out or pushes in...Oops.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022You broke it.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022No...it was a cap. There\u0027s a lens under it. Ummm...I can\u0027t see anything inside. The lens housing twists.\u0022\n\n![aoaBkKu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aoaBkKu.jpg)\n\nAn hour later...\n\nKurt: \u0022OK...I give up. Maybe there\u0027s more of it underground and we need to dig it out.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Hmm. I can place my subsurface sensors in holes around it, then set off a small charge to image what\u0027s down there before we dig.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Sounds good. But it\u0027s getting too late in the day for that. We can try that tomorrow.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022OK. It\u0027s my turn in the comfy cabin tonight.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022...and sitting in the cockpit for me. But first...supper!\u0022\n\n![XKgvEvS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XKgvEvS.jpg)\n\nBelow: Map View showing the location of the anomaly. (I have removed the other icons from the surface of Duna in this image, since they are all around on the other side and just confuse things.)\n\n![d631fQ3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/d631fQ3.jpg)\n\nSo Hellou and Kurt settled in for the night, with Kurt in the less-comfy rover cockpit. But he did have a nice view of the stars and Ike.\n\nKurt: \u0022What the... Hey, Hellou. Are you awake?\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Mffph? Uh..I am now. Is something wrong?\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022A light just came on in the mystery box over there. I\u0027m going out to have a look.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022A light? OK...hold on...I\u0027ve got to get suited up, then I\u0027ll come out.\u0022\n\nBelow: Kurt examines the image being projected by the alien marker.\n\n![5Wu1sA8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5Wu1sA8.jpg)\n\nKurt: \u0022Hey there, sleepyhead. The box is projecting images on the ground.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Wow. Hey, it changed!\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Yeah. It\u0027s cycling through a set of three images, about once a minute. Some sort of alien writing and diagrams. It\u0027s hard to make out on the ground.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Wait...stand over here.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Bright light!\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022No...face the other way. Hmm...the image is fuzzy.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022The lens housing twists. Maybe that focuses it.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Ah ha! You\u0027re right. Let me get some pictures. Too bad the image is distorted on the curve of your helmet. Do we have anything big and flat?\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022Ummm...I can remove the fold-down work table from the wall of the cabin.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Good idea! Go!\u0022\n\n![6QuuiTE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6QuuiTE.jpg)\n\nHellou: \u0022Good. Back up a little. Let me focus it. OK! Let me get some pictures.\u0022\n\nKurt: \u0022I feel like I\u0027m missing out on all the fun back here. Can you make out what the images mean.\u0022\n\nHellou: \u0022Well, this one looks like they are explaining their mathematical notation. Move it left two centimeters. The boys at KSC are going to love these.\u0022\n\n![UcxVzjq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UcxVzjq.jpg)\n\nBelow, for your amusement, are the three best pictures Hellou got of the projected images:\n\n![ZUjtZlz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZUjtZlz.jpg)\n\n![8hJk6Vv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8hJk6Vv.jpg)\n\n![StY1ppK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/StY1ppK.jpg)\n\nSo, after a successful night\u0027s gathering of data, Hellou and Kurt slept late the next day. Hellou\u0027s experiment with subsurface imaging showed that the mast of the device went down at least 100 meters into the ground, with no large subsurface object showing up. Before they left, Kurt wanted a picture of him standing on top of the device. He also put the lens cap back on to protect the lens from damage by dust storms.\n\n![P4MMQzG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/P4MMQzG.jpg)\n\nOur intrepid explorers headed back to the northwest for the long drive back to Barsoom Base.\n\n![MHNCbIj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MHNCbIj.jpg)\n\nI didn\u0027t have any interest in driving the rover back to base, so I set up a waypoint in MechJeb\u0027s Rover Autopilot and let it do its thing. When I came back a couple hours later, the rover was sitting motionless at the waypoint that I had set up in the mouth of Barsoom Canyon.\n\n![RmqnGk0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RmqnGk0.jpg)\n\n![iaYex1v.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iaYex1v.jpg)\n\nThen I manually drove the rover the remaining ten kilometers to Barsoom Base, where Kurt and Hellou were greeted by Emilynn and Nelemy (who had been gathering samples from the area around Barsoom Base in the meantime). Hellou was a bit grumpy until she got to take a proper shower in the Lander, but then they had a celebration party that couldn\u0027t be beat.\n\n![Uk3TlT5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Uk3TlT5.jpg)\n\nThat\u0027s it for this episode!
