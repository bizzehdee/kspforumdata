You might remember me as the author of the UKS MASEC mission logs thread that went dead a couple of years ago, but had a good run in 2013 and 2014. Life kind of intervened on me and I lost the inspiration for KSP for a long time - also, some of the mods broke on me and made the mission logs play-through difficult, and also unstable to run. I got back into playing the latest and greatest version of KSP lately and I may have the spark back again. Rather than revive that old thread (which is now locked) I\u0027ve been contemplating a reboot of UKS MASEC - basically starting over from the beginning, although this time with fewer mods and rather than following the same progression, there\u0027d be a few things I do differently this time around (more emphasis on unmanned stuff up-front instead of launching straight into a manned orbital flight, introducing planes and space stations earlier, etc). But it would probably still be a sandbox game with an underlying written story and a heavy emphasis on eventually getting to Laythe and the rest of the Jool system.\u00A0I am something of an amateur writer and this was a great outlet for it, and I may borrow things like the mission flags and presistent crew roster and stuff from the original thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust trying to gauge interest. There are a few core mods I want to use that I do not believe are fully updated to the newest version (I have to check of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is functional and there was that modular rover you could have the Kerbals assemble on the spot, etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketMan-Explorer","CreatedById":177587,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-11T02:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, @Cashen.
