She fails to grasp some of the fundamentals of flying where there is no air.

Nothing worked. It was Jonnie, our chief test pilot, of all people, who provided the solution. Looking at the design he simply wondered why we didn\u0027t push it to space with a large rocket, then detach said rocket from the rover\u0027s tail and park it back on top to drop the whole package onto the Moon. A single stage would provide Trans Lunar Injection, capture to orbit and powered descent. Elegantly simple.

It also had to be able to move around the lunar surface on wheels, as we were not yet sure we could make pin-point precision landings (in fact, we were pretty sure we couldn\u0027t). Oh, and it would have to be able to lift large, bulky payloads and be able to deposit them gently onto the Moon\u0027s surface into a vertical position (for base modules) or horizontally (for the exploration rover).

My conclusion was that such a vehicle was quite possible, as long as you did away with the ability to take-off vertically. The LV-909 was fine as a descent engine, but no-one could fit it into a sky-crane shape that would allow a wide selection of payloads to be carried.

The command module had been launched into lunar orbit with a couple of powerful omni antennae to provide a downlink to our tracking stations on Earth. These antennae had remained deployed until the batteries of the module \u2013 lacking any power generation of its own \u2013 had died. And so they remained transfixed in this position, protruding from the upper end of the module and obstructing access to the docking port that was supposed to allow \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E to pluck it from space and stow it in her cargo bay for the journey down to the Moon\u0027s surface.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EI was about to suggest that Catbeth could perform an EVA to retract the antennae manually, but then I remembered that, in order to comply with the draconian weight restrictions of such a vessel, \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E was not equipped with an EVA fuel tank to supply Cat\u0027s KMU, and it would be impossible for her to spacewalk across to the payload to carry out the operation.

The module contained the remote command station that would eventually allow us to operate \u003Cem\u003EPadirac\u003C/em\u003E and our other vehicles from the safety of our base. It was therefore vital for the future of Drygalski Base. Before I could think of something useful to answer, Cat said \u201COK, main engine off. Auxiliary thrusters on line.

At this point, one more insanely reckless procedure wouldn\u0027t make much of a difference... Catbeth was accomplishing firsts with each passing minute.

If Cat opened up carefully, the module might just settle to the back of the bay and stay there.

We were naturally forced to vent this natural gas boil off to avoid our tank exploding. Slowly but surely our fuel was leaking away into space, at the rate of a few litres per hour. This was not enough to leave us stranded over the one month duration of our mission, but it was enough to make a two year mission to the red planet unfeasible. We would have to find some other way to power out return from Mars, and I assume that this is what my colleagues back at the Space Centre have been working on in my absence.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LxYoHk1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LxYoHk1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EAnyway, back to the task at hand. We will set out from Drygalski base in a few days, when the late summer sun comes up above the horizon and allows us to see where we are driving. After scooting around the crater in the Arcambal Exploration Rover a few times, I can say it is pretty fun to drive, and after spending too many days mining water here, I\u0027m looking forward to seeing some new landscape.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EIn the mean time, tomorrow we are going to attempt to right our lander with the first idea I came up with.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EYEAR 6, DAY 76.

She then activated the auxiliary engines to lift \u003Cem\u003ELentillac\u003C/em\u003E into the air and moved slowly forwards until she was directly above the lander, before putting it down gently on the shuttle\u0027s landing legs.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OQxRvxw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OQxRvxw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EI\u0027d followed the shuttle in the rover, parking it at a safe distance, and suited up to inspect the lander. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t drill through the top of the fuel tank bulkhead or I would have been greeted by a spray of highly toxic and corrosive hypergolic fuel, and that would have instantly ruined our plans to return to Earth any time in the immediate future. However, there was a spot just to the side of the top end of the tank where I knew I could attach the socket without compromising the hull\u0027s integrity. I grabbed my toolkit from \u003Cem\u003EPadirac\u003C/em\u003E and got to work.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EIt took me just a few minutes to get the plug in place, and I managed not to pierce the tank in the process. Cat released the winch, and I snapped the cable\u0027s attachment point into the awaiting socket. I asked her to set the winch retraction rate to its lowest possible value in order to lift the lander very gently, then I stepped well back to what I assumed was a safe distance, and told her to start reeling the cable in.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EOne the slack had been taken in, the upper end of the lander began to rise out of the lunar dust inch by inch. It tipped up very slowly towards an upright position, and was at one point, almost resting on the bottom docking port beneath the pilot\u0027s capsule. My hopes were raised. Then, because I hadn\u0027t been able to attach my socket to the very top of the lander, the whole vehicle, now unweighted, shifted round it\u0027s centre of balance and was once more leaning at a precarious angle in the opposite direction.

But each time we lifted it, it would pitch round and settle on its other side. I even tried deploying one, then several of the lander\u0027s legs to try and stabilize it, but nothing worked. Karanda had somehow managed to design a vehicle that resists staying upright with fanatical resolve.
