I\u0027d periodically get some reception and I thought it was nice people were equally enthused by my mission as I was. Eventually, the developers of KSP hosted a little interactive thing with an engineer who worked on the International Space Station, members of the subreddit and followers of KSP twitter could submit images of their space station to be selected by the KSP devs and then commented on by the NASA engineer. Somewhat accidentally I had posted an image to the KSP subreddit of STS-133 during the selection period, with the following picture:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/yr9laj5h6pv51.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=233132be590afaa98b2554076073ccdcdde8f46d\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r/KerbalSpaceProgram - STS-133, the Final Flight of Discovery\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/yr9laj5h6pv51.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=233132be590afaa98b2554076073ccdcdde8f46d\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was actually an album of 5 images but that\u0027s neither here nor there. This was really cool to me! A developer of KSP had thought that my silliness was worth showing to NASA engineers, and they seemed to like my work! This was November 2nd of 2020, or around there, and at this point I was considering joining the forums with a series surrounding the space shuttle and after following \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/154577-jay-the-amazing-toaster/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154577\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/154577-jay-the-amazing-toaster/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Jay The Amazing Toaster\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s Kanaawai Ares to Mars thread I knew how I\u0027d want it to look. \u00A0And in March of 2021 I would, Shuttle Adventures was born. At this point I was a sophomore in high school during quarantine so nothing much was going on and I had all the time in the world. \u00A0And I did what I loved and that was play KSP (I did in fact keep up with school and friends and whatnot but thats not important to the story).

I\u0027d spend evenings looking over documents relevant to missions and planning them out to look as authentic as possible. I fiddled with TUFX (and KS3P gosh it\u0027s been a while since that was around) trying to make the pictures look beautiful (KSP screenshots actually got me into photography so thats neat).

I wanted to document every module, every launch, every crew rotation, every space walk, so it would be a 100% accurate rendition of the ISS in KSP and Lemon Cup was on board. So we got to work, we\u0027d flesh out the station in a join save file we\u0027d pass around and look at the history of the launches and recreate them. It was awesome. July was an awesome time for me to be playing KSP because I had so many missions to do.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cavTWm4.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cavTWm4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cavTWm4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also if anybody knows how to get the clouds to look like that please tell me every other time I\u0027ve tried to recreate that terminator I\u0027ve failed and its caused me much grief.

I couldn\u0027t afford to work on this project as much as I used to because of school returning to in person. In addition, I became more and more obsessive with the missions and they became increasingly complex as the nature of assembling an orbital laboratory would suggest. I insisted on not compromising on this (specifically Canadarm work god that was a pain) and eventually something that had not occurred in my 5 years of KSP began to manifest: burnout. I wouldn\u0027t really want to work on it and school had become quite oppressive. Lots of work and important tests had led to me being \u00A0drained and not wanting to do research on space missions. I still followed the forums seeing what had gone on while I had grinded away with academics but work on the project was not really happening. We had all gotten busy and it was no longer really. practical work on it. Eventually when I entered my senior year I thought I could work on this again a lot more but I had a lot of work to do with college prep and a rather difficult roster of classes to keep up with (more than I had dealt with in the past that\u0027s for sure) so that was out of the question (P.S. I don\u2019t want this to sound like oh boo hoo whoa is me, I was goober who wanted to sign up for hard classes and I knew what I was doing). I made a couple of posts here and there about ideas I wanted to do but I never really got around to them. School ramped up all the way until May after which I graduated, and prepared for college over this very summer. Eventually I was A) not burnt out and B) Had Free Time! and that leads me to today, I will go off to college soon and I\u0027m not in a position to bring my machine that I use to play KSP with me at this time (nor should I because this is an important time) so this will likely be the final post for a while here by me, which brings me to a point that I\u0027d like to invite people to contribute to this thread.

I\u0027d periodically get some reception and I thought it was nice people were equally enthused by my mission as I was. Eventually, the developers of KSP hosted a little interactive thing with an engineer who worked on the International Space Station, members of the subreddit and followers of KSP twitter could submit images of their space station to be selected by the KSP devs and then commented on by the NASA engineer. Somewhat accidentally I had posted an image to the KSP subreddit of STS-133 during the selection period, with the following picture:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/yr9laj5h6pv51.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=233132be590afaa98b2554076073ccdcdde8f46d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r/KerbalSpaceProgram - STS-133, the Final Flight of Discovery\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/yr9laj5h6pv51.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=233132be590afaa98b2554076073ccdcdde8f46d\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was actually an album of 5 images but that\u0027s neither here nor there.

I couldn\u0027t afford to work on this project as much as I used to because of school returning to in person. In addition, I became more and more obsessive with the missions and they became increasingly complex as the nature of assembling an orbital laboratory would suggest. I insisted on not compromising on this (specifically Canadarm work god that was a pain) and eventually something that had not occurred in my 5 years of KSP began to manifest: burnout. I wouldn\u0027t really want to work on it and school had become quite oppressive. Lots of work and important tests had led to me being \u00A0drained and not wanting to do research on space missions. I still followed the forums seeing what had gone on while I had grinded away with academics but work on the project was not really happening. We had all gotten busy and it was no longer really. practical work on it. Eventually when I entered my senior year I thought I could work on this again a lot more but I had a lot of work to do with college prep and a rather difficult roster of classes to keep up with (more than I had dealt with in the past that\u0027s for sure) so that was out of the question (P.S. I don\u2019t want this to sound like oh boo hoo whoa is me, I was goober who wanted to sign up for hard classes and I knew what I was doing). I made a couple of posts here and there about ideas I wanted to do but I never really got around to them. School ramped up all the way until May after which I graduated, and prepared for college over this very summer. Eventually I was A) not burnt out and B) Had Free Time! and that leads me to today, I will go off to college soon and I\u0027m not in a position to bring my machine that I use to play KSP with me at this time (nor should I because this is an important time) so this will likely be the final post for a while here by me, which brings me to a point that I\u0027d like to invite people to contribute to this thread.

Eventually, the developers of KSP hosted a little interactive thing with an engineer who worked on the International Space Station, members of the subreddit and followers of KSP twitter could submit images of their space station to be selected by the KSP devs and then commented on by the NASA engineer. Somewhat accidentally I had posted an image to the KSP subreddit of STS-133 during the selection period, with the following picture:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/yr9laj5h6pv51.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=233132be590afaa98b2554076073ccdcdde8f46d\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r/KerbalSpaceProgram - STS-133, the Final Flight of Discovery\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://preview.redd.it/yr9laj5h6pv51.png?width=2560\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=233132be590afaa98b2554076073ccdcdde8f46d\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was actually an album of 5 images but that\u0027s neither here nor there.

I fiddled with TUFX (and KS3P gosh it\u0027s been a while since that was around) trying to make the pictures look beautiful (KSP screenshots actually got me into photography so thats neat).

I wanted to document every module, every launch, every crew rotation, every space walk, so it would be a 100% accurate rendition of the ISS in KSP and Lemon Cup was on board. So we got to work, we\u0027d flesh out the station in a join save file we\u0027d pass around and look at the history of the launches and recreate them. It was awesome.

I couldn\u0027t afford to work on this project as much as I used to because of school returning to in person. In addition, I became more and more obsessive with the missions and they became increasingly complex as the nature of assembling an orbital laboratory would suggest. I insisted on not compromising on this (specifically Canadarm work god that was a pain) and eventually something that had not occurred in my 5 years of KSP began to manifest: burnout. I wouldn\u0027t really want to work on it and school had become quite oppressive. Lots of work and important tests had led to me being \u00A0drained and not wanting to do research on space missions. I still followed the forums seeing what had gone on while I had grinded away with academics but work on the project was not really happening. We had all gotten busy and it was no longer really. practical work on it. Eventually when I entered my senior year I thought I could work on this again a lot more but I had a lot of work to do with college prep and a rather difficult roster of classes to keep up with (more than I had dealt with in the past that\u0027s for sure) so that was out of the question (P.S. I don\u2019t want this to sound like oh boo hoo whoa is me, I was goober who wanted to sign up for hard classes and I knew what I was doing). I made a couple of posts here and there about ideas I wanted to do but I never really got around to them. School ramped up all the way until May after which I graduated, and prepared for college over this very summer. Eventually I was A) not burnt out and B) Had Free Time! and that leads me to today, I will go off to college soon and I\u0027m not in a position to bring my machine that I use to play KSP with me at this time (nor should I because this is an important time) so this will likely be the final post for a while here by me, which brings me to a point that I\u0027d like to invite people to contribute to this thread.
