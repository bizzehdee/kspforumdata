The planet is the same size as Kerbin, but pretty much everything else is bigger or more complicated in this modpack. To up the game a little more I\u0027m also using remote tech in this game (because I wanted to know how it works in conjunction with KSP\u0027s own kerbnet) and the engineering tech tree. I will also have to pay for the research cost of every part I want to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8awUbaKgoY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this first episode I fight a bit with the mods until I make them work. I then proceed with a few launches to fulfill contracts to proceed from out starting tech. Turn out one can make a Stayaputnik go surprisingly far, while only using Sepratrons - our only available forms of control and propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody6","CreatedById":155206,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-23T13:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a gift at the end of the year I present you episode 2!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy skills have apparently become quite rusty which causes quite a few mishaps and explosions.
