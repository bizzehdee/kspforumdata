It is just awesome, end of story. So naturally with a space sim, the first thing I wanted to do was a space shuttle. Nevertheless the actual designing of one eluded me for some time, until I saw some of Scott Manley\u0027s videos and decided it was time to try. What followed undoubtedly destroyed more expensive rockets and killed more Kerbal test-pilots than a century of normal rocket flight would have. I have permadeath enabled and so many were killed, that the name generator is just cycling through the used ones-4 Chads died in the making of this shuttle, as did 3 Tomvins. I have scenes in my head where the Kerbal press interviews the program director after the most recent crash and asks why they continue, to which the response is, BECAUSE IT\u0027S AWESOME. Mods used include B9 aerospace because it looks so pretty, and after a while the shuttle engines mod because I was slowly losing my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may have gathered things got off to a rocky start, the initial designs suffered from all kinds of problems; including most often spinning uncontrollably, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cyXJc73.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cyXJc73.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand failing to or knocking of parts on take-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aBXmiYK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aBXmiYK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone made it far. Most often when the time came to separate the solid boosters, the balance would go and she would spin out. Or if they got beyond that stage, as the fuel tank emptied they lose their balance. The shuttle also went through many redesigns, from flying like a brick, to being absolutely brilliant gliders, such as the Artemis (all names are just randomly selected from what pops into my head). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SXaBPay.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SXaBPay.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe flew brilliantly and as a result was one of the few designs I stuck with for a while, but I could never get her into space. She also had a tendency to tear off the tail section on every landing and I mean all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2KwMTr2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222KwMTr2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this time I had lost patience and downloaded the shuttle engines mod in order to get engines with a wider vectoring range. They also came with some very thematic fuel tanks. It was at this time I also came to the conclusion that doing this in career mode without many parts wasn\u0027t necessarily wise, but I soldiered on. The trial and error design method eventually culminated in Invictus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gMmjn91.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gMmjn91.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter so much failure, I was jubilant in my success. Although success is a loose term. That cargo bay is mostly for show, as she can only lift about 2.3-3 tonnes. So I\u0027ve been using it to launch ion probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N1tfLaJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022N1tfLaJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther variants on the design include Delphi, with a six kerbal crew tank, which is perhaps lighter then it should be, and she can make a higher orbit than Invictus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SAXDePO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SAXDePO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course launch is just one part of the puzzle. Landing is a whole other thing and on Invictus\u0027 second flight it was made even more challenging after she broke off part of the left wing when separating the solids on launch. This twinned with my inability to predict even approximately with any certainty where I will be after an aerobrake meant I was headed for the drink.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aqAJQWV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aqAJQWV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZcMegOB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZcMegOB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInvictus\u0027s decent glide characteristics saved her crew as she came in to ditch at just 30m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is that. I\u0027m immensely proud of myself, despite these shuttles having little practical use (although Delphi may come in handy for stations and crew transport). I like to set myself challenges while playing KSP and this certainly was one, though I may have copped out a little with the shuttle engines pack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A5ItmYl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A5ItmYl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T11:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice! Shuttles really don\u0027t have much for practicality in cargo transport at that size unless you are using them to put up a remotetech 2 relay system or crew transport. Though a cleverly designed Munar or Minmus lander could easily fit in there and go to space. When you get to the HL fuselages (and, to a lesser extent, the S2 widebody), shuttles get very practical. I can fit a full size kethane lander (2.5m center, minimum radial mounting) with two side-fitted engine pods (1.25m) in there and can then take that to the Mun with a moderate transfer stage. The HL fuselages are big enough for some radial attachment too and is what I use to haul up my station modules and service craft. The plain S2 there is also great for crew transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T22:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat shuttle man! I will propose a couple of changes to get more out of your shuttle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Reduce the number of SSMEs. You don\u0027t need quite that much thrust and you are carrying an extra 12t or so to orbit. This significantly limits payload capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Retool the lift system. I will need more pictures but it looks like you are carrying too much liquid fuel and would benefit from two high-thrust solids instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yea, as Captain Sierra said, that smallest cargo bay is only useful for satellites and the like. I personally use the S2 Widebody cargo bay for my larger shuttle. It can carry 2.5m payloads with unorthodox shapes and can fit a robotic arm or other supplies as well. Hope this helps, and happy shuttling!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cakeofruit","CreatedById":73238,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T11:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrapness could you share your craft ?
