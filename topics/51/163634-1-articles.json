Gene was getting his coffee from his office vending-machine, Jeb was getting yelled at by the Tower staff for buzzing it yet again on a test flight, the engineers and construction workers were building another rocket, and then, an ear-splitting roar from overhead. \u0027Jeb\u0027s not up there, so who could be flying around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u0027 an engineer said after hearing the noise. A quiet whistling sound, followed by\u00A0a massive wave of noise filled the air. Alarms started going off, and an announcer kept saying \u0027This is not a drill!

Looking around, he saw that he was at an airbase. Rows and rows of aircraft were in hangars, and he could see tanks, jeeps, and other vehicles moving about as well. A military instructor appeared, and directed the hordes of Kerbals, many still shocked and worried, to a large building. Jeb followed, and was directed to the main hall. A Kerbal took to the stage, and started speaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Greetings. I am General Katphe Kerman, or just Kat for short. Some time ago, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and almost the whole of the continent, were attacked by the UKSE, or United Kerbal Star Empire. We do not know why we were attacked. For your safety, you have all been evacuated to the main airbase of the Kerbin Defence Force. Many of you wouldn\u0027t have heard of this location before, as it was renamed \u0027\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E 2\u0027 for security purposes. From this base you will be housed in accommodation next to the airbase, and, if you have the skills or training, will be instructed to work on the site. If you want to take back the continent, and then ultimately Kerbin, this is your chance.

Once inside, he met with some other Kerbals, who were also looking confused as to why they were also told to meet here. A Kerbal dressed in a military jumpsuit entered the room, and told them all to sit down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027You\u0027re probably wondering why you\u0027re all here. I\u0027m going to tell you, so listen up\u0027 he said, as he pinned a map\u00A0up on the wall.\u00A0\u0027You\u0027ve been picked for a special mission, the first strike on the UKSE. You\u0027ll be flying two bombers to a designated target, hitting it, and returning home. Pretty simple\u0027 Jeb thought that it was easy. He knew how to fly, and all he needed to do was open the bomb bay, press a button, and things go boom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027But, that\u0027s not all. Your target, an island that we believe is being used as a staging zone for the invasion of the Pegasus Peninsula, is heavily defended. You know how I said two bombers? One will bomb the target, and the other will carry an assault vehicle. The one carrying the vehicle will land on the island, but far away from the base, and, once nearing the base, will take out the defences. Once they\u0027ve done that, you\u0027ll bomb it\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey then left the building, and went to the hangar. Having been briefed on the mission, and been allocated in teams, they were taxied onto the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-24T05:25:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2017 05:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The_Cat_In_Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-02T03:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread closed by \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
