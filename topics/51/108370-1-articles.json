If you notice the \u0022H\u0022 for hyperedit in the corner, it\u0027s because I was using it to test my rover on Pol. I didn\u0027t want to have to fly all the way there only to realize I\u0027d forgotten a crucial part, or that my wheels were too far from the CoM, or something. Even so, I haven\u0027t fully tested this iteration of *Noether\u0027s Revenge*.\n\n* * *\n[TABLE=width: 350]\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Mass[/TD]\n\n[TD]1.0813636\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^19^ kg (2/10,000 of Kerbin)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Joolean Periapsis[/TD]\n\n[TD]210,624,206 m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Joolean Apoapsis[/TD]\n\n[TD]149,155,794 m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Eccentricity[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.17[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Inclination[/TD]\n\n[TD]4.25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Equatorial Radius[/TD]\n\n[TD]44,000 m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Circumference[/TD]\n\n[TD]276,460.2 m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Max Elevation[/TD]\n\n[TD]5590.2m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Lowest Elevation[/TD]\n\n[TD]782.5m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n^Information from^[*^KSP Wiki^*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page)^and^[*^KerbalMaps^*](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/?body=Pol)\n\n* * *\n\nSo far, I\u0027ve made a rover called *Noether\u0027s Revenge* (so titled because [Noether\u0027s Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem) is my favorite theorem, and, let\u0027s face it, every mathematician needs [a tale of revenge](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/revenge.html)).\n\nIt\u0027s got six wheels, eight RTG\u0027s, some batteries, a command pod, struts, and some emergency RCS for the inevitable 3km-long jump because of Pol\u0027s low gravity (and my proclivity for shaking things up when I get bored). Note that there\u0027s only four RCS ports; not enough thrust to actually lift the thing into the (air). \n\nI\u0027ve also made a lifter that should be able to get the darned thing to Pol. Because the challenge rules were all, \u0022No, no, this is about the HARD way.\u0022 and I was all, \u0022How hard, exactly?\u0022 and they were like, \u0022HARD. The HARD way.\u0022 So I said, \u0022Fine, screw it.\u0022 I call it the *KSS Valentina* because, well, screw Jebediah. [Valentina\u0027s way cooler.](https://i.imgflip.com/hwyd3.jpg) And obviously more attractive.\n\nI started out with some careful delta v calculations. I knew I needed around 8770 delta v to get to Pol from Kerbin\u0027s surface, assuming I have to make the maximum plane changes on the way there. \n\n[TABLE=class: grid, width: 500, align: left]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Stage**[/TD]\n\n[TD]**Mass**[/TD]\n\n[TD]**TWR**[/TD]\n\n[TD]**Delta-V**[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Pol[/TD]\n\n[TD]12.3[/TD]\n\n[TD]8.72[/TD]\n\n[TD]1085[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Interplanetary[/TD]\n\n[TD]29.7[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.21[/TD]\n\n[TD]3736[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Kerbin[/TD]\n\n[TD]104.5[/TD]\n\n[TD]1.66[/TD]\n\n[TD]3208[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Boosters[/TD]\n\n[TD]Lots[/TD]\n\n[TD]Hopefully \u003E1[/TD]\n\n[TD]No idea[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nThese, obviously, quickly dissolved at the Kerbin stage. I an idea on how to get 3000 delta-v on at least 30t of payload, but these darned newly rebalanced engines tripped me up. It\u0027s like I haven\u0027t even played this game for 666 hours anymore. Anyway, I finally decided to just send up the upper stages completely empty of fuel. That helped, and I ended up with 3208 delta-v. But then the boosters caused me problems. Finally, I just strapped on some of the newer 5m parts and the Apollo-inspired \u0022really freaking huge engines\u0022 on top of my original four boosters.\n\nI have no idea if the *Valentina* can even **get** to orbit, let alone do it safely. It probably can. But I do know it can get to Pol. Once it\u0027s refueled. It\u0027ll just take for-freaking-ever because Nuclear engines have a horrendous burn time. Really, I hate using them, especially since I only have one on my interplanetary stage. I\u0027m an impatient person. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/2CG9d)\n\n[not pictured: the previous iterations, lacking the large spaceplane fins, flipping over in-atmo.]\n\nThank God, the *Valentina* made it to orbit. Holding (mostly) at (sort-of) 82,000m altitude, the next task was refueling it building a refueling craft calculating how much fuel I needed to lug up there. The *Valentina* has 3\\*5=15 jet fuel tanks. That means that, at 0.75t or 150u liq.f., we need to get 11.25t or 2250u of the stuff into orbit. On top of that, she\u0027s got three monoprop cylindrified\u0027s, three monoprop R25\u0027s, and a command pod. So that\u0027s 3\\*0.6[150]\u002B3\\*1[250]\u002B.06[15]= 1.8[450]\u002B3[750]\u002B.06[15]=5.4t 1215u of monopropellant.\n\nIn total, then, I need to haul 16.65t of fuel into orbit.\n\nTo accomplish this, I built the *KSS Jebediah*, following the Kerbal Way of MOAR BOOSTERS, MOAR FUEL, MOAR EXPLOSIVES. This behemoth, weighing in at 461.2 tons, is quite capable of getting said fuel into orbit.\n\n[not pictured: the *Jebediah*, because my function keys stopped working at this point for some reason. I\u0027ll get you some pictures later, at not-four-AM.]\n\nThe launch proceeded perfectly.\n\nShortly I had docked.\n\nNot so shortly afterward (WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FUEL TANKS. WHY.), I\u0027d refueled the *Valentina.*\n\n**Next:** Getting to Pol.\n\n* * *\n\n***Edit:*** Oh, drat. I just realized - Valentina Kerman\u0027s a pilot.

That solution comes in the form of the *Jump Cannon,* named after both its hilariously diminuitive size and [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon), who actually spent the time to do the detail work and catalog a whole bunch of stars. At its core, the *Jump Cannon* is just a grabbing unit strapped to some monopropellant engines and an external command seat. I was very pleased. Bill, however, was... not ecstatic when he learned that he\u0027d have to ride to Jool on the outside.\n\nThis wasn\u0027t my first solution. My first solution was to launch a *KSS Valentina II* with an external command seat on top of the *Noether\u0027s Revenge*. The problem was that Bill wasn\u0027t a pilot. With Valentina and Jebediah in space and only one pod and parachute capable of getting down, I\u0027d have to do a complicated shuffling of personnel and spacecraft to get both Bill and Valentina on the *Noether\u0027s Revenge II*. Then I remembered about the grabbing claw unit, and figured, hey, why not?\n\nAnyway, I did the math, and not only should I still have enough delta-v to get the *Jump Cannon* and *Noether\u0027s Revenge* to Pol, but the *Jump Cannon* will have enough delta-v to do some scouting and act as a beacon/waypoint. \n\nThat\u0027ll be especially handy, because I want to visit all the cool features of Pol. I\u0027d been there once before.\\* I definitely want to visit the mountains, those can get pretty high, and there\u0027s lowlands and I think a space krak---. Hold on a moment.\n\nI\u0027ve been thinking of [Bop](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Bop#Topography) this whole time.\n\nHmm.\\*\\*\n\nWell, my former calculations are correct; I used Pol\u0027s values to make them. And I did *say* I was going to circumnavigate Pol. Alright, let\u0027s do it. Cheeseball, you shall be mine!\n\nRight, so, minor diversion aside, the launch of the *Jump Cannon* proceeded normally. The most interesting part was attaching the thing to a craft; not only could Bill not ride it up without a complicated ladder system, but I couldn\u0027t attach a decoupler to the bottom or top. So I had to do a strange off-centered solution. But eventually the *Jump Cannon* rendevouzed with the *KSS Valentina*, and after some orbital ballet, I managed to get the thing more-or-less perched on *Noether\u0027s Revenge\u0027s* top. Or the *KSS*  *Valentina\u0027s* nose; however you prefer to look at it.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/4PIdO)\n\nOnce I finally get to Pol, here\u0027s my planned route:\n\n![9ZoO1C8.png](http://i.imgur.com/9ZoO1C8.png)\n\n^via^[^http://www.kerbalmaps.com/?body=Pol^](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/?body=Pol)\n\nIt takes me through the most interesting variety of terrain available; I hit the high point, the low point, a ring of mountains, and some of the crumbly cheese pollen bits between.\n\nThus prepared, I launched the *KSS Valentina* from orbit. First, I deorbited the *KSS Jebediah,* and safely landed him back on Kerbin. Then I got the *KSS Valentina* clear of Kerbin\u0027s SoI, mostly to avoid the annoyance of timewarping to a transfer window at KSC. Given when Joolean transfer windows happen, I figure it\u0027ll be a while before I actually hit one.\n\nLooking at the map, I only have to wait half a Kerbal year; much better than my usual two years or so. Everything was going smoothly until I tried activating the nuclear engine. It was then that I realized I\u0027d forgotten a critical component: One fuel line. The structural piece that goes from three fuel tanks to one fuel tank *doesn\u0027t transmit fuel*, of all the completely ridiculous-! The *KSS Valentina* was dead in the water, far from Kerbin, in the middle of the ideal burn window. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/2D2ig)\n\nI\u0027ve got three options at this point. One, use hyperedit to cheat my way to Pol. I mean, I know this craft can make it. But that\u0027s just so... cheaty. Two, learn how to edit part config files so that fuel can flow through that twice-blasted connector. I think that\u0027s an acceptable cheat. The craft works, it\u0027s just the stupid miserable fuel line that\u0027s missing. Three, rebuild, rescue Valentina and Bill, and relaunch. No cheats. But it\u0027d involve a solar rendevouz, which would take... forever. And, as I\u0027ve mentioned at one point, I\u0027m impatient. No, I think I\u0027ll try my hand at editing the part file. After all, how hard could it be?\n\nIt came down to a little line that reads, \u0022NoCrossFeedNodeKey = bottom\u0022. Apparantly, the stack tricoupler *could* have fuel crossfeed. But it only accepts fuel from the top. The documentation read something about this being a vital fix to prevent fuel imbalances or something, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be fine.\n\nI\u0027ve said how much I hate nuke engines before, right? Well, if I haven\u0027t, let me reiterate that. I hate nuke engines. Yes, their Isp is glorious, but the things are slower than throwing rocks out the window. On top of that, the fuel was only being pulled from one tank. Then parts started overheating, and my 20-minute burn (realtime 20 minutes, mind you) turned into a 40-minute one, because I had to shut down the engine to cool everything off. Of course, by then my trajectory was off, so I had to fix that. Then, with the new burn, fuel mysteriously was being pulled from two of three tanks, which made even less sense than only being pulled from one. In the end, I had to babysit the thing, transferring fuel as I burned to keep the CoM centered. Even after all that, my final trajectory is doing that wonderful thing where it flickers in and out of existence because of rounding errors. I\u0027m either going to miss Jool entirely, aerobrake at 180,000 m (no idea if that\u0027s going to be a useful altitude), or crash into the planet. Guess I\u0027ll find out soon.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/xxiTt)\n\nOh. Okay then. Aerobraking is out. Bill died immediately, which I guess I should\u0027ve seen coming. Then the wheels popped off, and that\u0027s a mission scrub if I\u0027ve ever seen one. Time for some more slow-as-ants nuke engine maneuvering. After five more maneuvers and a couple of quick loads (apparantly getting within 300,000m of Jool meant my craft was forevermore \u0022under acceleration\u0022, thereby preventing time acceleration, or leaving the game without losing my progress), I finally have a stable \u0022Pol\u0022-ar orbit.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/U3lxW)\n\nPol! At last! I never thought it\u0027d take so long to reach you!\n\nTo get here, I had to dump my nuke stage. Now the *KSS Valentina* is barely different than the *Noether\u0027s Revenge*, so I went ahead and renamed it. I hope I have enough fuel to land. I should, but it\u0027s still nervewracking. The harder part will be correlating my map with the actual terrain to land in mostly the right place. Or at least somewhere close enough that I can navigate to my path.\n\n![b54wzqh.png](http://i.imgur.com/b54wzqh.png)\n\nI think I found the right mountain ring. Unfortunately, it was about to be on the night side. Even so, the landing went very smoothly. I even ended up with extra RCS fuel, which I ditched. The fuel promptly slid down Twilight Ridge, which is what I decided this place would be called.\n\nSurrounded on all sides by strange cairns of pointy stones, Bill managed to (somehow) beat Valentina out of *Noether\u0027s Revenge* to plant a flag. They took a couple of nice pictures for the annals of history before boarding again. Jool was, cooperatively, in the sky, so the pictures were very good. Bill loaded up on snacks and fuel before re-embarking his command seat on the *Jump Cannon*.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

First, I love Kerbal Space Program. But, if you\u0027re not careful, you can fall into the trap of only playing for the orbital mechanics. Planets are just points. Who cares what\u0027s on them? So often, Kerbin just becomes either \u0022green field\u0022 or \u0022ocean\u0022. Duna is just \u0022red desert\u0022. The Mun is \u0022middle of a crater\u0022. And that\u0027s *boring*. The planets and moons in this game are so much more diverse than we give them credit for, and you can only really see that diversity if you go overland; if you drive them. Second, rovers are next to completely useless in this game (especially on airless rocks where rockets are just... *better*), and I\u0027ve got a strange drive to always try things that seem completely useless. Maybe it\u0027s just to confirm that they really are useless. Or maybe it\u0027s to try and find a use for them. Third and finally, even if you do like rovers, you aren\u0027t likely to use them on a low-gravity planet because they\u0027re \u0022impossible to drive\u0022. I contend that they\u0027re not. I also contend that they\u0027re perfectly easy to control, so long as you\u0027ve got a wide wheel base and low CoM. \nAs far as why pick Pol, I\u0027ll hazard that Pol is the least interesting body in the Kerbol system. It\u0027s not the smallest, it\u0027s hard to get to, there\u0027s no anomalies, the terrain is annoying but not particularly interesting, and it\u0027s just not... cool. I\u0027d like to try and prove myself wrong.\n\n* * *\n\nFirst thing to do would be to figure out where I need to go. If I am where I think I am, I should go south to the lowest point on Pol. Probably a bit South-Southeast. So, I--wait, where\u0027s the flag?\n\nValentina couldn\u0027t find it. She\u0027d just planted the thing not five minutes ago and now it had disappeared completely. Even Bill couldn\u0027t find it from his external seat.\n\n![lFwWMve.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/lFwWMve.jpg?1)\n\nTurns out it\u0027s 600m above the surface. With the discarded \u0022spare\u0022 fuel tank. Oh, and somehow, it\u0027s daylight now. Bill chalked it up to eddies in the spacetime continuum. I think it\u0027s something to do with loading a save file on Pol\u0027s notoriously bumpy tiny surface, but I\u0027m no astro-engineer.\n\nWeirdness now safely explained, I started off down Twilight Ridge, moving South-Southeast.\n\nAlready I encountered a problem. With *Jump Cannon* jammed on top of *Noether\u0027s Revenge*, the CoM shifted upward enough for the rover to want to wheelie. But it\u0027s still quite manageable with SAS on. I set off down Twilight Ridge at a good clip, and then bounced. I landed fine, though; the tires can take it. \n\nBut I bounced again. \n\nAnd again.\n\nAt one point, I hit the ground too hard, and a tire broke. Of course, however, I\u0027d bounced into the air again. Problem being that if one tire broke with the previous bounce, presumably, more tires were going to break with the next impact. It looked like it was going to be a particularly long bounce this time, so Bill did what he came to do: repair some tires. In mid-air.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Gc3RN)\n\nAs I predicted, once I\u0027d landed that bounce, even more tires broke. But this would be okay; as long as I fixed the tires before the craft hit the ground, I could maintain control. Bill got to work again.\n\nThis time, however, Bill couldn\u0027t get back onto *Jump Cannon* before *Noether\u0027s Revenge* bounced. Bill hurriedly used his jetpack to arc skyward again, but *Noether\u0027s Revenge* was spiralling out of control rather badly. If it landed on anything but its wheels, it\u0027d be a mission scrub. \n\nSo there wasn\u0027t much choice. I had to switch to Valentina, and hope Bill bounced instead of dying. I brought *Noether\u0027s Revenge* to a juddering, broken-wheeled halt. Bill was speeding past the ship into the air. Apparently he\u0027d survived the first impact. Now that *Noether\u0027s Revenge* was stable, I switched back to Bill.\n\nHe juuuust barely managed to gain altitude quickly enough to pull out of his dive. I landed him next to *Noether\u0027s Revenge* to repair some tires, refuel in the command pod, and plant a flag.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/6g30K)\n\nIt had been a long and eventful five kilometers.\n\nI named the place \u0022The Last Bounce\u0022. It seemed appropriate.\n\nAfter deciding to set out again, I immediately got sick of the *Noether\u0027s Revenge*\u0027s tendency to wheelie. I pulled her to a stop and detached the *Jump Cannon*. I was going to find the lowest elevation point and park there. Unfortunately, that\u0027d cripple my ability to repair *Noether\u0027s Revenge*, because Bill would be far, far away. No more mid-air repairs. But that\u0027s okay, because there weren\u0027t any mountains between me and the lowest elevation point, so there\u0027d theoretically be fewer bounces, and therefore fewer broken tires. Bill was excited to stretch the *Jump Cannon*\u0027s legs, or rather, rockets. So, he set off to find today\u0027s goal: the point of lowest elevation.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/v6KHD)\n\nI managed to land at 317m altitude on a downward slope, about 22km from *Noether\u0027s Revenge*. If the bottom of this valley isn\u0027t the lowest elevation on Pol, I\u0027ll be surprised. *Jump Cannon* performed beautifully; no complaints there. However, when I switched back to *Noether\u0027s Revenge*, the recently-planted flag was mysteriously floating 1000m up. \n\n![Z8uKbDC.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/Z8uKbDC.jpg?1)\n\nI wonder if this is the beginnings of a trend....\n\nAs I started off again, I realized that there **was** going to be a mountain in the way. \n\n![PXbnorN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PXbnorN.jpg)\n\nDrat. Oh well. At least *Noether\u0027s Revenge* was much easier to control, although it still tended to wheelie. This was disappointing; my previous (hyperedit tested) iteration of *Noether\u0027s Revenge* didn\u0027t wheelie, but it did scrape the bottom and explode when it landed large jumps. As I roved, I learned quickly that the best method of accelerating and braking is to make like an Antilock Brake System, and do it in rapid spurts. Turning can be surprisingly well effected by rotating the whole rover in mid-(air). So long as the angle from your heading isn\u0027t too great, *Noether\u0027s Revenge* just bounces forward in the right direction at that point, and then eventually settles down. Land-based turning happens both surprisingly effectively and shockingly normally. Also, whatever you do, don\u0027t press the brake button on landing. That\u0027ll lock your wheels for sure, and then flip the rover.\\* \n\nComing to the top of previously-mentioned smallish mountain, \n\n![LULlDsf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LULlDsf.jpg)\n\nI decided that I\u0027d take this one slow to try and spare the wheels. With luck, I could avoid being airborne for too long. The sheer cliff at the bottom of this thing makes that unlikely.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrYFywPIV3I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThough I took the descent gradually, the cliff proved too much. Four wheels broke. And Bill was 20km away. I debated getting Bill back to *Noether\u0027s Revenge* by EVA jetpack, but then I had a better idea: drive *Noether\u0027s Revenge* on the remaining front two wheels by listing starboard. It worked, though it slowed my average speed from 10 or 15 m/s to 6m/s.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/cZQ4k)\n\nFinally, the front wheel popped. That left me with one wheel in the middle of the starboard side. Time for repairs. Bill jetpacked in from 12km away, repaired *Noether\u0027s Revenge* and refueled, and then sped off back to the *Jump Cannon*. As I was flying back, I really started to appreciate just how alien Pol is. It\u0027s just me, Bill, and Valentina here. I really feel exposed; I regret not making room in the delta-v budget for some kind of permanent base for my Kerbals to relax in. Poor Valentina\u0027s been cooped up in that one-kerbal capsule for years. Bill hasn\u0027t even had that comfort. Jeez, what have I done to these poor Kerbals? \n\nI made some good headway in these \u0022flat\u0022lands, far from any mountain range. Or should I say \u0022mountain ring\u0022? My average speed was up somewhere around 19m/s, and I spent a good deal of that, unfortunately, airborne between bounces. These hills can be quite annoying; I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a lick of flat land anywhere on Pol.\\*\\* \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PASZREkWuE4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n^I slowed the video down to 1x near the middle so you could experience what 20m/s on Pol is like. For those too lazy, the answer is \u0022bouncy\u0022.^\n\nWithout much further incident, I caught up to the *Jump Cannon.* Bill launched the *Jump Cannon* and efficiently re-grabbed the *Noether\u0027s Revenge*. Then I ventured down into the valley, trying to find the lowest point on Pol. Eventually, I abandoned *Noether\u0027s Revenge*, and travelled about 700m on foot to where I think it is - 82m in altitude.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

That means it\u0027ll take just about 12 days to get around Pol.\n\n**Casualty report:** \n\n-1 SAS Module (Fore Starboard) \u003Cwait, shoot.=\u0022\u0022 when=\u0022\u0022 did=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/wait,\u003E*that* happen?\n\n-1,5,6,1 tires (in four events)\n\n**Progress so Far:** \n\n![zykW4cg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zykW4cg.jpg)\n\n**Next:** The Zenith of the Journey\n\n\\*^Hmm.
