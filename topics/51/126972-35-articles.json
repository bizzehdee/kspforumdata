The room was small, obviously the station\u0027s clinic based on the jars of tongue depressors, boxes of gloves, and other hospital knick-knacks. Thomlock downed another swig of his sludge, already feeling better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyway, you seem to be back to normal. We should rejoin the group.

Macfred, Gletrix, and Agake got up to greet him and make sure he was ok. They then introduced him to the others in the room: Jebediah, Bill, Bob, whom he already recognized, Valentina, Rama, Grazy, Shepcal, and Joekin. Macfred suggested a few others were on the station yet absent, either on-duty or returned to their beds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock pointed at Jeb, Bill and Bob. \u0022You.

And whatever happened to Nelsey and Albro?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverybody looked up at the mention of the name. \u0022Albro?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? You kids have legends about him too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Yes. Kind of.\u0022 Bill looked to the others for agreement before he continued. \u0022This station wasn\u0027t empty when we arrived, far from it. Until you got here we were the new kids. The oldest of the original residents, Maclie and Kening, were here on orders from an Albro Kerman. He was a slightly mad kerb who had fashioned himself as The Director. Claimed to have been the first kerbal to go to space and live to tell the tale.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo he wasn\u0027t the only one. Thomlock had always wondered what happened to the rest of the Hawk Project crews. Jeb had died in spectacular fashion, Bob exploded mere meters above the launchpad, and Bill had simply disappeared, his capsule discovered safe yet lacking its pilot. Nelsey had scored a named moon like Thomlock, though he\u0027d never heard exactly why. \u0022So Albro\u0027s alive?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not anymore. He died several decades ago from what Maclie told us. He was already ancient before their first trip to Jool, and passed during their second. Just around the time they discovered this station.\u0022 Bob continued with the story of how they came to be at Jool, with Bill and Jeb chiming in as they felt the need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eight younger kerbals had been at the Edge of Infinity now for a little over thirteen years. The four guys, Jeb, Bill, Bob and Ribzor, had been working at Eve on the Onepake 1 when they lost all radio contact with Kerbin. They were originally going to return home when Jeb had a crazy idea and plotted a course for Jool. (None of them were in agreement as to whether he had done this before or after checking if they had enough fuel.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were somewhat surprised when they arrived and discovered the girls, Val, Rama, Grazy and Lindra, had also set course for the jolly green giant. Those four had been wrapping up the exploration of Duna when they were tasked with the rescue of one Shepcal Kerman. Val took one of their landers out to Ike, discovering Shepcal\u0027s ship anything but disabled, which sparked a bit of a standoff. A short time later all contact with Kerbin ceased. Eventually Shepcal convinced them to ferry him to Jool, promising fuel for their return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of them were quite certain how old the station was or how it came to reside at Laythe. Internally half of the torus was reserved for crops, mostly things that grew well in low-light. The remainder was taken up by storage, crew quarters, common spaces, and laboratories. Some of the heavy-duty labs which rivaled those on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob then launched into an overly detailed explanation of his earliest research when an alarm chimed on the station\u0027s public address system. One of the other kerbals checked a nearby console and motioned towards Macfred and his crew. \u0022Your ship is trying to reach you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Time to get back to work folks.

The ship had slipped into the Joolian system some days before, and was coming up on the first of its capture burns. The last of the three Potassium tugs was hauling most of their fuel reserves, a third comsat (Scandium 3), and a probe to investigate the ability of jets operating in the atmosphere of Laythe (Calcium 7).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the Laythe landing, the Vall landing would constitute the single greatest expenditure of fuel during their trip, so one of the two fuel depots was to be placed into the orbit of that icy moon. The third Scandium commsat would also enter into a polar orbit of Vall, which would hopefully improve inner-system communications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, the K-3\u0027s capture was designed to place it into an immediate intercept with Vall.

The Scandium 3 freed itself from the nose of the Calcium 7 (under Gletrix\u0027s direction, of course... the robots haven\u0027t taken over just yet), discarded the couplings that had secured it to the stack, and made its own burns to place itself into a polar intercept at Vall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160731-ksp0221-k3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160731-ksp0221-k3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160731-ksp0227-sc3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160731-ksp0227-sc3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[The actual burn escaped the screenshot key, but was just a short puff of fuel.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe crew spent the next several days resting up and becoming better acquainted with the others at the station. Most had arrived by accident or after taking a whispered suggestion, such as the eight members of Jeb\u0027s and Val\u0027s crews. Some of the others had fled here after Kerbin had gone silent, borrowing whatever craft they could get their hands on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were a number of interplanetary ships in their fleet, most originally designed for missions to Jool, Duna or Dres and repurposed for whatever it was the Forgotten Space Program was doing. No other infrastructure was apparently present in the Joolian System, which left Macfred questioning how they fueled their adventures. The answer was simple - piracy. Mostly they had taken craft that had been prepared for a mission to Jool immediately before Kerbin went silent, and as such were abandoned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin going silent was a theme that ran through every conversation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat remarkably, four of the kerbals had been members of the Pioneer mission to the like-named base on the M\u00FCn: Lobo, Roemy, Burvin and Joekin. Their mission leader, Gregory, was off on assignment with some other kerbals and one of the program\u0027s borrowed ships, but they promised he was still very much alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock grunted at them as they were recounting their tale. \u0022More famously dead kerbals. I\u0027m telling you, kids, this station isn\u0027t real. It\u0027s the afterlife. These four are dead and buried.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s not wrong. We found your graves on the M\u00FCn,\u0022 Macfred said, somewhat less confidently. \u0022Flags and all. And some crazy old kerb who claimed he killed you himself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey laughed, except for Lobo who only grinned before offering an explanation. \u0022Poor Hallock. We tried for days to convince him to come with us. Wouldn\u0027t go. Kept asking who would take care of his bananas. His m\u00FCnfruit. He suggested we draw straws to leave somebody behind, and we did. Except he kept rejecting the result, forcing us to remove whoever won and redraw. Eventually he was the last one with a straw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gregory never wanted to leave him behind. We were going to slip him sleeping pills and drag him to the shuttle while knocked out, but he got the jump on us and locked himself in the greenhouse wing. We were going to miss the transfer window to Jool if we stayed any longer, so we had no choice. We sent the shuttle back down to the surface hoping he\u0027d take the hint, but that was the last we heard from him. Probably for the best, he had always wanted to go to Duna anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Scandium 3 arrived at Vall first. Its approach brought it in over the moon\u0027s south pole, in an orbit that mirrored that of the Calcium 3 almost exactly. Unfortunate, as it meant two whole hemispheres would be without satellite coverage at any given time, but such are the vagaries of orbital mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160801-ksp0235-sc3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160801-ksp0235-sc3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160801-ksp0246-sc3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160801-ksp0246-sc3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the initial capture was complete, Thomlock programmed in a second burn to place their newest communications satellite into a nearly 1800km orbit around Vall. This, when combined with the Scandium 1 and 2, gave much better coverage of the various craft operating at Jool.

A four-minute burn that took place almost entirely on the dark, Jool-ward side of the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160801-ksp0261-k3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022527\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160801-ksp0261-k3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan here was simple - drain all but a select amount of liquid fuel from the forward fuel depot into the mostly depleted K-3, detach the Calcium 7 probe and the forward fuel depot, move said depot free of the stack, then dock the Calcium 7 back up with the still-full second depot and continue on to Laythe. Enough liquid fuel would be left at Vall to refill a Sulphur shuttle at least twice, and the depot would have full oxidizer tanks. (A later resupply mission will top it off.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix was handling the K-3 while Thomlock was assigned to the Sc-3, both working from one of the terminals in the Edge of Infinity. So far everything had gone according to plan, so she transferred the needed fuel into the K-3\u0027s rear tank, undocked the Calcium 7, and was preparing to release the forward fuel depot when the readout started to throw errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160802-ksp0300-k3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160802-ksp0300-k3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s weird.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That.\u0022 She pointed at the numbers scrolling past in the control console. \u0022None of the docking ports are aligned anymore.

The forward fuel depot received a kick of forward momentum, sending it spinning past the Ca-7 while the other two larger pieces tumbled away in the opposite direction. The two cameras on the Ca-7 were responding and sending data, and both Gletrix and Macfred watched as their precious fuel supplies drifted into the inky black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few moments later the Potassium 3 came back online and started responding to commands. The tug was still in range of the two fuel depots, which both started broadcasting their telemetry data. Neither were responding to commands, though the second depot still showed full storage in its tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, so now what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm.\u0022 Macfred had to think it over. \u0022Activate the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on the tug.

Meaning the only port remaining on the craft was at the rear, nestled between the eight radiation-spewing engines. Though radiation was the least of their worries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Calcium 7 was considered an essential part of the exploration of Laythe. Originally intended to fulfill a contract, the small probe is also the proof-of-concept that jet engines will operate in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. Without that proof, the Aluminium X-4B 10 LEA would not be cleared for use by a crew member. And since Gletrix was supposed to ride it down form orbit, they needed to get the Ca-7 to Laythe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndependently, the probe could make it to the moon on its own. Making it to Laythe would be all it could do, discarding the small space tug it was attached to and losing quite a bit of hardware in the process. It also wouldn\u0027t guarantee the atmospheric entry and flight would occur at a time when the Jumble of Parts (or the Edge of Infinity) were overhead to relay the signal back to Gletrix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they needed the K-3 (or some other space tug)\u00A0to get it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some consideration, it was decided docking the Ca-7 to the rear port of the K-3 would be \u0022safe\u0022 provided they only used two of the engines during the tug\u0027s transfer and capture burns. As an added bonus, this would move the K-3 to Laythe, where they might be able to effect repairs or attach a spare docking port. Only problem is it might leave the little probe a bit \u0022hot\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transfer to Laythe wouldn\u0027t happen for another five days though, leaving the crew some time to continue their conversation with Bob and the other members of the crew.
