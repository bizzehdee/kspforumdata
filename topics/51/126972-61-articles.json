We recovered the capsule and all of its contents, and will attempt another launch once the replacement LV-12 Tango booster is ready. I have our programmers reviewing the launch code to determine exactly where things went awry, and I have another team reviewing the mechanical interlockings of the booster and the escape system. Once that\u0027s done we\u0027ll have the next batch of supplies and research projects at your station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald looked over the other two kerbals in the council room before continuing. Cartina, once again responsible for the day to day operation of the space center, and Munlin, there as an adviser from their friendly neighborhood monks. Wernher and Gene were joining in on the meeting over radio from Manganese Station, up in Low Kerbin Orbit. There were fewer kerbals on this version of the Continuum Council than he\u0027d like, five in total, but perhaps that would work for now. Later, once the astronaut corps was reestablished, maybe they\u0027d add two more to return to full strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was assuming Jonbald even wanted to have seven kerbals on his council.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe tapped at the microphone on the desk in front of his seat. \u0022So, Wernher, how go the plans for our next project?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quite well. Ve will call it Copper, yes? It will be quite the undertaking, you know, and require the construction of boosters far greater than any ve have yet constructed. And there is ze question of whether or not ve will be able power the thing. Have you discussed the nuclear option amongst ze ground crews?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald sighed. \u0022Wernher, you know as well as I we\u0027re not going to be able to refine enough radioactives in the span of time available to us. This planet has a net production of zero grams of the stuff. We need to go with solar for now, and find a way to create our fuel elsewhere. Such as on The M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Solar will only work while ze craft is in Kerbin orbit. Once we\u0027re anywhere beyond Duna ve will go dark and will freeze.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s why you\u0027re building a cryogenic suspension system, is it not? To freeze us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ja, but it too will need power. Perhaps ve could build only the reactors and leave them unfuelled?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Later, perhaps. Do you have the latest draft of the plans for us or not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ja, ja. They should be displaying now.\u0022 The screens along the council desk lit up, each displaying a wireframe version of the new station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180329_ksp0821_copper.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022512\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180329_ksp0821_copper.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What you see will be ze first phase of construction for Project Copper. It is not perfect, and again would be better nuclear powered, but it will be sufficient. As you can see there are four distinct sections separated by large sections of trusswork. At the apex we have the CNC, or Command, Navigation, and Control. This vill be ze microgravity heart of our new craft and the first node to ascend. Also in this section you will find a number of docking nodes and docking armatures of various sizes, and the primary forward ingress/egress airlocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Moving backwards along the spine ve come to ze habitation section. This features four large rotating devices which will fold up for launch. This is, perhaps thankfully, far less ambitious than the original design which featured six such devices in a tripod arrangement. The insides of each of these will feature sleeping quarters, a laboratory, greenhouses, meeting rooms and other such gathering areas. The spine of the habitation section will also be fitted out with yet more greenhouses a sufficient quantity of cryogenic chambers. Ve should be able to grow all the food ve need to keep a colony of kerbals alive, say, 48 or 50 in number, completely independent of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Spoiler: One of the many alternate designs of the Copper habitation sections....)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0056_copper.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022620\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0056_copper.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn flight testing showed this arrangement to be excessively kraken-inducing and wobbly.

These are,\u0022 Wernher coughed, \u0022by compromise just a sad collection of solar arrays. These arrays will feed ze numerous batteries at the core of the node, with enough capacity to keep us alive in the darkest of times. Further back ve have a large array of radiators. This design only uses one of the radiator nodes, though ve should consider launching a second and third in anticipation of using the nuclear option.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Unlikely,\u0022 Jonbald interjected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ve will see. Finally, at the rear of all of this trusswork ve find the hopes and dreams of the experiment: The mounting point where ze drive systems will eventually be installed. For now all there is is a simple ingress/egress airlock, but in time... in time ve will have exactly what ve need to break the bonds of Kerbin and take this research craft to wherever ve wish. This design at present is just short of being one eighth of a kilometer in length, 124.1 meters to be exact, and with the engines and their fuel containment systems it should reach nearly a quarter kilometer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It will be glorious!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald had no doubt that Wernher was positively glowing with excitement. He could hear it in his voice. This looked to be exactly what they needed to explore the remainder of the Kerbol System, and to perhaps one day leave and go... somewhere. Home? For some reason his brain wanted him to think they would go home, even though they were already home. He shook off the thought and was about to speak up, just as Wernher\u0027s voice came back across the radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That is assuming ve can ever launch the thing. The CNC node and the lighter trusswork sections should be able to fly atop a crude design such as the so far unused LV-30. These habitation nodes are proving to be quite a bit of trouble, and will require the creation of a launch vehicle the likes of which Kerbin has never seen. A tremendously huge rocket, capable of...!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, about that.\u0022 Jonbald stopped Wernher before he got too excited. \u0022Before we go down the path of these behemoths, perhaps we should see if we can get one of the Tangos off the pad intact and working. Agreed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnother Nickel\u0027s Worth\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a short time later the next Tango was sitting on the launch pad underneath the Nickel-Dime 4. Not much had changed with the launch vehicle, just a few small bug fixes and delousings of the ascent code. This time the launch went off without a hitch, and the interstage separator didn\u0027t explode until the craft was well into its intended trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second stage carried it most of the way into orbit before being kicked free. A short time later the Ni D-4\u0027s orbital motors performed their final orbital insertion burn, and the craft was set up for its rendezvous with the Manganese research station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0030_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0030_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0033_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0033_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0041_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0041_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch turned out to be a bit late, placing the Ni D-4 into an orbit behind the station. By skimming the atmosphere they were able to set up an orbit which would intersect with Manganese 1 in roughly two orbits, just over an hour out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0044_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0044_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0049_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0049_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180206_ksp0054_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180206_ksp0054_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal docking was handled remotely from Manganese Station by Tetris (who was proving very adept at moving strangely-shaped spacecraft into always lacking-in-size docking arrangements). With the Nickel Dime-4 docked and secured, the research teams aboard the tiny station finally had enough supplies to restart their now long-delayed science experiments.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne such experiment was their ongoing research into producing the perfect blend of ice cream. It was somewhat unfortunately a test they had to continually restart, as the results always disappeared before the principal researcher could complete their observations. Meanwhile the other members of the crew were gaining noticeable amounts of body fat and exhibiting signs of excessive sugar consumption, a seemingly unexplained phenomenon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet another experiment was attempting to determine if they could successfully grow plants in orbit. So far they had failed to even get a single seed to sprout, as the tiny larval-form plants always complained about missing some required input resource. Eventually they shoved the seeds and their dirt into the back corner of the lab and moved on to greener pastures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0057_mn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0057_mn.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0058_mn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0058_mn.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother critical and somewhat oddly related experiment was their continuing research into cryogenic preservation of living material. A minor breakthrough had occurred when junior scientist Barbara had thought to pack one of their test subjects (a goo they had named \u0022Jeb\u0022) in the results of the ice cream experiment. (Explaining the missing ice cream.) This was found to be doubly beneficial, as the preserved subject could extract calories directly from the cryogenic packing material, aka: the ice cream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey all agreed the results of this experiment were important enough to be verified and repeated by a second, independent team on the ground. And so they loaded up all the materials related to the cryogenic and other projects, packed them into the Nickel Dime-4, and shoved the capsule free from the station. Once it was clear, the craft burned to lower its orbit, setting up a second burn so it could land near the space center and be safely recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0060_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0060_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0061_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0061_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately for the recovery team, the Ni D-4\u0027s reentry calculations placed it well short of the space center. Far to the West of the mountains, actually, yet still on the correct continent. Far enough away to drop out of radio contact with the ground teams only shortly after exiting the reentry\u0027s plasma blackout.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0068_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0068_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0072_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0072_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0073_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0073_ni-d4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully the automated descent system deployed the chutes as it was supposed to, and the Nickel Dime 3/4\u0027s capsule ended its trip in a safe and uneventful manner.

The load/save times were \u003Cstrong\u003EBAD\u003C/strong\u003E.

I don\u0027t know what the game did to convert this save, or if some updated mods just dumped a bunch of bits into my save file, but sheesh. I think half of that is the noise from the very badly-implemented kerbal personal parachutes.

It didn\u0027t have much in the way of life support or power generation, just some backup solar arrays, and as a result would remain uninhabited until such life-extending modules were in orbit. And that would work well, as Manganese Station had more than enough room to house all the critical research they needed to conduct until Copper was complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s designs for the first phase of Copper had split most of the pieces into equally heavy lumps, excluding the two heavier pieces for the centrifuges. This was a problem, as there were no tested and validated launch vehicles for payloads of the \u0022heavy\u0022 weight class, and the ones that were available were not well liked. Too many struts, too few boosters, too much wobble here, too much wiggle there. In the end they opted to stick Cu-1 atop an LV-30 Overture.

Nor was it their first attempt at building a deep space exploration vehicle. The original attempt at such a vessel, the Silicon DSV-1 \u0022Memory of Tomorrow\u0022, was still out in the void doing whatever work it was now tasked with. It\u0027s hard to say what the pirate Captain Hallock and Queen Sieta were really up to. They were being careful, and had gone to great lengths\u00A0to remain silent and off the grid. Despite that, Jonbald was perfectly aware of the whereabouts and condition of the ship and its crew. The data from the Memory was both promising and enlightening, and was used to adjust the systems planned for Copper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd until very recently Jonbald had also been receiving data from the space program\u0027s second deep space vehicle, the Silicon DSV-2 \u0022Jumble of Parts.\u0022 Though it was more of a colony of spacefaring craft, the Jumble had also fared well in its trip out to Jool. Ultimately the performance and total reusability of the Memory was better suited to their plans, and so the more monolithic designs had won out over the e-pluribus-unum approach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0076_cu-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0076_cu-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0085_cu-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0085_cu-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180207_ksp0091_cu-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180207_ksp0091_cu-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was spectacular.

The Zinc 1 was only heavy enough to need two SRBs, so Jonbald didn\u0027t get to learn what it would take to get all six attached to it.

Some quick back-of-the-kraken-stained-envelope showed that parts of the debris cloud would pass dangerously close to both of the stations orbiting the M\u00FCn. Normally nobody would blink an eye (mainly because they have no eyelids), but in this case it looked like some of the large chunks might actually intersect the Pequoni 2.

Some of the debris eventually returned to hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and some other pieces hit the M\u00FCn directly, but most of it was shot out into solar orbit. By then the radios on the Gallium pods were well out of range, and their batteries long since dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe timing of the evacuation was good, in some ways, as it provided Jonbald a crew to assist with constructing the new Copper Station. Remotely-operated construction tugs were always a bit fiddley when controlled from the ground, kerbals eyes and hands closer to the action were always preferable. The Iron shuttle would provide the life support needed for the bridge, and the science team could even conduct smaller, simpler experiments there.

This was not possible in a few cases, such as the large rotating habitation sections.

Pieces were designed, built, and fully integrated onto their rockets, only to be held back until other modules had launched. The prime example of this was the first solar array assembly, which was held until radiators were installed and working. There was some concern the solar arrays would heat the station to dangerous levels if the radiator assembly was not already functional.

The space program\u0027s principal factories and infrastructure all had to be standardized and streamlined to increase the rate of production of the LV-30 Overture. They retained one of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s four high bays for emergency integration of other craft, but even that area was ultimately used to store LV-30s and various other kit for Copper.

First up was the Copper 2, perhaps the most important launch aside from the bridge as it contained the construction tug. This large craft would be needed to wrangle all of the parts of Copper Station as they approached the construction site. The launch also included the Aft airlock node, which would move backwards as new modules were installed between it and the existing forward modules. Finally, the tug was launched with a set of docking port size adapters, needed to handle all the odd-sized trusswork, such as the solar arrays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe majority of these launches were between 230 and 270 tonnes at liftoff.

Deja-vu? Maybe. The craft disintegrated a couple minutes into flight, resulting in total loss of the vehicle and payload. The review board was unable to find a root cause on account of the flight records and telemetry being completely corrupted. They suggested The Node, despite its small size, might be too heavy for the LV-30 Overture. Never mind that the LV-30 had quite capably handled much heavier payloads in the very recent past.

This hefty payload and its companion rocket displaced 262 tonnes at liftoff (or they would, were they in water), and was only a fraction of a kg lower in mass than the radiator assemblies.

No, instead they spread shrapnel and debris over half of Kerbin while sending several still-firing engines off in all directions. The meteor storm which resulted from the mid-flight explosion of the Copper 6 would become the stuff of legend (at least the legend of the few kerbals living down-range as it was nowhere near orbital velocity).

This time they decided the loss was due to improper anchoring of the payload, coupled with \u0022pogo action\u0022 and \u0022seeking\u0022 from the booster. This produced a vibration which dislodged a portion of the fairing, a failure which proved fatal to the craft. Their recommendation? Use a more powerful booster and add more struts. More boosters, more struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Copper 6 payload was placed back in the production queue, this time at the head of the queue. Development of the heavier launcher needed by the upcoming habitation assemblies was also accelerated, with instructions that it be ready for the _next_ launch of the Copper 6.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECopper 6A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat new launch vehicle was the LV-50 Orchestra.

The payload and its fairing had \u0022bent\u0022, as though they were strutted to the ground, and then sprang back towards the sky once those invisible struts broke. This caused the rocket to flip over, and broke the linkages between the payload and said rocket.

Not with a new project such as the Overture, and probably not with finishing Copper. He needed someone to whip them back into shape. Someone to get all their frogs in a row. And to get that someone he needed to revive an old project. Most of it was sitting in the spaceplane hanger, covered with a tarp, waiting for its chance to be reborn.
