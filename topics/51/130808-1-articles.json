(First Orbital Docking) The Sense of Accomplishment!","CreatedByName":"Elway358","CreatedById":157334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T00:47:51Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Elway358","CreatedById":157334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T00:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me start by saying I have been playing video games since an old Sears and Roebuck b/w telegames pong unit. I have thousands of trophies/achievements from doing some really difficult things in many different types of games, but\u00A0nothing I\u0027ve done in a game in almost 40 years can even come close to the sense of accomplishment this game gives me! I started playing with it a week or so ago and had been able to do some orbital stuff and land on both of Kerbins moons but for me, the thought of trying to dock two ships in orbit was terrifying!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter purchasing the newest version of the game today and watching some youtube vids from Scott Manley(to whom I have to give huge credit for my small success thus far in this game), I knew it was time to face that demon! I launched my little space station into a fairly circular Kerbin orbit without any drama. Then came time to launch my little Mun lander and go for that hook-up. I got into space and started planning my intercept orbit...that\u0027s when that \u0022fairly circular orbit\u0022 looked like something the Easter Bunny dropped off! After the initial shock of my not so round orbit, I decided to soldier on. I worked on getting my descending node down to 0.0 and then turned my attention to trying to setup a close encounter,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI clicked, turned, rotated, and pulled on those maneuver node handles like a grey-haired granny on a nickel slot machine for god knows how long! Then just as I was ready to send that ship into a fiery descent to anywhere...I squealed like a teenage Bieber fan\u00A0at the site of 0.4km encounter! woohoo! That\u0027s when it hit me...that was the easy part \u003Cimg alt=\u0022-_-\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 title=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u00A0. After warping forward and getting into sight of my mark, I started inching forward and keeping my navball marks where they needed to be and ship lined up. 100m...heart beating like crazy...50m and I can hardly keep from mashing the heck out of keys from nervousness...20m...keepin\u0027 them navball markers lined up like soldiers and inching forward like a snail...10m, my prograde marker vanishes! :0 :0 :0 panic ensues as I try to eyeball her in for that last few meters watching the nose sway back and forth in front of me and frantically tapping RCS thrusters. Then....click! YEEESSS!!! I screamed so loud my neighbors probably called the cops! I just stared for nearly half an hour\u00A0at that beautiful monstrosity floating in orbit like a ballerina \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know most of you have probably done a simple docking maneuver hundreds of times and I probably will end up doing quite a few myself but man, that first one....
