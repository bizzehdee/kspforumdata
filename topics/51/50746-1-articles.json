After they ran out and the staging refused to purge them so after manually cutting them and putting away my air sickness bag I tried to gravity turn only to find I lost my bearing and ended up turning for a polar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point the planed mission is completely out the window so I decided to practice landing on the ice caps. After setting my orbit to intersect with the middle of an ice cap I dumped all the stages before the lander and manually popped 2 of the chutes for my return home to compensate for the higher gravity of Kerbal. As I throttled up the motors to slow myself more I heard the sound of de-couplers firing and saw my mun lander and return propulsion stages fall away. At this point I did the only thing left to me and triggered the rest of the chutes and waited for landing so I could salvage some science from the disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T01:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EId blame Bill.
