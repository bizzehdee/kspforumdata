As you can see there is no capsule, not even a liquid fuel rocket. Just a solid booster, probe, antenna and 2Hot. The first thing I noticed in the VAB was that the weights are different - a lot of things are heavier so you no longer have science instruments weighing a negligible amount. The Stayputnick is heavier but it now actually has 10 minutes of battery life like the description says. I also found out that you can\u0027t tweak the thrust on solid boosters, so after calculating that I wanted 25% thrust for optimum altitude I couldn\u0027t do it. There is only one speed and that will be fast. On the launchpad I found out that you no longer get science on the ground - in BTSM the kerbals seem to have already explored that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bviGzdM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bviGzdM.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JQVEOJS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JQVEOJS.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RuTaYvI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RuTaYvI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first launch gets off the pad and begins turning north, slowly tipping over. It becomes clear it will not last long and as it passes 90 degrees, now tilting down, I start transmitting some temperature data about the lower atmosphere. The transmission ends just 1.08 seconds before the probe hits the water 50m from the shore and is destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/95qnT4z.png\u0022 alt=\u002295qnT4z.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JyL7qyu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JyL7qyu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 science isn\u0027t enough to unlock anything, so I try flying again but with SAS turned on. It turns out the probe doesn\u0027t have SAS or a reaction wheel and it crashes, without the ability to perform any new science. So for a third launch I try to get the antenna and 2Hot placed to balance each other. This doesn\u0027t work either. Then I remember that the weights are different - I need 2 antennas and 2 2Hots to balance. This time it works and the 4th Alpha launch manages to reach the upper atmosphere and get 4 more science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ic5UWdv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ic5UWdv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zqHZzCa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zqHZzCa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter it comes down I can unlock the next item in the tech tree, Basic Rocketry.

BTSM is a very interesting change to science in KSP. If you\u0027ve ever browsed the question and answer forum you\u0027ll find someone new to KSP asking where they can get science. To anyone experienced it\u0027s easy because there is plenty of it at the beginning, Kerbin is covered in small bits of science. BTSM puts experienced players in that same position. I have used the 2Hot and barometer in the upper and lower atmosphere, I can\u0027t fly a kerbal into the upper atmosphere without killing him and the GravMax can only be used in orbit. If I could figure out how to land safely I might be able to try a terrifying low atmosphere EVA. In short it doesn\u0027t seem like I have any experiments left, I actually thought a few times I might be running into a tech tree dead end. BTSM seems to do a nice job making you really work for the next bit of science - you have to be original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway I think my \u0027goal\u0027 with Delta was to figure out what I could do with liquid rockets. Maybe I could get into orbit or something so I attached all my current instruments to a probe. Or maybe I just didn\u0027t want to kill another kerbal without advancing a bit so they would at least die in a new way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I launch off and there are two problems. The first is that I don\u0027t get a perfectly straight up launch - the nozzile of the liquid booster just isn\u0027t as stable a launchpad as the solid booster - and that means I slowly tilt over. The second problem is that extra bit of smoke you see coming off a bit of an angle from my main exhaust. That\u0027s bits of the nozzle assembly \u003Cem\u003Emelting\u003C/em\u003E.

Science is much more restrictive - you get more of the science instruments up front (I can see the Double-C on the 90pt tier) but the surface of Kerbin is already explored and the GravMax is more balanced (it returns 25% more science but can only be used in low orbit - Kilo which I just flew confirmed that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that makes designing more interesting is the way parts fit together. For my RCS I only have one type of tank right now, a tiny stack tank. That creates issues on where it can be placed without comprimising the structure of the ship. And then there are no radial parachutes near the start (the next parachute I can see is on the 90pt tier and its the XL parachute), which Juliet showed present other challenges. In Kilo I also ran into issues with the placement of solid boosters since I had nothing to space them out and prevent overheating. Overheating itself is interesting - I actually designed Kilo with my traditional spreadsheet method and only after flying it did I realize my thrust calculations for the liquid engines couldn\u0027t work because at 100% throttle they would explode!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisually there are some cool things too. Because reaction wheels don\u0027t exist until later my first orbital probe (Kilo, report coming soon) would slowly spin as it drifted in orbit. Unfortunately time warping removes any rotational velocity but until then the effect really gives the environment a better \u0027feel\u0027. The slow uncontrolled spin gives my probe the proper \u0027feel\u0027 of weightless that is missing when it is just sitting there motionless with the camera locked firmly on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real negative I have so far is that I\u0027m not a fan of reusing some of the games models for completely different types of equipment. The T15 engine, which is a scaled version of the T30 (the flavor text even mentions the name on the side being in error), is fine. It\u0027s the batteries that are a bit off. Maybe it\u0027s because the mod author doesn\u0027t like the look of the stock batteries which I can sort of agree on (they are a bit too cartoony) but to maintain some of the feel of stock it shouldn\u0027t use those art assets for something completely different, especially when it looks like they will then be used for their original purpose too (so I have a battery and a double-c that look the same). The mod itself is very small (less then 1MB) and all code. Maybe someone with art skills could partner up to create some original assets for batteries and anything else that needs a unique model.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T19:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKilo 1-3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intended Kilo to be a pair of missions using the same spacecraft which would use my new decouplers to make a reasonable journey into orbit. One would orbit the equater and take a gravity scan of the desert and if it could find it the badlands (I\u0027ve never been able to get an orbital scan of the badlands). The second would take a polar orbit and scan the tundra and ice caps. I calculated out the batteries I would need (the new XL batteries have a better charge:mass ratio) for the two transmissions and enough operations time to make at least one complete orbit after launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the first mission in the new mode that I planned out by spreadsheet. I\u0027ve started to make my own reference list of the unique mass and other attributes (like heat tolerance) of the parts in BTSM. One thing that stands out is just how heavy things get. This is an extremely basic probe with a single instrument (GravMax) and enough power for one orbit. Without fuel or engines it weighs 2.45 tons. My calculations where conservative on the ISP I\u0027d be getting for each stage but for the launch I did have one specific concern. The bottom of the rocket consists of 4 solid boosters around a center booster, not unlike my probes. I\u0027ve calculated the thrust and even with the radial boosters empty the center can\u0027t lift the rocket on its own. That means I\u0027ll need to run 2 radial and the center at the same time to keep enough thrust and I was worried about them overheating each other. Without any item like girders to space them out I would just have to try. Unfortunately overheat is exactly what they did, and they where almost done burning too. The explosion was uneven (only one blew up) and that flipped the rocket far off course into an unrecoverable spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XGDTyho.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XGDTyho.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nrzTZeF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nrzTZeF.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cb0dnvm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cb0dnvm.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KjjB4U4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KjjB4U4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKilo 2 was modified to use a larger BACC solid booster in the center which also added additional control surfaces. The staging was altered to fire all 4 of the smaller SBs followed by the center booster. Take off on the 4 SBs seemed ok but once I switched to the center engine I was far short on thrust. I dropped from 210 m/s down to 120 m/s before the load was light enough to start gaining speed. By the time I started picking up speed again I had burned more then half the solid fuel and I only made to it 180 m/s at 11 km when I staged and engaged the liquid engine. Here I encountered another oversight, my thrust calculations normally assume 100% from liquid engines, but the T15 can\u0027t run at 100% without exploding so I had to throttle down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rzemv9l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rzemv9l.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dbMPpAp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dbMPpAp.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/njm7Jsf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022njm7Jsf.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vawlIp5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vawlIp5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pushed on but things didn\u0027t really seem to be going well until I staged to the second liquid engine. With less mass and at 29 km in altitude when it started up there was little to stop it from putting on a lot of speed. Clear of the bulk of the atmosphere the control surfaces aren\u0027t useful anymore so they where put on the lower stage. It requires a lot of piloting input to keep steady but it makes it into orbit with fuel to spare. From here I began an orbit of the planet, searching mainly for the badlands. I was unable to find it, though I found two places where it briefly registered as tundra (too short to grab a reading). I took readings over the desert and with the extra battery power to allow another couple of orbits (no power used for badlands transmission) I used some of the left over fuel to boost my AP into high orbit so I could see for myself if the GravMax worked there. The result was negative but it was a useful piece of information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GZewiC5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GZewiC5.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LYFuSJl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LYFuSJl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I lowered my PE into the atmosphere which would both dispose of the probe and let me observe a reentry from orbit. Kilo 2 came apart at roughly 31 km, it\u0027s systems burning up in rapid succession until there was nothing left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Kilo 2 I wanted to make a slight adjustment. Knowing that I\u0027d be able to reach high orbit briefly I packed a pair of weight balanced 2Hots to see if I could take a temperature reading. This doesn\u0027t work in stock (2Hot only works in low orbit or lower), but then the GravMax works different here so I should test to be sure. I launched and turned toward a polar orbit. I didn\u0027t get the gravity turn as well as I did the first time - that was mostly luck - and the extra weight cut down on my delta-v too. However since I knew I\u0027d have limited power to make 3 readings (2 GravMax and 1 2Hot) I had planned from the start to raise my initial AP all the way into high orbit so I could get all the readings in less time then it took to make a complete orbit. I ran out of fuel just before the orbital burn was complete but some RCS was enough to push my AP up another 10km, for a final orbit of 74 km x 255 km with the PE above and a bit north of KSC. I was able to take readings of the ice caps and tundra as I passed over the north pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7w43LUG.png\u0022 alt=\u00227w43LUG.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cl1QuQw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cl1QuQw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn high orbit I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 2Hot worked, giving me another 8 science. That information should be useful in the future. With half a tank of RCS I lowered my PE to dispose of the probe. I use the science to unlock Advanced Rocketry to give me the LV-909 like engine and smaller fuel tank and Space Exploration to give me the mercury style pod. From here I can see that Fuel Systems is interesting - you get the big orange tank along with all of the large to small adapters. It would seem the intent is that rather then have a lot of radial attachment at the start the tech tree is forcing vertical designs. The jumbo and the adapters means you can build a rocket with that big tank and 4 engines under it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y2kd5QQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y2kd5QQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fUZHRm5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fUZHRm5.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wr9xJJt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wr9xJJt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T01:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELima 1-3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have the parts that I should, in theory, be able to put a kerbal in orbit. My orbital capsule consists of the reentry portion (the Mk1 capsule and a parachute) along with a service module composed of the smaller fuel tank I now have, the smaller LV405 engine (which is basically a slightly heavier, slightly less efficient LV909) 3 batteries and RCS thrusters. I calculated the battery life for a minimum of 60 minutes of operation, though actual life support would be less then that I wanted a safety margin. The pod itself has 10 units of monopropellent just like it does in stock .23. However the pod is a lot heavier then stock - 2.99 tons with the monopropellent. I\u0027m guessing part of that is the built in heatshield and the life support stuff. Either way it should make an interesting balance against the lander can which I assume will be much lighter but obviously be totally inappropriate for atmospheric reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need the limited monopropellent in the pod for when it is in orbit so I\u0027ve disabled it in the VAB and will reenable it when it stages (too bad you can\u0027t drop action group items into the staging list). For ascent once the control surfaces are dropped there are additional tanks of monopropellent on the 2nd booster stage. I\u0027ve also disabled the pods batteries - those will be saved until just before seperation so that the batteries on the service module are used and the pod battery stays full for the descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELima 1 uses 3-way symmetry and has 2 booster stages. I\u0027m back to trying liquid rockets but Lima 1 doesn\u0027t really perform - it just doesn\u0027t have enough thrust once the center engine cuts out and ends up bleeding too much delta-v on the way up. The AP only gets up to about 65 km and despite an effort in the orbital module to boost into a sub-orbital (but actually in space) flight it doesn\u0027t work.

Merdun Kerman takes the ship up this time. There is spin on the ascent but Lima 3 showed that it was down to piloting rather then a flaw in the craft. There is enough thrust to run the engines at 80% - this seems to be the sweet spot for the TN15 so I\u0027ll use it in my thrust calculations. I\u0027m not quite sure how long I need to burn for the circulization, I end up starting the burn too late and my PE needs to be corrected to 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VwuDh8z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VwuDh8z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0opb5vc.png\u0022 alt=\u00220opb5vc.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E3eQr5i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E3eQr5i.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5xxIncF.png\u0022 alt=\u00225xxIncF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oDYw2Ld.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oDYw2Ld.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JPsf3z4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JPsf3z4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter orbiting a burn is made to bring Merdun back. As the ship leaves orbit the command pods battery is activated and the service module is ejected. The service module is pushed into a slightly faster descent ahead of the command pod. This provides a valuable reference point since I can observe when it begins to break up and compare that to how the heat shield is protecting the command pod and parachute. You can see in the animation how parts begin to smoke and then explode in sequence, eventually the main structure breaks up leaving multiple chunks which burn up until there is nothing left of the service module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i618LxK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i618LxK.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gOp980x.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022gOp980x.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lzocxD.png\u0022 alt=\u00222lzocxD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELima 3 wasn\u0027t originally scheduled. If all had gone well Lima would have been a conservative single mission to put a kerbal in low orbit (I have future plans about testing goo container reentry but I wanted to get this done safely first). The failure of Lima 1 to fully meet its goals (in particular no crew report from low orbit) required Lima 2. However with the success of Lima 2, which still had fuel left, I prepared and launched Lema 3 which was an identical ship to be flown into high orbit. This would get a high orbit crew report and provide another test of reentry - I need to make sure I have it working like clockwork if I want to make manned missions beyond LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJorster Kerman is flying this one and it turns into a rather routine flight thanks to the incremental improvements in flight control and design I\u0027ve made. After making a high orbit pass he comes back in for a landing, setting a PE of 20 km to enter the atmosphere. Life support is more then half depleted by the journey after barely completing an enlarged orbit. More life support will be needed to go beyond Kerbin. And the Mk1 doesn\u0027t float very well, it would be best if kerbals don\u0027t open the hatch until they are recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JZA2rcC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JZA2rcC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MXII1Al.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MXII1Al.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7DSKleM.png\u0022 alt=\u00227DSKleM.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uorcxzq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uorcxzq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DJ8bMfH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DJ8bMfH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T02:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMike 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMike was planned as two missions. I want to return goo containers from orbit (they are worth some good science). However to do this I need to protect them from reentry. My idea was if I attached them to the side of the Mk1 pod (the way most of us did when they first appeared in .22) they might be protected the way the parachute is. I had even considered this as a part of Lima but with all the kerbal deaths I decided to focus on just one goal at a time. For this mission I still didn\u0027t want to risk a kerbal in the event that the goo containers might compromise the pod and I didn\u0027t want to design a whole ship. So I planned two missions both of which would be flown with a modified version of the Lima 2/3 space craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first mission would fly with 2 goo containers attached to the pod. This would add weight but that wouldn\u0027t be too important because we wouldn\u0027t try to get into proper orbit, just ascend to 250 km and then fall back down. In order to avoid risking a kerbal this dry run would be setup to \u0027fail\u0027 from the start - the parachute would be a replaced by a Stayputnick so that the whole flight could be made remotely. The final 3000m would be a predetermined failure, but everything before that would prove if the concept worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings go well at first.

With the service module nearby (the nearly straight up path means they don\u0027t seperate very much) we can see the moment that the reentry forces hit a critical point. At which point both goo containers are also destroyed. The rest of the pod comes through, but obviously the goo containers are too far out to be protected by the heat shield.

If I could get high orbit samples I would have enough science for another item. Out of the available technologies some don\u0027t seem useful yet - I see technology for landings and faster transmissions which at this point are secondary to actually getting somewhere. I see a slightly better engine (the normal T30) but I don\u0027t think that would be enough. I see heat shield technology but that would have limited use right now, I need a lot more then just returning goo from high orbit. Then there is docking which could be useful - I might be able to assemble something in orbit. But what I think I really need now are Fuel Systems, which give me that orange tank and the adapters for attaching multiple engines to it, and Advanced Flight Control. This has some useful parts - a dedicated reaction wheel, SAS system and small RCS tank but the real reason I\u0027m taking this first before fuel systems is the new QBE probe core. This probe core weighs less (.25 tons) and much more importantly it uses half the power. Because batteries are such a big part of reaching the Mun and because they weigh so much in BTSM reducing the power requirements is the single best way of reducing payload weight and thus extending delta-v. I think with this probe core I can reach the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W9R0ws1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W9R0ws1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T20:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENovember 1-2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of November is to reach the Mun and transmit some basic readings. This won\u0027t be an attempt to orbit the Mun, there just isn\u0027t enough battery power for that. Remembering older missions I think I can get to the Mun in 6 hours though that will still be tight given how many batteries I can carry without exceeding my payload capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovember 1 uses the same launch platform I\u0027ve been using, only it replaces the 3 ton pod with a much lighter probe core. It then doubles the number of batteries and finally the 1st booster stage needs to expand from 4 to 6 radial engines. I\u0027ve fitted a 2Hot to take readings. There is a lot of spin during launch, I haven\u0027t put aside any weight for an SAS control system so its manual stabilization the whole way. With more delta-v in the 1st stage the 2nd stage can be used for part of the circulization burn. After that the orbital module plots a course to the Mun. This is a collision course but that\u0027s fine, we\u0027ll only have the power and opportunity for 2 temperature readings anyway and this should neatly dispose of the probe when it is done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching the Mun there is a minor letdown. In stock .23 the Mun\u0027s orbit has a multiplier of 3x compared to 1x in Kerbin orbit. So the same reading will return 3 times the science. In BTSM that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case. The Mun is worth 1x so I only get 8 science for the high orbit reading and 8 science the low orbit reading before it crashes. Power wise I still had over 700 em when I \u0027landed\u0027 so I may be able to get more science (I really need it so I can unlock something else) if I send a GravMax instrument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cDgxlaM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cDgxlaM.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/boSkFFv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022boSkFFv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qfT5ROc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qfT5ROc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovember 2 does just that, fitting a GravMax instead of a 2Hot. Due to weight balancing I am able to slightly reduce the overall mass of the ship. This time I won\u0027t collide with the Mun, I need to be in low orbit to take a reading and the GravMax takes a while to transmit so I want to be sure it won\u0027t crash. Reaching the Mun a course correction is used to bring the probe in close. Readings are taken of the Mun\u0027s Midlands and with enough power left a second reading is taken of the Highlands. The two readings provide 50 science in total, the same 25 science/reading as I got in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Avcecx9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Avcecx9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Aj861H.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Aj861H.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VZFnI7y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VZFnI7y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the probe having done it\u0027s work and with 50 minutes of life is left to drift (there is not enough fuel to make a large enough correction to send it into the Mun).

I have enough to unlock one thing. It\u0027s obvious that I at least need to be able to get into orbit around the Mun with some good battery power to take GravMax readings if I want to proceed further in the tech tree. It\u0027s also becoming obvious that I\u0027m not going to find a ton of science on the Mun, at least not with a single landing like I\u0027m used to. I\u0027m going to need to explore the whole surface just to advance. Of the items I can unlock the heatshield and antenna are still nice to haves but won\u0027t really change things much. The landing equipment, which includes the Double-C, could be interesting but I have no idea how much science the instrument itself provides and what my other instruments (2Hot) would provide if I made a landing. I also don\u0027t know how much power it uses to transmit. I\u0027ve rerun the numbers and the orange tank doesn\u0027t open things up as much as I need them to, it really wouldn\u0027t be better then my current launch vehicle. The T30 engine could be useful but that would depend a lot on how hard it can be run. If it still has the same overheating threshhold as the T15 then I won\u0027t have gained enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves me with structural technology which includes docking ports, size adapters and struts. I have an idea of using the docking port to let me place a support module into orbit - a partially used fuel tank with lots of batteries. A Munar probe would then launch and link up with the support module before making it\u0027s way to the Mun. In the worst case I\u0027ll need those struts if I\u0027m force to make even bigger launchers, since without any radial decoupling mechanism I need ever bigger stages to provide enough thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T04:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOscar 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst you might be asking where is Oscar 1. Oscar 1 never reached the pad but progressed far enough that I already had a craft file for it (2 actually as will be explained). With the name already used I went to the next available number rather then overwrite it. Oscar 1 used a design almost identical to November to enter orbit around the Mun with enough battery power for multiple GravMax transmissions (that\u0027s a lot of power). To do that the November capsule was stripped down to just 2 batteries and a docking port was added on top to be used with a support module. The support module was basically a light frame rig with a docking port and a lot of batteries, over 4 tons worth (which sounds like a lot but is barely enough to support a few Mun orbits and some GravMax transmissoin). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission plan would have the first probe launch carrying the support module (all the batteries on the support module would be turned off). The fuel normally used to reach the Mun would instead be used just to get the module into orbit. The second probe, much lighter then the first, would launch on the first orbit to quickly catch up and dock with the support module as it entered its second (it the first probe ran out of power it wasn\u0027t fatal but would mean docking with a dead mass). The second probe would take possession of the support module and steal any fuel and monopropellent it could from the first probe. With a hopefully full tank it would then fly to the Mun and enter orbit with enough power to transmit multiple readings from the GravMax. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RdPB5Vs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RdPB5Vs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere where two issues with this plan. Docking itself wasn\u0027t an issue but quickly setting up a renderous and just doing two launches for one throw away probe seemed like extra work. The bigger issue was that I had still hadn\u0027t fully worked out the exact delta-v and thrust values with all the swapping of parts and fuel going on. It was very possible that the first probe could fail to get into orbit, or the second probe wouldn\u0027t have as much left over fuel as I thought, or it might not be able to get into orbit around the Mun even with a full tank once the rig was attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy backup plan for choosing the node I did on the tech tree was that if docking ports didn\u0027t work out I could instead use the struts to build a monster launcher and get something bigger into space. And that\u0027s exactly what I did. I designed a capsule to go from LKO to LMO on a full tank, with enough power that it could send 8 GravMax transmissions and do about 4 orbits, and then built a launcher to get it into orbit as a payload. Struts allowed me to build the first stage outward (a requirement since I needed more thrust and needed more attachment points then just a single decoupler, all without the ship flexing and bending).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOscar 2 fully utilized thrust tweaking calculations (while SBs and fuel tanks can\u0027t be tweaked in BTSM the liquid rockets can) so that I could run the ship at 100% throttle and not have to micromanage drag or heat. I also installed an SAS system in the launcher (for weight savings the Mun probe itself still relies on manual stabilization) to further reduce the workload. Ideally I can reuse the launcher for several missions before I need a bigger one or have enough technology to redesign it. I was surprised to find out that the small RCS tank actually carries a lot, 250 units compared to the 50 carried by the tiny one (in stock the small tank carries 100 units). This meant that I had more then enough monopropellent for the launch and could leave it on the entire time to aid the SAS system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage consists of 12 engines, 4 clusters of 3 engines each which are attached by individual decoupler to one of the 4 radial engines of the 2nd stage. The center of the first stage is empty space with the structure supported by struts. The second stage is far more familiar, 4 engines around a 5th center engine. When it is activated the first stage splits into pieces and falls away. The gravity turn is timed to start immediately afterward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dmouu2w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dmouu2w.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G6BG7is.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G6BG7is.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/usIAsvP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022usIAsvP.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/khw4loD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022khw4loD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3rd booster stage consists of a final T15 engine and T800 fuel tank along with the SAS and RCS systems used by the entire launcher.

The previous trip in November 2 identified the Midlands and Highlands which make up most of the Mun\u0027s surface. I quickly pass over Highland craters but these areas are incredibly tiny, the scanner is over them for less then a second. Midland craters are easier to get a fix on. As the probe passes to the night side it finds the Northwest Crater and the Farside Crater before coming on a larger set of Highland Craters that can be scanned. The Twin Craters are scanned next after which all remaining fuel and RCS is used in an attempt to change the orbital inclination (there is only about 60 m/s to work with) for the next pass around the Mun. Power is running out and while there was power planned for 8 scans it did not take into account the longer trip to the Mun or the number of orbits needed. Ultimately it\u0027s not important, with the small plane change only two new features can be found, the Northern Basin on the dark side and some Canyons near the Twin Craters. With 7 scans complete the power levels are too low for another complete scan even if something could be found. There is no fuel or RCS so the probe can only float as debris for another 62 minutes (around 2 more orbits) before it dies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aWYIPYT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aWYIPYT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HtlNSfF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HtlNSfF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 7 scans I gain 175 science.

I\u0027m tempted to unlock landing and find out how much power is required for the Double-C and what science can be returned from the Mun\u0027s surface. By cutting down on batteries I could free up enough weight to add fuel for a landing. Mounting 2 batteries and the instruments directly to the probe core (30 m/s impact rating) I wouldn\u0027t even need a smooth landing. Another mission would be to stretch Oscar\u0027s fuel enough to make a low orbit flyby of Minmus (maybe take off 2 batteries). There would only be time and power for 1 or 2 transmissions (like the November 2 flyby) but it would give me data on what scientific value Minmus has. Ultimately I will also need to send one or two more Oscar missions to make GravMax scans of the Mun\u0027s other regions, there should be something like 400 science left to be harvested there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
