I\u0027ve built wheel stations before. You can have gravity onboard a ship in orbit, using centripetal force. Thing is, it\u0027s very heavy to lift, quite power-intensive to spin, and when you raise your arm it moves in the direction of the spin, whether you want it to or not. Also, try running and jumping in the opposite direction to the spin of the station, it\u0027s weird. It\u0027s cool, actually. The gravity changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI digress.

They\u0027re very happy to have arrived, after having spent six days stuck in a rocket-powered Pepsi can with each other. They will finally be able to get out into the open.
