It seems Kerbalkind have finally decided to explore the vast unknown, but due to there only being one KSC and no prospect of a Space Race, I have a tough time imagining why.

As you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see, all of the flights had a reliable escape system to bring our brave kerbals home. By Day 52 of Year 1 of the program, we were ready.

Because the Bluestone missile is just a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKickback\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 SRB with an ASAS unit attached, the Bluestone missile can only put the Moho capsule into a ballistic trajectory. Reaching an apoapsis of 229km, Jebediah enjoyed a successful 15 minutes of flight in space, with Mother Physics in the driving seat, eventually reeling him back in. As Jeb rattled around in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUnity 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 during re-entry, an alarming bang was heard from outside. The omnidirectional RCS thrusters had been unable to hold up to the required specification and had blown up in the heat. Whilst not fatal, the mistake was remedied for further flights. Jeb plopped down in the ocean east of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeven days later Valentina blasted off from KSC in an identical rocket, but her capsule she had named \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHalo 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (so excited for that game). Her launch trajectory was much more vertical than Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUnity 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 leading her to break his altitude record by 40km, reaching a 269km apoapsis. Valentina had what was arguably a greater shock than Jeb, as when she turned off the capsule\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s reaction wheels to preserve the limited electric charge stored in the Moho capsule, and tried to do an orbital burn to move her landing point away from KSC, the capsule went into an uncontrollable tumble. Recovering the craft by turning back on the capsule\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s torque, future missions had to deal with the fact that orbital burns must use capsule torque and suffer the electric charge drain from it. Due to her straight-up, straight down trajectory, re-entry for Valentina was safe, but fierce. The redesigned RCS system of linear RCS ports far up the pod as opposed to RCS thrusters on the heatshield decoupler meant that no overheating issues occurred, and Valentina touched down on land (not preferable, but within specification) just west of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this point Project Moho had to go on the backburner for a while as the transfer windows for Sarnus and Urlum arrived, and I sent SCANsat missions to them both (accounts of their travels comes roughly 4 and 14 years later):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/04E8zghl.png\u0022 alt=\u002204E8zghl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fh0KLWfl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fh0KLWfl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 days on from Valentina\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s flight it was time to initiate Phase 2 of Project Moho, orbital flights. Due to the Bluestone missile not having sufficient dV to fling the Moho capsule into an orbit, a new launch vehicle had been designed, the Globe V. Due to previous problems with the Moho capsule being ironed out, flights were given the go-ahead.

The new Globe V proved very reliable and capable, placing Lodbart into a stable 73x73km orbit, where after one revolution and 41 minutes, he re-entered with a textbook trajectory that plopped him into the ocean east of KSC. Kerbals had orbited Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Lodbart\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s successful mission, Project Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s objectives became more time-based.

Launching on Day 104 into a 79x82km orbit, the flight was flawless much like Lodbart\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s up until re-entry, where things nearly took a turn for the worst. In previous flights it had been pointed out that when the heatshield was decoupled after use, it spiralled off backwards and posed a collision risk with either the capsule or the parachute. Dohat watched the shield fly just outside his window, but thankfully the shield didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make contact and he splashed down in the ocean west of the KSC continent, after 3 hours 31 minutes flight time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, to round off Project Moho, Johnsen Kerman was to spend a day in LKO.
