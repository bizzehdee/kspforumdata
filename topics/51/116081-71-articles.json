Bob\u0027s facial hair in the last panel makes clear (if it wasn\u0027t already) that we have at least a partial analogue of \u0027Mirror, Mirror\u0027, the classic Trek episode. There are also elements of the Romulans and the Klingons in the mix for flavour.  \n\nBut both Kenlies have written or talked about imagery \u0027coming into their heads\u0027 unbidden. It doesn\u0027t sound to me like either one is making up the other as part of their fiction, but that they are both seeing images through the eyes of the other.  \n\nI hope that makes more sense.

In the Star Trek episode \u0027Mirror, Mirror\u0027 the characters enter the alternate universe and meet some of its inhabitants. This leads to certain expectation/anticipation on my part about the future of the story. Given that the Kerbulans are not just in Kenlie\u0027s imagination, I would expect that they will have to have an effect on the story of our Kerbfleet crew members as it unfolds.  \n\nIt may be that since Kenlie has such an active imagination as a writer, he is more attuned to the thoughts of his alternate/Kerbulan self and thus it is him seeing the images.  \n\nBut, knowing that Kuzzter wants to tell us a story, I will make a prediction. Evil Kenlie is not really about to die.
