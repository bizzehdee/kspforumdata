Then was motivated to record and post this today, otherwise, this playthrough was going to be postponed until the next release. Total real time played was around 3 hours. This was not my first attempt at this type of career, probably the 40th. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This career type was a challenge before figuring the science from space method. When the Strategey Outsourced Research is employed this method can effectivley rocket you out of a deep hole. Previous attempt my funds exceeded 100k, reputation close to 800, and 160 science in less than a few days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there is risk involved the payout is too great. This contract type needs to be altered. Maybe not just any science from space maybe Goo science. A limit then declining reward would also help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing this career style is challenging, so there will be a self imposed limit. These two spacecraft represent that limit. Bill is in orbit and Jeb is out of electricity. A recover vessel can be sent over to Jeb to retransmit the data.

Sure Jeb had it easy the first time but the second flight was death defying. Having only 14km to atmosphere is not a smart time for EVA. After a crew report in space Jeb went on EVA and somehow lost his grip of the command pod rung. Don\u0027t panic Jeb. Just turn on the jetpack, hit the change camera button, press space to orient view, jet towards the capsule, grab rung, complete EVA report, store EVA report on lower pod, complete another EVA report, grab stored crew report and board. Failed on obtaining two more crew reports from space. Too bad my hands were sweaty and not able to take any screenshots. As I remember the altitude was around 72km before getting on board. Both EVA Reports from space just above Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands are shown while on the ground during the radio transmission.

But the first attempt failed. The vehicle crashed and so did the game. Restart the game with reservations as to how to proceed. Decided to just go for launch but without modifying the vessel, just a slight adjustment to the ascent path by going straight up and now with orbital success. After some time orbiting the rescue vessel catches up to Calely. Now on board and begins working for KSC.

The COM was behind the wheels. Just complete the jet engine text contract and redesign. The vessel crashed in less than 200m what is going wrong?

The launch is routine and contract will be completed later on. This satellite will aid in radio communication with the surveillance drone. Calely in orbit was initially to be the radio link. Then after the drone runway failures and redesigning in the VAB I got the idea to send the satellite up there and hold a 370km circular orbit. With 500km being the range of the omni-directional dipole antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Third try for the surveillance drone is the charm, with some changes and a successful take off.

Another flight is needed to survey the last marker and finish the contract. Piloting skills are sufficient but landing technique needs improvement. Everybody now. Give chutes a chance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Calely is on course for re-entry.

Landing is another issue. The approach was a little shaky. Lining up the runway was decent. The game crashed again when the vessel impacted just before the runway, so what choices do I have. Do I reload then after completing the contract again and then on purpose crash the vehicle? Just because it happened that way before the game crashed. Or is this just another lucky break? Maybe the game will crash again.

Was looking to complete my keosynchronous communication network and just did not receive any decent contracts from Gene. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Contract to position a satellite in keosynchronous inclined 26 degrees was chosen, A \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSatCom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was launched and the mission was successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The discovery that was found next will improve my next attempt at this career style. An idea for a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctwo-for\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite, to send one payload of two satellites to complete two contracts. I was not sure if this would work out. The \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTwoForSatCom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite is contracted for Equatorial orbits of Kerbin and Mun. The back half of the satellite is positioned and the other is left to orbit and catch the Mun later. The head of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTwoForSatCom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite has now caught the Mun and transfer was successful and Munar orbit established. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So figuring to improve the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTwoForSatCom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite idea and now send one satellite to complete two orbit contracts. Redesign and now launch a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSatComB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite for both keosynchronous and equatorial contracts. Each contract is completed by the same satellite. Bonus! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Finally the contract I have been waiting for to position a satellite in keosynchronous orbit with close to zero inclination, but in retrospect I could have got the communication network done way before with one of my other satellites. Satellite \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSatComC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is launched without a hitch and is placed first into a keosynchronous orbit to complete the contract. Now to re-position and set up a 6 hour orbital period. With the satellite parked in keosynchronous orbit over KSC now triangular coverage around Kerbin and the communication network is established plus with a long range Reflectron KR-7 for later missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Multi use satellites save funds is a great idea. Send a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPolarAltRADAR\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite into a polar orbit with an altimeter RADAR scanner to scan the rest of Kerbin, this will also complete a science data from Kerbin space contract Launch is favorable and the satellite is in position at 450km circular polar orbit and starts scanning. After a few orbits the altimeter data obtained completes a science data from space contract. Wait for some more data and complete the altimeter scan of Kerbin. Transmission and another science data from space contract completed. Then two maneuvers to finish the Kerbin polar orbit contract. Now send this same satellite over to the Mun and start scanning. Too bad not enough dv for proper orbit and a narrow equatorial map is produced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E An \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CecoII\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite is designed to complete multiple contracts. First a keosynchronous orbit then a Kerbin equatorial orbit. Science data from high above Kerbin space using a mystery Goo experiment completes another contract, then over to a Munar equatorial orbit to complete two more contracts with another science data from space around Mun using a mystery Goo experiment, transmit the data and profit. Later in the career this satellite was noticed drifting off into deep space and had to adjust its course to keep it inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The Munar orbit was at its furthest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Turning off the Outsourced R\u0026amp;D strategy to increase funds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Rescue Shepsted Kerman but first to position the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRescueC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite for profit. At the launch Jeb is discovered stowed away and is booted out of the capsule (somehow squeezing through the 0.1mm gap in the fairings) and completes a science experiment on the crawlerway. The power settings were not set properly and this vessel was steered away from anything expensive and destroyed. Jeb looks suspicious and is now being inspected for sabotage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The next attempt goes well and the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRescueC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite is positioned in equatorial orbit for profit and then returns to intercept Shepsted. Working for KSC, Shepsted collects and sends science data from space and is then sent on EVA to assist with re-entry into Kerbin. He pushed the vessel using his jetpack to an altitude of 70km and then used up the remaining monopropellant from inside. Shepsted opened the chutes and returned safely to Kerbin and almost all the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The multi use \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CecoB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 satellite probe is up next. This is designed to complete two orbit contracts with low cost. Kerbin equatorial orbit followed by a specific Kerbin orbit. Both contracts completed as planned. The engine contracts were missed because the initial Kerbin orbit exceeded the altitude requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The ultimate in multi use satellite \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CecoBScience\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is designed to preform mystery goo experiments around the Mun and Minmus and finish off in a 180 inclined equatorial Kerbin orbit. Launch is without problems and complete two engine tests while in orbit. Then complete the transfer and establish a specific orbit around the Mun. The science data from space around the Mun was attempted using the altimeter scan but nothing useful so the mystery Goo science experiment was done instead. Next \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CecoBScience\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is to orbit Minmus and complete another mystery Goo science experiment. Minmus transfer is without problems and with a pass by from an old friend to say \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chello\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Minmus orbit and mystery Goo experiment completed. Turn around for an 180 degree inclined equatorial orbit around Kerbin. That was a lot packed into that mission totaling six contract payments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now to complete the goal of this exercise and the mission to the Mun is initiated. First to test the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMunLanding\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 vessel is with a probe. Launch and Mun transfer all go as planned. Mun orbit went as planned. Choosing a landing spot that will have both radio and sunlight. Losing battery power during landing was concerning but all went well. Landing was aided via HullCam. Launch from the Mun went well. Problem again losing battery power during orbit. Out of power and was thinking this mission is over, had the back of the vessel pointing at the Sun. But after several orbits got lucky and the probe somehow had sunlight shine on the solar panels. The last command in the computer controller was causing the craft to oscillate. When was using time warp the satellite stopped rotating and solar panel was facing the sun, no luck kinda of a cheat but not on purpose. Charge the battery, regain communication and maneuver set to go back to Kerbin. Vessel areo-braked in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere during return and was recovered luckily close to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb is now demanding that it is his turn to go to the Mun. With an FL-T200 added to compensate for the extra weight and to insure mission success. Launch and into a Mun transfer. The trip went well. The landing spot is chosen \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTwin Craters\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Missed it by that much and with a rough landing. The gear is jammed, good lucky the LV-909 survived. Jeb is overjoyed to get to the Mun. He plants a flag for glory and profit. The launch from the Mun had extra altitude but nonetheless Jeb opens up a return trajectory window. The re-entry did not go as planned with an additional orbit around Kerbin. Disregarding chute deployment warnings is not smart. Within the atmosphere the drogue chutes are lost due to sheering wind forces. Good thing the main chutes held and Jeb is now safe back on Kerbin and ready to transmit the science data he collected from the surface of the Mun for profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Total time was 7 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 28 hours Total Play Time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 116 contracts (59 send science data from space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 152 Kerbin Days\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 0 dead kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2 rescued kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 181,880 Funds remaining \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 573 Reputation \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 154.4 Science remaining (623 spent to unlock tech tree)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My attempt at this style of career was overall enjoyment and fun. When first attempting this style my progress was short lived and nearly gave up on the whole idea. But it took some creative thinking on choosing the best method to get the career off the ground. Even though contracts were milked, I still prefer this harder game play setting. It made me at times very concerned that Jeb might not make it or a vessel cracks up a building. The science data from space is a well used crutch and would like to use less or a least have actual science data as in the altimeter scans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The vessels were made up from memory of past attempts and I did have notes to help with dv and TWR requirements. The satellites \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTwoForSatCom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ceco\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 series were made up and never before tested. I have landed on the Mun in past other career types but in this career the Mun lander was also a new design that was never before tested. My inexperience still shows (been around since 0.23) and many mistakes were made. In this harderS career style this is the furthest and most successful in all my attempts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now to continue this career as I wait for the 0.90.0 BETA than ever update to be released so that this harderS career style can start all over again with Kerbals to train and buildings to purchase/upgrade and new biomes to visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Music: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Unknown Stuntman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 sung by Lee Majors, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHypnodrome\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Taxim-Alexander Ney, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBriefcase Full of Blues\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The Blues Brothers\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T19:00:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T19:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EObjective completed.
