I did this and 6kms from \u0022L30 Station 1\u0022 I undocked from it and went to the station taking all the kerbals, including Kellong. I needed two scientists in the station\u0027s lab so that would be Bob and Kellong. Damnit Bill, get out of Kellong\u0027s seat. Got them transferred and then decided to bring the Kerbals that were along for the ride, home...... while towing the dead ship. I can always disconnect it if it causes a problem on re-entry, the Kerbal\u0027s will be fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey died on impact with Kerbin while trying to hold onto as much debris as possible in order to get the funds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis annoyed me. I don\u0027t like killing Kerbals. It upsets me, I don\u0027t want to be resposible for their deaths. I loaded up my last save...... Kellong is back stuck in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I got the multi kerbal orbiter out again. Added some extra tanks, for a safety margin, and set it off this time without kerbals. It can function autonimously anyway. It was in orbit and about to do the transfer burn to get close to Kellong when I couldn\u0027t...... SAS was off. What has gone wrong? No power? I had forgotten to deploy the solar panels and the ship was dead with a full load of fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMulti kerbal orbiter number 3. This one is to dock with the other one and then deploy its panels and the one with the most fuel goes after Kellong.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn getting this one into orbit I started recording the video.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDock with the other MKO and deployed its panels......save!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI get to Kellong, rescue him and then tow the ship to the station, get Kellong onto the damned station and then went back to the ship.... I am going to deorbit it and the MKO now there are no Kerbals to hut and see how much survives.... it is in the video.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI forgot what I was sopposed to be doing tonight....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QGqD0fy1FQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QGqD0fy1FQ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
