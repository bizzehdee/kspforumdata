I\u0027ve been playing FlowerChild\u0027s fantastic mod, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61632-0-23-Better-Than-Starting-Manned-%28v1-491-Lingering-Marsupial-Feb-27th%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBetter than Starting Manned,\u003C/a\u003E for quite a while now. The mod changes the way KSP works in several major ways -- most importantly making missions much harder. Electricity is actually a very limiting factor now -- you can\u0027t get far out past Minmus until you research solar panels in tier 7; those only work as far as Dres, and going further than that requires a generator which doesn\u0027t come in until tier 8. Manned missions are much tougher, as the game includes a basic life support model; getting to the Mun is a challenge, and landing requires lots and lots of work. Hell, a stable orbit requires work. Yet the mod doesn\u0027t feel \u0022grindy\u0022, not in the least; rather, it feels challenging, and every accomplishment -- from breaching the atmosphere for the first time to bringing a probe safely down without blowing it up -- feels like a major accomplishment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027ve been playing BTSM for quite a while, and am now at the second to last tech tier. BTSM changes the way tier costs work -- the last tech I bought cost 1,800 science; the next will cost 16,000. Until now, my missions have mostly been unmanned; probes to the Mun and Minmus eventually led to a Mun and Minmus landing, which led to probes to the inner and later outer system. But now the time has finally come for manned missions to take their place at the head of my space program. This mod is \u0022Better than STARTING Manned\u0022, and I am certainly out of the starting phase now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of this mission report, I plan to plant a base on every body from Moho to Eeloo, and stick a station in orbit around any body from the Sun out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe endgame of BTSM seems to focus around colonization of foreign planets. There are 4 9th tier techs, plus a 5th which is available because I use MechJeb to calculate dV and is of no interest to me. These 4 techs are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUber Rockets -- unlocks the LV-N. That\u0027s right; 16,000 science for the LV-N rocket and nothing else. And you know what? It\u0027s worth it! I\u0027m going to need the LV-N to colonize the outer worlds. But before I get there, I need some other techs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColonization -- this is my first target. The only tech in Tier 9 that unlocks a new experiment, Colonization gives me a habitation module that doubles as a science lab (the actual science lab is removed from the game, and all experiments either transmit at full efficiency or do not transmit at all; this makes a lab a major, major boon for me.) The habitation module also lets me run habitation studies -- experiments that take 5 years, but produce tons and tons of science. They can be run on the surface of any body or in low orbit around a body that contains an atmosphere. Habitation studies will be the cornerstone of my push to finish the tech tree; I will be colonizing the planets of the Kerbol system in order to get the science to unlock the rest of the tree. Finally, Colonization unlocks some large solar panels and a life support processing unit -- when on the surface of any body, this unit can use tons and tons of power to make a small amount of life support. With enough of these, I can create self-sustaining bases, but this isn\u0027t easy; it takes 5 processors to keep one kerbal alive, and the processors weigh in at 15 tons each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerospace Tech -- this node unlocks the RAPIER engine, a couple of aircraft parts, and two items critical to station building. First is the Air Scoop -- when in low orbit above an atmosphere-bearing body, this scoop allows processors to function by taking in air and putting out whatever it is they put out. The second item is an all-purpose processor that can make fuel, oxidizer, mono-propellant, and life support, but only works above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. This processor can make a station in LKO that allows every craft leaving Kerbin to launch empty and leave full. In my opinion, this will be critical for reaching any body further than Duna and Eve with the materials necessary to build a station or base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENanolathing -- this node unlocks a couple of structural parts and, most importantly, fuel and monopropellant processing units that work away from Kerbin. Additionally, it unlocks a generator that weighs .8 tons instead of my current generator, which comes in at 8 tons. It also produces 2.2 e/m as opposed to my current generator\u0027s 1.8. This generator will be critical to both manned missions past Dres (where solar panels stop working) and for any station or base at that range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo! What am I going to do? That\u0027s a tough question. Colonization is absolutely necessary to finish the tree, in my humble opinion; without it, I can get no more science once I finish probing and landing on every body. On the other hand, I will be getting the science to unlock the nodes through manned missions, and I am not goin\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Eg to be a\u003C/span\u003Eble to do any manned missions past Dres without the more efficient generator from Nanolathing. But on the THIRD hand, getting past Dres is gonna be extremely difficult even if I do have the juice to do so, because I\u0027d have to carry tons and tons of life support with me. Getting to the Jool system, landing, and coming back with only the life support I carry with me might as well be impossible. So, what should I do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Mission Plan\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I do anything else, I need to earn 14,841 more science.

The Interplanetary series uses a modified Omega-class launcher; a simple, 2 stage craft that can get the 200 ton Interplanetary III into orbit in one piece. The Omega-class launcher has served over 10 different craft designs on dozens of missions so far, and is by far the most reliable workhorse I\u0027ve ever built. While it may eventually be retired if I decide to lift stations and bases into orbit in a single piece, it will serve me very well until that point.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EHere is the Interplanetary III atop an Omega-class launcher: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/81AQBOx.png\u0022 alt=\u002281AQBOx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xI8pxLB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xI8pxLB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5nGkfYc.png\u0022 alt=\u00225nGkfYc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Omega lifters are not just lifters; for loads under a couple hundred tons, they also serve as orbital tugs.

I make the burn and let Endo Kerman enjoy the ride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Interplanetary series carries around 230 days worth of life support. The trip to Duna took 59 days, leaving me ample supplies for the return trip. Endo Kerman grins as he becomes the third Kerbal to leave Kerbin\u0027s orbit (Gergun Kerman was the first, with his trip to solar orbit to collect biometric readings; Jebediah Kerman was the second with his trip to Gilly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip is uneventful and requires little input on my part, aside from correcting the ship\u0027s orientation to ensure that the solar panels are functioning. The Interplanetary series had a flawed design in terms of solar panels; I placed two rows of them on each side, meaning that only half of my panels could ever be fully exposed, and even that rarely happened. The Interplanetary IV will fix this problem, but until then corrections in solar orbit are necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon enough, though, Endo Kerman reaches Duna. The Red Planet becomes visible shortly after the pull of its gravity is felt, and soon Endo spies his target: Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5DJsZVi.png\u0022 alt=\u00225DJsZVi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough the tanks of the second Omega stage are nearly empty, they serve two purposes here. First, their thrust to weight ratio is so great that they can still apply about 500 dV -- nothing to sneeze at with Deadly Reentry active. Second, engines are the most heat tolerant parts of a spaceship shot of heatshield. I plan to aerobrake in Duna\u0027s atmosphere using the higher lifter stage as a heat shield and burning at my periasis; once the engines start cooling I will detach the stage and burn with the Interplanetary\u0027s engines, hopefully slowing down enough to remain in Duna\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MgY8sng.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MgY8sng.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xyTC143.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xyTC143.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3ULBj0L.png\u0022 alt=\u00223ULBj0L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan works flawlessly, and though I use more fuel than I would have liked I enter a stable orbit around Duna. I do notice a problem -- the batteries atop the lander heated up to almost 1,000 degrees, and the landing struts actually let of sparks -- a sure sign that they were about to explode. I did not run into this problem when aerobraking in Eve\u0027s atmosphere on the way to Gilly, but I also didn\u0027t need to drop as low into the atmosphere to slow down to a reasonable velocity. Future landers will come equipped with detachable heat shields protecting any rear-facing payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it was a close call, I make it through with the lander intact.

Its pull is strong enough to easily enter its sphere of influence, but orbital velocity is low enough to ensure that a lander needs to use little fuel to return to orbit.

First, a couple of changes: My last reentry was far too close for comfort. A periasis a few meters off would have probably killed Endo. Part of that has to do with my aim, but part of that is my fault. I have unlocked the 6.25 meter Inflatable heatshield, and should have been using that instead of my outdated 3.75 meter heatshield. The 3.75 has a heat tolerance of 1,000 degrees (which means it was trying to explode long before it actually did; I\u0027m lucky it lasted that long) while the inflatable heatshield has a whooping heat tolerance of 10,000 degrees. I have replaced the reentry shield with an inflatable one, and added a rear-facing heat shield to the lander. When aerobraking, I can point myself prograde and open that shield. That means I won\u0027t be able to burn retrograde, but the shield should allow me to fly lower and aerobrake harder, getting the same effect with less fuel used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I cut it a bit close in terms of fuel on my last mission. Granted, a flight to Duna should use less dV than a flight to Ike as I\u0027ll have a few less burns -- no transfer burn to Ike and no capture burn when there -- but on the other hand, I\u0027ll have a bigger burn to leave Duna\u0027s orbit. While my current fuel supply could cut it, I\u0027d like to be on the safe side. So I modify the transfer stage, raising the number of engines from 4 to 6. I add extra engines to the second stage, strut everything in place, and call it a day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babale","CreatedById":108874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERed Dawn, Continued\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the changes to the crafts involved made, the Red Dawn mission is ready to begin.

The tiny red marble grows and grows until it fills the sky, at which point Jeb prepares to aerobrake. The solar panels are retracted and the ship is turned prograde. The great heatshields atop the lander\u0027s engines are deployed, blocking the view of Duna. The ship hurtles into Duna\u0027s atmosphere, moving quickly. The heat shields redirect the superheated plasma away from the ship as it sinks to a periasis of only 10 kilometers. The RCS tanks on the main engines are far enough back that they heat up and explode just as the ship reaches periasis. The main fuel tanks heat up as well, but the ship rises before they can reach dangerous levels. Then another explosion rocks the ship. The exploding RCS tanks prevent the ship from righting itself as the thrusters run dry, and it turns slightly; then the shields right the ship, jerking it back straight. The jerk causes enormous G-forces to act upon the ship, and 3 of the solar panels explode. Luckily, there is enough built-in redundancy for that to cause little concern.

I start burning with the radial engines and instantly stop as I find the problem: I used decouplers instead of stack separators to attach my heat shields to the engines, and the decouplers were still there. I thought that it would only have a graphical effect, but the decouplers actually made it impossible for those three engines to provide any thrust; they just used fuel for nothing. I begin to fear that Jeb will never be able to return from Duna, and weigh my options. If I burn the three useless engines at enough power, I\u0027d be able to generate the electricity to send back the science I already have. Jeb would die, but the science he acquired would be sent back home. On the other hand, I could disable the three radial engines but keep them attached in order to use their fuel, then burn the center engine and return to orbit using it alone. The lander is untested for such a maneuver and is likely to fail, rendering me with no Jeb and no science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we leave no man behind.

Without the protection of the engine, it doesn\u0027t take long for the small grey tank to explode; this is followed by a series of massive explosions as the solar panels and life support kegs blow up as well.

That style of burn would take me away from Kerbin while burning retrograde to the sun. 6,000 m/s of dV later, I was diving towards the sun with a periasis inside the star itself. A few days later I passed through low sun orbit long enough to take readings and send them back. After 4 hours of falling, the probe crashed into the sun, putting me at around 15,500 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NCdrV7c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NCdrV7c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gd0fAkG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gd0fAkG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z4C5rsl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z4C5rsl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the inner solar system thoroughly probed and so little science remaining before I unlock Colonization, I decide to take the old Vaulter I design and send it to Eeloo for a flyby.

This tech gives me everything I need to build a self-sustaining base. Of course, colonization missions are possible without self-sustaining technology; but sending hundreds of tons of life support kegs to the Mun every few weeks doesn\u0027t sound like a lot of fun. So instead, my goal is to build a fully self-sustaining base from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the center of any base is the living quarters. BTSM has a single command pod appropriate for colonization; the YU-GON-SOLNG habitation and science module. It only takes a single kerbal to finish a habitation study, but if I send two the habitation module can act as a science lab. Since I\u0027ve already got pretty much everything I need from the Mun, I will only send a single kerbal, but allow modular support. Maybe later I can dock some more life support generators and send a second kerbal with a rover in order to grab the surface samples from other biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next question is that of redundancy. The Mun\u0027s sidereal period is 1 day and 14 hours; since I want redundancy I will make my calculations using 45 hours, which is obviously larger than 38. I need batteries that can keep the base powered for a full 45 hour period; this way I account for things like Kerbin coming between the Mun and the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe habitation module uses 9 units of life support per kerbal per hour. A recycler reduces this by a .2 multiplier. 9/Kerbal/Hour is the same as 216 per Kerbal per day; recycled, that\u0027s 43.2 a day, or 1.8 an hour. The module comes with 1,000 units of life support, giving me 23 days -- more than enough to get to the Mun in the first place or send a rescue mission in the event of a system failure. So I don\u0027t need to send any kegs; just the module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ll be using 43.2 life support units a day. The processor creates 9.7 units of life support each day. That\u0027s 4.5 life support processors to keep up with the kerbal; clearly we can\u0027t send half a processor, so call it 5. Because of the way symmetry work, I can either send 4 in radial symmetry and one in a stack or 6. At 15 tons, these processors aren\u0027t something to send just for fun. I\u0027ll pass on the additional redundancy and go with 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sWsz3D0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sWsz3D0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve got a weird little base with 5 processing units, a habitation module, and a recycling unit. I\u0027m already at 90 tons and I still don\u0027t have electricity, nor a way to land this thing on the Mun -- much less a way to get the lander and base in orbit. Time to look at power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe processors use 21 electricity each minute. The pod uses 13.3 and the recycler uses another 3.3. That brings me to 121.6 electricity per minute, or 7264 electricity an hour. And we want 45 hours of juice... that\u0027s just about 330,000 electric charge. The best battery pack I have has 4,000 electricity. I\u0027m going to need 85 batteries weighing in at 17 tons if I want to send that to orbit -- which, actually, isn\u0027t all that bad. Adding the batteries brings the ship up to 146 tons and makes it look a little weirder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CuFNSrS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CuFNSrS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter adding in some struts for stability, the next step is to figure out how we\u0027ll charge this thing -- getting something this huge into orbit only for it to die 45 hours later seems like a waste. We know that we will be using up around 122 electricity per minute; that means that we\u0027d need just 3 Gigantors to power the whole thing. Since we already have 4 towers built into the design, though, we may as well place 4 solar panels. That gives us 216 electricity each minute -- not too bad. During hours of sunlight, we\u0027ll be getting 94 electricity each minute -- which means that it will take 68 hours to fully charge the batteries. That\u0027s not good enough; our plans count on the batteries being fully charged each evening. 4 solar panels would delay the inevitable, but every night the battery banks will be a weaker until they run out completely. If a day is 38 hours long, we need to be fully charged in 19 hours -- let\u0027s call it 13, since the panels can\u0027t be fully effective in the evening and at dawn. The actual battery banks have 384,000 units of electricity; that means we need about 30,000 units each hour. That\u0027s about 500 a minute, which takes 10 solar panels. Putting 2 on each tower (including the central one) should be sufficient, but I\u0027d like to keep the central tower clear; instead I\u0027ll put 3 on each of the outer towers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes some jiggling, but I arrange the panels so that all 12 can be deployed at once. The base now has everything it needs -- life support, electricity, and... actually, that\u0027s it. But it has unlimited amounts of both of those things, which is nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final base, which includes things like landing legs and a science jr. lab on top of the base, weighs in at 168 tons. Enough life support kegs to last 5 years -- just under 80 of them -- weigh in at about 120 tons. Between the habitation module itself, the structural elements of the ship, the return craft, and so on, the 40 tons of difference shrink pretty fast. So a self-sustaining base is certainly the way to do things if the goal is to send a base up in one launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext time -- I figure out how to launch a blue whale to the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babale","CreatedById":108874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T19:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYear 11, Day 3. 0:00:00 hours.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep underground in a nuclear shelter which has sat empty since the end of the Second Kerbstomp War, the Prime Minister of Kerbin is ushered into his seat. Worn screens line the walls of the shelter, thick and outdated by modern standards. A large, ornate wooden table sits at the center of the shelter -- the famous table where the Unification Treaty that ended wars on Kerbin was signed nearly fifty years ago, and the room from which the War was directed. Prime Minister Derburry Kerman sat down at the chair at the head of the table, flanked by a pair of suited kerbals wearing dark sunglasses. He put on his glasses and picked up the plain-looking file sitting on the table, opened it, and began to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few minutes later, a short kerbal with a pencil-thin mustache and a pair of thick sunglasses walked into the room.

The monitors flickered to life, their image slightly grainy but certainly usable. \u0022As you know, we have outfitted the tracking station at the KASA spaceport with the capability to detect NKO\u0027s -- that is, Near Kerbal Objects\u0022 began Wernher von Kerman. \u0022Indeed\u0022 muttered the Prime Minister, \u0022I signed twelve million kerbucks to your agency for that task\u0022. \u0022Well, that was money well-spent\u0022 countered Wernher. \u0022As any child with a telescope can see, we have captured four asteroids which were on an impact path with Kerbin and brought them into a stable orbit\u0022. The monitors flicker again as Wernher plays with the controls, and four large, potato-like objects orbiting Kerbin can be seen. \u0022But asteroids aren\u0027t the only thing the tracking station can see\u0022 continued the scientist. \u0022Since early last month, we have been tracking a certain object which has been travelling along a very irregular path\u0022. The monitors flicker again, showing Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus in their orbits. A few marked and coded asteroids, their paths highlighted in different colors based on their trajectory\u0027s proximity to Kerbin, also appear. Three other objects show up on the map, marked with grey question marks. \u0022Two of these objects have been identified as asteroids, and their projected trajectory mapped for the next few hundred years. The third... Well, look at this\u0022 Wernher continues as the Prime Minister sits up, interested. \u0022Here is the projected path of Object KEU176\u0022 begins Wernher, showing a dotted line that crosses near the Mun and is then flung out far away. \u0022Here is what actually happened\u0022. The object comes closer and closer to the Mun, finally being pulled by its gravity; but at the lowest point in Munar orbit, it suddenly slows down. It slows until it is captured by the Mun, and orbits it for a few revolutions. Then, on its third pass of the Mun, it speeds up rapidly and flings away out of sensor range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That sort of trajectory is completely and utterly inconsistent with an unpowered object\u0022 begins Wernher. \u0022In fact, such maneuvers require power -- and lots of it. We calculate trajectory corrections around 2,400 delta-V to slow down as it did, followed by a second correction burn of 1,500 delta-V--\u0022 \u0022Wait just a moment!\u0022 thunders the Prime Minister. \u0022You are telling me that this -- this object, is powered, somehow? Like a spacecraft?\u0022 \u0022Exactly like a spacecraft, yes!\u0022 says Wernher. \u0022Further, based on our calculations of the object\u0027s mass based on its initial velocity and reactions to the Mun\u0027s gravitational field -- well, no need to bore you with the details. But we calculate that the mass of the object is on the order of a few thousand tons\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Prime Minister blinked. \u0022That sounds like a lot. Is that a lot?\u0022 Wernher nodded. \u0022Not only is that a large mass, but we have no known means of delivering the observed changes in velocity at the speed we have observed to an object that large. Whatever -- WHOMever -- was piloting that craft has access to technology far more advanced than ours\u0022. The Prime Minister nodded. \u0022Well, Director Wernher, I believe that the reaction to this threat falls under KASA jurisdiction. What do you propose we do?\u0022 Director Wernher swallowed before answering. \u0022Do you recall my proposals for bases on the foreign bodies of the Kerbol system?\u0022 the Prime Minister nods. \u0022Well, we should be able to outfit those bases with tracking modules with only small changes to the original designs. With manned tracking centers across the Kerbol system, should the anomaly arrive again we will be able to accurately track its progress, and perhaps derive its point of origin\u0022. The Prime Minister nodded. \u0022Very well. You will have the funding. Get to work!\u0022 Wernher nods, excited. \u0022Of course, sir.

The engine cluster would make its way up and rendezvous with the base, docking on; once all 5 engine clusters were docked, the entire base would be pushed into Munar orbit, where a skycrane would meet the base and grab on, eventually lowering the base onto the Mun\u0027s surface. As the rocket was being carried towards the launchpad atop massive rails, the Prime Minister approached Wernher again. \u0022This launch is what I meant to talk to you about. When are the other rocket clusters supposed to be launched?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly annoyed by the interruption, Wernher responded, \u0022Not for another three days. We need to get the base ready, and --\u0022 \u0022Push it forwards\u0022. Wernher seemed dumbfounded by the interruption. \u0022Impossible!\u0022 he responded after a moment. \u0022We need to--\u0022 \u0022You need to launch it tonight. And not one at a time, either. The file you gave me -- I understand that these launchers are Sovereign-class launchers, yes?\u0022 Wernher nodded. \u0022Well, your file spoke of Terminal-class launchers, capable of carrying up to 400 tons. And I understand that these engine clusters weigh 165 tons each. I want you to launch tomorrow, using Terminal-class launchers and carrying two clusters at a time\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher paused for a moment, taking in his new orders. \u0022That can\u0027t be done, sir. We only have two Terminal-class launchers ready --\u0022 \u0022Excellent! You will only need two launches!\u0022 \u0022AND they are HIGHLY experimental. And trying to get them ready in just one day, it\u0027s --\u0022 \u0022It\u0027s exactly what you will do, if you want to remain director of this space program!\u0022 growled the Prime Minister menacingly. \u0022Understand?\u0022 Wernher nodded silently. He feared that if the launch failed, he would be blamed -- although he had warned against it from the start. But there was nothing he could do; for now, he needed to launch the first engine cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BZUxoBD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BZUxoBD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r9PWVta.png\u0022 alt=\u0022r9PWVta.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2tLdT3Q.png\u0022 alt=\u00222tLdT3Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b9wfOTh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b9wfOTh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w8ScNmJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w8ScNmJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nUj82iK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nUj82iK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babale","CreatedById":108874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T17:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYear 11, Day 88\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKASA Spaceport\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce more an enormous rocket was wheeled onto the launchpad of the Kerbal Space Center.

Matdan out.\u0022 Far above Kerbin, the lonely kerbal flicked a switch, shutting off the radio.

I am glad we have come to an understanding. Tell me -- do you, by any chance, know why you were selected for this program, of all the astronauts that KASA has to offer? Certainly, someone who has actually spent time off-planet, like the Commanders Jebediah and Endo, would be more qualified?

Not sure, sir.

Why?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because this mission is about a lot more than a study of the effects of prolonged exposure to the Munar environment on the kerbal body. This base -- no, colony -- which you will be founding is a matter of national security.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatdan sat straight up in his seat. \u0022National security? But, sir, I have no military history. What can I do?\u0022 \u0022The same thing anyone else can\u0022 responded the Prime Minister. \u0022Keep a weary eye upon your instruments. The results of your habitation study you can report to KSC, but the Armstrong Munar Base is capable of much more than that. It is capable of tracking NKOs with accuracy unmatched by Kerbin-bound instruments. You will report all unusual NKO encounters directly to the Kerbal Security Bureau, through the secure frequency which your radio is capable of transmitting in.

The dot representing the Armstrong Munar Base had been slowing down over the last ten minutes and was nearly still over the Mun\u0027s surface, only falling at a slow pace. \u0022We read you, Matdan. What\u0027s the problem?\u0022 asked Director Wernher. Though directly managing missions wasn\u0027t something he did very often nowadays, he had demanded to be responsible for the safe touchdown of the first permanent outpost on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, I need to maneuver the craft -- keep the engines pointed retrograde so I can kill horizontal velocity at the same time I slow down my drop. But the docking ports attaching the Pusher engines -- well, they aren\u0027t stable enough. I can burn just fine, and I can turn just fine, but if I try to do both at the same time the whole thing shakes itself to moho.\u0022 For a moment, the kerbals at Mission Control were silent, contemplating their options. Finally, Wernher spoke up. \u0022How bad is it? Can you finish the mission?\u0022 There was another delay, then: \u0022No. If the craft doesn\u0027t shake itself apart, I\u0027ll still be unable to burn accurately enough to slow down to a safe margin. I\u0027m sorry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Control fell silent as the kerbals contemplated their failure. \u0022Very well\u0022 started Wernher with a heavy voice. \u0022Burn back into orbit and we\u0027ll launch a retrieval craft to --\u0022 \u0022Wait!\u0022 said a voice. Meshy Kerman, one of the youngest yet most brilliant engineers at Kerbal Space Center, spoke up. She was the one who designed the LV-909 engine that first allowed probes to leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, and rumors that she had more to do with the Poodle than Wernher himself were not as farfetched as they sounded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have an idea. Official KASA protocol demands that all landing burns on low-gravity bodies be made with Stability Augmentation Systems and RCS thrusters active. Are you following that procedure?\u0022 \u0022I am!\u0022 responded Matdan, insulted that his obedience would be questioned at a time like this. \u0022Well, disregard that procedure. Make correction thrusts, turn off RCS, then burn; kill the engines, make corrections, and burn again.\u0022 \u0022Are you mad?\u0022 shouted Wernher. \u0022Without the RCS stabilizers, a burn could send him in the wrong direction! Even if he successfully corrects his aim after burning, he\u0027d be wasting fuel -- landing burns need to be made once, or gravitational acceleration wastes the change in velocity you\u0027ve already made!\u0022 \u0022True,\u0022 responded Meshy, \u0022But the Armstrong is equipped with enough fuel to land on the Mun three or four times. Why build in so much redundancy if we don\u0027t use it when we have to?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a moment, Wernher considered. Then he nodded. \u0022Alright, Matdan. Try her plan.\u0022 \u0022Roger that!\u0022 came the reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/My4R5w8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022My4R5w8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is it working?\u0022 asked one of the kerbals sitting in front of the screen. \u0022I\u0027m not sure!\u0022 responded Matdan. \u0022I\u0027m not shaking nearly as much, and I\u0027ve lowered descent velocity to acceptable parameters -- but I\u0027m moving laterally at 19 meters per second. I can stop the base from gaining lateral speed, but it isn\u0027t maneuverable enough to slow lateral velocity down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce more, the kerbals in mission control considered their options. Again, it was Meshy who came up with the solution. \u0022Alright, keep making orientation thrusts only while the engines are killed, but start making translation thrusts to kill lateral velocity. How high are you?\u0022 \u0022Twenty K\u0027s, and dropping slow.\u0022 \u0022Then you should be able to slow lateral velocity to four meters per second. Is that within acceptable parameters, Director?\u0022 Wernher considered. \u0022It would damage the engines, since you are meant to land on them, but you aren\u0027t using them for ascent anyhow. Very well; follow her orders.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinutes passed. Every so often, Matdan would call out his lateral velocity over the intercom -- \u0022Twelve meters per second!\u0022 -- and the dot marking his craft approached the Munar surface. Finally, Matdan reported: \u0022One hundred meters above surface and dropping at nine meter per second. Lateral velocity --\u0022 he cursed. \u0022Still high. Seven meters per second.\u0022 \u0022Abort the landing!\u0022 shouted Wernher. \u0022Start rising, kill lateral speed, and try again!\u0022 \u0022Negative. Fuel levels too low. I\u0027m going in. Twenty meters above surface and dropping at three meters per --\u0022 a loud crash came over the radio, like the sound of scrunching metal; then static.

What is your situation?\u0022 shouted Director Wernher. Finally, the radio crackled again. \u0022--rol, all systems operational.

After donning his spacesuit he stepped out of the Armstrong Munar Base and leaped down onto the Mun\u0027s grey surface. Kicking up dust, he walked over to the lander. The massive base still stood upon the five engine clusters that had carried it there, but those clusters were damaged, each one missing three or four of its engines. The lateral movement on impact had carried the base towards a hill, which was lucky; if it was heading away from the hill, the base may have tipped over, meaning a lot more work for Matdan and possibly causing serious damage. Luckily, this wasn\u0027t the case. Before he left the base, Matdan undocked the engine clusters. Now the huge base rested atop them, unsupported.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a grunt of effort, Matdan started shoving at one of the engine clusters. The Pusher was normally quite heavy, but nearly empty of fuel and under the Mun\u0027s lighter gravity, it didn\u0027t seem to bad. Matdan managed to push it over. Then, using the controls on the side of the pusher, he activated it. The remaining engines thrust to life, pushing weakly, and the RCS thrusters struggled in vain to keep the engine\u0027s course straight. It slowly pushed away, then, once at a safe distance, the engines roared to life. Though they made no sound in the Munar vacuum, Matdan was nevertheless impressed. The engine flew away, tumbling into the distance, before crashing into the side of a nearby hill and exploding. Matdan grunted with satisfaction and heaved at the next engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon enough, all five engines had been moved. As the last engine cluster pulled away, the base landed on its last legs, finally safe and secure on the Munar surface.
