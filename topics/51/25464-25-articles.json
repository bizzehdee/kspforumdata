I had a long transmission from KSC today about how we\u0027ll be leaving the Jool system after the astronomers give an all-clear on the Kerbol mega-flare activity.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Do we get to finish our mission on Vall?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Yes. And possibly more, if you want. You know that there were missions planned to study Tylo and Bop and Poll, similar to your Vall mission. The boys at KSC have decided to continue sending that hardware out here during the moratorium on kerballed deep space flights. By the time those ships arrive, the flight restrictions are expected to be lifted... and rather than wait for new crew to get out here to use it, they are offering us the option of doing those missions before we return to Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Why are they in such a hurry to keep sending out the ships? I thought their plan was to just put those mission on hold until the all-clear.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Apparently there has been a lot of pressure by the rocket and spacecraft manufacturers to keep up the launch rates.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Yeah, Dude...I know my Uncle Martin and Uncle Lockheed can be pretty persuasive.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Not to mention the Rockomax Mafia.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Rockomax \u003Cem\u003EConglomerate\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022I calls \u0027em as I sees \u0027em.

The most dangerous, of course, is the Tylo mission...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Mine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022...um.

I think it\u0027s time we took that away from him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Yeah, Dude.

Jeb\u0027s lander was a huge beastie, as I recall. Can they even launch something that big with our current Reusable Rockets?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022The ships are already being assembled in Kerbin orbit. The big brains at KSC have determined that Jeb\u0027s lander was a lot bigger than necessary. By using the more efficient Rockomax 48-7S engines and staged/drop-tank landers, they have designed smaller ships that they think can tackle Tylo.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022So not an SSTO lander? I thought they were all about reusability nowadays.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022No. For the mass of a reusable lander, they could send along two or three single-use landers. And it\u0027s not like we expect to do a lot of traveling to and from Tylo\u0027s surface. Also, because of the chances of landing failures, they are sending out two of everything: two crew-landers, two surface-habitats, and two rovers. Here are some of the launch photos.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The first two launches to assemble the Tylo fleet. On the left is one of the Tylo surface habitats, sitting on a Triple-Tug adapter, being boosted on a Reusable Rocket. The Tylo ships will use the same Triple-Tug arrangements used to launch the Vall expedition hardware. On the right is the launch of the central nuclear Tug (and you can also see the returned sustainer from the first launch in the background).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/167Y2NZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022167Y2NZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Ah. So the habitat lander has a Hitchhiker module and a control cabin surrounded by six FL-T400 tanks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022That sounds like my Vall lander.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Similar. But the control center is a single-kerbal cabin, and it has twice as many Rockomax 48-7S engines as the six on your lander. Plus, some of the tanks are droppable. And unlike your Vall lander, this habitat lander is designed for a one-way trip down to the surface.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the central Tug docks with the Tylo Hab 1 payload. My simulations show that the habitat can land on Tylo using just the six FL-T400 tanks...but because I\u0027m not confident about my ability to land on Tylo, I\u0027ve included an extra Rockomax X200-8 drop tank (marked with yellow arrow) to increase the amount of fuel available for final landing maneuvers. It\u0027s surprising how little extra fuel you end up with near the surface after adding all that extra fuel to begin with. A lot of the fuel gets used up just to slow down the extra fuel. \u0022ADD MOAR FUEL\u0022 is not the best plan of attack when tackling Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HM4HRIf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HM4HRIf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022What about the crew lander?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Here you go: Two single-kerbal lander cabins surrounded by six FL-T400 tanks, and a dozen 48-7S engines, only four of which are kept for ascent. That\u0027s supposed to be enough to land and return to orbit. But they also added an extra X200-8 drop tank for more margin. They are sending two of those landers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022So if they crash the first one, they can walk back to orbit and try the second one?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022No. Because the landers have enough fuel to land AND return to orbit, the designers feel confident that the crew can land...but maybe not with enough fuel left to return to orbit. So the second lander can be sent down to see it it makes it with enough fuel to return to orbit. And if not, the ships are designed with surface refueling capabilities. Hopefully there will be enough fuel in all landed ships to get one of the landers back to orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Tylo Lander 1 being launched on a Reusable Rocket. The Refueler Topper on top carried fuel to be transferred to the nuclear Tugs later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dcxF5YA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dcxF5YA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Refueler Topper also provided the fuel and engines used for the orbital maneuvering to get the Tylo Lander docked to the Triple-Tug assembly in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W84JtQ2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W84JtQ2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8PucLKA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228PucLKA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the launch of Tylo Lander 2 shows a different view of the Lander configuration. You can see the 1x1 structural plate and junior docking port sticking out from one of the tanks that provides the surface-docking capability (tested using prototypes at the KSC). On the right is the return of the Reusable Rocket sustainer to KSC. I just let Mechjeb handle that, and I decided to let all of these sustainers sit on the ground until all of the launches for the Tylo armada were finished (just for fun...despite the slowly increasing launch site lagginess it caused).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JEcv3R1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JEcv3R1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of the Tylo Lander payloads were successfully docked to the Triple-Tug assembly on either side of Tylo Habitat 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q0C6AJP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Q0C6AJP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, two more standard nuclear tugs were launched to complete the first of the Triple-Tug assemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EubuovA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EubuovA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the third nuke docks to the Triple-Tug ship. Afterwards, the fuel from the Toppers was used to top off the tanks on the Tugs. Then the Refueler Toppers were separated and the small amount of fuel left in them was used to return the Toppers to KSC for parachute landings. At this point, not all of the tanks of the ship were completely full because of the extra fuel storage space provided by the three tanks in the Triple-Tug adapter...but I\u0027ll take care of that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aAjQ1BS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aAjQ1BS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o3MrCBt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o3MrCBt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext came the launch of Tylo Habitat 2 and the central Tug of the second Triple-Tug ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yHq7uVh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yHq7uVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022So what do we get for a rover, Dude? We can\u0027t explore Tylo with BirdDogs.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022The rovers are based on the eight-wheeled Fido design with a cockpit and a single-kerbal cabin as a habitat module.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022So it\u0027s like the Fidos we used on Vall. The two-cockpit model you have here on Laythe is fine, but for long exploration drives, it really is nice to have the extra room of that cabin where one of you can stretch out and get some proper rest. Does it include lab facilities?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Some, but most of the lab facilities are in the Habitat Landers, so samples will need to be returned there for more analysis.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022These drawings show that the Tylo Fido has four FL-T100 tanks built into it frame.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Those hold some of the fuel for landing, AND they allow the rover to carry fuel between ships if needed. There are junior docking ports at two corners of the frame for surface docking to the Habitats and Landers. The four FL-T400 tanks on the sides hold most of the fuel for landing, and those are jettisoned after landing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bQQpoH2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bQQpoH2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second Tylo Fido rover and two more nuclear Tugs were launched to complete the assembly of the second Triple-Tug. Each Triple-Tug has a Habitat lander in the center, and then either two Landers or two Fido rovers on the sides (I did it this way rather than putting a complete set on each Triple-Tug because this way had better balance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MvTKCNJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MvTKCNJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the second Fido rover payload approaches the Triple-Tug core in the dark of night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hiw2IfN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hiw2IfN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the second Triple-Tug ship was complete, the Refueler Toppers gave up most of their fuel (again, not quite enough to fill all tanks on the Triple-Tug) and were separated and returned to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/odrOEYs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022odrOEYs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, a Refueler Topper descends over KSC. Eleven of the twelve returned sustainer stages from the Reusable Rockets can be seen in the background (the other on is out of sight below where the Topper is landing). Not seen, of course, are the 48 recovered side boosters of the Reusable Rockets that would be ringing the launch area within a couple kilometers (because those get de-spawned during their descents back to KSC), but you may join me in picturing them off in the distance. You can also join me in picturing the gleeful hand-rubbing by the rocket manufacturers over all the refurbishing work that now needs to be done on all those stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SmjAYCT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SmjAYCT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude...so if all of this equipment is going to Tylo, how do Aldner and I get there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022They are also sending the interplanetary crew transfer / orbital habitat ship that was going to bring out the Tylo exploration crew.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Now that looks exactly like our Vall ship.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Yes. It will come here to Laythe on a double-tug train with plenty of extra fuel, so our Tylo explorers can use it to get to Tylo...and later to Bop and Poll as needed. Others of us can use our Laythe transfer ship and Vall transfer ship to head outward as needed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, to send the Orbital Habitat/Transfer ship out to Laythe, I used a double-tug that had previously been returned to Kerbin from Laythe, which was waiting in Kerbin orbit. The small amount of fuel it had left on board was enough to rendezvous and dock with the Tylo Orbital Hab payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oND6Tww.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oND6Tww.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause that double-tug was almost empty, it needed to be refueled. The two ships below were launched to refurbish the double-tug. The Refurb A payload on the left is just two Rockomax X200-32 fuel tanks and a nose cone that has a probe body and solar panels and a couple Sepratrons. It has no orbital maneuvering capability, so the Refurb B payload would have to perform the rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fSygcnE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fSygcnE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Refurb B ship climbs toward orbit on the Reusable Rocket sustainer, and pops off its nosecone after the side boosters were dropped and the gravity turn started. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0UJ8LHr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220UJ8LHr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, the Refurb B docked to the rear of Refurb A. Then the ship was pointed retrograde and the two Sepratrons on the Refurb A nosecone were fired to deorbit the nosecone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/snifSdM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022snifSdM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the combined Refurb ship rendezvoused and docked with the Tylo Orbital Hab/double-tug ship. The two full tanks were left attached to the double-tug, and most of the fuel from the Refurb B ship was transferred to the double-tug. Then the Refurb B refueler was separated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eMzHujk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eMzHujk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Refurb B refueler deorbited using its remaining fuel, and landed at KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZTRUpU1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZTRUpU1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe double-tug was not completely full at that point, so another Reusable Refueler (identical to the Refurb B ship) was launched (below, left...Sorry about the night launch picture). The Refueler docked with the Tylo Orbital Hab/double-tug and topped of its tanks (below, center). Then the Refueler separated and docked with each of the Triple-Tug ships in turn to top off their tanks (below, right). The Refueler was still not empty, so it was left in orbit for future use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bXWGYKO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bXWGYKO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three ships of the Tylo fleet were then ready to send off to Jool when the transfer window opened. The burns were done in two parts (as I typically do). Because of the fuel in the Triple-Tug adapter tanks, those heavier ships required longer burns (a little over 20 minutes). The ship carrying the Landers tolerated physical time-warp OK, but the ship carrying the rovers was too wobbly in time-warp (because the masses of the rovers were too much heavier than the mass of the central Tylo Habitat lander, I think...it pays to balance the weights of your payloads when using a triple-tug arrangement). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ash4Gfx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ash4Gfx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MPlkI0r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MPlkI0r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ETug Transfers, Etc. Etc.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I got the Tylo fleet headed off, Kerbal Alarm Clock reminded me that it was time to send some other double-tugs back to Kerbin from Jool. These were the tugs that had been earlier boosted away from Laythe into Jool orbit (or, in one case, whipped outward by a Tylo encounter) to await this transfer window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burns for the two ships waiting in Jool orbit were straightforward, but the burn for the double-tug that had used the gravity assist from Tylo gave me more difficulty. It turned out that the ship was not quite out of Jool\u0027s sphere of influence yet, and setting up the necessary maneuver node was not easy (the directions were odd). I ended up mostly eyeballing it, and had to send the ship cutting back across Jool\u0027s S.O.I. the other way so that it would leave in a retrograde direction. It still took less delta-V than the other tugs, but I didn\u0027t save as much as I had hoped...and it certainly was a bigger pain. The problem mainly occurred because the Tylo gravity assist had actually sent the ship out in the wrong direction. The gravity assist from Tylo SHOULD have been timed to fling the ship out in a retrograde direction (whereas I hadn\u0027t timed the Tylo encounter at all...I just accidentally ran into it and decided to use if for fun). Below, pictures of the two double-tugs that departed from Jool orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2T3ZYGO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222T3ZYGO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting those double-tugs sent off, Kerbal Alarm Nagger let me know that the Tylo fleet ships (out near Duna\u0027s orbit by then) needed attention for their plane-shift/fine targeting maneuvers. In all three cases, I target the ships toward Laythe encounters (example trajectory shown below)... but not just any old Laythe encounters. The encounters were targeted to come in tangent to the far side of Laythe\u0027s orbit. This requires the minimum aerobraking delta-V (as I found out previously by comparing incoming trajectories). This results in the most gentle aerobraking possible. The Tylo Orbital Habitat/transfer ship will be aerocaptured at Laythe, but the two Triple-Tug ships will just use Laythe to aerobrake into Jool orbits that will allow them to continue out to Tylo\u0027s orbit. I\u0027m looking forward to trying that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rd3HLo6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Rd3HLo6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the midcourse correction burns, one of the Triple-Tugs (the one carrying the rovers) had depleted its rear tanks, so those were dropped in orbit around the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kUY0xGO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kUY0xGO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, Kerbal Alarm Clock reminded me that it was time to tweak the orbits of the tugs that were returning to Kerbin. It\u0027s always something. These only needed small burns (still out close to Jool where things move slowly), and all three double-tugs were targeted for aerocapture passes at Kerbin (they\u0027ll need tiny tweaks after entering Kerbin\u0027s S.O.I.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PGHeoIL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PGHeoIL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow you can see the resulting trajectories from my efforts: Three payloads heading from Kerbin to Jool, and three heading from Jool to Kerbin. Note that all of these transfers are done in my alternate time-synced save-game, so that there is less overall lag (that would otherwise be caused by all the ships that exist in my regular save-game file). Not seen on this trajectory plot is the ShoreLab payload that would be currently approaching Jool. That\u0027s because I\u0027d already zipped ahead earlier in my timey-wimey ways and taken care of that, so that ship was already pasted back into the main game file waiting for its time to appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DHB6TA3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DHB6TA3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EShoreLab Studies\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, let\u0027s take care of the ShoreLab payload now (since Kerbal Alarm Clock was telling me that it was time for it to appear). Below we see the ShoreLab on Laythe Tug 3 (which is returning to the Jool system from Kerbin yet again...hooray for reusable toys). It was targeted for a direct aerocapture at Laythe, but not for a low-relative-velocity encounter like those discussed above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/raHGj5j.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022raHGj5j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the ShoreLab/LaytheTug 3 ship is shrouded in plasma as it is captured at Laythe.

This is because the game remembers (for reasons I\u0027m not clear about), the last UT times when you activated/deactivated these items...and it won\u0027t let you control them again until after that UT time has passed. So, if you run the game time forward far enough, these unresponsive systems will again be controllable. Or, you can go into the persistance file and find these settings at the end of the vessel\u0027s data, in a section labeled ACTIONGROUPS. The code there shows the names of these systems, whether they were left on or off (true or false), and the UT time they were last controlled. If you change those UT time settings to zero, the systems will respond again at whatever time you\u0027re at. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the ShoreLab separates from Laythe Tug 3, and uses its four Rockomax 24-7 engines to deorbit.

The ShoreLab landed about 1.5 kilometers from the shore. With all the chutes deployed, the ship landed at a little under 8 meters per second -- a bit hard, but the parts of the ship are strutted to handle that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YBJBRAS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YBJBRAS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for building the ShoreLab was to get a look at what the topography of Laythe is like under the sea. On Kerbin, the oceans are transparent, and you can look down from above to see what the terrain is like offshore, such as the continental shelves and dropoffs to the abyssal plains. But on Laythe (at least on my computer, with the video settings I use), the seas on Laythe are NOT transparent, and I can\u0027t see what the terrain is like under the sea. I suppose it must be because of all the cyanobacteria that inhabit the surface of Laythe\u0027s oceans and are responsible for the rather substantial fraction of free oxygen in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ShoreLab is equipped with jet engines and parachutes that allow it to hop from place to place on the ocean. The cupola module on the underside of the ShoreLab will allow views of the undersea terrain, at least if its within range of the six high-intensity illuminators that are mounted around the cupola. At least it worked when tested by Jebediah offshore at the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew members chosen to conduct the ShoreLab mission were Emilynn Kerman (master pilot), and Dr. Hellou Kerman (who hopefully can make sense out of what is seen below the surface). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Keep in touch, especially whenever you are going to make a hop. If anything goes wrong, I can send out Aldner in the BirdDog to scout the situation, and Kurt in the old \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFido if a land pickup is necessary. If the ShoreLab breaks down off shore, we can use the NAMOR marine rescue ship to pull you out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Yes, yes. We\u0027ve gone over this.

The main body of the ShoreLab consists of a Hitchhiker module and a downward-facing Cupola pod. Four standard jet engines mounted on four FL-T200 tanks provide the in-atmosphere maneuvering power. The four 24-7 radial rocket engines that were used to de-orbit the ship could still be used, if needed, but they are not expected to be used (the jet engines are so much more efficient) and are deactivated with an action group. The four landing structures are built of girders to provide a wide, stable base both on land and in the water (because, as everybody knows, metal girders make great flotation devices...at least in KSP). There are some important struts between the cupola and hitchhiker module, and between the jet engines and the main body -- these were found to be necessary during tests of the prototypes offshore at KSC (otherwise parts can break off during a hard landing or rough parachute deployment. I could say that Jebediah gave his life finding this out...except that he strangely seems to be alive and well back on Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/859SSbk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022859SSbk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst order of business: Emilynn climbs up and starts repacking the eight parachutes.

The first thing Emilynn did after landing was climb up and repack the chutes. This is not a step you want to forget. It\u0027s kind of odd, because she emerges from the cupola upside-down on the ladder, but there is a short piece of ladder oriented at 90 degrees (at her current location in the picture below) that allows her to turn around at that point.

The animated image below showed what the view looked like when the ship was wobbled a bit side-to-side with its reaction wheels. This is important because it helps differentiate which features in the view are real terrain, and which are artifacts (such as the lighter area in the center where the illuminator beams overlap). The ship can also be rotated around its vertical axis to see other parts of the bottom currently hidden by the control panel (just more sand ripples in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5XAQa20.gif\u0022 alt=\u00225XAQa20.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur heroines spent the night at this location to see if there were any illumination differences on the bottom between night and day (there were not -- the surface of Laythe\u0027s oceans is pretty effective at blocking light. Again, it must be all that pesky cyanobacteria. The thermometer reported a temperature of 4.72 degrees...normal for Laythe\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bqTpQ1C.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bqTpQ1C.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, Emilynn went out for a swim. As you can see, if you look at just the right angle, parts of the ship are faintly visible below the water. She was floating fairly high in the water her (compared to the bottom-of-helmet-level which is more the norm).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nijV5Sa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nijV5Sa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found out that if Emilynn dropped from the top of the ladder (up by the chutes) into the water, she would sink down and go rag-doll where the ladder extends below the ship. I could then zoom below the surface and get a view of the bottom illuminated by the lights...but I couldn\u0027t look in other directions or the view jumps back up above surface. And moving Emilynn at all causes her to pop back up above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kjUo8PF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kjUo8PF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, another jump, this time out to about 7.1 kilometers from shore. Emilynn again used the jet engines to slow the descent before parachute full deployment and before landing (speeds are displayed this time, in case you are interested).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2eCCh9b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222eCCh9b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YQcU5h3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YQcU5h3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view from the Cupola out at 7.1 kilometers was quite dark...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kt2GhYg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kt2GhYg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but with some Photoshop enhancement of the brightness and contrast, details can be seen. The spacing of the sand ripples shows that the bottom is considerable deeper here. There are some artifacts in the view (in the upper left and right) that are caused by the jet engine nozzles and struts...although, oddly, it seems like we can see through parts of them). What are ship-part artifacts and what are not can be determined by wobbling the ship, remember. But that rough lighter patch in the middle (and smaller lighter patches elsewhere) are real terrain features, and are apparently steeply-dropping terrain. So we appear to have located the distance where the island shelf is dropping down to the depths of the sea. Alas, no cool volcanic vents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u8itN2d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022u8itN2d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe location of the ShoreLab 7.1 km from shore is shown in the map view below. Alas, as cool as the cloud mod is for making planets look pretty, it IS inconvenient when you want to take map view snapshots. It would be nice if it had some obscure keystroke combination that could toggle the clouds on and off easily. That probe icon further out is one of the Ocean Probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2tyih9F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222tyih9F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother hop maneuver is shown below. The navball is your friend while doing these (note that the navball shows we are upside down because the cupola is upside down...but you can choose to \u0022control from\u0022 the top docking port if this bothers you. First, liftoff and tilting to the right to pick up horizontal speed; then tilt opposite direction to kill the horizontal speed (watch the prograde or retrograde marker on the navball); by the time the horizontal speed was killed and the jet engines spooled down, the altitude had risen to about 3,000 meters where the parachutes were deployed when the vertical speed hit zero. Then descent was as before with jet engine slowing before chute full deployment and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EsnH1XO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EsnH1XO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis hop put the ShoreLab down about 8.6 kilometers out from shore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hYVn1un.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hYVn1un.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view from the cupola here looked completely dark to me, so this was the distance at which I halted the exercise. But later Photoshop enhancement showed that there were indeed terrain details to be seen. The spacing of the ripples (and darkness of the image) shows that the seafloor is even deeper here, of course, and there are lots of the lighter areas that indicate the seafloor is continuing to drop away quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YvljPYP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YvljPYP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QEZeSuV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QEZeSuV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next hop was back toward shore to a location about 7.8 kilometers from the coast.

For this reason, each of the six illuminators can be toggled on/off separately via action group keys to reduce the illumination. Also, the illuminators were mounted at various angles to spread out the beams. In the image below, only three of the illuminators (ones without much overlap of their beams) are on to prevent from blinding us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EhQug2Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EhQug2Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022OK, Chickadee.

There are two rovers stacked one atop the other, topped off with a Refueler Topper. Unfortunately (not shown in the images), I failed to notice that Jebediah Kerman had snuck on board one of the two rovers for the launch. Arrrgh. He is ALWAYS doing that crap. \u0022Just checking out all the systems before the launch!\u0022 I always have to remember to remove him before launch.

At this point the ship was not completely full of fuel...but I would take care of that later.

Below, refurbished Laythe Tug 6 was launched on a Reusable Rocket. In the right image, you can see the nuclear engine fairings have ejected and the side boosters (previously separated) are further below. This was just before the start of turnover at 18 kilometers, so all this stuff will fall back onto \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E property.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P5sabfR.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P5sabfR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, Tug 6 has docked to the Pol ship, and then MechJeb returned the sustainer to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

These landers are way overpowered for Bop and Pol (with six tanks of propellants and six Rockomax 48-7S engines each), but they are expected to make multiple hops on those small moons to meet up with they rovers as the travel across the moons. This way the crews won\u0027t have to spend so much times on long trips living in just the rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LyAMIuu.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022153.67\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LyAMIuu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, the stack of two Fido rovers was launched to the Pol ship. Some people question the usefulness of rovers on such low gravity bodies as Bop and Pol, but I think they will work well. These rovers DO have the newer wheels for better traction. They also have integrated propellant tanks and engines, so they can travel back up to orbit, if needed, around Bop and Pol. Note that there are also two small landers on top of the rovers that will carry a materials bay and goo canisters down to the surface -- the kerbals will visit these landers with their rovers to pick up the SCIENCE.

The girder was separated before the fine targeting of the landing so that it would not land too close to the sustainers lined up at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Or, that was the plan, anyway. The girder actually stayed pretty close to the Topper during reentry, and as the Topper was descending over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, the girder smashed in between a couple of the sustainers further to west like some freakin\u0027 Rod of God (sorry...I missed snapping a picture of the explosion, but the yellow arrow marks the impact point).

To retrieve Jebediah, I took the opportunity to try out the new Rapier-powered \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Crew Carrier 5. My previous standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Crew Carrier used six jet engines -- this ship used six RAPIER engines. The older \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E carried six kerbals -- this version only carries four. Rather than put two ram air intakes on top of each engine nacelle (like the older ship), I arranged six of the intakes on top. I figured that as long as I had this much frontal area in the center, I\u0027d cover it with intakes (to reduce the overall frontal area of the ship). The small fuel tanks that the RAPIERs are mounted on have their oxidizer levels tweaked down to 50% because only fuel will be used when the RAPIERs are in air-breathing mode, so no need to bring along excess oxidizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BSVxrxO.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022123.33\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BSVxrxO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill Kerman decided to pull rank and pilot the ship (hey, his old buddy Jeb got to fly, so why not him?). With the six RAPIERs in air-breathing mode, it took a few seconds for the thrust to build up and lift the ship off the pad.

By 10 kilometers it was tilted a little over 20 degrees from vertical, and had picked up almost as much horizontal speed as vertical speed. The idea is to pick up horizontal speed while still in air-breathing mode... but this is not a winged \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the thrust from the RAPIERs is not all that great, so the ship must be pointed more toward vertical than horizontal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OGfjAey.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022104.67\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OGfjAey.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, at 15 kilometers the tilt was about 32 degrees from vertical, and the ship was slipping sideways at 242 meters/second.

Bill pressed the button with the big number 1 on it to switch the RAPIER engines to closed-cycle, rocket-power mode. It probably would be safer to do that right at 22 kilometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dobN0xu.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002269.60\u0022 width=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dobN0xu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the RAPIERs were in closed-cycle mode, Bill seemed much happier.

The Refueler then returned to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022prH9DaV.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/prH9DaV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this construction project, you can see the line of eight Reusable Rocket sustainer stages, three Reusable Refueler Toppers, one \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Crew Carrier, and one Reusable Refueler all in a row where MechJeb had deposited them. The accountants can start totaling up the money saved, and the rocket companies can start refurbishing this hardware for re-use in future construction projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ayUZIhK.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ayUZIhK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, when the transfer window to Jool opened, the Bop and Pol expedition ships were boosted off to the Jool system. Despite balancing the payload weights, the Bop ship (below) was a bit wiggly at over 2x physical time warp, but the Pol ship was happy at 3x physical time warp. I use MechJeb\u0027s SmartASS to keep the ships pointed during these 20-minute-long transfer burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kVm34Bl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kVm34Bl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transfer burns were done in two parts, like always. Below we see the Pol ship on its first swing out from Kerbin. The second parts of the burns for both ships went fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JQCNmA9.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JQCNmA9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ascending nodes for the transfer trajectories (relative to Jool\u0027s orbit) were very close to Kerbin, so those burns were handled quickly. In both cases, the rear fuel tanks of the Tugs had been depleted near the end of their trans-Jool injection burns, so those tanks were separated before the plane-shift burns (below, the Bop ship does its plane-shift burn, leaving its empty tanks behind).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fUrY0mr.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fUrY0mr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately after the plane-shift burns, each ship needed a small fine-targeting burn to aim them toward aerobraking passes at Laythe. These were targeted for when Laythe will be on the far side of its orbit where the ships\u0027 incoming trajectories will be almost tangent to Laythe\u0027s orbit, which will result in the minimum aerobraking heating. These ships will not be captured at Laythe -- they will only use the aerobraking at Laythe to slow them into Joolian orbits with high apoapses, from which they will be targeted to their respective moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iNnaMTl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iNnaMTl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow: After today\u0027s work, we see the Bop and Pol ships are heading out to Jool (with very similar trajectories), following the three Tylo expedition ships (which are now out beyond Dres\u0027s orbit), and the three double-tugs on their way back from Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CHFwKpR.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002299.83\u0022 height=\u0022599\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CHFwKpR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, something weird happened to the orbits of the three double-tugs returning from Jool. If I used fast time warp while taking care of the other ships, the double-tugs would end up in strange orbits that missed Kerbin and had apoapses out beyond Jool. Apparently these ships were re-encountering Jool\u0027s sphere of influence. They had been sent out of Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in a retrograde direction, at speeds slower than Jool, but somehow they were getting these re-encounters. And when this happened at high time warps as the ships crossed into Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and back out again, the orbits of the double-tugs were messed up considerably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get around this bug, I had to back up time (I keep lots of renamed quicksaves just for special occasions like this) and follow those double-tugs through the re-encounters to make sure they crossed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E interfaces at 1x time warp. This still messed with the orbits a little, but all three are again happily on target for Kerbin. I\u0027m not sure why these re-encounters are happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s Next? Well... There is another Kerbin-to-Jool transfer window coming up before the Tylo equipment reaches Jool... and the one after than is when the all-clear will be sounded from further super-flare activity (assuming Kerbol stays quiet...which it will). At that point I can send out the replacement crews to Laythe and turn the current Laythe crews loose on Vall, Tylo, Bop, and Pol. So I was going to use that next window to send out some equipment for use by the new Laythe crews, such as replacement GasStations. But now I don\u0027t want to do that until I see the capabilities of \u0022The Claw\u0022 that will be released as part of the NASA Asteroid Redirect Mission. If The Claw does allow easy surface docking and fuel transfer, I\u0027ll want to re-design my surface refueling equipment before sending it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-10T06:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2020 06:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T08:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImpressive as always \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Love that line of ships next to runway.
