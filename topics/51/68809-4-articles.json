That\u0027s just asking for more trouble than what I\u0027m already in for. But do you see the large trusses holding them together? They fit perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know you already see something questionable. \u0022But Whack!\u0022 you say. \u0022... You can\u0027t have a closed loop! They don\u0027t connect!\u0022 And you\u0027re quite right. Which is why, if you look really close, the trusses that meet in the middle that would be \u0022open\u0022 have a strut connecting them. I find it works wonderfully. Like a locking pin, holding them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith seven core columns, six are on the outside. 360/6 = perfect 60 degree angles between each, giving me nice little equilateral triangles that assure a snug truss fit. By using tanks of equal radii, I can assure the trusses still fit nice. It\u0027s quite elegant. I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI swiped locking pins from this post by Whackjob early on in the thread, explaining the reasoning behind his structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-16T22:10:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2014 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T18:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHerro?
