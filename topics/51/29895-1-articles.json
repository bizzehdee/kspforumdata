Upon launch, when the second stage separated, the central engine was exploded for no apparent reason. However the fearless leaders at KSEP (Kerbal Space Exploration Program) were able to transfer the fuel to the outer engine. However because of the large size of the vehicle, the transfer stage was used a bit earlier than on other rover/probe missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, the crew at KSEP spent their time enjoying watching their multi-trillion dollar Herschel space probe being ejected from the solar system by Tylo \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander successfully landed and the chutes were repacked, however, no real exploration of the area was done. There was not any large rocks in the area, and the lander seemed to have landed in a large open area. The target location was a crater near the equator, but to save precious fuel, which the Carmen 1B is not good at \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E , the lander did not target its landing location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe took off, equatorialized our orbit, then flew home to Kerbin. We touched down off the South Pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a nice mission overall, but we need to do it buttloads better next time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ojf2YDH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ojf2YDH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were 3 guys, Aldory, Steve, and Ribbles, but I photographed this as Aldory\u0027s captain photo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
