Maybe because his two last flys showed him that his EVA suit was waterproofed, and that mystery goo loved both water and space, Jebediah did already know about EVA suit. Without any communication mean to be told how to use EVA suit, he valiantly went on EVA and recorded his observation about many situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo orbits later, Jeb found that the day-night cycle were too fast up there and deorbited, to successfully splash midway between south pole and west desert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVernher found the scientific data collected very helpfull, and stated that the Mun would soon be beyond kerbal\u0027s reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene, excited : \u0022excellent, another record to break!
