Trainer plane? Survey craft?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Neither, experimental engine testbed. We\u0027ve recently developed a new type of jet engine, powered by a new fuel.\u0022 That part was true. Dr. T had to bend the truth a bit for the next part.\u00A0\u0022It\u0027s a very efficient fuel, but we do not have a lot of it. It would be unwise to fly for more than ten minutes, you might run out. And you know we trust you, but please - if there is one aircraft that we need recovered intact - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can Bob come?\u0022 said Sily, already starting for the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, sure, just don\u0027t crash it! The fuel is pretty dangerous!\u0022 The door slammed. Dr. T sat back in his chair, hoping Sily didn\u0027t screw this one up. The world would attack them if they accidentally blew up a flying nuclear reactor over the continent, which is why they had to involve Sily, the only test pilot the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E employed. Not that many people at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E knew about the nuclear turbojet, the second tangible byproduct of Project Timberwind, which even fewer people knew about.\u00A0This flight, although the pilots didn\u0027t know it, would be the fourth mission funded by the top secret Timberwind project. Ironic... Sily searches for information without realizing she is a part of the program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oKI9e4h.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oKI9e4h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we\u0027re in an untested aircraft powered by an untested engine?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yup! Engine spooling up... Wow, it\u0027s slow. And heavy, by the looks of it, and the fuel tank appears to be filled with something. It\u0027s a pretty small fuel tank, don\u0027t you think, Bob?\u0022 Dr. T was listening in on the channel. The fuel tanks had been filled with water and a small hole drilled to drain it out, giving the impression of fuel usage when there was none. The fact that the plane could fly indefinitely could not be betrayed to the crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Z43TWPJ.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Z43TWPJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And, we\u0027re airborne!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You said it, Bob! Wow, this thing has a huge amount of acceleration!\u0022 She pulled the stick back, the plane rapidly responded. \u0022And a lot of maneuverability!

We\u0027re going to hit apogee without flameout. Sure, we only reached 700m/s, but we have a really draggy plane... Imagine what this could do!

The nuclear turbojet had surpassed all expectations - and did not explode. Initially they were worried that it would have incredibly low thrust, but that was not the case. Now, to get Sily and Bob out of the plane before they realized that the fuel gauge was still going down.

Then it was the Extremely Large Radio Telescope detecting that same interference. Then the Overwhelmingly Large Radio Telescope was built, and began seeing patterns in the static... Nothing large enough to be decoded, if it was anything. It was given little thought, nothing more than annoyance. The Oppressively Colossal Radio Telescope would not be complete for several more years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then the crew of Serenity Base picked up the signals from that star while on the far side of Minmus, very faintly on their antenna... The same patterns, slightly clearer, free from the interference of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. And then those involved began to wonder...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plans had been going on for years for a space-based radio observatory, it kept getting cancelled and rescheduled over and over again, ballooning into a very expensive project and was dubbed the Very Expensive Space Positioned Elite Radio Observatory (VESPERO) and due to political reasons, would have also included a nuclear reactor, the second and largest ever put into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it never happened, the prototype was mothballed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, all of the various space probes en route to the various planets were used, briefly, to form a radio telescope effectively the size of the solar system, but with very low total power and accuracy. The team detected the patterns again, and a small group of perhaps 10 Kerbals tried to decode it. And through the haze, they found convincing evidence of patterns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately they tried searching for anything that could be digital data sent by extraterrestrials. Some alphabet, an image-like code, binary patterns, math, physics... Anything. The results were inconclusive. They simply needed a more powerful telescope. They found a rich investor and told him everything - but demanded that it be kept a secret. He agreed to help them, and they recruited two dozen more people, including construction workers, launch schedulers, and a few administrative personnel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey made up a name, Project Timberwind, with a cover story of making wooden windmills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey secretly bought the old, incomplete VESPERO satellite and added on a crewed segment, bought the Copernicus Heavy Structural Test Article from a museum, and, well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MCC4U2W.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MCC4U2W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStupidly launched it without any cover story. They tried to make one in hindsight, but it wasn\u0027t very good. They then recruited a sci-fi writer to write the backstories for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ct1b7Ys.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ct1b7Ys.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTimberwind 1, the Timberwind Space Station, was in a medium Kerbin Orbit. It had to only send data when nobody was looking in order to remain secret, meaning the ground controllers could not use it very much. That is why they needed to get crew up as soon as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut - the little data they could receive from the station was very telling. Obvious patterns. In some form of Binary. Many undecipherable things, but the Timberwind team was nearly certain that the signals were put there on purpose by another species. But for what purpose?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAliens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALIENS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Timberwind team decided that it was of utmost importance that they keep this a secret for now. If word got out, the world would panic. They needed to analyze their intentions first. But their intentions did not seem apparent... They were beaming physics at Kerbin. Simple elemental patterns in binary. The periodic table... But with extra elements nobody had ever synthesized. And particles! Strange particles - Ones smaller than electrons, many different Bosons, and another weird thing - a particle with the exact opposite characteristics from any known matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat better name than antimatter? Given the basic information about this particle, the Timberwind team designed an instrument that could search\u00A0for this stuff. They called it a Magnetometer. They paired it with another instrument and built a satellite around it. They called it Timberwind-2, but came up with a better backstory this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DSIoxPO.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DSIoxPO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe public knew this as NetStar 1, the first commercially built communications satellite. They had actually legally bought a launch onboard an Agesis launch vehicle, the oldest the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E still operated, and the cheapest. It was placed into an elliptical orbit... But, the satellite had its own experimental propulsion system, a new, miniaturized nuclear engine, partially developed using alien technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OKkS578.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OKkS578.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith it, it orbited both moons scanning for the elusive antimatter particle. It was extremely rare, and destroyed itself upon contact with normal matter. The team still wasn\u0027t quite sure what antimatter would be useful for, but if the aliens were trying to tell them what it was from light years away, then it was probably important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey found that the highest concentration of antimatter in the Kerbin system was at the altitude of a medium orbit, in the radiation belts. What they would do with this knowledge, nobody knew. They decided to hire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E again, this time to recover their satellite under the guise of a failure. This was possible due to their investor\u0027s deep pockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fP0BCSx.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fP0BCSx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately Sily blew the payload up, scattering the remains of the nuclear engine all over the plains. Fortunately most of it remained contained, but they could not afford another disaster like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up, in order to find out more, they needed to get two scientists up to Timberwind Station. For this they needed two trained astronauts... So they reached out to the newbies and bribed them heavily to take a two month vacation to Kerlington. Except they were really going to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022grOBYeb.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/grOBYeb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt turns out, annoying Senator Rodfred had been a help, switching the Mun crew transfer to a Galactus mission instead of a spaceplane mission. That meant that three Galactus\u0027s had been built, and one used for the mission... The second one was chartered with tourists to Arkangel station, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E station. The mission would pay for itself, and was about to be switched to a normal Copernicus instead of a Copernicus Heavy, but there were more bribes, and the Timberwind team managed to sneak an experimental spacecraft into the interstage, which was usually filled with a station module, but in this case was empty. This was called the Timberwind-3 mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224uyVK9V.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4uyVK9V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022B7Dbneo.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/B7Dbneo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there the two scientists stayed for 50 days, analyzing data, collecting alien radio waves, and being exposed to half a dozen different times of radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tI62WUi.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tI62WUi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HJWF3X2.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HJWF3X2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey returned with a lot of data, a thousand science points worth, give or take. This was fudged into the monthly statement by messing with the numbers of the other four science labs, those on the Mun/Minmus bases and stations. And they wanted to know more. It would be hard to launch their own space probes, so why not slip their magnetometer into the standard part inventory? It could also measure other things, they just needed the data. So they made a big public show of \u0022inventing\u0022 the magnetometer and the small nuclear engine, at around the same time ion engines were invented. These technologies were all added to one of the new Venture probes, a public mission.

Their fully reusable, if nuclear, devices that carry a dozen travelers to Minmus and back regularly, are quickly making obsolete many other things. While the rocketry division is still leading in payload size (anything larger than 2.5m) and payload mass, they are losing out to the Spaceplane division in the innovation and crew categories. The Generation 3 Galactus capsule was supposed to facilitate far reaching Kerbal exploration, but it had only flown a handful of times, and was fairly expensive. So a radical idea was formed - the Vau capsule.
