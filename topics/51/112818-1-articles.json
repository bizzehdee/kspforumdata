That said, I also started myself with 120 science and a large grant to upgrade basic facilities. I also get twice the funds and science from contracts. Balancing this out is I have RemoteTech and Lifesupport by Thunder Aerospace. (I should post an image of the mods I am using, but I\u0027ve just started to use Linux Mint, and I don\u0027t know how to do that yet.... Once I figure that out, I\u0027ll update this with a pic of the mods I am using. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) Oh yeah, I am using Kerbal Construction Time too.\n\n\\*Cough\\* Anyway, without further ado... Here it begins.\n\nHaving been given an old air force base used by the Kerbal Republic, Slipshot Aerospace has set about upgrading the facilities to support it\u0027s contract to lead Kerbal-kind into exploring the Kerbol system. Corporate (with government support) strategy insisted that test pilots be on the fore front of this effort, and not trained hamsters.... To this end, development of training aircraft has been the first step. The goal of these aircraft is to determine who shall go to space first.\n\nThe Republic sold two obsolescent A-1 attack aircraft along with the rights to build more as the basis for these tests. Accepting delivery of these aircraft, contestants have been put through the simulators. The pilots that crash the least.... Will get the opportunity to fly the real aircraft and the one who demonstrates the most proficiency will be on the first rocket into space.\n\nThe current roster includes the original four draftees.... Err *volunteers* are Jebediah, Bill, Bob and Valentina. Filling out the other six recruits are Tradie, a civilian from Koeing Aerospace. Lagertrude from the Republic Air Force and likes to fly by the numbers, Wenemma and goes by Emma, is from the Republic Navy with countless carrier landings under her belt and fresh from the command of a squadron. Hardon is a Republic Navy test pilot from Katuxent Naval Test Center. Billy-Bobfry is also an Air Force pilot from Kuroc and is the highest flying test pilot so far recorded. Gemzy is also from Kuroc and she is rumored to hold the speed record at mach 2.9.\n\nDespite arguments by Bill and Bob that *pilots* wouldn\u0027t be needed, the competition for the first into space and orbit has been limited to pilots. Sulking, they point out that the first into space won\u0027t actually control their craft.... And that they may even endanger the mission by trying to operate outside of the mission parameters.... Further the first \u0022Rocket rides would be performed by engineers and scientists.... The Brass and the Supreme *Elected* Leader were not impressed and so pilots would be the first into space.\n\nIn 16 days, the E-1 Rocket will be launched, and straws will be selected between Bill and Bob as to who will fly... Err... Ride that rocket on its sub-orbital flight. All of Kerbin awaits with trepidation and excitement the winner of the contest. Who will be first into space? Who will die in the attempt? Will it be gloriously explosive? Can the Republic beat the Kerbal Socialist States of Kerman into orbit? Stay tuned for further updates!\n\n[http://fizwalker.imgur.com](http://fizwalker.imgur.com)\n\n((If some one can tell me how to embed the actual album into the thread, I would appreciate that.... \u003E.\u003E ))"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T02:36:51Z","Content":"From the United Kerbal Press, by Udgas Kerman.\n\n**A-1 Too Difficult a Standard?**\n\nIt was determined today that the standard A-1 had a too high of a landing speed in simulations and upon landing, braking was asymmetrical.. Specialist 1C Bill suggested that flaps be added to the upper surfaces of the main wing, and thus adopted into the A-1B. With this modification, the A-1B has been determined to be the test aircraft for the competition. As the pilot that was instrumental in discovering the \u0022flaws\u0022 in the basic A-1, Jebediah Kerman has been chosen as one of the first Kerbals from the Republic to be catapulted into space. However, this has delayed the flights of the finalists of the \u0027Space Race\u0027 Much has yet to be accomplished. The capsule has yet to be decided on. The cost has yet to be negotiated.... In short. the first extra-atmospheric flight has parameters that haven\u0027t been set yet.\n\nThe Press has reported Jeb as saying.... \u0022I found these flaws... I flew the best flight... Oh! Hi! \\*Cough\\* You didn\u0027t catch that did you ?.... You did....? Well, I did the work... I should be first! This competition is for PR purposes.... The director\u0027s memory is... Well, it\u0027s not good... No, I fully support... Gaaahg! Get that.... What?! Is that.. No! That can\u0027t be legal! Get away from me!\u0022 Jeb seems to have reacted adversely to our methods of determining honesty. One can only wonder why someone who is being *honest* would object to the best ways of testing the veracity with the probe. The freely *elected* president says we...Oh... We can\u0027t mention that...? \\*Cough\\* Are we broadcasting....? You can edit.... It\u0027s live....? \\*cough\\* (unintelligible) \n\nAnyway! We have reports that the A-1 has been modified with what engineers are calling *spoilers* on the main wing. Those in the military are calling this the A-1B. Generals in the Republic Air Force are saying that this modification will extend the A-1\u0027s service lifetime for the next twenty years! Maybe less. \u0022Kietnam might end in the next decade with this addition to our attack aircraft.\u0022 General West Kermorland stated. Testing continues for the much coveted first into space! This reporter knows Jebediah will make the finalists, no matter the competition! Like our society, the A-1 is changing to what is needed! A smaller, better aircraft, all the better to choose our first Kerbal into space!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T02:42:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fizwalker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T03:15:46Z","Content":"**E-1 To Launch in Seven Days!**\n\nAn Interview By Udgas Kerman\n\nWith the launch of our first sub-orbital rocket, what can be expected?
