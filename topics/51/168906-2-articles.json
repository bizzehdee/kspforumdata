Each century would be divided into ten \u0022contuberniums\u0022, of 8 men, similar to the organization of squads into platoons in modern militaries. The term \u0022century\u0022 is a bit of a misnomer, since one would assume that such a formation would consist of 100 men, not 80. However, a century actually had 20 noncombatant members, two to each contubernium, which would assist the men with carrying supplies, preparing food, maintaining the century\u0027s pack mules, etc. Therefore, while the actual on-paper strength of a century was 100 men, only 80 were combatants.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AMsyAqA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AMsyAqA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tjg8S0R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tjg8S0R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, while the launch vehicle propels the spacecraft up to and during TLI, the lander\u0027s engines are responsible for any mid-course corrections, as well as the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn.

The yellow marker in the center is the landing site, pictured above. Immediately above it, the red symbol marks the landing site of the rover\u0027s delivery frame and the North Debris Field which the crew explored during EVA 2. The two blue triangles to the far left of the image represent the flags planted at the Arch. One flag is at the arch\u0027s base, and another is on its crest. At the far right, the single blue triangle marks the flag planted by the western rim of Crater Two. The rest of the crater complex is located to the north of the flag. Crater One is nearest to the landing site, Crater Four is the extremely small crater at the very top of the photo, and Crater Three is between One and Four.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-24T18:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oL2cdC0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oL2cdC0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the sun sinks lower in the sky and the shadows lengthen, the crew begins shutting off non-essential systems in \u003Cem\u003EAurelian \u003C/em\u003E such\u00A0as cabin lights, landing radar, and communications with\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMarius\u003C/em\u003E, preparing the lander for its low-power hibernation, which will be necessary to keep the lander\u0027s batteries at a safe power level throughout the long lunar night.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ay6jA34.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ay6jA34.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the sun finally disappears beneath the horizon, the crew sees Kerbin wax to a greater size than any previous landing crew has witnessed.

Shortly before climbing the ladder, the mission commander takes a moment to survey the valley in which he and his crew have spent the last four days. He is unsure if he will get a chance to return to the lunar surface, and he doubts that anyone will ever return to this particular landing site. The ground has proven to be generally subpar for base construction, the only real features of interest are surrounded by extremely difficult terrain, and the level of resources in the surface has been determined to be disappointingly low. The crew\u0027s personal recommendation\u00A0is that this site be struck from the list of potential base locations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DEJH8mO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DEJH8mO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew spends the next day and a half inside their lander, waiting out the night.
