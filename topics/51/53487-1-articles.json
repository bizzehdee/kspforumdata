That island runway is even more tricky cos its that much narrower and shorter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etip for landing space planes; lots of reaction wheels. helps deal with the shift in weight once they are low on fuel and their tendency to tumble when they reach the lower atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso park a small rover a couple hundred meters from the ends of the runway, then select it as a target on your approach, helps you get lined up long before you can see it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you want a additional plane landing challenge; land in IVA mode! it\u0027s awesome!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsfalconero","CreatedById":89120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T07:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow long is the Island runway anyway? I noticed planes I could easily land on the KSC runway run out of strip incredibly quickly. Of course, the KSC runway is also plenty long.
