This probe would be about 80% heavier because of it would have twice the Xenon gas fuel needed to circularize the orbit. Also the craft would need a larger lift package and a liquid fuel boost system to take it to solar orbit. The liquid fuel using nuclear assist engines would be used in the slowing of orbit speed to bring the periapsis as close to the sun as possible. The lift package is designed in such a way as to not leave any space debris in orbit around Kerbin (Kerbin Clean Space Act Mandates). Space debris around the sun is acceptable because of the great distances and its extremely low likelihood of it posing a problem for any other crafts in future travels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoto of LSO probe in construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54171727/KSP/KRAK/2013-12-07_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-12-07_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the LSO probe was being constructed, a mission order was sent to Scott Kerman to fill all tanks with Kethane, convert to other fuels and fill those tanks and then top off the Kethane tanks and return to Arkeinen Station in orbit around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoto of Lunar Miner in orbit around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54171727/KSP/KRAK/2013-12-04_00003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-12-04_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoto of Arkeinen Station coming into view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54171727/KSP/KRAK/2013-12-04_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-12-04_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoto of successful docking to Arkeinen Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54171727/KSP/KRAK/2013-12-04_00005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-12-04_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext after this was the lift-off and orbit of the LSO Probe. It was a bright and sunny day for the local Kerbin population and we had record turnout of visitors to the KSP Space Center along with record sales for silvaneers and other swag. Signatures from previous Kerbonauts and tours were a plenty and the excitement was to the Mun. Children of all ages came to see the heaviest launch of a Kerbal made object so far. To The Stars was played on every public speaker for all to hear and sing.

This should still suffice as to it\u0027s job of collecting data and transmitting that data back to Kerbin. So far, it is determined that there is no Kethane gas in un-burned form on the surface of the sun. Only preliminary scans have been done (2 blocks).

In addition, the Korse Communication Satelites have fallen out of syncronous orbit. Reposition them to be in K-sync orbit and 90 degrees apart from eachother.
