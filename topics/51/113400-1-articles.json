The launch date was set to 2009 but due to more testing it was delayed to 2011. \n\nCuriosity with the atmosperic protection\n\n![dLdDYvZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/dLdDYvZ.png)\n\nCuriosity with the second descent stage (retrorockets and parachute)\n\n![p3JgiGs.png](http://i.imgur.com/p3JgiGs.png)\n\nThe launch system was set to be the Atlas V rocket, having more than enough power to set Curiosity on a trajectory with Duna.\n\n![oBIWbJw.png](http://i.imgur.com/oBIWbJw.png)\n\nPart 2: LAUNCH\n\n10:02, 26 nov, 2011: Kape Kanakerbal, Fl, United Kates\n\nThe ground is trembling under the sound of the ascending Atlas V rocket roaring into the sky. \n\n![XjQ8q3v.png](http://i.imgur.com/XjQ8q3v.png)\n\n![X5Ay7bw.png](http://i.imgur.com/X5Ay7bw.png)\n\nAt 32.000 metres the second stage is detached from the first stage wich kicks in immediatly.\n\n![oHKKNfF.png](http://i.imgur.com/oHKKNfF.png)\n\nOrbit is archieved at 170 kilometres and the first stage falls away.\n\n![BcqqK55.png](http://i.imgur.com/BcqqK55.png)\n\n![oLEQLR7.png](http://i.imgur.com/oLEQLR7.png)\n\nTo encounter Duna, Curiosity will first do a TDI (Trans Dunar Injection) \n\nand one or two trajectory correction burns during the transfer.\n\nImage from Flight Planning for the settings of the TDI\n\n![a9kjQwj.png](http://i.imgur.com/a9kjQwj.png)\n\nTo be continued....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T12:17:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 12:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ferdoni**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T16:39:23Z","Content":"A nice project.
