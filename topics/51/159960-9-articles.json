Also, I\u0027m changing the BFR design again, it\u0027s titanium and will feature a reusable raptor based third stage for direct GEO insertion of communications satellites without refueling. It will also be useful as a Phobos/Deimos exploration vehicle once you dock a Dragon to it. We\u0027re also shrinking Raptor so we can have 42 engines. And since the hopper is now outdated we\u0027re donating it to Blue Origin as a peace offering, which will also make it practical to launch the New Shepard as a 2 stage vehicle that could reach orbit... Except we\u0027re sticking a ULA ACES between the two stages, and we\u0027re modifying the New Shepard stage to be restartable and long term storable (really hard with hydrogen). These will be ready for launch in 9-16 weeks, and will have a first mission of intercepting and destroying Starman, who has, unfortunately gone rogue and must be destroyed. We\u0027ll launch a replacement in the form of a Starliner spacesuit posed on a tricycle. Or maybe a skateboard.

And then the scope of the story exploded into much more than it was originally supposed to be, further diminishing his effect. So, if I ever do a revision of the story, which I want to do but may not have time, I will probably replace him entirely with someone with a similar personality. And I have finally admitted to myself that this whole thing isn\u0027t much more than a rough draft. There is so much that can be fixed in this story. There are plot points\u00A0that I started writing towards and abandoned in favor of something better, there are formatting inconsistencies, general inconsistencies, and characters with no defined personality, like Alonya and Marie.

So we\u0027ve figured out Marie\u0027s... And I\u0027m not going to talk about mine... But what about Cheng\u0027s? He told Alonya to be careful on Laythe. What could that mean?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably that something bad happens on Laythe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s the obvious answer, yes. But given how big of a deal Marie\u0027s seemed to be, Alonya getting stranded on Laythe and not coming back seems like not enough to compare.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sometimes the monolith tells you big things, sometimes it tells you small things.

We don\u0027t use them often. There had never been more than two in existence at once until we began the challenge.\u0022 I suddenly felt a bit guilty about using up something that cost the same amount as a Dyson sphere. I decided that I should just accept it, but it keeps nagging me. Why me? Why spend trillions of whatever unit of currency on me? For that matter, why send me to space? Why take me to Earth? Why tell me about the impending apocalypse? I feel like I\u0027m being thrust into the role of hero... I\u0027m not a hero. I mean, I people have told me I\u0027m a good person, but I\u0027m certainly not better than any other decent person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If she does get stranded on Laythe, will you save her?

I\u0027m observing as well, however.

Does The Species have Death Stars? I don\u0027t think they\u0027d make reference to those movies in their invasion. And laser weapons aren\u0027t even that practical anyways... Maybe it\u0027s a weird quantum laser or something. I don\u0027t know if those exist. But apparently, a lot of advanced technology is named by slapping the word \u0022quantum\u0022 in front of it.

The atmospheric engines are antimatter powered, and the antimatter reserves on board are good enough for a few ascents/descents without refueling, but antimatter is not as efficient as you\u0027d expect in atmospheric flight. It can fly around a bit, enough to get pretty far away, but antimatter reserves become a problem quickly. The original Wyvern had a nuclear ramjet instead of an antimatter one, which was much better for flying around. I\u0027m going to try switching out the antimatter ones for nuclear ones to see if it is better, but if I\u0027m probably going to stick with antimatter unless nuclear is just as good as ascent.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCannot fit in any reasonable cargo bay.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHas more drag (I think) than the original Wyvern.

It gets a specific impulse of 15,000 ish at the highest thrust setting, almost double that at the lowest. However, when I added the thermal rocket nozzles, I noticed that they had a specific impulse of 7,000. I only intended to use them for a little extra boost, but I decided to see what would happen if I dropped the fusion engine and replaced it with an antimatter thermal one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, at this point I changed the hydrogen only fuel to a hydrogen fluorine mixture which is more dense, if it only gets a specific impulse of ~4000 seconds (haha, \u0022only\u0022 4,000 seconds!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBOOM. Amazing performance, but only in oxygenated atmospheres, as the thermal rocket can\u0027t operate in just atmospheric mode. I still had to use the thermal ramjets to get up to orbit. Except, the thermal ramjets are vastly outperformed in hydrogen-intake air mode by the thermal rocket engine, giving much more thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I decided to try ditching the side ramjets, leaving me only with a single thermal rocket. Maybe I could do non-oxygen ascents on just rocket power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried that. I ended up with a vehicle with 10km/s of Delta-V with hydrogen and fluorine, plus a little extra hydrogen for oxygenated ascents. It was also single stick, so there was a bit less drag. The size of the engine was dropped to 0.95 meters because it actually had too much thrust. Unfortunately, due to drag, it got to Kerbin orbit with 5km/s left.

The fuel tanks are less heat resistant, so I wrapped them in a fairing. At this point I may as well put the whole thing into a fairing...

I wanted to go all at once, holding hands or something, but Cheng provided me with a long report from mission control (which was populated again! Evelina is on vacation currently and her absence has led to more publicity, and many more people have volunteered!) stating how dangerous going in one group was.

After the last person before me left, I looked up at the stars. I knew I had to leave soon, or wait hours for the next pass of the Voyager. But I felt at that moment that the Bop landing had been the least formal and least poetic of any of the landings so far - more like 9 ordinary people messing around than a few heroic astronauts embarking on an epic journey. Don\u0027t get me wrong, all of our landings have been less formal than Apollo \u00A0- the tip over and skid on Vall, residual thrust, also on Vall, Cheng\u0027s crash and smugness on Tylo, the shock on Pol...

If our calculations are correct, the Voyager will be slightly roasted, but with a short dip into Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, we will enter an extremely elliptical orbit, requiring only a short burn at our apoapsis to stabilize it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t help but notice that Cheng seems like he is a little bit more anxious than usual. He has been extensively helping Alonya practice operating the Laythe plane. Several issues have been found with the Laythe plane, the most pressing being it\u0027s stubbornness in maneuvering. The control surfaces were installed very near to the center of mass, giving it extremely poor maneuverability. In our simulations, pulling up at low velocity is nearly impossible... Alonya will have to use the drogue parachute at just the right moment in order to land intact - and she will have to find a suitable hill to take off from, and possibly use the parachute once more to pull up later on in the ascent. And she will probably have to use her EVA jetpack to reach orbit, and we\u0027ll most likely have to send the Emerson to go get her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I\u0027m saying is, if you\u0027re religious, pray for Alonya.

How long do you have?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not very long, I was just wondering.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, it was an early exploration ship, from before the Galactic Union found us. It was used to explore planets around nearby stars in search of life. A few of this type were built, none of them exactly the same... None of them found intelligence, but a few came close. This one went on around a dozen expeditions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did it always have the Wyvern - well, that particular DAAWEV with it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. The originals were a model or two older.

There were several close calls, including one where a wing was damaged, but no destruction, at least until the end of the exploration series. That ended when we were found by the Union... It became a ceremonial transport ship and the DAAWEVS were made illegal and unnecessary. Most of them were scrapped. After its multidecade long role as a transportation ship for the Jankra\u0027ani ambassador - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry to stop you - but do you know what happened on Erinodor?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh.\u0022 He had his back turned to me, working on something, but one could guess that his face fell. \u0022I assume you found the room.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was locked for centuries, most likely. I got bored, I\u0027ll admit. I don\u0027t often spend weeks on a spaceship with not much to do, I\u0027m afraid... So I learned a spot of lockpicking and got in. It\u0027s not a very practical skill, but I was always curious and I wanted to give it a shot before I died... As to Erinodor... The records aren\u0027t exactly perfect, but most sources say that Tilmen, well... Erinodor was shrouded in clouds that blocked all vision, and interfered with the Legacy II\u0027s sensors. The decision to land anyway was made. The DAAWEV Nobility touched down very roughly on a barren, rocky plane. Lava was prevalent, and ash filled the turbulent, dark sky. The crew looked around outside and took readings for a few minutes before the fierce hot winds drove them to make the decision to get offworld.... Right as they began the journey back to the craft, a sort of volcanic geyser erupted. Hubert and Liselas were not harmed, but... but a large rock landed on top of Tilman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He was not dead, but he was barely alive. The other two crew dragged him back to the Nobility, and managed to get him inside. They hoped to get him to the medical center onboard this ship... But he died due to his injuries during ascent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said nothing for several moments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s... That\u0027s horrible!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A tragedy, but one not known well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A fatality on an interstellar expedition escaping the public eye?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. There were many more important missions going on at the time, and time has certainly passed since then. Tell me, what percentage of the human population do you think knows the name Vladimir Komarov? Or about Soyuz 11? I doubt you could name half of those who died on Challenger or Colombia.\u0022 I realized he was right, and it made me feel sick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Silly me, I forget sometimes that not everyone is as passionate about space as I am...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t check the genealogy records right now, but I fully intend to find Maybelline\u0027s closest living relative and deliver the flower to him or her.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why, you weren\u0027t planning on using it for something, were you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. I would almost never use something that emotionally significant for my own purposes.\u0022 I walked closer to him and looked at what he had been working on. \u0022What\u0027s that, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022o8idRvdODIfB_DpSXAVsUmWUYyXG-aRwETlEba3cB7m4BAUpwJchW3rC2ApDXjy34ijmv733oKbxFZVi4L-DfwRISbhJk_T5wBv0UwTfzvPK-R1Co04SwnHTu1OcEfgVwhqQ2STK\u0022 height=\u0022987\u0022 src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o8idRvdODIfB_DpSXAVsUmWUYyXG-aRwETlEba3cB7m4BAUpwJchW3rC2ApDXjy34ijmv733oKbxFZVi4L-DfwRISbhJk_T5wBv0UwTfzvPK-R1Co04SwnHTu1OcEfgVwhqQ2STK\u0022 style=\u0022border:none;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, this? That\u0027s supposed to be a rose. I took a break from lockpicking and tried my hand at origami. It\u0027s been years since I\u0027ve done any, I thought I should revisit it. I would not die happy had I not revisited old hobbies...\u0022 Something struck me as odd about how he had mentioned death a second time in relation to his hobbies, but I pushed the thought aside. I had more urgent things to worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It looks great, Jeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well thank you, but I beg to differ.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I\u0027m serious!

Let me make sure I have this right.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Crazy idea. The Species is supposed to be this hyper energy efficient race, which has the most efficient way to do everything calculated to a T. I just need to game the system.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Go on!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Enslaving me won\u0027t work. I\u0027m the last of my kind - I\u0027d need a custom atmosphere for optimal work efficiency, and that\u0027s not worth doing for one extra slave, so they\u0027d just kill me.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Yes.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022But they will only kill me if it\u0027s energy efficient to do so. I just need to put myself in a situation where it\u0027s not worth the effort to kill me. That means I can\u0027t pose a threat to any Species operations. Now don\u0027t get me wrong, I really want to help you. It\u0027s all I can do to not ram my ship into one of theirs as fast as I can. I mean, it would accomplish nothing, but it would be symbolic, you know... I can\u0027t bear the thought of so many people suffering...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Now there are people who know what you felt when you lost your planet.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Sadly. I wish that feeling unto not one being, not even those of The Species.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022So, Galactus... How are you going to eliminate yourself as a threat?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Simple. I intend to lock myself in somewhere I can\u0027t get out.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022And how do you intend to do that?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I do not know, but the enclosure must be small, and use only low energy, low value materials. Otherwise, The Species will declare it worthy to be used as an energy source.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022So you have to keep yourself trapped, alive, entertained, and fed using only low value, low energy materials?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Yes. I intend to make a small cabin with a regenerative nearly closed cycle life support system, powered by nothing more than starlight, and place it in a very low orbit of a black hole, possibly the one in the middle of the triangulum galaxy. That way, in order to salvage what little high value matter there is, The Species must dive deep into a gravitational field to get me! Plus, I will be unable to escape the gravitational field as I won\u0027t have a ship! I\u0027ll self destruct mine when I seal myself in!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Two things. That\u0027s moot if they have tech that allows them to bypass that sort of gravitational field, or make use of matter efficiently in its conversion to energy. There isn\u0027t anything we can really do about that, but what about entertainment?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022The enclosure will house three redundant fully immersive virtual reality machines with a replica of the entire known galaxy, where I can live out all of my dreams... And that may be the only way I will ever return to Planet Pock. In a computer simulation.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022...Wow.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022That should keep me occupied until I\u0027m finally dead. No more clones. It\u0027s been a good couple of centuries, I do believe...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022But you\u0027re not going to do that, are you?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know, Xanth. I hate to sound rude, but I could either run away with a small chance of living, or stay and have a chance at a virtual life for as long as I live. My first choice was a time dilated micro-universe, but those are in high demand and short supply. The energy needs are atrocious, too... At this point, it\u0027s a thought experiment. I don\u0027t know what I want to do.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022At all?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Actually, now that I think about it, I do know, Xanth. I want to be happy. I want to have fun. I want to go on an adventure. And I want everyone in the entire universe and beyond, if there is a beyond, to feel the same. But that will not happen. The best I can do is one last lap around the two thirds of the galaxy we still control, visiting all of my favorite worlds one last time, and taking one last longing glance at my friends... Well, road trip time. Would you like to come with me?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I would, Galactus. But I have a planet and a people I need to take care of.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022What I wouldn\u0027t give to have a planet or a people...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so, I tried to write this next bit as a dialogue narrative. As it turns out, I am not good at writing dialogue narratives about semi-awkward yet not awkward social yet slightly romantic yet friendly yet a bit romantic yet confusing situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried. It took me a long time, but then there was a glitch and it got deleted. I took that as a sign, so I\u0027ll just sum up what happened. I mean, it\u0027s not like anyone besides me will ever read this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, Space Prom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, we had both ditched our Kerbal disguises. It was great looking like myself again, I hadn\u0027t seen myself in quite a while. I looked a bit weird. Admittedly, it was also great to see Evelina\u0027s face again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt begins with me showing up in the rotating ring. She had mildly decorated the place, it was as fancy as you could make a semi-industrial spaceship with the limited supplies we had on board. We greeted each other. We smiled. I put the corsage on her wrist, and she complemented me on my origami abilities and asked how long I\u0027d known how to do that for. I told her the truth, less than an hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pinned the boutonniere on the lapel of my (good looking, according to her!) duct tape tuxedo coat. Fortunately, I did not get stabbed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe did a few prom pictures, slightly in jest, with varying backdrops, by using a timed camera on one of the Kerbal smartphones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, BTW, Kerbal smartphones are actually thicker than human ones due to the poor battery technology of the Kerbals. It also allows for the inclusion of a headphone jack and a heavier duty charging cable. Wireless headphones are cool and all, but they get lost quickly. Actually, the charging port was added for the human editions, as Kerbals actually use wireless headphones as they don\u0027t have ears and need something that will reach around their head anyway, so they end up with large headphones that are really hard to lose.\u00A0I mean, they have ears, they are just not super visible and you can\u0027t stick things in them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, back to the topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, we sat down and had dinner. Our favorite of the preserved food on board. And we talked a bit, just a normal comfortable friend talk. We both agreed that it would be great if we had other friends to talk to. She\u0027s great, but at the same time, she\u0027s the only other human that this version of me has talked to for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll too quickly, dinner was over. The music started playing. She had a playlist going, a mix of her favorites, my favorites, and traditional dance hits. We generally goofed off, laughed, and had fun. There was actually a minimum of awkwardness, surprisingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there was a slow song. Something calm and tranquil. I cheesily (on purpose) asked her \u0022May I have this dance?\u0022 and well, we started slow dancing. And it was great - I haven\u0027t slow danced outside of a few isolated, awkward scenarios.\u00A0It continued in a joking manner for a while, but then it got more serious, and we quieted down significantly. But then... Well, I have to do this part in a dialogue narrative. This isn\u0027t the most accurate retelling. It\u0027s definitely not exact,\u00A0 but it is close, and\u00A0this is the gist of how it went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan?\u0022 she asked, with a hint of nervousness in her voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Evelina?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can I be honest with you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Absolutely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And don\u0027t take this the wrong way... But, well, I have realized that I still like you.\u0022 This definitely caught me off guard, but less than I was expecting for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And which way do you want me to take that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The same way you\u0027ve been taking it, I think. It\u0027s not like we can act on it much, with the current state of the universe, and it\u0027s too good of a friendship to risk ruining.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So why bring it up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I feel like I need to say it. I may not get many more chances.\u00A0And while I am in that vein...\u0022 She hesitated. \u0022Ethan Edwards, you are an amazing person. You\u0027re great fun to be around. I feel like every day with you is a new adventure, and not just because of the whole space thing. And I feel really\u00A0safe around you, and I feel like I could talk to\u00A0you about anything.\u0022 I was briefly taken aback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina...\u0022 I hesitated slightly and took a breath.\u00A0\u0022I feel that too. I can be myself around you. I have enjoyed nearly every instant of my time with you.\u00A0And your spontaneity and enthusiasm have not been matched by anyone I\u0027ve met.\u0022 We both were definitely blushing by this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s quite the list, it\u0027s very flattering!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m telling you that I feel pretty much the same way about you that you do about me, you said it about me first!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, copycat,\u0022 she joked, \u0022Anything original?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well,\u00A0you\u0027re cute!\u0022 I blurted out spontaneously. I was actually surprised that I had said that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You really think so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Absolutely. Not that looks are the most important thing, your personality is worth far more than looks could ever be worth.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you have a great smile.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, so now you\u0027re copying me!\u0022 I joked. \u0022And my smile is nowhere near\u00A0as great as yours!\u0022 She turned away, blushed some more, and smiled some more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes it is!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And your laugh, I love your laugh!\u0022 I said. Oops. I didn\u0027t mean to say that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, popping the l-word already, are we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I said I loved your smile, and technically you already used one of the l-words... You said you liked \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I do like you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I like you too!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, then, mister copycat!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Like!\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Love!\u0022 she responded. I opened my mouth to say something more, but stopped myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? What\u0027s wrong?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, what were you going to say?\u0022 I hesitated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Loss.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Loss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t want to lose you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then we will have to win. Win against The Species.\u0022 I\u00A0hesitated again. \u0022Ethan? What\u0027s wrong? You can be honest.\u0022 I took not one, but two deep breaths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right now, I am not as afraid of them as I am of messing up. Messing up this... Messing things up with you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, there are few things you could reasonably do to mess this up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Really?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. And Ethan,\u0022 At this point, we had stopped dancing and were standing close to each other,\u0022 I think you need to be far more confident in yourself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stop for a moment, I need to tell you this. You. Are. An. Amazing. Person. Reading your public journal entries and\u00A0talking to you like this, I see you belittling\u00A0yourself and doubting yourself so, so much. It sickens me. You are worth it, you can do what you put your mind to. Alright?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if I do mess things up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, if you continue to mean well, be kind, and be considerate of others, you could never, ever mess this up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never is a very strong word.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, but\u00A0so is love.\u00A0And Ethan?\u00A0I...\u0022 she hesitated. \u0022I love you. I don\u0027t know in which way, yet, if\u00A0it\u0027s a friend love or something more,\u00A0but I do. And that will not die easily.\u0022 I felt myself beginning to tear up slightly. Okay, maybe more than slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And Evelina... Same as you, I don\u0027t know which way, but, well...\u00A0I love you too.\u0022 I pulled her in for a hug. We stood there, interlocked, for several seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe music continued playing. We slowly resumed dancing, more of a shuffle at this point, much closer. We spun as the wheel spun as the galaxy spun. And then, a song started playing. It was potentially the most beautiful song I had ever heard. It must have been one of hers, as I did not recognize it.\u00A0It was just so... Magical....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a happy song. It was a sad song.\u00A0It was the final song. And about halfway through that final\u00A0song, a feeling passed through me, one I had never felt before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was so many things. Warmth... Contentment... Peace... Tranquility... Ease... Fulfillment... And many, many more. It was\u00A0all of them at once, yet none of them at all.\u00A0But whatever it was, whatever it is called... I felt it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd call me crazy, but I could sense that she felt it too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pulled away ever so slightly, far enough that I could see her face well.\u00A0She looked up, and her gaze met mine. When she saw me, she smiled. It was a soft smile, a kind, welcoming\u00A0smile,\u00A0one\u00A0unlike any other I had ever seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, confidence, you say?\u0022 I whispered, returning that smile. Time began running in slow motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Confidence,\u0022 she responded, nearly breathlessly, as she seemed to hold me ever\u00A0tighter, pull me ever closer, and beckon me even nearer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI closed my eyes and leaned in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022HEY, GOOD NEWS!\u0022 shouted an extremely enthusiastic Jebediah Kerman, racing quickly (and noisily) down the ladder.\u00A0Evelina and I (startled would probably be the biggest understatement of my entire life) abruptly\u00A0pulled back from each other. In the\u00A0fraction of a second it took for him to descend the ladder enough to see us,\u00A0we had put several feet between ourselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have successfully completed our mission!\u0022 He smiled enthusiastically as he climbed down into the room, and then he saw us, looking extremely preturbed, shocked, and embarrassed.\u00A0His face then changed to one of panic. \u0022WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, err - \u0022 I began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I told you a thousand times, your Kerbal disguises are NOT TO COME OFF UNTIL I SAY SO!\u0022 I was momentarily glad for the change in subject. \u0022This was literally the most crucial part of the mission! We had probably a fifty percent chance of dying\u00A0or getting captured by The Species! You could have involved humanity! That\u0027s careless! Reckless! Irresponsible! Irrational! Stupid and idiotic! What the hell were you doing that could have warranted this blatant disrespect for the lives of TRILLIONS of souls of every peaceful race in the galaxy?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um - \u0022 I began, my already preoccupied brain doing gymnastics trying to figure out how to justify and rationalize Space Prom, and also, if necessary, the failed kiss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We had a fifty percent chance of death?\u0022 Evelina was blindsided a second time by this announcement.\u00A0Her face turned the palest of\u00A0whites.\u00A0\u0022We could have DIED?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, that was a real possibility.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what if we had died?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We would have all continued on with our lives via our clones.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OUR CLONES?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Evelina, our clones.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I\u0027m sorry mister immortal Prime Minister of the Galaxy with who knows how many doppelgangers,\u00A0 THERE IS ONLY ONE OF ME!\u0022 Jeb abruptly stopped, frozen, and over the course of the next few seconds,\u00A0his face turned\u00A0from one of panic and anger to one of concern and shock. \u0022And even if there wasn\u0027t, even if there were TEN of me, that doesn\u0027t give you the excuse to put me in extreme danger without telling me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my goodness, Evelina, I\u0027m so sorry!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022FIFTY PERCENT!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I really meant to clone you back on the orbital rings, but you kept hanging around to stare, and I couldn\u0027t find a ship, and... Well... I guess you are right. None of those are excuses for risking your life.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right then, we are still far, far from home, am I going to get cloned NOW, or what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s nowhere to do it for thousands and thousands of light years!, and we won\u0027t need to now! The moment we get home, you are going straight back to Kerbin, where you belong, and you are going to stay there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry,\u0022 I interjected, \u0022but what happens if a clone dies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, Ethan, two things.\u00A0One, you feel a chilling emptiness that eats away at your soul and sanity. I recedes but never goes away entirely, it hangs around for the rest of your life, like a shadow, haunting you until the end.\u00A0I am not used to it, and I never will be.\u00A0That is why I try to die as little as possible. Two, if there is a God, he will have had to decide how the afterlife will work for copies of the same person.\u0022 I felt a chill pass though me. \u0022The risk is not over, but at this point you are most likely not going to die. I still cannot tell you all of the details - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Even after our lives have been risked without us knowing why and just how much?\u0022 interjected Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hush. Tell no one.\u0022 He gathered us in close and whispered to us. \u0022This ship has been cloaked using top secret bleeding edge technology. We ventured out into Species controlled territory. Every ship that has ventured out that far has been destroyed - until now. And we\u0027re back, make no mistake! We survived!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my!\u0022 I said. His enthusiasm was getting to me, and mine was getting to him. It was a positive feedback loop! We both grew ecstatic, as the implications bounced back and forth between the two of us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t see why this couldn\u0027t have been done with a probe!\u0022 asked Evelina, still in her shocked and slightly angry mood. That brought both Jeb and I back down several emotional levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, the mission started as me taking frozen embryos as stealthily\u00A0as I could to a galaxy far, far away to restart civilization. I cloned myself on Voyager to make my clone less traceable, and brought Ethan because he was going to blab. I had to turn back to Kerbin because of a forgotten payload, which was actually a ruse to tell me the improved plan. It could have been done with a probe, but the original mission required an operator to restart society once at the destination, and that ship\u0027s ancient pathetic excuse for a computer was not going to cut it for even much remote piloting! Originally it was just going to be me. I am Jebediah Kerman, I have died dozens and dozens of times. I am not expendable, per se, but despite being a Galactic Representative, I am more expendable than most. The new mission was a slight modification from the old one, so we kept the same hardware in an attempt to speed things up, and maybe it would have also\u00A0 alleviated some suspicion. But then Ethan ran off and got you, I rescued you both, the ship exploded, and we had to find the new one. So, yes, Evelina, it definitely could have been done with a probe if it had been planned that way from the beginning, but it was intended that the only life at stake would be MINE. No Ethan, no Evelina. Just me. Once you joined I could not reasonably get you to leave.\u00A0There.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\u0022Wait... Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Ethan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You were about to take me to a galaxy far, far away on a tiny ship to restart society with a minimal chance of survival, no chance of return if the mission succeeded, and no idea that any of this was happening?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I...\u0022 Jeb was at a loss for words. \u0022It was stupid of me to do that. I should have convinced you to stay. I had no right to potentially put you through that, but in my panic, I let you come anyway, come with me to what I thought would be a lonely life at best, capture and death at worst. There is no good justification for that, Ethan. I am sorry.\u0022 He seemed extremely genuine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And taking off our disguises had no good justification either,\u0022 Evelina replied. \u0022We are both sorry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well - yeah, I guess so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You guess so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean, if I had known that we were about to potentially die, I would definitely have not removed my disguise. But, there was no way of knowing that, and I can\u0027t say that I regret what we did,\u0022 I said. Evelina looked like she was having an internal struggle about what to think, but before she could say anything, Jeb spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What exactly were you doing?\u0022 I looked at Evelina. She looked at me. \u0022Did I interrupt anything?\u0022 I cleared my throat and looked at the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, just a little bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just a bit? Oh, good, I was worried I had interrupted something important.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I mean...\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 asked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, then. I guess I\u0027ll go back to piloting, lockpicking, and origami. He turned to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, Jeb?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes?\u0022 He turned back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How significant was this mission?\u0022 Jebediah looked at her straight in the eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It could be just a fluke, but if this truly works, and is kept secret... I daresay that there may be hope for the galaxy yet.\u0022 Jebediah started walking and turned back, in an extremely dramatic manner, but turned into the ladder that lead out of the centrifuge, banging his head. \u0022Ow!\u0022 He nearly fell over, holding\u00A0his head in pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You alright?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Billions of funds worth of research and development, and they didn\u0027t think to add pads to the ladders.\u0022 Jebediah chuckled ever so slightly, but\u00A0then had a visible moment of realization.\u00A0\u0022Oh, hey, that actually reminds me, the Wyvern still lacks a ladder, I should replace it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that necessary?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s something to do,\u0022 said Jeb. I\u0027ve integrated human weapons with Kerbal missile technology, refined that a few times, exercised, disassembled and rebuilt several subsystems, played chess with myself, and now I\u0027m resorting to lockpicking and origami. Rebuilding a ladder will definitely keep me occupied for a while.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, do you need any medical assistance?\u0022 asked Evelina. Jeb was now walking around, obviously struggling with balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m going to build the best ladder for several light years in every\u00A0direction!\u0022 he announced with loopy enthusiasm,\u00A0as he grabbed onto the ladder and climbed up, back into the central stalk of the Legacy II.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked back at Evelina. She was obviously still an emotional wreck. So was I.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know about you, but I think I could definitely use a rest,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s probably a good idea,\u0022 I said.\u00A0Evelina looked around at all of the Prom supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can clean this up tomorrow.
