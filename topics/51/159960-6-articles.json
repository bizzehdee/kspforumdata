The two Jebs looked at each other for a few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should we tell him?\u0022 asked Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 said Jeb 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, considering the circumstances...\u0022 replied Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, I get your point, fine, I\u0027ll tell him... Ethan, I would try to break this slowly to you, but we don\u0027t have time. There are actually almost 90 known species of intelligent life in this galaxy alone.\u0022 I stood silent for a few seconds, my mouth wide open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Ninety?!?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002288 or 87 at the last count, if I remember correctly. And there is one more that - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022NINETY?\u0022 And you haven\u0027t told the humans at all?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s not my-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what does this mean for peace!?! What does this mean for philosophy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, please -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What does this mean for religion!?!?!?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022ETHAN, IF YOU WILL BE QUIET FOR A SECOND - \u0022 began Jeb 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tone of voice, Jeb,\u0022 replied Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry. Ethan, just calm down, and you\u0027ll get some answers.\u0022 With no real other option, I laid back in defeat and prepared for one really long explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you done freaking out?\u0022 Asked Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 I replied, \u0022For now, at least.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. To answer your most recent question, the whole religion thing has still not been proven one way or another - interesting parallels have been observed even across planets, and the odds that there is more than one universe are arguably pretty high, but nobody knows for certain and everyone is as divided as ever.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022O-kay, then, so that doesn\u0027t change anything...\u0022 I said, partially confused, partially relieved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As for us,\u0022 said Jeb 1, \u0022The original Jebediah Kerman died several hundred years ago after a freak rocketry accident involving parachutes in the first stage. About a hundred years later, the Kerbals were discovered by the Galactic Council and immediately inducted. Jebediah was then brought back to life and cloned - he was found to be one of the most suitable leaders. He became the Representative of Kerbin, the second highest position anyone can hold in the entire galaxy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, I\u0027m sort of following this... Why didn\u0027t we get inducted?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To put it kindly,\u0022 said Jeb 2,\u00A0 \u0022you are one of the most violent, vile, selfish, racist, and cruel races we have ever come across. We had to test you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI began to protest, before being cut off by Jeb 1. \u0022None of that matters any more, though!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why?\u0022 I asked. I began to take a sip of water from the container strapped to my spacesuit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Skipping to why we\u0027re here,\u0022 said Jeb 2, \u0022We recently discovered a new species that is several million times bigger than all 88 of us combined and wants to take over the galaxy.\u0022 I spit my drink out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022WHAT?!?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They could undoubtedly delete our galaxy in a second, but apparently they want it for something and are planning on invading it rather slowly, it seems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You mean, I could just vanish right now? Poof? Just like that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It seems the reality is far worse,\u0022 said Jeb 1. \u0022They will crush us slowly, like slowly taking a Band-Aid off. They have already begun their attacks, and the council is divided upon what to do. Some of them wish to surrender. Some of them wish to run. Some of them wish to fight, although our core belief is peace. We haven\u0027t fought a war in millennia.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we\u0027re all doomed?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now look, there\u0027s always hope - \u0022 said both of the Jebs at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Against something millions of times bigger than us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t say there was much hope,\u0022 said Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t say that to him!\u0022 said Jeb 1.\u0022 The implications of this whole scenario hit me like a ton of bricks. I stood there shocked for some time while the Jebs argued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When were you planning on telling the humans?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You weren\u0027t?\u0022 I shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This whole invasion thing is a new occurrence,\u0022 said Jeb 2. \u0022We did not know it was happening for sure until an hour ago, tops.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what are you going to do about it?\u0022 I demanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Before you laugh at my shell of a plan - \u0022 said Jeb 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EOur\u003C/em\u003E shell of a plan,\u0022 cut in Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Same difference. We must try something - action is better than inaction, no matter how pathetic the action is. We are going to take a bunch of preserved embryos from many of the species as far as possible, not caring about time dilation or the laws of physics.\u00A0 Many times further than the reach of this new species, if possible - which it may not be. We have no idea how far their reach extends, or if they can expand faster than our ship can travel. Then we find a habitable planet and do our best to set up shop, buy our races a few thousand years, and develop the technology to outrun the species again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So basically you stole the plot of \u003Cem\u003EInterstellar?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 asked both of the Jebs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Interstellar, it\u0027s an Earth movie. Doesn\u0027t obey all of the known physical laws either, and given the sheer enormity of what we\u0027re up against, your plan is a pretty bad plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We know, but it\u0027s the only one we\u0027ve got,\u0022 said Jeb 2. \u0022We aren\u0027t the only ones, though - we have several dozen of these ships nearly ready to depart, the rest should all be ready within a week.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which reminds me - assuming you mean FTL travel, how are you dealing with the time dilation? And have you invented time travel?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Sort of, and Yes. This is an FTL ship, we have a weird machine for dealing with some of the dilation by dilating only a small part of the universe which is now quadrillions of years ahead of the rest, and we have time travel, but it\u0027s iffy and it has been banned.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why not time travel back far enough to prevent this evil species from forming?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t know where and when they started, and there are two main methods of backwards time travel. One can only send small objects and is rather inexpensive, but allows for universe ending paradoxes. The second method works around paradoxes and can send anything back in time, but the energy required to send the objects backwards increases exponentially. It would require more energy than the observable universe will ever produce to send even an atom backwards a billion years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, so that\u0027s out... Why do these guys want to invade us anyway?\u0022 I asked, hoping for an easy way out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They want to unite all of the creatures of the universe and use all of its resources to try and find a way to escape heat death by going to another universe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s not so bad,\u0022 I said. \u0022Why are resisting? That seems like a noble cause.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They think slavery, total control, and extermination are the most efficient ways to do this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Well, maybe - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stop right there, we\u0027ve had teams of millions of geniuses with access to more technology than you have ever seen work on this problem. I can almost guarantee that there is nothing you can think of that we have not already considered.\u0022 I stood there, thought for a moment, and frowned in defeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tell me about this ship,\u0022 I asked, trying to distract myself from the reality of my impending doom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a model seven Astra, one of the first operational, general utility, non experimental warp ships. It was used to build up much of the third generation Jool architecture back before the Council found us. It\u0027s called 4-16\u003Cem\u003E Memories\u003C/em\u003E. It is powered by a mark five K-drive core.\u0022 Jeb 2 pulled up an old photograph of the ship up on the computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PyA4UVl.png?1\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:409px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PyA4UVl.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is a K-drive?\u0022 I asked. I briefly wondered why the picture looked so old even though it was taken using a race that had technology thousands of years ahead of mine, but then dropped it because of the vastly more important current events.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a type of high acceleration reactionless engine,\u0022 explained Jeb 1. \u0022It runs off of strange particle interactions between two plates, which is amplified by Zeta particles, which create a vacuum force in space-time that vibrates through the ship, causing acceleration.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022English, please!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A few pistons push down on a plate made of matter that does not obey some of the laws of physics, which causes negative mass to briefly form, pushing the ship forward. However, the force is jittery and irregular, which is why it has so many reaction wheels. It\u0027s to keep it straight. Acceleration can be tuned by adjusting the height of the piston. In addition to being the first throttleable K-drive, the mark 5 core was one of the first restartable K-drives. That\u0027s what those purple lamps are for, they actually keep the core in a time loop so that it resets every so often. This requires energy, but it means the ship does not have to replace its warp core after every jump.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, just how fast can this thing go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s a complicated question. Originally, the 4-16 was only rated for 4g because that was the limit to how much Kerbals could survive sustained. Although, earlier K-drives were not throttleable or tunable and usually provided either 0g or 40-100g. Eventually, advanced acceleration protection was developed and the ships were rebuilt to withstand 50g, which allowed the users to travel from one side of the system to another in two days. After we were discovered by the Council, we modified our existing ships to circumvent relativity to travel faster than light, placed the hull in an acceleration bubble so it can withstand almost anything, and applied a thermal coating capable of withstanding almost any atmospheric entry, and almost capable of surviving the surface of a star.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, how fast can it go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pretty much infinite, the only limiter is the acceleration. After a certain point, physics breaks down and acceleration becomes linked to heat, and the ship will turn to liquid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is the acceleration limit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So many questions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, as a general rule, humans are pretty obsessed with things that go fast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you really want to know, about one million G is the limit. However, due to inaccuracies in warp tuning, and the fact that acceleration increases exponentially with throttle setting, it would be unwise to go within an order of magnitude of that. If we accidentally tune it so that it hits infinite acceleration, it could create a rip in the Higgs Field, and that would be bad. Plus, we\u0027d be dead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s pretty darn fast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No joke.\u0022 There was a long silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Take me with you,\u0022 I finally said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 said both Jebs at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s extremely dangerous with next to zero chance of success,\u0022 said Jeb 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, so is staying here!\u0022 I said. The two Jebs glanced each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He has a point,\u0022 said Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you don\u0027t let me come I will tell everyone.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, I think all three of us know that you wouldn\u0027t. Would you rather know the date of your death, and that you were going to die violently, and spend your entire life dreading it, or let it come by unannounced? Imagine that times eight billion. Very few would be evil enough to do that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And yet, earlier you mentioned you weren\u0027t sure whether to tell anyone or not!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, to be fair, we\u0027ve only had an hour! I\u0027m not the only person that needs to make this decision!\u0022 said Jeb 1. \u0022And I\u0027m not talking about just Jeb 2 either!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ll worry about telling everyone later,\u0022 said Jeb 2, \u0022but we need to set the plan in action now! Ethan, you will stay here with Jeb 1, and I will complete the mission.\u0022 An idea hit me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why don\u0027t you clone me?\u0022 I asked. \u0022If you cloned me and took one of me with you, then the other me would stay here and not make much of a fuss.\u0022 The two Jebs shared another look, and then, after several seconds, responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, it\u0027s not like anything can get any worse. Come on, the cloning machine is back here. Be warned, it hurts about as much as getting run over by a planet while inside a blast furnace.\u0022 I shuddered, partially regretting my decision immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=======================================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ESeveral hours later, Marie sat up, looked around her, and blinked. It was dark. She tried to rub her eyes, but there was a thump as her gloved hands hit her visor. She remembered - she was on Pol. All of a sudden, her head started hurting. She again went to touch her hands to her head, but failed again. Then, she remembered the party - and why her head was probably hurting.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EShe had never been a drinker. The only other time she had ever had an alcoholic beverage of any sort was when she mistook a glass of wine for a glass of grape juice. Which is probably why the hangover hurt so bad...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EShortly after Ethan had left, Cheng had revealed what his personal cargo was - a lot of beer and wine. And, in the mood of the party, everyone had tried some, and it had affected Marie more than most. As a side note, the Kerbals all seemed unaffected by the beverage...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ESpeaking of Ethan, she thought, where was he? She stood up and looked around. He had to be back by now, she had dared him to go to Voyager and back as fast as he could. What if he had crashed? What if he was dead?\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EStumbling a few times, she got to her feet and activated her jetpack to look around for him. However, it was really dark and she still hadn\u0027t regained her senses of direction or balance. She ended up flying sideways into the monolith and falling downwards onto the lander.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EShe decided on a new approach - she would first attempt to communicate with Voyager to determine if Ethan was still up there or not.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=======================================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Ethan, this is going to feel a little bit weird - you and your clone will be able to read each others\u0027 minds - not to the point where you know everything you are thinking, but it\u0027s sort of vague, as if through a dream...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is there a way to turn that off?\u0022 I asked, slightly nervous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, but that requires another machine and we don\u0027t have time for that. It\u0027s also important to note that you are both equally Ethan - instead of generating a clone and keeping the original, the machine injects excess matter into you and commands all of your cells to split at once, so you sort of get really fat and then split into two. The engineers back on Kerbin made a config file for humans, but you\u0027ll be our first test subject - err, I mean, user.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You mean you\u0027ve never tried this before?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Great,\u0022 I said with a million tons of sarcasm. \u0022Also, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes?\u0022 they both said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I notice that neither of you look particularly old - I\u0027m assuming through a different type of cloning, you can also reduce age, is that correct?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, technically, yes...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is there to stop someone from living forever?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Laws and regulations, including strict guidelines on reproduction - Kerbals have long lifespans, there are very few accidents any more, and space is limited on our planet - although the Kerbals on Kerbin actually only represent about a quarter of our race. Only a very few select Kerbals can get extended lifetimes, for being exceptional leaders, historical figures, or for being famous and rich.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can I ask you another thing?\u0022 I asked, as the Jebs messed around with the equipment. One of them suddenly stuck a needle in my arm. \u0022Ow!\u0022 It was quickly followed by more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s just the painkiller. Also, you\u0027ll be really thirsty after the procedure, the water storage is over there. And yes, you can ask.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How many Jebs have there been?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At the current count, a few hundred or so. I answered that already, you know!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A few hundred?\u0022 I said in disbelief. \u0022Does it ever feel weird, knowing that you aren\u0027t that unique?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Listen,\u0022 said Jeb 1. I had obviously struck a nerve. \u0022We are Jebediah Kerman. We are unique. Unique enough to be preserved for future generations to benefit from. We share the same history. I can remember several hundred years back. I went to school in Greenwood, and studied astronomy at Kerlington college. I got a job at a junkyard and later bought it. I began launching rockets, one thing led to another, and here we are today.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But splitting that many times - there can\u0027t be that much of the original left, can there?\u0022 Jeb 2 stared me down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Some of your scientists back at home estimate that every single year, 98% of the atoms in your body are replaced.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 I said, a cold chill going through me. It sort of reminded me of the Ship of Theseus... A darker version of the Ship of Theseus...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyway, we\u0027re about ready. Be as still as possible, do your best not to scream, and make sure you remembered to write a will.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 I said, but then Jeb 1 pulled a lever before I could say anything else. Despite the painkiller, it still hurt a lot A lot is an understatement. There are almost no words to describe how torturous it was. Over a hundred pounds of nutrients shot into my body through various IV tubes into a matter of seconds, and my cells took them all in thanks to all the alien steroids that had been pumped through my body. Even though the Jebs had told me not to, I couldn\u0027t not scream. I grew huge and bloated, screaming and panicking - and then it started - it felt like every single piece of my body was being ripped in half - well, technically it was. Sparing most of the gruesome details, I sort of plopped into two pieces which solidified fully a few seconds later. The entire process probably took about fifteen seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!\u0022 I said. \u0022WHAT THE - \u0022 and then I turned to face myself. \u0022AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!\u0022 The Jebs passed us pouches of water. I both drank it down pretty fast, and then I drank another pair. My muscles were sort of just burning... It was a weird feeling. After I/we had stopped panicking, I turned to face me (narration is pretty hard when I is plural). The pain subsided almost instantly, replaced by curiosity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does my hair really look that weird?\u0022 I asked myself out loud, as I had always seen it through a mirror (and that reverses direction). \u0022Yes,\u0022 I answered. \u0022Hey, we should try a chess game!\u0022 I said. \u0022But who would go first? Wait, you want to do the airlock thing like Jeb did? Nah, this is too fun! Wait, I\u0027m talking to myself! But I can\u0027t have a conversation, actually, it\u0027s like talking to a mirror! Should I use I or me, Ethan? Hehe. This is funny! Okay, let\u0027s stop now!\u0022 Jeb was struck by a moment of humor odd for the situation and chuckled. \u0022Ethan 1 is the Ethan next to the airlock. Which one? The starboard one, dummy. Oh. You can talk first. No, me! Wait, oh...\u0022 At that moment, the ship\u0027s communicator beeped. We both reached for it and pressed the button at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Marie to Voyager!\u0022 said Marie, her voice sort of slurred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes?\u0022 I answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, thank goodness! We thought you had died or something!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Marie, your voice sounds sort of weird!\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yours does to, like some sort of echo!\u0022 I looked at myselves and stifled a giggle. \u0022Why have you taken three hours to get back?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, um...\u0022 I said, searching for an explanation that wasn\u0027t a total lie. \u0022I got distracted.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, that\u0027s fine. Anyway, we\u0027ve been down here long enough, why don\u0027t you just stay there until you\u0027ve orbited around again? Then we\u0027ll all jetpack back up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sounds good, bye!\u0022 I said, trying to get out of the conversation before she found out anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, wai - \u0022 she was cut off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Ethan one is the one closest to the airlock. He speaks first. Got that? Yes? Okay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E------Narration at this point starts from Ethan Two\u0027s perspective\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, like this?\u0022 said Ethan One.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. Hi, me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi, me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can I give you one piece of advice?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I already know what you\u0027re going to say, you are going to tell yourself not to die,\u0022 he responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OOOOH, this is cool! What color am I thinking of?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Atomic Tangerine, and not just because I am your clone, I can read your mind now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022While the first time is always funny,\u0022 said Jeb 1, \u0022We really must be going, we don\u0027t know how much time we have. Their invasion force could have already started to sweep the galaxy, we just don\u0027t know!\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, then!\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, I\u0027m Ethan one, right? So I\u0027m staying? Aww, lucky you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our minds are linked, so it won\u0027t be that bad,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, let\u0027s not dilly-dally, we need to get moving!\u0022 said Jeb 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right! Wait, I need another spacesuit, don\u0027t I?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right cupboard,\u0022 said Jeb 1 as he prepared to exit the \u003Cem\u003EMemories\u003C/em\u003E to return to the \u003Cem\u003EVoyager\u003C/em\u003E. I opened the cupboard to find three additional spacesuits, slightly more futuristic looking than my previous suit. I put one on quickly (they were rather easy to put on). At this point, Ethan 1 and Jeb 1 were about to exit the airlock. Ethan 1 had yet to put his gloves on... And I knew what he was thinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Goodbye, Ethan,\u0022 we both said. I held up my right hand, he held up his left. They touched for a few seconds before the Jebs got anxious. Ethan 1 and Jeb 1 departed, and almost immediately we undocked from the Voyager. Jeb 2 activated the navigation system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where, exactly, are we going?\u0022 I asked, thinking that I\u0027d never see anyone I knew again, except through the thoughts of my clone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Far, far away. We are starting at impulse 1, should be good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How will it feel?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bumpy. Activating K-drive in 3... 2... 1...\u0022 The ship lurched forward, sending the two of us back into our seats to Jeb\u0027s screaming. The ship stopped again. \u0022Gah, forgot to activate the anti-g mechanism... That could have been bad. Impulse 1 in 3... 2... 1...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd we were off. A few seconds later, Jeb went up to impulse 10. Then 50. It sure was bumpy. I didn\u0027t feel any linear acceleration, but I felt like my brain was going to be shaken out of its skull. After Jeb went to impulse 100, we left Pol pretty quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HJQxtSJ.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:409px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HJQxtSJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA minute later we skimmed Laythe\u0027s atmosphere and passed by Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JTyUUx6.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:409px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JTyUUx6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Jeb hit impulse 10,000, which he quickly upped to 100,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AR44L4C.png?1\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:763px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AR44L4C.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur cruising acceleration became impulse 200,000 as we rapidly left they system behind. I wondered if I would ever see it again - and then I wondered - why did I ask to come in the first place? Was I stupid or something? I was voluntarily leaving everything I knew and loved behind for adventure and a slightly higher chance of survival.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again, I\u0027d already left everything behind twice... I left Earth, then I left Kerbin... What difference should a few more orders of magnitude make?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=====================================================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan 1\u0027s private journal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGah, it\u0027s only been five minutes and I\u0027m already going crazy. How am I going to manage keeping this a secret? What will happen when the others find out? And how in the whole universe am I supposed to just sit here as evil aliens invade the galaxy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I can do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I had never found out about this, it\u0027s just too much knowing something this big and not being able to know about it. The first chance I get, I\u0027ll ask Jeb if they have invented memory erasers yet. But for now, to the humans reading my blogs on Kerbin, I\u0027ll have to dodge the truth. I can already tell, my writing is going to be halfhearted - how am I supposed to write about something that seemed so large that has suddenly become so small? Oof, I can already picture it, it\u0027s going to end with a cringey \u0022Ethan out!\u0022 for lack of a better option. This is going to be so terrible...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=====================================================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, Kerbin! Ethan here, with an update!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat party was so epic. If you ever get the chance to go to one similar to this, do it. Even if it isn\u0027t an epic space party, just any party in general, it\u0027s better to go than not to go! I ended up leaving early, everyone else went to sleep, and I did some checkouts of Voyager, routine, boring stuff. If one can consider anything in space to be boring and routine!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, a few hours ago, the crew finished their surface mission on Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226YqDTwv.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:410px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6YqDTwv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob was the first one back up to the Voyager, followed by the others in rapid succession.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HIxpskR.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:410px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HIxpskR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheng ended up taking the lander back up, joyfully... still a bit odd for him, but I think he\u0027s changed for good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PYqGYsG.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:410px;\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PYqGYsG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re currently plotting a trajectory for our next destination, Bop! In case you didn\u0027t know, it\u0027s a low gravity world, similar to Pol. And due to the limited fuel, we have to be as careful as possible with our trajectory. We have plotted a course that will hopefully use less than 300m/s out of our 2100m/s total - and that\u0027s before even stripping down the ship further, which we will do after Laythe!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in short, not much happened this week...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, as a note to all the humans and Kerbals reading this - to restate my point, parties are awesome. If you get the opportunity, just do it! Even if it doesn\u0027t work out, at least you know what to expect from that type of party and - how do I word this... Just have fun, alright? Good luck, Kerbin!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=======================================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Okay, fine,\u0022 said Evelina to herself, after she had finished reading Ethan\u0027s most recent post. Oddly, it seemed weird to her... More distant than his other reports. Probably due to something spacey, she concluded. She decided to drop it.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I agree with his point - I\u0027ll never know if I don\u0027t try.

Question 1 is partially solvable by the fact that it has been an hour, there are rules about the test, and that the humans know nothing about super advanced weaponry... But I might explore that.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, maybe I should impose a speed limit, that might also explain why the others haven\u0027t gone outside the galaxy. Maybe Jeb was trying to rush through the explanation and glossed over some of the details... And the free energy thing might be loosely explainable by the time dilation thing (dilating only one tiny portion of space across many K-drives). Or maybe the strange particle that powers it steals energy from somewhere else... Hmm... I can\u0027t make the warp core resource too scarce because the time core just resets it (or who knows?
