The Munlit Silence had been rotating now for the better part of a year, and it was hard to tell what would float free once they were back in freefall. Not that freefall would last longer than it took to align for the course-correction burn, but better safe than sorry. The post-it note he\u0027d placed over the \u0022Kill Rot\u0022 button flaked off at his touch and landed on the faceplate of his helmet. He held his breath and pressed the button. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait!\u0022 Just then Haloly crawled out of the access tube, but it was too late. The burn from the reaction control system sent him flying from the ladder and tumbling about the cabin. \u0022Ow!\u0022 A few seconds later he floated past Shepgee, grabbed a hold of free seat and strapped in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepgee gave him a sour glance. \u0022Oly, did you not hear the warning?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Cheese! Ike! We\u0027ve got to go to Ike! There\u0027s cheese on Ike!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat? Shepgee punched the coordinates for the midcourse correction into the flight computer and hit the commit button. The ship rattled as the computer turned to the new heading. \u0022There\u0027s no cheese on Ike. We\u0027re going to Jool, not Ike. Ike\u0027s behind us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know that. Look.\u0022 Haloly passed him a wrinkled up sheet of paper. \u0022I\u0027ve worked out a plan for getting there from Jool.\u0022 He looked over the paper, searching for an explanation or even a hint of sanity. Finding nothing he handed it back to Haloly and gave the main engines a test burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s on Ike that M\u0026amp;M can\u0027t handle?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wildfire! The Ike Contingency! If I\u0027m right, M\u0026amp;M won\u0027t be allowed to land on Ike. Something, everything, will go wrong as soon as they head for Ike. So we\u0027ll have to go there. Ourselves.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm.\u0022 Shepgee glanced out of the window at the stationary sky. After spinning for so long the unmoving stars seemed strange to him. Almost enough to make him dizzy. Or maybe that was just a product of Haloly\u0027s insanity. He shook off the feeling and looked Haloly straight in the eyes. \u0022Is there anything I need to do now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No. The course change happens at Jool.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good. That\u0027ll give me some time to think about what to do.\u0022 With you, he thought but didn\u0027t say. Shepgee watched as the node counter ticked down to the target then gradually throttled up to 100%. The ship shuddered and recently-dislodged debris fell to the the back walls of the cabin. This was the first real stress placed on their ship since leaving Kerbin \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150203_ksp0222_munlit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150203_ksp0222_munlit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if they made the correction now to skip Jool and go to Duna it would be at least another year or two before they got there. Sure, Haloly was usually spouting some sort of insanity, but cheese? Diverting from a return to Kerbin to one for Duna? That was a bit much. No, there had to be some other reason. The paranoid parts of Shepgee\u0027s brain began to tingle, well trained by reading \u0022Secret Agent Kirrim\u0022 novels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe glanced over at Haloly as the ship was throttling down from the burn. There he was, just smiling at the void as the Munlit Silence ejected superheated fuels, abnormally quiet. Shepgee armed the RCS system to spin the Silence back up to its normal rotation. What could Haloly know that he didn\u0027t? What was crawling through that strange mind of his? How did he \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E get to space all those years ago?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAd Lunam - Origins - Upgrades\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMother of Necessity Survey Expedition\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 1 day 342 - Cape Kerbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDEMO-18\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths later and Jebediah was returned safe to Cape Kerbal. The CCHR had paraded him around the country in celebration of his accomplishments, recognizing him as a \u0022Hero of Kerbin.\u0022 They made sure to show him the devastation the meteor strike had levied on their country. Mention was made repeatedly of the Unified Government\u0027s refusal to assist the CCHR in its time of crisis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They will only help us if we join them. Give up our sovereignty\u0022 he was told. \u0022We have something else in mind.\u0022 That was when they showed him the launch complex, well hidden in the mountains north of the spreading desert. \u0022It is our second.\u0022 When Jeb asked about the first his question was met with tears and lamentations. \u0022At the center of a smoking crater.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe news he brought back to DEMO and the Unified Government alarmed everyone. The never-ending desert, the burning wasteland, the \u0022enemy\u0027s\u0022 new space program. So, after a long investigation of just what Jebediah had seen and said while held as a \u0022guest\u0022 of the CCHR, an expedition was arranged for him and Bob. An expedition for Bob to see if the deserts were spreading beyond the mountains of K2, and to determine if Jebediah was still trustworthy. There were six survey points in two clusters around K2: 3 to the north, and 3 in the pass. A few days after Jeb\u0027s second release they set out aboard the Mother of Necessity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0035_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0035_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was for Jeb to land near the center of each of the cluster of three survey points, have Bob get out and make observations, then fly to the next cluster. They headed for the northernmost set of surveys first: Kenfurt\u0027s Boundary. In ancient times this boundary had been established by a Kerbal chieftain, Kenfurt Kerman, to resolve a dispute between a Shepherd and a Farmer. Now it was little more than a memory and a line on a map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0040_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0040_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they were on the ground both Jeb and Bob jumped out, Bob making some observations about the grass, the presence of any sand (they found none), and the general ridiculousness of this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m not sure I see the point in this, Jeb. It\u0027d be more useful if I could take surface samples. Apparently that\u0027s not allowed. Something about paid-DLC-ransomware stuff and needing to spend more money to be able to pick up rocks. Again. Did you ever pick up rocks when you were a kid Jeb? Remember anything about needing to pay money to your parents first?\u0022 Jeb just shrugged and climbed back into his plane. \u0022Hmm. Guess you\u0027re not in the mood to chat.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0044_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0044_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of taking off again, Jeb just taxied the plane around to the other two observation points. Only once Bob had his fill of data did they take to the air again. Next stop: Mora\u0027s Prize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0066_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0066_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way Jeb related the story of his time in the new desert to Bob. Of how the CCHR, the \u0022enemy\u0022 of the Unified Government, only wanted to show him around the devastated lands. How they made a point of showing him the suffering caused by their governments\u0027s refusal to help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then he went into the tales of the stars. How many there were, how vibrant they seemed from orbit, the endless and vast ocean of unblinking stars that could be seen from the night side of Kerbin. Bob was more concerned that Jeb was paying no attention to the large mountains that had just passed by on either side of the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0070_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0070_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few moments later and they were there. No living kerbals remembered what Mora\u0027s Prize was, but a few educated scholars were keen to speculate on the very old name. Perhaps these were once rich, lush farmlands, prized by the ancients? Or maybe this area had been won in a raffle by some lucky Kerbal? No idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb looked around for a landing spot. \u0022I don\u0027t know, Bob. There\u0027s an awful lot of trees. Maybe in that gully up ahead? Hmm.\u0022 He brought the plane in low, skimming over the tops of more than a few trees before he found an open spot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0089_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0089_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time Bob would have to walk, as there was no way Jeb could taxi the plane through the \u0022dense\u0022 forest of Mora\u0027s Prize. And so Bob walked. And Bob ran. And Bob made useless observations about the lack of ash and sand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0023_0109_mon.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0023_0109_mon.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb wasted no time once Bob was back in the plane, setting course for KSC. The sun was getting low in the western sky and he wanted to land before darkness fell on the Cape. \u0022We\u0027ve got to get you trained for your flight\u0022 he said to Bob. \u0022You\u0027re up next, right?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob shook his head. \u0022No, they\u0027re letting Bill go up next. They wanted me on this trip for some reason, so Bill got the Kestrel 2. After your landing,\u0022 Bob was staring out the window at the grasslands west of KSC, \u0022they weren\u0027t sure if we should fly again until they could add a remote-control to the ships.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob shrugged. \u0022Bill came up with one, but it\u0027s too heavy. So for now we get to fly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just not me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob looked right at him, unsure what to say. \u0022You should\u0027ve listened to Gene. He\u0027s not a kerbal you want to be on the bad side of. At this rate you may never fly again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mmm-hmm.

The sand and ash that had claimed the Western Continent and the west parts of their landmass had not crossed the mountain range, though many considered a year too short of a time frame for such rapid desertification to have occurred. Sure, it was getting a bit cold, and it was downright chilly up in the pass, but that was to be expected. And as for Jeb?

It wasn\u0027t that he didn\u0027t want to fly, but he was in the middle of fighting with a problem that had plagued him since they moved to Cape Kerbal: How to make the sounding rockets useful again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150223_ksp0024_0139_kestrel2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150223_ksp0024_0139_kestrel2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no debate that the small rockets were more efficient for atmospheric testing than a full-sized K-4, Kestrel or equivalent, but the thicker air and the heavier \u0022pre-release\u0022 components in the sounding rockets made it difficult for them to reach the higher atmosphere with a meaningful payload. He was still running over numbers and ideas in his head when the second stage of the Kestrel 2 cut out and placed him in freefall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was when it hit him: He needed to develop a new type of engine for the sounding rockets if he wanted to use liquid fuels. Of course! He continued to ignore the fact that he was in space, surrounded by a vast ocean of nothingness and Jeb\u0027s endless stars, and set about scratching out ideas on his checklist.

Or the noxious yellow clouds. Or the incredible mass of water vapor that was still rising from the impact site nearly a year later. The glow of the still-molten core of the impact was dim and barely visible during the day, but Bill was sure he could see active lava flows. He wondered if the impact had punched through Kerbin\u0027s crust, though he doubted anything would be dense enough to do that. He took as many pictures as he could of the new crater and the desert beyond and relayed his findings back to mission control once he was back in radio contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150223_ksp0024_0146_kestrel2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150223_ksp0024_0146_kestrel2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the next orbit it was time to return home. Bill spent most of it perfecting his new small engine design, though he did make a few more observations of the impact site before the retro burn. He almost skipped a checklist item that read \u0022expose science experiments\u0022 on account of all the random scratches and notes some lunatic had scribbled onto it, but remembered at the last second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150223_ksp0024_0170_kestrel2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150223_ksp0024_0170_kestrel2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe splashed down safely just off the coast of KSC (like a good little kerbonaut), though most of the science experiments were destroyed by the impact with the water.

He was very reluctant to align for the deorbit burn after only going around once, but followed the instructions like a good little kerbal.

Something plucked from the dark, usually unreachable recesses of existence. Its previous passenger, Thomlock Kerman, had launched into a vertical ascent that was perfectly retrograde to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. That lowered his orbit down well below that of Eve, which didn\u0027t even exist at the time. And when Eve finally popped into reality, it caught Thomlock and the Hawk 3-2 and expelled them from known space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet that was a different universe. Today the Hawk 3-2 would lift Jenzer Kerman into low-Kerbin orbit where he would perform various tasks on EVA.

If not, then it was a small loss. The ITA-1 was launched atop the venerable Kestrel-Songbird, which handily placed the satellite into a parking orbit around Kerbin.

This extra 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA inclination at Kerbin is also what contributed to the longer travel time to the mighty orange planet, but it would save lander fuel in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150219_ksp0244_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150219_ksp0244_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150219_ksp0256_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150219_ksp0256_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the worst of the atmosphere behind them, Meldo set up the initial capture burn.

He didn\u0027t know where or what, just that he was inside and it was dark. It was obviously a smaller capsule, very likely the Jebediah Kerman special of the week.

He flipped it and the cockpit sprang to life, dim lights casting him in an awkward glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small booklet was dangling from the top of the capsule, bouncing in the excitement of the launch.

Why was he here? Why was he doing these tasks for the faceless Council? Sure, they were obviously the ones in power, but why? Should he be worried? What would they do if he failed? Of all the tasks he had done for them this was easily the most dangerous and most questionable. Sabotage a camera? No problem. Chuck a nosy kerbal into the vacuum around the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn? Accidents happen. Deorbit an unoccupied station? Who would miss it? But this? Many kerbals could die from this.

Most of the ship\u0027s primary fuel was expended in the injection burn for Duna. The two SRB packs were used to complete the capture and lower his orbit. All he had left to burn through was the RCS, and shortly that too sputtered and died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok Barting, fuel\u0027s dry. Guess we do the rest with jetpack, eh?\u0022 The easiest way to do this would be to align the ship in the direction he needed to face on EVA. He ran some quick numbers for how long of a jetpack burn it would take to finish matching orbits with the Osprey, waited until the node was near, then started out of the ship. He looked around the capsule one last time, grabbing an extra snack and another box of toothpicks before he made his way out into the void.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150227_ksp0421_barting.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150227_ksp0421_barting.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne orbit later and he arrived at his target. He made his way silently to the hatch of the lander, careful not to spray his jetpack at the station. No need to alert its occupants to his arrival. His suit\u0027s radio was off and he had approached the ship from out of the sun. All he could do was hope none of the five aboard decided to look out of a window just as he was floating by. And that none of them were waiting in the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150227_ksp0442_barting.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150227_ksp0442_barting.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150227_ksp0445_barting.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150227_ksp0445_barting.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe checked the capsule\u0027s windows before he made his way inside, just to be sure. He was quiet and he was quick. As soon as the airlock opened he moved to close off the ship from the station, venting atmosphere as he worked. Undocking at full cabin pressure would set off alarms, but if he slowly bled the pressure down maybe they wouldn\u0027t notice. Hopeflly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are you sure you want to do this, boss?\u0022 he asked himself. \u0022No time like the present to stop, float yourself into the station and join your friends for dinner. Right?\u0022 He watched the sunset through the cabin windows, thinking of how distant he had grown from everyone. \u0022No,\u0022 he said resignedly, \u0022a mission is a mission. Best not bite the hand that feeds ya.\u0022 And as the Osprey drifted into the night of Duna its lander drifted away towards a grisly fate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce safely away Barting burned to increase his orbit. The Kraken\u0027s Harvest was exactly 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA out of phase of the Osprey at a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 incline so he should be able to reach it in one orbit. Better to hit it while dropping down from a high orbit to increase the speed differential. \u0022Use your imagination\u0022 the orders had said. Unfortunately Barting was sorely lacking in original thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intercept would occur just as the two ships were emerging from the night. Less than ideal, with the lander approaching the station from opposite the sun, but nothing Barting could do about that. He locked in the heading, set up the burn, and then abandoned the lander to its fate. \u0022One last chance\u0022 something whispered to him, but he primed his jetpack and backed away. He watched as his new weapon fired its engines and sped away, death itself looming down on the Kraken\u0027s Harvest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0274_barting.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0274_barting.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial impact was bright, but not blindingly so. Barting watched as the lander clipped the habitat at well over 400m/s, sending ripples through the Harvest as it tore its way to the ship\u0027s drive. The entire bulk spun in the direction of the impact, pieces of superstructure tearing away and reaching out like broken bones that had punctured their flesh. One of the small landers was backing away from the burning wreckage, furiously ejecting mono-propellent, its damaged capsule dangling by a thread. A cloud formed as fuel and air leaked into the void, wisps of fire burning at its periphery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0346_barting.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0346_barting.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0357_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0357_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0497_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0497_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the Harvest\u0027s drive section exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0520_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0520_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blinding flash opened Barting\u0027s eyes to the true extent of what he had done. As he drifted through the debris field his mood changed from joy to terror. These kerbals were once his friends. How could he have fallen so far? He panicked and started to hyperventilate. He needed a ship. Any ship. He could run. Hide. Somewhere. Anywhere. Anywhere that\u0027s not here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it hit him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0022 being a small chunk of debris.

Best keep it on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe noises emanating from the ship did not put his mind at ease. There was obviously a fire somewhere, and the walls of the ship creaked and groaned endlessly, sounding not unlike a breathing giant. He glanced out of the window and noted that the stars were spinning. Duna flashed past his view, quickly made invisible by the sun. And that\u0027s when he saw the endless field of brightly glistening shards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0609_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0609_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gash on his head was still throbbing, but appeared to have at lest stopped bleeding. Which was good, because he wasn\u0027t about to remove his helmet to bandage it. He pushed off the wall and floated through his door and into the crewspace beyond. The scene outside was one of pure chaos. Bunks and cabinets that had been sealed away were now blown wide open, contents spilled out and floating everywhere. Milzer swatted his way through them as he made his way to what counted as a control room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInside he found two kerbals. Meldo looked to be pretty frazzled. Gersted too. Both were helmeted, though Gersted\u0027s helmet appeared to be a little worse for wear. Milzer moved into one of the open chairs and strapped in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s the situation?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeldo looked up at him and smiled. \u0022Good to see you too, M. Seems we\u0027ve been hit by something. Not sure what yet, but it took out part of the habitat and pretty severely damaged the drive section. Which is nothing compared to what the drive section did when it exploded. Somehow we\u0027re still here. We\u0027re running off of the systems in the lab module, which seems to be unharmed, so there\u0027s that. As far as I can tell the habitat\u0027s main computer was sheared away with the rest of the drive section.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Casualties?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not sure yet. I\u0027ve sent Newwin and Lorim around to check on the crews, but so far the only kerbals unaccounted for are Deruki and Podner, both of whom were in the C-Duster preparing for their descent. Podner had detached, but the Harvest attempted another collision avoidance move and smacked into the lander just as they were backing away. Communications are down, so I can\u0027t tell if either survived. Everyone else has reported in. Some are in pretty rough shape, a few broken bones. Melden has some nasty-looking burns. Almost everyone has a new bruise or three.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer watched as Jebediah floated in, helmetless and unmoved. He casually took the fourth seat and strapped in. The elder kerbal\u0027s bravado inspired Milzer to remove his helmet, globs of mostly-congealed blood floating freely into the thin cabin air. And Jeb didn\u0027t have a scratch on him of course. Meldo continued with his report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The other two landers are floating just aft of us, out amongst the twisted wreckage of the drive section. I had to close off half the system due to leaks, but our RCS is functional, and so far I\u0027ve managed to stop most of the rotation. We\u0027re missing a chunk of the habitat, so spinning the ship back up again is out of the the question. Here in a bit I was going to attempt to move us closer to the landers and send out two pilots to bring them in. No telling if they\u0027re still flightworthy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer nodded. \u0022I\u0027ll go.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re not a pilot anymore M, remember?

Milzer watched as he floated out of the adjacent airlock and drifted over to stand on the tube linking the hab with what was left of the core of the ship. With communications down they were limited to the short-range, low-power, suit-to-suit radios, so Jeb stayed behind to act as a relay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lots of debris out here guys.

He completed the rest of the journey with his suit\u0027s jetpack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0652_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0652_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150307_ksp0662_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150307_ksp0662_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeruki was also alive and unharmed, though considerably further away. The C-Duster\u0027s capsule had absorbed much of the momentum of the initial impact, placing it into the higher orbital band of debris. His only chance at a rendezvous was to jump out and use his suit, the capsule lacking in RCS thrusters or any other means of propulsion. (Though one could argue venting the cabin atmosphere is a \u0027means of propulsion\u0027, it\u0027s not one allowed by KSP.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, two orbits later Deruki\u0027s capsule would almost meet back with the Kraken\u0027s Harvest. A short jump at apoapsis would set up a rendezvous. Returning from such a trajectory provided Deruki with a unique view of the greater debris field as it stretched out across Low-Duna-Orbit. It also gave him a nice view of Eve, Gilly, Kerbin, Minmus, and even Moho for a few brief moments before the Sun rose over Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150407_ksp0349_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150407_ksp0349_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150407_ksp0354_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150407_ksp0354_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150407_ksp0362_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150407_ksp0362_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally all their fellow crew members had returned home.

The same position he\u0027d been in for some m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths now. \u0022I\u0027ve been here how long? 23 days? And all I\u0027ve seen since I woke up is the inside of that room and the inside of this one. And you. I\u0027ve asked before where we are, and I\u0027ll ask again. Except this time you\u0027ll get no more stories from me until you answer.\u0022 He leaned back and crossed his arms, stern in his resolve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well then. Follow me.\u0022 Lem stood, pressed a button, and walked through the door behind his desk. Gene\u0027s chair melted away from under him, prompting him to roll forward onto his feet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond the door was a long, shapeless, empty hallway. To Gene\u0027s eyes it was nearly a hundred meters long. Being cooped up in a small room for so long will alter one\u0027s perception. He followed Lem to the end, reaching another nondescript not-grey, not-white door. Lem waited for Gene to catch up, and then pressed a small silvered pad to the left of the door. Beyond was a wall of glass, black against the night. Kerbin rotated into view as he walked in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Behold. Academy Station, home of the Academy of Kerbal Spaceflight. Quite a sight, no? It\u0027s not as large as some of the other stations, but it suits our needs. The shuttle you see on approach is one of the Hydra Void Shuttles, transferring a group of young trainees from our landing base on Minmus.

The stars swirled by outside, a blur against the unfamiliar kerbal looking back at him. No, not unfamiliar. Gene knew this kerbal. Somehow. And he knew it wasn\u0027t himself. \u0022Who?\u0022 He turned to Lem, the shock of understanding still painted on his face. \u0022What? How?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We were wondering how long it would take for you to notice.\u0022 Lem put his hand on Gene\u0027s shoulder to comfort him. It didn\u0027t help. \u0022You see, Gene Kerman died seventy-three years ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I?\u0022 Gene swallowed back the sudden sensation of sickness. \u0022I what?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Died. Of natural causes, as they say. It was a pleasant passing at a venerable age, surrounded by your family and closest friends.\u0022 Lem looked out at the stars and Gene followed his gaze. The station twirled around them, a blur against the unchanging universe. \u0022Hopefully now you understand why we\u0027ve been rather reserved with you. It was quite a surprise for us too, you see, meeting a ghost.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene turned away from the endless star field, head spinning. \u0022How? If I\u0027m dead, how am I here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s a story I had hoped you would remember yourself. Many years ago one of your crews found a crashed vessel on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. This was back in the very early days of the space program. The space program was immediately moved into deep secrecy. An excavation crew was sent up, and in a short time they had found the entrance. Inside they found a strange device and a glimpse at the long distant past.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141213_ksp0530_ufo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141213_ksp0530_ufo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022By then you had risen through the ranks to become head of the Agency. And yet you were on thin ice due to a few fatal training accidents. One of them very preventable. One of them involving the son of a prominent member of the Senate. And so, when the engineering teams conducting the investigation of the recovered craft found the device and discovered that it placed its user in a very realistic and very believable simulation, you acted.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And I tried it out myself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As any good leader would. The interface was simple, seemingly designed to fit any intelligent being that matches our basic composition. Neurons being the universal constant, of course. Inside you found a nearly perfect representation of Kerbin and the Kerbol System as it appeared several millennia before the rise of the first civilizations. Before the cities overtook the continents. Before the skies were filled with aircraft and advertisements. In other words, the perfect place to train kerbals without killing them or innocent bystanders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Except there were ghosts in this simulation. Kerbals that appeared to be independent, yet were not avatars of those on the outside. The longer a kerbal spent inside, the more creeped out they would become. As though someone was watching over their shoulder. Someone inside their very head. This sensation drove many of the early trainees mad, and so the project was cancelled, the device hidden away in a secret bunker, and all knowledge of it struck from the records. Until we found it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We? We who?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Academy, of course. We\u0027ve been training kerbals to face life in space for more than seventy years. Yet accidents do still happen, and irreplaceable lives are lost. So we started searching for a solution, found the device, all the notes on how to use it, and we moved it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We recently discovered, completely by accident, that the device was keeping a backup of every kerbal who used it. Quite the fortuitous accident, and it hinted this technology may be far beyond our comprehension. Previous research had shown the participants were only learning and remembering when they left the simulation. The device exploits the natural dream-state memory reinforcement mechanisms already present in our brains. Knowing this, and the nature of where the device was found, led us to conclude it had only one practical purpose. Interstellar travel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And reviving the dead?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022More precisely their memories and personalities. Traversing the dark between the stars is no easy feat, and one not many biological beings will survive. Far better to transfer yourself, your knowledge, into a construct that can be recovered at the other end. Something far beyond out capabilities, but to a sufficiently advanced society shaping neurons and synapses would be a simple task. And why keep the passenger static? Why not allow them to train and plan as they travel? What better way to do that than in a near-perfect simulation of their destination? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you see, the device you and your crews recovered from this crashed ship on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was far more than a simple simulation. It was the entire crew of the ship, the hopes and dreams of a long-dead alien race, trapped in an electronic playground for their minds.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene smiled dryly, almost madly. \u0022The second landing site.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now Gene had slumped to the floor and was mindlessly staring out into nothing, smiling at the empty glass in front of him. The station was well past the terminator and more than halfway around the nightside of Kerbin, only visible for the warm glow of its flood lights. \u0022The second landing. The crew I sent to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn just before being, extracted? The rebels said I would find the truth of our space program there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Curious. We\u0027re not even sure ourselves where the alien vessel was found, and we\u0027re positive none that entered the Simulation with you did either. So many of the missions you\u0027ve related during our chats were classified and not public knowledge. The Ospreys, for instance. And the ORTHO shuttles that built them. Secret military operations each. Which means something, someone is still alive on the inside and they must have been feeding you information. Possibly the old crew, having survived thousands of years in solitude on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So why continue?\u0022 Gene asked, changing the subject. \u0022Why did I, whoever I am, use this device again if you knew what it really was?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We didn\u0027t know. As it so happens you were our fortuitous accident. You and your class of seventy trainees were trapped inside, all because you chose to identify yourself to the Simulation as Gene Kerman. In an instant you, our best instructor, ceased to be and became the bewildered and confused ghost you are today. Worse yet, the device seemed aware something had gone wrong and refused to eject you. We\u0027ve been trying to get you out for nearly a decade, every attempt thwarted. Eventually you found your own way.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who was I?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Carl Kerman, and you still are for the most part. Yet you are also Gene Kerman, which makes for a rather peculiar situation. Most would declare you insane and send you to the institution on Dres, but I know better.\u0022 Lem smiled in a way that made Gene wonder if that wasn\u0027t to be his ultimate fate anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe shook his head, trying to make sense of it all. The sun had risen again and the shuttle that had seemingly just arrived was leaving once more. He watched as it slipped silently out of the spinning station, backing into the void. It cancelled its rotation once clear, flipped 180 degrees, and then burned prograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So what now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now? Now we need your help.
