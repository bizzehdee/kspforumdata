I am planning on also updating in the forums in the future depending on time. Sometimes I have a lot of time for weeks. Sometimes no time at all.\n\nI am planning a more serious reboot by the time the Unity port is done as I can then use more mods ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).\n\nFor now please have a look here on twitter:\n\n[New Kerbol Space Exploration Initiative](https://twitter.com/NwKSEI)\n\nI am very bad with logo and other designs currently looking into that. Maybe I could repost the tweets here .... hmmmmmm"}]}
