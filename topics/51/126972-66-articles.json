Ok.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack when this pandemic began I\u0027d thought maybe I\u0027d end up spending more time in KSP and thus would be more motivated to _\u003Cem\u003Efinish\u003C/em\u003E_ Forgotten Space Program. Instead the opposite happened. After 8\u002B hours a day working from home the absolute last thing I wanted was more hours sitting at my PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of that mood started to pass last November when I began posting these Forgotten things again, only for me to be interrupted by events of the world that are outside the rules of this Forum to discuss. And then we had the winter freeze here in Houston and Texas which has taken months for some of us to recover from. And then a bunch more stuff that\u0027s still well outside the scope of this forum, and then a big push in May and June for us to get back into our offices full time, which was oddly disruptive despite being a return to \u0022normal\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a month of finally being _\u003Cem\u003Esomewhere other than my home\u003C/em\u003E_ for 9\u002B hours a day I\u0027m at last able to sit at my PC and actually enjoy something. Like Untitled Goose Game. And Journey. And Kerbal Sacrifice Program. Wait, no, Kerbal Science Platform. No, that\u0027s not it either. Little Green Dudes in Space And Not Splattered on Mountainsides Program. Yeah, that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust in time for Kerbal Space Program to \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEND\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk. That complicates things. Forgotten Space Program was originally intended to be somewhat open-ended while still having a destination to reach _\u003Cem\u003Eat the end of time\u003C/em\u003E_. Unfortunately I\u0027ve delayed continuing this long enough that _\u003Cem\u003Etime ended\u003C/em\u003E_ without me. Oops.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat can still be the case, but I\u0027m not really sure just how I want to handle it yet. I\u0027ll definitely finish posting the rest of this Second Volume as we move into Summer, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m ready to move beyond that just yet. The most recent semi-original idea was that KSPv2 would have already released, and would have come into play in Volume 3 (as I mentioned in a recently\u00A0previous post). At the moment I\u0027m not even sure I\u0027ll be able to play KSPv2 (I certainly won\u0027t be able to run it on my current system). And the Forum today is a much different place than it was in 2015\u00A0when Forgotten started... and I\u0027m a much different person. I\u0027m not entirely sure this type of long-form mission report is still welcome here, so... IDK. Need to think about this some more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m playing through a semi-casual career game in 1.12.0, trying to decide if I like all the changes that have been made to the stock game since whenever I last regularly played. (v1.4.5? v1.6.1? v1.10.1? I don\u0027t even remember anymore.) I\u0027m not particularly fond of the occasional crashiness of the game in this \u0022final\u0022 release, but I really do like the now-stock Alarm Clocks, suit switchers, and maneuver node editors, among other things. I\u0027m not entirely sold on the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff yet, and I still haven\u0027t tried the stock robotics, but maybe they\u0027ll grow on me as I learn.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, aside from another \u0022near collapse of civilization\u0022 event like we witnessed with the February Freeze (I\u0027m only partly exaggerating there), you can expect the next Forgotten post to show up in a couple days. And then another right after. And another shortly after that. And then we\u0027ll have to see.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Misguided Kerbal","CreatedById":203209,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T15:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223996884\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624914073\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Cydonian Monk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the Forum today is a much different place than it was in 2015\u00A0when Forgotten started... and I\u0027m a much different person.

There was still a great deal of work to do before everything was solid enough to move under its own power. It had been a long day, and Hallock needed a nap before he started into the difficult tasks.

It had been quite some time since they last added to the Memory of Tomorrow, back in Kerbin orbit, and even then the ship had been incomplete. They had only the \u0022test\u0022 drive section to get them this far, and none of the planned expedition craft. As such the two landers were a much welcome addition, no matter how old and worn they might be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe checked in on Queen Sieta before suiting up, finding her asleep at her station, having drifted off in the noise from the radios. She had thus far found several dozen Things in orbit around Duna and Ike, objects which had been missed during their earlier surveys. She was left to sleep while he ventured back into the void.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis first inspection pass of the ship and its newly acquired additions was done in the dark, illuminated by only his headlamps and the ship\u0027s scattered floodlights. The pressurized sections had been brought up to their regular atmospheres, and no major leaks had ruptured out into the nothingness. Some of these pressure vessels had taken more abuse than others, with the occasional ding and divot to patch over. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHallock made note of the myriad flags adorning their collection, none of them familiar to him. Most bore some resemblance to kerbals, while other were more esoteric designs such as dice and gears and little orbs. They slipped into the bright side of Duna during this inspection, while Ike slipped into its master\u0027s shadow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0527_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022704\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0527_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0534_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022704\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0534_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first move of the day was the small craft he had taken to calling the transfer shuttle. Its interior was very slick and had a modern feel to it in comparison to the Rock Spear, so he decided it would become the \u0022Bridge\u0022 to this new Memory of Tomorrow. He undocked it and the smaller lander, then slipped it in behind the Spear before docking the back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext was to restring and tighten several of the craft\u0027s struts and stays. They were now considerably further from the Sun than at Kerbin, and the reduced energy had become evident in the contraction of the metal masts which held the ship\u0027s power systems and radiators. These struts, constructed of some meta-material Hallock barely understood, were either completely taut or oscillating freely with the motions of the ship. So a good re-rigging was in order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, new anchor points were required on the modules from the Seconee station. The extra mass towards the ship\u0027s bow called for additional bracing and stays along the spine of the ship.

It wasn\u0027t much, the photon and particle pressure from their distant star, but a captain could dream. It also served as a good test of their full electrical and cooling capabilities.
