This is a big ship so I actually did an unmanned test launch into orbit where staging, fuel lines and mass (for double checking delta-v figures) could be verified. The only thing I\u0027m not happy about is the first stage booster which has gotten ugly. It\u0027s not a pancake yet but it\u0027s edging really close. Unfortunately I need a certain amount of thrust leading to a minimum number of engines (it\u0027s a lot). I don\u0027t want to spoil much so I\u0027ve obscured the upper portion. The orbital jumble of rockets is from staging without actually burning any fuel, the rest of the ship is less then 50m away split into 4 pieces, staged as far as the Kerbin SOI reentry (from there the staging has already been well tested with Ham and Kiwi).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w41cbDv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w41cbDv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p9ZjsmG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p9ZjsmG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to try and streamline it was to build it out and create a pair of super-boosters attached to the side though I\u0027d really need to abuse the new joints to prevent it from tearing apart the ship on launch. However even the smallest viable super booster had too large a footprint because of the engine count requirement - even the single launch design has the edge of an engine peaking out over the front and back edges of the launch pad. The smaller super booster design (which isn\u0027t much of an improvement in terms of looks) has 3 engines right over the right edge (the model rigged up was not structurally sound for a launch, it was only for size checking). The proper sized super booster would have 9 more engines, pushing it well past the edges of the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l2EqIeX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l2EqIeX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy one defense over the huge cost of this test launch just to check mass in orbit (I don\u0027t use Kerbal Engineer or other information mods so sometimes figures need to be double checked the hard way) is that I am getting economy of scale - most of the ship is composed of the same Nosecone\u002BX64\u002BX32\u002BMainsail assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babale","CreatedById":108874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T00:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is quite the lifter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E how many tons does it carry?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T01:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022babale\u0022 data-cite=\u0022babale\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is quite the lifter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E how many tons does it carry?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload is about 618 tons into a 100km orbit with a little fuel left over (not enough for anything serious, maybe shave any rough edges off the orbit).

I got stuck for a while trying to figure out the best way to do this mission in terms of how multiple ships might be utilized and how they would transfer supplies (docking 2 big ships 100 million km from home is not straight forward, nor is pumping fuel on a large, multi-engine, multi-stage vessel). I figure out some requirements, namely delta-v for each portion and a suitable amount of life support for the outbound and return trips (taking into consideration that the return trip might be longer then planned). Then I went and did some asteroid missions before coming back and finally just designing the mission as a single ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch platform itself is massive at 5000 tons. This is the biggest ship I will launch in KSP, I have neither the computing power or the launchpad space for something bigger at the moment. The payload itself is very similar to a stretched Ham interplanterary rocket and utilizes the upgraded return module tested in Kiwi (this replaces solar power with RTGs that can stay with it during reentry). With the first stage on screen (and within the ~2.5km physics range) it slows the game down to 40%, making some buttons and controls sluggish. Activating SAS requires holding the T key long enough for it to register.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NJTPF5B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NJTPF5B.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Am5tn4.png\u0022 alt=\u00222Am5tn4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHanemone Kerman, my first successful kerbonaut, will fly the mission.

With a successful gravity turn that won\u0027t be a problem and at 50km the engines are cut with 6 minutes of drifting expected before they can be lit up again to circulize. There is still 4400L of fuel available for the 116 m/s burn, though it will be moving a lot (that fuel is divided between 19 engines and 875 tons so it\u0027s much less then it sounds). A little over half of that fuel is burned to complete the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EC8yumf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EC8yumf.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zi6poNT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zi6poNT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in orbit with about 80 m/s of delta-v left in the booster we can begin plotting a course to Eeloo.

With the passage of time the next launch window for Eeloo was a bit different from the last - I found that the new window required a bit more fuel but was a bit faster. Checking I found that I still had enough fuel though it would cut down on my safety. On the opposite side I would obviously have enough life support though in hindsight I might have removed a small amount. The ship is lined up for a long 1974 m/s burn. The 2nd stage booster is only going to last for about 3 seconds and after that we need to rely on the 6 Poodle engines of the orbital section. Pushing 600 tons it is going to take almost 15 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RLk7AIy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RLk7AIy.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CBztZrG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CBztZrG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see the orbital module has 6 main tanks around the center tank (easily identified by the orange tanks they are composed of). 4 of those tanks are small and will be used in stage for this inital injection burn. The 2 double size tanks are going to be kept longer. They will complete the injection burn, be used for mid course plane change and finally should have a little fuel left to aid in capture at Eeloo. That\u0027s important since they also have the life support supplies for the outbound trip. By dropping them just as the capture burn starts we can avoid paying an additional fuel cost to carry them into Eeloo orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe length of the injection burn does pose some issues - even at 100km the ship eventually dips to 63km as it cuts across the upper atmosphere. The first pair of tanks are dropped within a few meters of the lowest altitude reached during the burn. The second pair are dropped much later as the ship is climbing out of Kerbin orbit at an altitude of 336km. The burn was started during the day, passed into the night side and then completed on the day side. For this reason both tank drops need a bit of gamma correction to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RUVjUEE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RUVjUEE.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MMrzoxS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MMrzoxS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RdwasxG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RdwasxG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in deep space a plane change must be executed to encounter Eeloo which will cost another 309 m/s. I didn\u0027t really get a good angle for the picture, the maneuver being plotted here is not braking, rather it is adjusting the normal - I\u0027m tilting the course upwards to intersect with Eeloo. One interesting thing I\u0027ve discovered in the Cupola and look forward to verifying in the other capsules is a neat trick with the navball. Normally you can run into trouble finding the blue maneuver marker because there is no guard as to which direction is the closest to it. With the other markers you have a retrograde counterpart so that you can always see at least one part. Well if you go into IVA view in the Cupola you\u0027ll that there is a maneuver retrograde marker, making it easy to line up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fwhzv4A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fwhzv4A.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JwwZhZc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JwwZhZc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 256 days into the trip I\u0027m closing in on Eeloo and make some minor course corrections to bring the PE down. I also moved around some life support in advance of reaching Eeloo, shifting as much as I could from the tanks that will be discarded into the tanks that will be kept.

The pair of external tanks are good for about 700 m/s of delta-v, then it\u0027s just the center engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E50axKS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E50axKS.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rnpJwhc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rnpJwhc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is now on the capture tank and engine.

For the most part I don\u0027t have a problem with the design and I\u0027m not looking for all kinds of fancy information but what I do need is for it to respond correctly and predictably to mouse clicks. There are a number of systems (several dialogs in the VAB for instance) where it is obvious there are conflicts between the UnityGUI elements and Squads stuff, meaning that the same mouse clicks get interpretted multiple times. This can vary from minor nuisance (AP/PE nodes are activated) to frustrating like nodes deleting themselves or suddenly changing multiple values at once. The mouse wheel hasn\u0027t really helped, since the mouse wheel focus doesn\u0027t work consistently either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I finally broke down and installed PreciseNode. I don\u0027t really like any mod that adds a window, despite them being part of the UnityGUI they never seem to fit with KSP and they clutter things up. After I was finished I did load up a training mission and played around with it, finding that I can remove most of the PreciseNode interface and leave just the basics that I want - adjusting Prograde/Normal/Radial and Time while getting rid of the stuff about ejection angles and conics mode. I\u0027m not completely clueless about how to write Unity code so I\u0027m tempted to make an alternate version that provides just those essentials while integrating more seamlessly with the KSP interface. With PreciseNode it\u0027s very straight forward to setup a return since I can adjust my node smoothly and can easily move the node forward/backwards even from a zoomed out position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jEaTmAm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jEaTmAm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capture drive provides another 50 m/s before it is exhausted.

While I burned most of my fuel getting back to Kerbin (remember that launch window update, it made my fuel much tighter and ended up giving me 300 extra days of life support) by discarding those sections I now double the remaining delta-v to over 800 m/s. There is more then enough life support in the cupola (which was topped off from the containers just before they where ejected). Approaching Kerbin low orbit I make a 700 m/s burn to remove some of my velocity, followed by a minor adjustment to put my PE at 27km. I want to ensure I capture but don\u0027t want to go in too hot. I have 20 days of life support so I can easily ride out a long orbit as long as I can capture around Kerbin.

The original small solid booster is gone, replaced by the tiny KESTES-1.

This one can\u0027t have anything mounted on top of it (built in nose cone) but it can be mounted radially to other things. This is used to build Arend 2 which now has 4 radial boosters, staged to fire in pairs before the original center booster. This design starts to tip even faster, by the time it reaches 12.4km (now confirmed as the start of flying low) it has almost turned horizontal and is mainly relying on upward momentum to climb. I get a low flying PresMat reading but nothing else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yqeIq1x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yqeIq1x.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zQVfUi7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zQVfUi7.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/okG01sH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022okG01sH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 solid boosters survive the crash and are now sitting a good distance away from the KSC. Arend 3 tries a short sighted solution to the tilting problem. 6 boosters are used, 4 tied together for the first stage and 2 (mounted east/west) are staged apart so that one can be activated early to try and correct the direction of travel. There are 2 problems with this. One is that the ship doesn\u0027t tilt anywhere near as far as Arend 2. The second is that the booster provides too much power and the forced staging delay means the other engine can\u0027t cut in soon enough to do anything. The ship is launched into a spin and becomes a write off, the only thing I learned was that it was safe to operate 2 KESTES-1.5 boosters beside each other without overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lEZ1fN.png\u0022 alt=\u00222lEZ1fN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7YB3lB3.gif\u0022 alt=\u00227YB3lB3.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArend 4 is the last ship in the series.

By the time it reaches 12km it is already on the final booster and traveling at 400 m/s though it is slowing down for the moment because the booster doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to maintain that speed. As the air thins out it begins to speed up. At 29.9km the flying high point is found and readings are taken. At 37km the final booster cuts out with the probe traveling at 720 m/s.

I\u0027m pretty sure with some basic control that I can reach a suborbital flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8MGXeyk.png\u0022 alt=\u00228MGXeyk.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NlFfuiU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NlFfuiU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kiwa","CreatedById":109641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T19:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to say I very much enjoy reading this thread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T20:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBaldwin 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArend was a series of unguided atmospheric rockets simply designed to \u0027go up\u0027. Baldwin is my first guided rocket and did get a few minutes of math to get a rough idea of how much power it would need to carry, what that would weigh, and what booster arrangement should be used to put it into space on a suborbital path. The arrangement is very similar to Arend 4, only 4 more boosters are added that feature the new wing control surface. There are additional batteries (12 batteries in all) and the instruments have been rearranged to include a GravMax and to try and remove as many redundent parts as possible. It\u0027s still weight balanced (with a second 2Hot required) but doesn\u0027t follow the earlier model of trying to get it perfect since I can correct for minor changes with the fins. Staging is setup as 4-\u0026gt;4-\u0026gt;2-\u0026gt;2\u002B1, with the large center booster being the \u002B1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RHTs8UN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RHTs8UN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/spTCR58.png\u0022 alt=\u0022spTCR58.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/slJf8X3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022slJf8X3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first 3 booster stages lift it to 10km at 174 m/s with the fins providing stability. The final stage runs on 3 boosters until the 2 smaller ones run out, then its a long push on the center booster up to 42km. By now most of the atmosphere has been cleared and the AP is at 80km which should put us in space. Coasting into space I can run three instruments - a single use of the GravMax over Kerbin\u0027s shores for 25 science plus the 16 and 8 science for the PresMat and 2Hot. I haven\u0027t budgeted battery power for anything else so after transmissions are complete the probe falls back down though there is just enough power left to keep it running up until impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6AEKBnE.png\u0022 alt=\u00226AEKBnE.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WmIEVTt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WmIEVTt.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fLD6rEw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fLD6rEw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe impact is rather unusual since despite a lack of parachutes only the probe core, a battery, the antenna and a 2Hot are destroyed on impact. Everything else survives. I unlock the T15 liquid engine and T800 fuel tank and while I\u0027ve got a good amount of science left I\u0027m not unlocking the first manned pod\u002Bparachute yet, I want to work with the liquid engine first and be sure I have a working ship before I start putting kerbals in danger. I may end up unlocking the node with the smaller liquid engine or the stack decoupler first as soon as I get a few more points of science to afford them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gI7UgCk.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022gI7UgCk.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wZVeSc0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wZVeSc0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
