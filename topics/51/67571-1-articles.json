It was a Class C, and it entered Kerbin\u0027s SOI such that it only needed the tiniest of nudges to put it into a stable orbit. I will spend more time trying to get it down to a 0 inclination orbit than I spent capturing it. It will be an excellent beginning to an orbital base of some kind. My plan is to have one of each type of rock in close orbits to each other. Perhaps some kind of space museum - tourist camp of some kind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I get to redesign all my previous ships using the better engines and tanks for the launchers.
