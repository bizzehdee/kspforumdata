For two generations, the new Pan-Kerbin government worked to rebuild shattered cities and knit together a planetary culture. Today, the Kerbal race is united, and the threat of war no longer hangs over the heads of most Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet, peace is not enough. Kerbals have a deep instinct for adventure and excitement, an instinct that was once channeled into warfare and nationalism. A new outlet was needed, now that armies have dis-armed and nations have vanished. And there were other concerns; the vast crater on the shores of Kerbin\u0027s major continent and the pockmarks on the Mun were testament to the violence of asteroid and comet impacts. Someday, that may happen again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, newly elected President Ydennek Kerman, in his opening speech to the Pan-Kerbin Parliament, set forth an ambitious goal: the conquest of space. He declared that it should be the goal of the Kerbal civilization to send Kerbals to every planet and mun in the solar system. Sensing the call of adventure - and the chance for explosions - the Parliament voted unanimously in favor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus was born the Pan-Kerbin Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis consists of 2 mission logs.

Genecas, who had recently earned his Ph.D. from Drofnats University, brought with him something Jebidiah called \u0022Mystery Goo\u0022 - a term that soon stuck with first the Kerbonaut corps, then with mission control teams, and finally with Genecas\u0027 fellow researchers, despite Genecas insisting it be called the \u0022Anomalous Substance.\u0022 Eventually, Genecas snapped, and called it \u0022Mystery Goo\u0022 just like everyone else from then on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then got the idea of exposing Mystery Goo to various environments on Kerbin and in space.

The Pan-Kerbin Space Agency had set aside funds and resources for five missions, and the final results were mixed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESurveyor 1\u003C/strong\u003E was launched on 1/019, with the goal being the Northwest Crater on the Mun\u0027s near side. Until proper communications satellites could be established over the Mun, it was decided that all landings must be on the near side. Farside targets would have to wait. Even with a target location, there was the question of where to bring the lander down. KSC kept Surveyor 1 in orbit around the Mun for close to 13 hours, going over images of the crater from orbit before selecting what they thought would be a suitable location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pj6puJU.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022pj6puJU.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESurveyor 1 detaches from its booster, less than 5 km above the surface of the Mun.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t until the final 100 meters that controllers at KSC realized their site was too rough for a stable landing. In a panic, the mission FIDO attempted to send a revised flight path to Surveyor 1\u0027s guidance computer, but with some errors due to his hasty typing. As a result, the lander attempted to spin in place, and chanced to be upside down when it hit the surface. All contact with the lander was lost. Because of its final speed (less than 10 m/s) it is believed that much of the lander survived the impact, but that the more delicate components - to wit the solar panels and omni antenna - were destroyed, rendering the craft deaf and dumb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESurveyor 2\u003C/strong\u003E launched a day later, on 1/020. KSC mission planners decided that the East Crater would be a better target, as there appeared to be fewer craters and ridges there. After a five hour flight, the lander eased into orbit around the Mun. It only took a single pass over the crater to select a landing site this time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurveyor 2 followed a similar descent profile to its ill-fated predecessor, but with better results. People in Mission Control breathed a sigh of relief when the craft neared the last 50 m with no sign of treacherous inclines or rocks below the lander. Surveyor 2 became the first soft-landed object on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGpNq8m.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022WGpNq8m.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESurveyor 2 on the Mun.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin moments, the lander began to send back pictures and temperature data.

Astronomical observations and the few pictures sent back from OSL-6 showed Minmus to be less varied and interesting than the Mun... but for the flat areas. Regions flatter than the great Craters of the Mun, flatter than Kerbin\u0027s oceans existed on this small world. Landing on one of these regions was deemed a suitable target. Between the flat, craterless expanses and the miniscule gravity, landing on Minmus was a much easier task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gjvEqX8.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022gjvEqX8.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESurveyor 3 separates from its booster.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing confirmed that the flat areas were indeed solid, rather than liquid as some scientists speculated (usually after having a few drinks in the R\u0026amp;D Lounge). A mystery equally strange was uncovered: several rocks were spotted in the distance, of a material different from Minmus\u0027 flat regions or its hills.

It was also a return to the Northwest Crater that had claimed Surveyor 1. A location further north was selected within the crater, seen to be potentially smooth and stable. As with the previous landings, Surveyor 4 used its booster to kill orbital velocity, detached the booster to crash on the surface, and then descended on its own LV-1 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OcP8OLK.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022OcP8OLK.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESurveyor 4, less than a few hundred meters above the Mun.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was almost textbook in its perfection, with the craft coming close to killing all of its velocity before touching down.

Two inclination changes were made to the lander\u0027s orbit, first to position itself over the midlands, and a second one just before the final descent burn, fine-tuning the landing to a spot that should have been safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CVGZkzf.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022CVGZkzf.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe final approach path of Surveyor 5.

There are a number of reasons for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. The breakneck in-game pace.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep everything straight in my own mind, I set up a nice little spreadsheet in Google Drive where I can enter vital information about each mission. Who piloted it, what the goals were, what the results were, date of launch, time elapsed, and so on. The thing is, looking back over my progress thus far, I\u0027ve noticed an unsettling fact. Missions are happening too fast from a standpoint of realism. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example. Year 1, Day 1 saw a total of 10 missions launched. Day 2 saw 4 missions. In total, my in-game date now stands at Day 34 and I\u0027ve launched a total of 38 missions. Even if one assumes the VAB has a nice big assembly line churning out rockets on demand, and funding that would make NASA green with envy, that\u0027s a bit much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. The mission grind.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might seem a little odd given the above complaint, but I\u0027ve found, looking back at my missions, that they seem more timid and tedious then when I first thought them up. Take the Hopper program, for example. I could have skipped Hopper 2 and gone with the much more ambitious Hopper 3 and netted more science for my trouble. A lot of missions were redundant, and I could have made better progress (and gotten more enjoyment) if I\u0027d taken some more risks along the way, set my goals higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, since I\u0027m starting out with career mode, I\u0027m still feeling my way, finding a way to play that I like (sandbox has spoiled me a bit, I\u0027m sorry to say). I\u0027m not looking to go the Scott Manley route (\u0022unlock the entire tech tree in just 3 missions!\u0022), but my snails-pace at science progress isn\u0027t satisfying either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above two complaints are mostly a case of gameplay, and are thus are easily fixed by starting over and learning from the experience. Since they are tied to this mission log, however, a reboot necessarily affects how this log will work going forward and so this leads to my third - well, not complaint, more like concern: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Flat reports.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJudging from the lack of responses to the missions posted thus far, I\u0027m left to conclude that my current writing style/skills are lacking. Certainly, it doesn\u0027t look like people find them interesting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of this I can understand: we have a number of people blogging their missions using one method or another now, and Yet Another Mission Log can seem a bit boring. It\u0027s a little hard to stand out from a crowd when everyone else is doing the same thing. But writing is also a difficult skill to master - especially when one does not get feedback on what one is doing right - or wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027d like to ask those of you who read this a few questions, in the interest of improving quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

The idea here is to simulate the time it takes to take data and turn it into applied technology. The rate I\u0027m settled on is to assume 5 science points consumed per game-day, after which new rockets using the technology can be built. This is still a fast pace compared to how we did things in our history, but more acceptable. I\u0027ve also decided that the Kerbal Space Center\u0027s R\u0026amp;D division has space and personnel to work on a maximum of 3 projects simulateously, so, if I have the points to do so, I can unlock 3 nodes at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee.g. In the new save I completed Flight Control and Science Tech on day 24 of Year 1. The next level techs beyond that are 90 points apiece so that\u0027s 18 days before I can unlock them - day 42. Since then I\u0027ve unlocked one other 45 point tech so that leaves me with 2 projects I can unlock by that date so long as I have the points for them. Then I can start new projects after that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also putting hard limits on what I can do by year. Year 1 for example will see crewed orbits and crewed Munar / Minmus flybys, but only uncrewed planetary flybys if I have the tech available by the time the various launch windows open up (first one - to Duna - opens up on Day 58 of year 1). Year 2 will likely see uncrewed Munar and Minmus landings, more probes, and possibly a Munar \u0022sample return\u0022 mission or three. I won\u0027t get to crewed Munar and Minmus landings until year 3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the result is a more realistic pace to missions and advancement, and that will be reflected in the new log once I get to writing it.

So, while the Hopper 4 rocket was being built, Flight Control technologies such as inline reaction wheels and controllable winglets were developed and tested nearby. Almost a full 30 days after Hopper 3\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s flight, Hopper 4 rolled out onto the launchpad, with Jebidiah Kerman in the pilot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s seat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A1ip01U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022A1ip01U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA flawless liftoff.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the new control technologies, Hopper 4 also sported a new innovation: side-boosters.

He stepped out, straightening his suit as best he could. Somewhere, he could hear a band playing the Pan-Kerbin anthem. For a moment, Yddennek was blinded by the flashbulbs of the typical photographer ambush. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to get this over with, he thought, and he walked onto the platform and over to the podium. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speech and award ceremony went, thankfully, without incident.

Bill had accepted his with just a muted \u0022Thank you,\u0022 goggling slightly at the planetary leader as though he had just been praised by the school principal. Bob was a little more solemn, but Yddennek noticed how weak his handshake was. Stunned by the attention, or something else?

Yddennek was introduced to the new kerbonauts, recently hired and going through their first weeks of training. Aldemy, a flight engineer involved with designing the proposed Mun lander, Obwig, a geologist whose goal was to study the Mun, and Kenwise and Milwig, both pilots with dreams of space. Yddennek made sure to say some words of encouragement to each, relaxing some as they talked. So far, this event wasn\u0027t the embarrassment he thought it would be--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone cleared his throat. \u0022Excuse me, Mr. President?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYddennek turned to the source of the voice, to see Jebidiah Kerman standing before him. Not smiling. In fact, Jebidiah looked a little subdued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, Jebidiah?\u0022 Yddennek said warily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I, uh...\u0022 Jeb took a breath. \u0022I wanted to thank you.

I\u0027m part of something important now.\u0022 Jeb smiled. \u0022And you made all of this possible. So... thank you. Thank you for changing my life.\u0022 He held out a hand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYddennek took it, suddenly finding it hard to breathe. \u0022That\u0027s... that\u0027s very touching, Jebidiah.\u0022 It truly was. Yddennek was stunned at this pilot\u0027s attitude - so different from what the reports said he was. Perhaps all the brazen attitude was an act, covering up something vulnerable and uncertain. \u0022I\u0027m glad this program has had such a positive effect for you. I hope it will be positive for all of us. For our civilization.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, me too. And, please, call me Jeb.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright...

Three photographers had heard the word \u0022picture\u0022 and were now converging on the group, cameras out like weapons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene looked at Jeb, reading Yddennek\u0027s worried expression. \u0022Jeb, maybe we should let the President be on his way...\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s all right, Gene,\u0022 Yddennek heard himself say. \u0022One picture can\u0027t hurt.\u0022 Much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure!

Honestly I liked the first run through you did, but yes, I can see why you\u0027d think things went a tad fast. This new run through does seem slightly better over all, but it may just be the way you\u0027re going slightly more into the personal details than the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw you put a limit to construction as well as research (two small rockets built simultaneously) but have you limited the tonnage built per day?
