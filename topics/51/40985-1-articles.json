(I choose the toroidal fuel tank with 30L of the stuff) Remember it\u0027s a Misnomer to presume a bigger tank is better, Either an element contributes negative buoyancy or it doesn\u0027t, If it dose then volume is only necessary to overcome the buoyancy of other elements in the craft.

Nothing is thicker than water not even Osmium. Although this dose explain why kerbin a planet 1/10th the size of earth gains its mass to have 1G Gravity. Also Explains why there are no clouds or hydrological sphere at all, You\u0027d need to heat this stuff upto thousands of degrees to vaporize it and if it moved, through a river it would obliterate any land mass it passed over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEE WE\u0027RE LEARNING STUFF!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Continuing on, unfortunately there aren\u0027t many normal elements denser, Osmium which I mentioned and perhaps some Lanthanide\u0027s Depleted Uranium ect...

Perhaps my observations might help, although I suspect you already know this stuff. In my experiments, I was just using stock parts apart from the Firespitter part that makes your vehicle spawn in the water. The actual vehicles were all stock parts, no boat mod parts or airplane floats at all. Anyway....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Conventional boats having their hull in the water, when made of stock parts, are a total waste of time. No matter how many rockets you put on them, they hardly move at all. Putting nose cones on the ends of the fuel tank bodies doesn\u0027t change this at all. You\u0027re lucky to get even 5m/s out of such a boat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Hydrofoils, however, can go quite fast. If you can get the whole main hull out of the water, you can get at least 80m/s (my own record before RUD). You make hydrofoils by putting legs on the bottom of the hull with wings and/or structural panels on the lower ends, these latter parts being angled up about 45^. The more you lift the hull, the faster you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Despite the relative success of hydrofoils in speed, they are totally uncontrollable. Stock control surfaces, winglets, and canards put in the water have almost zero effect at all, EXCEPT at very LOW speeds. This is contrary to how the hydrofoil fins apparently generate more force the faster they go. I\u0027ve also noticed this with the rudders on Firespitter airplane floats--you can\u0027t turn while taxiing on the water unless you\u0027re going very slow, and then turning is painfully slow. Same with hydrofoils.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Hydrofoils are dynamically unstable. The higher you get them out of the water, the more top-heavy they become until they roll over and explode spectacularly. This roll cannot be stopped by any number of ailerons either above or below the surface, even though those in the air have enough airspeed to roll an airplane quite easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When a hydrofoil wrecks, usually you\u0027ll have at least 1 fuel tank (part of the hull) stay attached to 1 radially attached I-beam (leg for a set of fins). The amazing thing about this is that when this bit of debris stops bouncing around, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eit will come to rest with the I-beam sticking straight up in the air\u003C/span\u003E, instead of pointing down under the surface as you\u0027d expect. This is especially interesting because it\u0027s exactly the opposite of the initial situation with the hydrofoil at rest and intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#5 really gives me pause. It suggests that over time, submerged parts lose their mass until it becomes negative. When radially attached, therefore, they move the assembly\u0027s CoM away from them, resulting in the visibly heavier side of the tank floating higher than the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Despite the ability of hydrofoils to rise in the water if their fins are angled up, angling the fins down will not make the boat submerge. There appears to be no change in the level at which the main hull floats and as a result, it never moves fast enough for the fins to do much for it. The only way I\u0027ve been able to submerge anything was to hold it under with a powerful rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. There is definitely a strong force below the surface that pushes up on submerged objects. Items forced below the surface will, once the downwards force is removed, rapidly accelerate upwards, MUCH faster than it went down. The upwards force is so great that objects will fly high into the air (like 250m up from 50m down) when they reach the surface. Then of course the objects slam back down on the surface and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, the oceans are strange things. They have a collection of mysterious and often contradictory properties.

The engine didn\u0027t generate sufficient TWR to lift off. Those Eezo tanks clearly have POSITIVE mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final experiment. I played around with Mechjeb to see what it had to say. Mechjeb suggested that negative mass craft have negative TWR and negative delta V. So part of me wounders if the game handles negative integers like positive ones... Kinda like with my previous mission the altimeter counted upwards the LOWER I got in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final Experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Darkphantom/screenshot0_zpsa6a7867d.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Darkphantom/screenshot0_zpsa6a7867d.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft was perfectly balanced to have Zero mass... If something this big truly did have No mass then RCS ought to be able to lift it, Mechjeb had kittens at first saying it had some insane amount of delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe reason why the value is slightly negative is because the more mono-propellant you use the \u0022lighter\u0022 you become making you Negative as you started at 0... Ultimately this thing wasn\u0027t able to take off, implying that some part of the engine reads the value as positive but other bits accept the negative value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to move away from this topic for now I might revisit what\u0027s happening here later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI know this is an old thread, but your results are exactly what I would expect of negative mass. It\u0027s counter-intuitive stuff. To whit:\u003Cp\u003EA positive force applied to a negative mass will accelerate the mass in the \u003Cem\u003Eopposite\u003C/em\u003E direction of the force. This comes simply from F=ma and keeping your signs correct. So the engine thrusting upwards is actually trying to accelerate the negative-mass ship down, and it doesn\u0027t take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gravitational field of a positive mass (Kerbin, say) accelerates both positive and negative masses towards it. For a negative mass, the force felt points away from Kerbin, but as per the above that force accelerates the negative mass towards Kerbin. Therefore a truly negative mass - as opposed to merely a buoyant mass - will not float away by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe experiment I propose you, or anyone who knows how to mod the stuff in, is simple: \u003Cem\u003EMake a ship with overall negative mass and an engine thrusting downwards with sufficient force to lift its weight\u003C/em\u003E. The weight being calculated as though all the mass was positive. If KSP handles negative mass properly, the ship will take off, flying with the engine burning \u0022the wrong way\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
