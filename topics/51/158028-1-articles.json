This is a report of my attempt at the Jool-Sarnus 10 challenge. For those who don\u0027t know, the Jool-Sarnus 10 challenge is to, in one launch, land on and return from all 5 moons of Jool (like Jool 5) and all 5 moons of Sarnus from OPM. Additionally, you have to do it in a ship that costs less than 250,000 funds. So, without further ado, let\u0027s get this thing started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter Time Warp Continued\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistant Object Enchancement\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngine Lighting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKopernicus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanetShine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealPlume-Stock configs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScatterer-SVE sunflare\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransfer Window Planner\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVen\u0027s Stock Revamp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission profile:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorking under a 250,000 fund restriction makes things... interesting. Lots and lots of gravity assists are used to capture into low Vall orbit for barely 2 km/s delta-V. From there, the core of the transfer stage (mostly emptied of fuel)\u00A0 and the Laythe lander detach. They dock together, head to Laythe, land, and return. The everything-else lander/fuel conglomerate then detaches from the mothership and docks to the transfer stage. Vall is landed on, then the ship heads for Tylo, then Bop, then Pol, and then back. The transfer stage then reattaches to the mothership and heads for Sarnus. Gravity assists are used to capture into a low Eeloo orbit at Sarnus, and similar things happen, with a dedicated lander for Tekto (which happens to be an exact copy of the Laythe lander), and a lander/fuel thingy for the rest of the moons (also a copy). Once everything has been visited, the ship flies back to Kerbin and into a direct re-entry (or, if that proves too kaplodey, gravity assists).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait... that was really confusing.

From there, the ship took the Eve-Kerbin-Kerbin-Laythe gravity assist path, ending up on an orbit intersecting Vall\u0027s. A Vall encounter was set up, and the ship inserted into an equatorial 22x22 km parking orbit. From there, the transfer engine/tug, with 2 of its three tanks empty, detached from the mothership, along with the Laythe lander. The tug docked to the Laythe lander and headed off for Laythe, aerocapturing neatly into a 55x55 km orbit around Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KRTOz9s.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022160\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KRTOz9s.png\u0022 width=\u0022282\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FsmIll9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022161\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FsmIll9.png\u0022 width=\u0022285\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C1cFqLm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022159\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C1cFqLm.png\u0022 width=\u0022284\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Fls7qgb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022160\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fls7qgb.png\u0022 width=\u0022285\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-01T23:44:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2017 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by IncongruousGoat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EImgur albums!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T23:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProgress update #2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe is complete!

Bop made itself unusually hard to get to, causing me to waste around 800 m/s in over-burning and corrections. Once I landed, my lander started sliding, and I had to hop over to a nearby valley to get the thing to sit still. And then I managed to accidentally put the lander on an escape trajectory by not paying attention to my orbit while trying to rendezvous with the tug. Pol, not to be outdone, blew me up on the way in via time warp collision glitch (an event corrected via tactical alt-F9). Then Jeb kicked the lander while getting out, sending it tumbling away. And, of course, coming back from Pol cost around 500 m/s more than it reasonably should have.

Yeah, I should have split this up more. I got a bit distracted by other things, and then ran into some... difficulties... in the Sarnus system that made me lose motivation. Transfer to the Sarnus system was uneventful, landing us in a 24x24 km orbit of Slate. The tug and Tekto lander departed for Tekto, completing that moon with only a few difficulties regarding me forgetting to feather the throttle on ascent from Tekto. Upon Jeb\u0027s return to Slate, he jumped in the Slate lander and polished that moon off. It was at this point that things began getting a bit more complicated. I realized that I would burn an egregious amount of fuel pushing the tug around the Sarnus system like the original plan had called for. So, I took the tug, the lander, and the lander\u0027s fuel reserve to Eeloo, with the plan to use the lander alone to deal with Ovok and Hale. The Eeloo landing went fine, and I sent the lander 1/3 full off to Ovok. Capture, landing, and orbit went fine. It was at this point that things got problematic. Ovok\u0027s strange shape, coupled with its low gravity, meant that the lowest stable orbit had a non-negligible period, when compared to that of Ovok itself. This and a strange orbital drift I began experiencing when close to Sarnus, made the return transfer hairier than I would like. To make matters worse, the lander burned every scrap of fuel it had inserting itself into a circular orbit. Jeb had to EVA rendezvous with the tug and then rendezvous the tug with the lander. It was this rendezvous that was the apex of my problems. I couldn\u0027t use the tug\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E in any quantity since I needed it to dock with the mothership, which meant an engine-only landing-no mean feat in a vessel as clumsy as the tug. Furthermore, I had to ferry Jeb between the tug and the lander in the middle of the docking to line up the ports. Once the rendezvous was complete, I refueled the lander with all the reserves I had left and sent it off to Hale-a much more pleasant place than Ovok. It\u0027s almost surreal to be in a sphere of influence where point-and-burn navigation is an effective way of getting from point a to point b. The lander returned to Eeloo, Jeb returned to the tug, the tug returned to the mothership, and the mothership returned to Kerbin. One interplanetary re-entry later, our intrepid Kerbal was home, safe and sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221PTC6nd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022264\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1PTC6nd.png\u0022 width=\u0022469\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Lan5vJa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022283\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lan5vJa.png\u0022 width=\u0022468\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ILJm7vQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022265\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ILJm7vQ.png\u0022 width=\u0022472\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KLnrR2U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022265\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KLnrR2U.png\u0022 width=\u0022472\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bToFH0q.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022261\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bToFH0q.png\u0022 width=\u0022465\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AQbeBGr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022261\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AQbeBGr.png\u0022 width=\u0022465\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-01T23:43:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2017 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by IncongruousGoat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
