Idea is to get the SSTOSO plane up in LKO (that\u0027s \u0027Single Stage to Orbit, Sort Of\u0027 because I use drop tanks and also eject one turbojet after it flames out) , then dock with with the transdunar stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst order of business was to roll the plane over next to the launch pad for a group photo before launching the two ships.

(Also, that it does not have a parking brake.) It started to roll--down one launchpad berm, up another, back and forth as Buzz frantically chased after it. I don\u0027t have pictures of this, as (1) I was jamming WASD and the view controls to try to intercept the ladder, and (2) I was laughing too hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of times the ship passed right over him, narrowly missing his head with the drop tanks and ram intakes.

I did consider that, but then of course I would have had to add some more airbreathing engines for the ascent through Kerbin atmosphere.
