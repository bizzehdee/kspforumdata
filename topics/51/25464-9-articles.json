Again, it\u0027s going down the other side where you need to be careful, or your speed can easily get away from you. The eight standard wheels don\u0027t have a lot of grip on the surface, so slowing down sometimes requires not only using the barkes, but also using the \u0022k\u0022 key for backpeddling. Still, I wouldn\u0027t want those ruggedized wheels because they can suddenly grab the surface while you\u0027re zipping along at high speeds and cause the rover to tumble (or so my earlier \u0022engineering simulation\u0022 tests showed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jBGb5oa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jBGb5oa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Emilynn Kerman calling Laythe Base.

The driving time (in game) from Vall Base to the top of the ridge separating Eve and Venus basins (the big dot) was about 2.5 hours. It was less time for me, of course, since I was running at 2x or 3x time warp. And I\u0027m sure Hellou and Emilynnm took longer because of stops to take samples. They stayed fairly high in the hills along the south rim of Venus Basin rather than go down into the basin bottom because they were heading for the pass over into the next basin at the southwest corner of Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aJuZQ3K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aJuZQ3K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next basin was a large one, which they named Aphrodite Basin. Again, our gals stuck to the foothills that jut out into the basin rather than go down to the bottom, just to make the route shorter. The speed of the rover was kept to under 25 m/s in this terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A1QkFO6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A1QkFO6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeading down from the foothills into the southern part of Aphrodite Basin resulted in the Fido catching some more air -- er -- vacuum, although it looks to be higher than it really was in the picture below because the low sunlight angle puts the shadow far off to the side.

The great circle distance between thos points is about 190 kilometers (the radius of Vall is 150 km).
