It was, in fact, originally projected to miss the ground by a mere 10 kilometers! When it entered the system on May 23rd, revised observations showed it was actually going to skim only 17km over the surface, still a significant brush through the atmosphere, which begged the obvious question \u2013 what was going to happen to it? Our knowledge of the composition of asteroids is still very limited. At best we can classify them into broad categories like Stony, Metallic, Carbonaceous, etc based on what we can derive of their makeup from their orbital characteristics \u0026amp; limited optical observation with ground-based telescopes. How well they hold together under heat and pressure no one really knows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo prepare for this event, scientists traveled by airship from Ockr City to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y7RYbFL.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eentry corridor\u003C/a\u003E and laid out several stations along the path with seismic sensors to measure any ground impacts and microphones to pick up on the asteroid\u2019s hypersonic passage \u0026amp; possible mid-air breakup. Then, there was nothing to do but pull back to a safe distance and wait. An hour after the asteroid was due to enter the atmosphere late in the day on May 25th, the scientists moved back in to collect their data, noting along the way from station to station no obvious signs of large surface damage on the landscape. When they looked at the data they saw seismic evidence not of an impact but of the pressure wave striking the surface from the asteroid\u2019s passage, along with audio recordings of the sonic booms as it traveled along the entry corridor\u2026 and back out into space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral hours of airship travel was necessary to bring the news back to Ockr from which it traveled over land comms much faster to reach Kravass City, home of the Kravass Observatory perched atop the 5km\u002B mountain under which the city sits. By now it was already well into the day\u2019s first night cycle so the team at Kravass Observatory rushed to setup the infrared scope, expecting to pick up the asteroid\u2019s signature easily due to the excess heat it would still be shedding after its pass through the atmosphere. They did have a lot of sky to cover though, being that it\u2019s still a very small object and no one knew its size or shape well enough to even begin to predict how a pass through the atmosphere would affect its orbit. It took two night cycles of observing before the elusive target was finally spotted, and during the following night cycle (3rd sunset to 4th sunrise today) its orbit was locked down:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled3-1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg height=\u0022256\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled3-1-1024x505.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled3-1-1024x505.png 1024w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled3-1-300x148.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled3-1-768x378.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled3-1.png 1323w\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022520\u0022 alt=\u0022Untitled3-1-1024x505.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current orbit of FZX-816(C) is in blue, the original orbit is in red. The yellow patch of orbit is where the asteroid was during the time it was being hunted, which you can see was a significant deviation from where it would have been if Kerbin had no atmosphere. The asteroid has in fact been captured into orbit around Kerbin, with a period of 8 days, 21h23m04s. However it is still on a trajectory that intercepts Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere and will remain so until it does eventually either crash into the ground or not survive one of its aerobrake passes. It is next scheduled to enter the atmosphere on June 3rd @ 19:21:01 UTC, where it will pass over \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Tracker/body.asp?db=bodies\u0026amp;body=Kerbin\u0026amp;map=true\u0026amp;loc=8.2617,179.8682,Sea%20Ring%20Crater\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESea Ring Crater\u003C/a\u003E.

They both followed the exact same route (with some \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1WLdHKU.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eminor deviation\u003C/a\u003E due to pilot navigational errors) but Jeb flew at 2km while Val took her flight up to 4km. Engineers have studied the data from both flights to confirm their belief that flying higher is more fuel-efficient thanks to the thinner air, which causes less drag. Of course, the thin air also means less air for the propeller to push against, meaning a slower speed, but the drop in speed is much less than the drop in drag. Flying at 2km allowed the aircraft to travel an average speed of 101m/s while producing an average 0.87kN of drag. Up at 4km the aircraft flew an average speed of 99m/s but the drag force was reduced by a much larger factor to only 0.76kN on average. This reduced fuel consumption by around 24% so although Jeb managed to complete his flight roughly 2-3 minutes faster than Val even though they both traveled 530km, he consumed more fuel than she did on her flight. Still, while the gain in fuel reduction for traveling at 4km will always exceed the gain in speed for traveling at 2km, doing so only gets the aircraft around an additional 500km of range. Unless the Civvie is really going the distance to get where it needs to go, flying at lower altitudes is more feasible mainly for the comfort of the pilot, as the cabin is not pressurized and only has minimal heating \u2013 it can get as cold as 18\u00B0F up at 4km during the early hours of the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny Mk4 #2 Looking Good for Launch May 31st\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough we said in a previous ops summary that we expected to launch by the end of this month, we realized today we hadn\u2019t yet announced an official launch date and time. It has now been set to May 31st @ 17:33 UTC. The rocket was topped off today and will be undergoing final integration on Monday, followed by readiness checkouts and rollout on Tuesday prior to launch on Wednesday. We will be returning to the ascent profile of coasting between booster stagings, and starting with a change in pitch of 1.5\u00B0 to signify the end of a coast period, with the final stage also not being allowed to drop below 100m/s of vertical speed before a staging event is triggered. Now that we know the rocket will fail under high dynamic pressure launching at full continuous thrust, we need to see how it will handle the upper atmosphere at full continuous thrust, meaning the third stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O engine will ignite at 100% throttle and stay wide open the entire time.

Upon striking the ground, the canister of compressed gas meant to fill the balloon ruptured and blew the entire thing to bits, KerBalloon crews out to track the balloon who recovered the remains have turned them over to the Genesis program to see if they can determine what went wrong. This was Val\u2019s first mission dropping a fully-equipped KerBalloon although she was the first to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=3424\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etest the concept\u003C/a\u003E earlier this year. Both programs have already cleared her of any fault \u2013 she literally only has to press a button and reported no strike of the balloon on the aircraft, confirmed with a visual inspection after she landed back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil the nature of the failure is determined, KerBalloon has suspended cooperation with Genesis and will instead return to launching the balloons from the ground. They also do not feel they have seen a reasonable profit increase when teaming up with Genesis. This doesn\u2019t limit their effect range that much, since using the aircraft to deploy the balloon rather than carrying it aboard a UTV to the deployment site only allows them to carry extra fuel to extend their range by about 200-300km. Although they anticipated contracts that would send them further from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, so far that has not happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe loss of the KerBalloon unit also included the loss of a barometer instrument and avionics unit, the latter of which is what is also known as a Master Control Unit, an integral part of any probe used in both KerBalloon and Progeny missions. It is an expensive part and so not many have been ordered since KSA began operations. This was the second to last MCU available and with the final MCU already integrated into the second Progeny Mk4 the KerBalloon program is unable to launch any more balloons until additional units arrive on Jun 2nd. These will be followed by additional units later in the month so that we eventually end up with 10 units to trade between the programs. We are also awaiting the arrival of replacements for several scientific instruments.

The Telemetry Data Unit that records all the flight details was also preserved without damage in the tail section of the aircraft. Investigators have all the information they could ask for and plan to spend at least the next week digging through it. When they release their conclusions later this month we will also include a detailed report of the Deuce\u2019s first flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was on medical leave today \u0026amp; will remain so over the weekend but is expected to return to full duty on Monday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAirborne Rocket Launch Postponed Indefinitely\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast week Jeb came up with the idea of using the two \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/index.php?page_id=1839#ffs-tabbed-13\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProgeny Mk1-B\u003C/a\u003E boosters we have in surplus to test the feasibility of launching a rocket from a plane. Lead Engineer Simon initially scoffed at the idea but since the Progenitor program has slowed down waiting for their new parts to be delivered, he had time to actually think about it and decided it was worth looking into. Jeb had suggested the idea with the Civvie in mind but after drafting up various mounting ideas Simon realized this just wouldn\u2019t be possible for various reasons. The Deuce, however, could carry the rocket on its back and in fact carrying payloads atop its tail section is what the aircraft was designed to do. However with the recent crash the airborne rocket launch idea will have to wait a while longer. Still, the Mk1-B currently under assembly will continue to be built so it is ready when the time comes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that using a Mk1-B isn\u2019t just being done out of convenience for having the boosters available.

The events of the crash will come out in much more vivid detail in the final accident report but I just want to make it clear this wasn\u2019t a planned event. I do sometimes decide in advance how things should play out one way or another, but just as often I go out and give a mission my best shot and whatever happens is what happens.

I actually stopped, saved the track, paused the game, deleted the track from the data folder, resumed the game, deleted the track from the game and started a new track. No difference. The only other thing I can think of is that there is this weird issue when I do named quicksaves that the camera switches to one of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/145633-113-hullcam-vds-continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHullcam VDS\u003C/a\u003E views or even opens the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95022-0-90-AFBW-v1-4-6-%28Joystick-controller-mod-SAS-bug-fixed%21%29\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAdvanced Fly-By-Wire\u003C/a\u003E dialog boxes. Well, sometimes if I use Backspace to return to normal view it screws up the camera or just screws up the hullcams so when I try to look through them I\u2019m staring inside the aircraft. This latter issue was present on this flight and could have caused some lag\u2026 somehow. I dunno, but it was the only unusual aspect to the flight. But hey, I still managed to land the Civvie intact!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, for the first time in v1.2.2 I took off in the Civvie from the ground, on the fixed gear. I was tipped off a while ago that disabling all friction on the wheels would help solve any issues related to misaligned gear and finally remembered to try it out. Nice to be able to have a rolling takeoff again (friction is re-enabled for landing because without it the brakes don\u2019t work!

Because I would be guessing \u0026amp; have to redo placement a lot I did all the initial setups without any graphics mods so things would load faster \u0026amp; perform better. While doing this I came up with a great way to save the location/orientation/altitude so that once I got the positions I wanted, I threw all my graphics mods back in and was able to just hop from place to place and switch to the hullcam and snap the shot without needing to fiddle around with the aircraft in a low-FPS environment.

This is the second time their prediction proved false and they once again took a close look at the software being used to plot orbital trajectories, finding that if they searched for the earlier \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E intercept themselves, they could see it happening but the software failed to detect the event.

The engines that were recovered from the sea floor show they were in fine working order when the crash occurred, consistent with reports from the telemetry data. They are now looking more closely at the faulty aerodynamics that Captain Jeb reported in his complaints about large sideslip he was forced to constantly counter. While this is going on, HAB workers have fully inspected the aircraft and determined the main wings, nose cone and the engine pods with all attached parts will need to be replaced while the rest of the aircraft remains structurally sound and operational.

I have just a \u003Cem\u003Eteeny\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E bit \u003C/em\u003Eof gamer rage when playing competitive games and after destroying my second PS4 controller I figured it was time to call it quits \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I decided to hop back into GTA Online since another friend of mine had it for PC. I created my new character, logged on and played through some of the tutorial missions and was literally just about to jump into a Time Trial to start earning cash and reputation points to begin building my career when all of the sudden I started receiving $50,000 every second along with like 1,000 RP - and I was like \u0022what the hell, no, no, no, no, no!\u0022 but of course I couldn\u0027t make myself log out. I watched as people in the text chat cried out in joy and thankfulness for the modder heaping cash \u0026amp; RP upon us all and was like \u0022well, maybe this isn\u0027t so bad?\u0022 Finally after accruing north of $10M and like level 60 I decided enough was enough and logged off. Then I went searching online for whether or not I was going to be banned in the next few days. Verdict: No. Turns out Rockstar will probably reset my cash accounts but I\u0027ll keep my level and anything I purchased before then. So I logged back in and started to go on a hardcore shopping spree, and along the way I managed to land in a session that got hit by \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E money and RP to where I had like $25M and now I\u0027m level 90ish. Needless to say when my friend finally logged on the next day I took him straight to my $7.6M yacht parked off the coast and he was like \u0022WHAT THE love DUDE?! Didn\u0027t you just start??\u0022 The next day when we were online together \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E modder came into our session and started dumping $$$ and RP - while at the same time doing things like spawning us all atop Mt Chilead with every possible weapon given to us (where of course a huge brawl would break out). Sometimes we\u0027d be floating in the air all doing push ups, or like a few dozen rocket cars would spawn overhead and kill anyone they landed on, the rest would get in and fly off. One time we spawned in downtown LS with cars floating up off the streets then crashing back down kinda like the terraformer effect in Man of Steel. It was pretty nuts. At the end of it all I had north of $60M and I\u0027m like level 124. So far R* has taken back only $25M-ish and worried they would take back more I spent the next two days buying up \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E I possibly could and modding the crap out of every car in all my 5 properties...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yea. I expected to take it slow in GTA Online and ended up binging the crap out of it these past few days in order to set myself up with all the money I got. If you\u0027re wondering why T2 is shutting down modding services, this is why. I can\u0027t really say I blame them - the cheating was rampant. Anyways, that\u0027s why it took so long for me to get this week\u0027s work done.

I do have good ventilation, so if it\u0027s 95 outside it is 95 in here and not any hotter but 95 is still 95 and way damn hot. I noticed when playing GTA even during the evenings after a while my framerates would tank because my GPU was shutting itself partially down to prevent a literal meltdown. One of the days I had planned to work until it got too hot then head to the mall to cool off and see Wonder Woman. Well, I didn\u0027t even get to where I was ready to switch off my computer before it abruptly shut itself off. Yikes. Thankfully I managed not to lose any data in the apps I had running at the time. That was 5 days ago now and since then it\u0027s been running perfectly fine now that the temps are back to below 85\u00B0F. This will be my first full summer in my new place, so I\u0027m still waiting to decide if I really need to shell out a few hundred bucks some A/C or not.

As the flight progressed I saw the percentage drop steadily from 98% all the way down to 50% and sometimes lower, which meant the game was running 1 second for every 2 real world seconds and getting worse. Hence, the Civvie developed a leak in its hydraulic system and Jeb had to cut the mission short. Now that I know it\u0027s an issue that worsens as the game is running I will switch back to the previous Kopernicus version for the next flight and see if the problem persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFinancial readjustments\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a reason you can only view the previous month\u0027s finance sheets via KSA\u0027s Google Sheets page and it\u0027s not just because each sheet already includes the prior months, but because I tend to go back and tweak income/expense numbers sometimes and no way am I going to make sure multiple versions available online are all consistent! In this case I went and added deployment costs for all the UTVs that went out with a KerBalloon attached to them - because I keep great records I was able to go back and do this all the way through last year where applicable. I also adjusted some contract payouts for high-altitude KerBalloons that fell short of their maximum altitude. I use the formula ((maxAlt - contractMinAlt) / (failAlt - contractMinAlt)) * payout to determine what fraction of the full payment is actually given to the KSA depending on how high the balloon got relative to the altitude when the contract becomes valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn additional formula I use is for deploying vessels from the HAB/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E: ((l*w*h)/t)*partCount, which is all data you can get from the Engineers Report down on the stock toolbar. It\u0027s a nice formula because if a craft is big but light and made of few parts it won\u0027t be much more expensive than a craft that is smaller but way more complex (more parts). Small and light vessels are also more expensive than small and heavy vessels because you figure they use advanced alloys or miniaturization to keep size \u0026amp; weight down. It\u0027s also entirely independent of the actual cost of all the parts that make up the vessel, which is something that is only paid once to build it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFull timestamps on mission report tweet timelines\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOMG this is something that makes me so happy, because looking back at the mission report timelines I love how they fill the page and are so easy to create but I have hated for so long the fact that you can barely see the timestamp on each tweet.

The most obvious change is the lengthening of the 3rd stage by adding an additional payload truss. This was done to both increase the effectiveness of the fins that are now lower on the rocket and allow us to add two more batteries so the rocket can stay powered up throughout its entire flight from launch to coast to re-entry and splashdown, gathering precious data the whole way. Another change was the bottom booster had its thrust reduced to just 81% so the rocket leaves the launch base at an initial 6Gs of acceleration. Coupled with the second stage booster\u2019s thrust reduced to 52% we are hoping the rocket will see stresses no greater than 40kPa as it ascends under power from both engines. Finally, the fins on the second and third stages have had their pitch increased by 0.1\u00B0 to account for the lower thrust. The added weight from the extra truss, batteries and fairings has increased the mass of the rocket from 1.764t to 1.789t and decreased the \u0394v from 2.543 km/s to 2.273 km/s. However we\u2019re pretty sure that anything above 2 km/s shot nearly straight up should be able to reach space and the Mk4 second flight had a projected apokee of over 100 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Monday the rocket will get its final checkouts and, assuming all goes well, will be rolled out and mounted to the launch base after 3rd sunrise.

For now, the maximum flight time a Civvie can endure is limited by the length of the day, not its fuel tank, as there are as yet no facilities either here or at KGA to allow planes to takeoff or land after dark. The Air Safety Administration has frustratingly been dragging its heels on setting up night flying regulations for aircraft and ground facilities.

This was a good week, went pretty smoothly. I\u2019m getting close to a major plot point so that\u2019s helping drive me towards what will soon be coming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart Commander Memory Leak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFound out what was making my flights slow to a crawl these past few missions. I keep meticulous records of pretty much everything the KSA does so it was easy to look at the video of a flight on May 25th and see everything was fine during landing, then look at the video of the next flight on 5/31 and see that landing was done at around 40% real time. My first attempt at solving the issue was, as I mentioned in previous Desk Notes, to swap out Kopernicus for a new version. Why? Because the installation log at the bottom of my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?page_id=14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emod list\u003C/a\u003E told me that was the only mod that was updated between the 25th and the 31st. When that didn\u2019t make any difference I knew there was something else I was missing. What else had I changed in the days between those two flights? I couldn\u2019t think of anything. Then I remembered to check what I had done differently during the flights themselves, and looking at the videos of the 25th and the 31st landings I finally noticed that I had replaced the Part Access Window for the flaps with a window from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150122-12-part-commander-continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPart Commander\u003C/a\u003E. The reason for this was because with the Part Commander window I could size it so \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E the flap setting was visible, which was the only data I was interested in. This gave me the room to open a second PAW for both engines when flying a Deuce. I tested in game and sure enough, when the Part Commander window was open KSP\u2019s RAM usage would tick upwards constantly. This is thankfully an easy fix \u2013 just don\u2019t use Part Commander until it is patched up or only show the window during takeoff/landing when I actually need to see my flap position. Even if the window is made visible, the RAM leakage stops as soon as it is closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny story though, is that I figured this out \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E flying the longest Civvie mission ever to gather atmospheric readings from the desert near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. By the end of that flight I was literally flying from the map view since that would allow the sim to run at 100% real time (that was another clue, BTW). Thankfully the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway running east to west means you can use latitude to align with the runway, so I flew all the way in from the map view just with that information (Val used her avionics) and altitude readouts from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-23-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-3\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E. I mean, I swapped out to flight view a few times just to make sure I wasn\u2019t about to run into the higher ground near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on this approach, but I think the time fraction in flight view was down to like 12% real time so it was impossible to actually fly.

Cheers and applause had barely gotten underway when all of the sudden arcs of electricity began to shoot from all the consoles in Launch Control and the Tracking Station. Kerbs still outside reported a huge ball of plasma around the Monolith. The scene inside quickly dissolved into barely-organized chaos as several severely-burned operators were tended to by emergency medical personnel that arrived shortly after the arcing had ceased after several seconds of crazy sparking. Elsewhere around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E campus similar reports were made, although at the time of launch no other building had as much electronics in operation as Launch Control and the Tracking Station. After nearly two hours of tending to injuries (no deaths, thankfully) and putting out small fires here and there, an overall assessment was finally begun - which is when all hell broke loose again. Thankfully with most active electronics destroyed during the first event there wasn\u0027t as much widespread damage done, lots of melting components but no serious arcing or fires, however new equipment brought online to help determine the overall situation of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was knocked offline. Repair work was begun again from a rapidly dwindling supply of spare parts when roughly two hours later a third event struck, and all recovery efforts were put on hold for 6 hours in case the events continued to repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow nearly 00:00 UTC, during this time we had been able to send and receive a courier to Umbarg via the access tunnel and the report came back of similar timing to events that included huge bolts of lightning coming out of cavern walls and melting power lines, exploding transformers and in some horrible cases rendering kerbals into instantaneous piles of ash. We had hoped to receive some aid from the city but it turned out they had their hands full. MSV Tongjess and MSV Lymun were both able to lend supplies, but the need for aid was still extreme. Commander Valentina volunteered to take a Civvie aircraft up to Kravass, the next-closest city. Thankfully one aircraft had still been in the Horizontal Assembly Building, which is heavily shielded, and was able to start up and take her aloft, which she did at 4th sunrise (01:16 UTC ). At best speed it takes a Civvie roughly an hour to reach Kravass and spending just shy of an hour there Val got back 3 hours later just as the sun was setting. Unfortunately the tale was the same as Umbarg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the following day, the 12th, we had decided the events were over and had begun to get basic systems and utilities up and running again after repairing our emergency generators with the last of our spare parts. Shortly after second sunrise at 13:34 UTC an airship en route to Umbarg stopped by with kerbs from Sheltered Rock and Ockr wondering why all communications with us, Kravass and Umbarg had been lost. To our relief, we learned that both cities on the other end of the continent had remained unaffected. We accepted some aid supplies from them and they continued on to Umbarg, apparently another airship was sent to Kravass as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore good news for us to share is that the Mk4 third stage survived re-entry and was recovered 135km downrange by Lymun! We never were relying on any command to be sent to the vessel to deploy its chutes, which were armed at 8km during ascent and set to a pressure sensor. It is in pretty bad shape, the engine is almost completely destroyed and the fuel tanks crushed but they did a great job absorbing an obviously higher than intended impact with the water and the payload bays are still intact. We\u0027ll have much more analysis once we have a chance to go over all the data from the rocket\u0027s TDU and what we can recover here at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the Monolith - the evidence we have at this time it was in some way responsible includes the eyewitness reports and the roughly 250m diameter patch of scorched ground that now surrounds it. Thankfully all researchers were here at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to watch the launch and no pilgrims/worshipers were gathered around it at the time. The kerbs that stopped by from Sheltered Rock and Ockr also relayed information that they had picked up large amounts of radio static from the upper atmosphere that coincided with the timing of events here. What exactly the Monolith did will require a lot of investigation to determine if this was a deliberate act to sabotage our attempts to reach space or an unintended side-effect of its true purpose for which we happened to be unfortunately vulnerable.We have spent yesterday restoring as much of our vital equipment as possible with what parts we were able to scrounge up, salvage or re-purpose. We can communicate again via this website and our media accounts, but it will take until next week until we are able to restore our operations services (Flight Tracker and Crew Roster).

That\u0027s certainly a convenient outcome of this whole episode but again, no. The reasoning behind what happened is much, much more complex and I can\u0027t really explain any further because things will now unfold over the next 2-3 \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E based off this event. Stick around, and you\u0027ll get to see how it all plays out on the grand scale (I have big plot beats defined but to be honest even I\u0027m not sure how it\u0027ll all turn out!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEdit 7/13:\u003C/em\u003E I originally only planned to stay offline for two days from the time of the Incident but I didn\u0027t see enough people wondering what happened so I was able to go back and re-schedule things for three days without too much trouble. Mwahah. This also was better though as I otherwise would have been working the day KSA came back online.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so moving on then, here are some things about this past week\u0027s rocket launch that you may find interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERocket mount photo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been gearing up for this for a while now. I\u0027ve always been a bit annoyed at myself for never actually \u003Cem\u003Eshowing\u003C/em\u003E a rocket being mounted because I go to great lengths to show just about every other aspect of operations around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I decided there was no way I was setting up for this historic launch without a mounting pic, and besides I had run out of other things to show that I hadn\u0027t done already. There was a small hint that this was perhaps coming during the last launch where you may have seen the mount vehicle rolling back towards the garages in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qLfYQSL.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis photo\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mount vehicle is constructed with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149233-12-pre-konstruction-weldable-ports-servos-cranes-and-magnets/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKonstruction\u003C/a\u003E parts and an Akita rover cab for the operator. Being an open cab I either had to view it from the rear so I could stick a generic kerbal in the seat or use one of the astronauts - Bill was of course a perfect fit so that worked. Unfortunately the vehicle I had built and used in the previous photo was not found in any of my game saves! But, that\u0027s why I have all my vital KSP files backed up with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrashPlan\u003C/a\u003E, which also does revision backups so I was able to look back through multiple Auto-Saved Ship.craft files to find the one of the mounting vessel and properly save it as its own craft file. Seriously, back up your excrements people. This is just one of many times CrashPlan has saved me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the grasping claw does not fully articulate and relies on kinetic joint movement for some of its armatures, which is a complex way of saying I couldn\u0027t maneuver it to actually pickup the rocket in-game from the bed of the carry vehicle. Also, when dropped onto the carry vehicle the rocket would eventually slide far enough off that the Kraken would appear and fling them both into the air. Picking it up off the ground was a no-go also. So what I did instead was just pose the claw in the flight scene, take a screenshot of the robotics window that has all the movement values, and then programmed that position back in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Then I just attached and properly offset a Mk4 vessel after merging it into the craft file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe space center crew being out on the pad is just taking photos of them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E then masking out and layering them onto the external shot. Unfortunately the workers do not have set animations, so I have to spend a good deal of time following them around with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134823\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EWasdEditorCamera Continued\u003C/a\u003E and wait for them to act the way I want while also being sure to capture them from the right angle. It must have taken me about 15 minutes to get that damn butt pick, following random workers around hoping they would do it, only to see the one in the background doing it! The kerb behind the carry vehicle looking up was just a bit of detaching his head from his neck and tilting it back. Also, it\u0027s not as visible as I thought it would be because I had to make him smaller than originally captured, but the marshal\u0027s vest does in fact say \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 rather than \u0022KSP\u0022. Shadows were manually drawn to really make them blend into the scene, as well as some lighting adjustments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I messed up a bit on having the fuel tankers out on the pad - they really had no reason to be there (they went out with the carry vehicle last time but that was because we were going straight for launch from mounting) but I liked how they crowded up the scene and had already placed a kerb walking away from them and the two standing there talking when I realized my error. So I came up with the excuse of tanking the rocket to ensure the extra weight of the added payloads would not cause undue stress on the launch rail. Ehhh, a bit thin for like 23kg of extra mass but whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch delay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realized there was no way I actually wanted to get up for a launch early in the morning, but why wouldn\u0027t the KSA want to launch the rocket at the earliest opportunity? So I planned to have a weather hold during the first launch attempt. Then I realized I wanted to try to rope as many people into watching this launch bomb out as possible with KSA going offline, and setting it up to have an ambiguous delay would mean anyone that did actually bother to tune in probably wouldn\u0027t stick around to see if it launched that day cycle or got scrubbed to the next. So I just had the MSV have a scheduling problem so I could move the launch back with enough time for people to see the change and maybe still tune in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still had a weather delay, because I decided to see what the game would put up for cloud coverage on that day and it turned out that it did actually clear up within a few minutes of the actual launch time so I let that play out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECan you see the planes?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea they are barely noticeable but they are there, the two Civvies parked on the tarmac outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. I originally forgot to include them in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X5qRKJi.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eshot from the bunker cam\u003C/a\u003E and wasn\u0027t sure if they would be a noticeable.

I\u0027ve discovered a while ago that launching manually via the space bar and launching via kOS script for some reason can lead to extremely different results during the initial flight phase. I have no idea why, because it\u0027s not a timing issue, it\u0027s the way the rocket leaves the launch sticks that is noticeably different for both methods of launching. Very strange. Anyways since KSA has talked more about the upcoming Progeny Mk5 automation I felt now was a good time to introduce the AFCS, which will become a legit aspect of the automation control scripts I\u0027ll be publishing as they are developed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe actual launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt only took me two tries to get this launch done - getting better! I would have had it in one, but for some reason \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s windows have taken to hiding themselves randomly and I can\u0027t figure out why. It did it during both launches and the second time I was just like \u0022screw it\u0022 as I have other sources of similar data to turn to if needed. I also had to go back through the launch recording to determine when I did all my manual staging because since I wasn\u0027t decoupling the fairings on this launch I moved them into their own staging group separate from the chute, but that added another stage to the stack and my recording script was looking for specific stage numbers to recognize when an event happened. Not a huge deal but just one of those examples where small things can trip you up in unexpected ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I didn\u0027t think about it until I started getting into post-launch activities but - I should have quicksaved while I was in space!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThat eclipse shot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first I took a regular photo of the eclipse with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip11-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00244-17042016-11-compatible-faster-loading/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EScatterer\u003C/a\u003E, then I used \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140580-112-kopernicus-105-may-28/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKopernicus\u003C/a\u003E to disable the atmosphere around Kerbin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E\n\n@Kopernicus:FINAL\n{\n  @Body[Kerbin]\n  {\n    @Atmosphere\n    {\n      %enabled = false\n    }\n  }\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made sure to also remove \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128858-105-realistic-atmospheres/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ERealistic Atmospheres\u003C/a\u003E since that edits the same node.

There was still damage also done to sensitive electronics equipment in any unshielded labs and buildings.

Finding nothing but charred grass, they moved in closer and received no subsonic vibrations typical of the Monolith\u2019s \u201Ckeep back\u201D behavior, which was also lacking in the days leading up to what scientists can only describe right now as a \u201Cdischarge\u201D. The biggest difference instruments have picked up is that the object is now extremely cold, even colder than the surrounding air, whereas in the days before its discharge sensors nearby had detected increasing levels of infrared radiation.

In these locations the surface of the rock literally exploded with the force of the released energy, which also killed and wounded many kerbs.

I\u2019m going to cruise through several more days to set me up with a 3wk lead \u002B a few days to compensate for work I\u2019ll be doing over the 4th of July holiday that\u2019ll keep me from making progress.

So, I didn\u2019t want to just temporarily remove the pages from the server and have the links 404. My initial attempt was exactly as you may have seen it during the event (if not, here click \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/Tracker/bodyDown.asp?db=bodies\u0026amp;body=Kerbol-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis link\u003C/a\u003E) but if you right-clicked and selected \u201CView Page Source\u201D in your browser you would immediately see that all it was was a page set to display a timeout message after 15 seconds. It was pretty thinly-veiled and you can all take it as a compliment that I consider you to be a smart audience who could potentially see right through that. So, I had to somehow make the site not load and show the timeout message without tipping my hand that it was a deliberately-scripted event. How I did it might still be obvious to a web developer who took the time to actually look through a couple thousand lines of code but I simply hid all the other page elements in a div element so everything would load as normal, it just wouldn\u2019t show up. Looking at the source, you\u2019d see thousands of lines of the usual code, with no ASP errors and no JavaScript errors showing up in the debug window either. I even stuck the actual message string as a variable in one of the JS libraries so people couldn\u2019t search for the timeout window text within the source to try and figure out where it was being generated in an attempt to backtrack what was happening. Hopefully all my efforts were for naught because no one bothered to try to pick apart what was going on, but if anyone did\u00A0further than I hope they came away thinking it was something really happening somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe WordPress site going offline was way easier, just downloading and installing an \u201CUnder Construction\u201D plugin that let me switch off the site and display a cool message in theme with the site. I got lucky it was the first plugin I tried, although not all luck since it was top-rated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also deleted all the KSP forum cookies so that the next time I visited the site it wouldn\u2019t automatically log me in and I could select the \u201CSign in anonymously\u201D option which let me still access the forums to reference stuff (like the 3D system model) without tipping people off that I was still around.

If you must know, I\u2019m now 35. I\u2019ve always planned for kerbals to have shorter lifespans than humans because I wanted to have another excuse to rotate more characters throughout the story and have some actually retire. I haven\u2019t decided on an exact age range yet but Jeb is already 43 and I don\u2019t want them living past 60. The general idea is they mature quickly and stay active late in life, so even if I decide to cap lifespan at 50 years Jeb could still be an astronaut for 5 more years at best. Anyways, I don\u2019t want Drew Kerman to die before I do, so I had to make him really young, which also fits with his backstory of already being rich thanks to his parents so he wouldn\u2019t have had to have worked much to be wealthy enough to start KSA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI am a GTA:O griefer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, still playing GTA:Online with a friend of mine and having a good time, even when going solo.

We\u2019ve done a basic comparison between this flight and the last, but full analysis will not be done until Monday. Still, there are some interesting things to note, like how the 4th flight staged the first two boosters both higher than the 3rd flight and ascended slightly more vertically but ended up with a lower apokee \u2013 no doubt due to the lack of throttle-up on the 3rd stage engine. Also despite being higher the rocket was traveling slower, which made the nose pitch over faster and decreased the coast times. We are also still going past 40kPa during ascent, this time topping out at 61.42kPa \u2013 but only during the first stage boost, so if the rocket can ascend with an initial 2G of thrust we may stay below 40kPa the duration of the flight. We also noticed a large precession, or wobble, to the rocket as it was re-entering this time versus the last flight and are not sure why. Thankfully although it did slam sideways into the atmosphere a bit the spin did not turn flat and the engine still took the brunt of the re-entry force as intended. Definitely a lot more scorching on the sides of the rocket though. Finally, the landing was perfect this time around, with the initial chute deployment adjusted down from 6km to 4km. Further analysis Monday will lead to decisions for our ascent profile for Tuesday\u2019s launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerBalloon and Genesis Continue Contract Missions\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth programs had missions this past week to satisfy 4 contracts in total.

After the 1st stage was expended, the entire rocket was blown up via the Flight Termination System command sent by the Range Safety Officer after confirming the rocket\u2019s course with Guidance and receiving the order to terminate from Flight Director Lanalye, who had a brief consultation with Operations Director Drew Kerman. Running out the first stage reduced the size of the explosion and limited debris raining down towards spectators, but it also allowed us to see how fast the rocket would be accelerated \u2013 it stayed below 40kPa. How this data will be applied to the Mk5 program is still under review, the Progenitor team expects to release a report next week. We can say at this time that the first Mk5 launch will not occur until early September, however we do plan to launch all 5 initial rockets in a cadence similar to the last two Mk4s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a look also at a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEvVtMD3JTY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evideo comparison\u003C/a\u003E of the three last Mk4 launches that allow you to see how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E affects the rocket at launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce Rebuild Complete, Trials to Resume Next Week\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Deuce has finished its reconstruction in the Horizontal Assembly Building, sporting its \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GQPiS55.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enew tail design\u003C/a\u003E.

No serious icing formed during the balloon\u2019s ascent and it made it all the way up to 24.990km before bursting. This was great as we haven\u2019t had a clean ascent in a while, however the fact that it took 3 days meant that our net income on this mission was almost nil thanks to requiring a relay airship to be on station for that long.

Keologists working at the site have determined that the material forming the island is not stable enough to support an inset bowl as originally designed, which flies in the face of earlier reports by a separate team that did the initial site survey. The backers of Arekibo have since signed off on an alternate construction proposal, which would see most of the material already excavated treated into a concrete mixture and used to build a dish atop the island. The downside to this is that the original 180m dish has been reduced to just 84m, which will still make it the largest on the planet but radio scientists are nonetheless dismayed.

Imagine my surprise when I triggered my science instruments in the latter half of the Civvie mission this week and didn\u2019t trigger a contract completion. There was no thermometer on the aircraft. Derp. I fixed that after the flight, and thankfully because of the delays it was okay to say the Civvie was rolled out a few days ago when the mission was initially planned so it makes sense they would have parked it off to the side after the first day.

However I then realized an even better reason was that doing the Civvie mission at the same time as the Deuce ground trials would let me relegate the Deuce activities to the background, which was great because I didn\u2019t plan to have Val do anything different than what Jeb had already done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again the Deuce trials were flown without me doing any prior testing myself, so whatever happened was what happened, there was no pre-plotting or anything \u2013 I could have crashed in the water, crashed on the ground, but I did actually end up landing okay both times.

I know playing Flight Simulator for many years that the aircraft can tend to be a little left-friendly when it\u2019s just you sitting in the pilot\u2019s seat. But it\u2019s a small thing. Then again, no one ever said the physics in KSP were perfect\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, had some trouble with my Saitek X55 joystick sticking. Annoyingly, the piece that keeps tension between the base and the spring gets stuck, which lets the joystick flop around like a helicopter cyclic. This happened a while ago too and was one of the reasons I stuck with my X52 until I needed to use the X55\u2019s dual throttles. Surprisingly the stick worked great when I first started using it, but now it\u2019s been getting stuck again. Application of WD-40 has done no good, I may need to look into some silicone spray if it gets worse. For now, I just swapped out for a heavier spring to force the piece back down. This has increased the joystick resistance, which I don\u2019t really like, but it works.

Commander Valentina and Captain Jebediah have both flown through and around these areas in various fashions to collect the data required, but this past week Tarsier Space Technology asked if we could go a step further. They requested that data be collected around the target area within 4-5km of the center, from 1km to 4.5km (Civvie\u2019s service ceiling). To attempt this, we equipped the Civvie\u2019s radio beacon receiver to emit pings as Val flew within the proper range, with decreasing intervals as she drew close and increasing intervals as she flew away. Using this, she was able to successfully fly within the required constraints.

The first test flight had a serious yaw problem and I saw the red numbers in the derivatives window and I figured out how to fix them for the second \u0026amp; third test flights. Red numbers in the pitch were still there and I knew they were there but I didn\u2019t really understand how they would affect the aircraft until I flew it and realized yea those numbers too would have to be fixed. I don\u2019t want the C7 engineers to be coming to these conclusions from raw calculations though, which is why I liked how Jeb was able to determine the aircraft was unstable once pitch was dampened when at first C7 was concluding it was him being too hard on the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk4 launch #4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis past week was the second to last Mk4 launch and it went great from a technical standpoint, the Flight Tracker followed all the events properly. Funny how it was the 4th Mk4 launch on August 4th \u2013 I didn\u2019t even realize that until the day of. I kind of wish I could have added a bit more suspense by saying stuff like how most of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was evacuated in case the Monolith did something else but I had to play into the fact that there was now a gag order on Monolith news so KSA wouldn\u2019t have been able to mention it that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlying the DME arc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo since Civvie flights have begun to get a bit routine and boring (to write about anyways, I still love flying them) and I don\u2019t yet have anything else going on that allows me to relegate them to the background, I decided to add a new challenge of flying a certain distance from the target area.

It was still a challenge, but it was doable to turn towards the target until the distance slowed its change, then level out and turn back in when you started to get too far away.

Overall asteroid detection rates have gone up, but it has also become more generalized and less-focused on the NKOs that could pose a threat to any future surface inhabitants.
