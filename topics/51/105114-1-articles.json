The mission was designed to correct the problems associated with the partial failure of Kosmos 2, where it was assumed that aerodynamic forces caused the vehicle to fail.

Its objective was not to do scientific research in space, but actually launched with an RT-5 booster and landed just outside of the Research and Development complex.

Is completely outrageous. The very first flight of the Kerbal Air sub-program has ended in catastrophe. Valentina Kerman, the first female Kosmonaut and the first Kerbal to ever reach space perished when the plane was unable to take off, and then unable to slow down. The plane struck the beach just to the East of the Space Center and exploded, killing Valentina instantly.\n\nThis is a stark reminder that flight is a dangerous business, and no mistakes are allowed.\n\n**Total Science Collected:** 0\n\n[**Back to Top**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n**KA-002**\n\n**Mission Date:** April 29, 2015\n\n**Crew:** Jebediah Kerman\n\n**Mission Cost:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A114,151\n\nKA-002 was, fortunately, a success. The mission was a very short test flight, meant to test a safer redesign of the KA-1 Caracara, the Kerbal Air sub-program\u0027s first jet aircraft. The craft can now take off, and as Jebediah bravely demonstrated, can also land safely.

Alxy Kerman really delivered on her first-ever flight, which also happened to be the first real non-test flight that was also sort-of a test flight. The mission involved performing crew reports at two locations on Kerbin, Kerman\u0027s Gambit and Gregvis\u0027 Drift. In addition, Alxy took some nice photographs of Kerbin from the cockpit of the aircraft, as well as provided interesting information about the KA-1 Caracara used for all three KA flights thus far. The plane seems to be capable of supersonic flight, but it will not be until further testing is completed that a speed run will be authorized.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Urlee Kerman performed a nearly flawless first flight. The only hiccup occured when attempting to pursue a tricky contract objective, one that required a crew report from 17,000m above the ocean. It turns out that the KA-1 Caracara is unable to fly within these parameters, and the mission changed to pursue two other readings.

Jebediah Kerman, ace pilot of ace pilots, was called in to test a brand new procedure. KA-005 was the first flight to ever make two touchdowns in a single flight. After first taking off from the runway, Jeb piloted the craft to a site and performed several observations after landing the plane in the grasslands just to the southwest of the KSC, before taking off again and flying home. The plane he was flying was outfitted with a single radial parachute to make the landing, for safety purposes. Jebediah did take the opportunity of the easy grasslands setting to perform some low-flying stunts, but overall the mission went swimmingly!\n\nADDENDUM: Wonderful news! KA-005 finally brought the Program back into the green figures for cumulative success! The current success rating for the entire Program now stands at exactly 85%, the borderline for a green-rated program.

The mission was designated X for Experimental, as the Kerbal Air sub-program was contracted to test a new type of landing gear, one that actually retracts into the body of the aircraft. Wonderful technology! However, it turned out to also be the cause of the half-failure. Jebediah Kerman was selected as pilot for his ability to perform under extreme circumstances. When his plane landed by parachute at Scott\u0027s Scar Alpha to collect an EVA report, the plane was reported to have tipped over to one side. It presented no significant cause for alarm, so the gear was retracted and extended to right the plane.\n\nHowever, while taxiing across the ground to reach Scott\u0027s Scar Beta to collect another report, the plane keeled over and the left wing was destroyed. The plane righted itself, but a short time later Jeb turned the plane too sharply, causing the plane to tip and explode, sending debris over the area. Jebediah survived when the cockpit detached, and was forced to walk the remaining distance on foot.\n\nFun times!\n\n**Total Science Collected:** 10\n\n**MET:** Data Lost\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** Data Lost\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** Data Lost\n\n[**Back to Top**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n**KA-007**\n\n**Mission Date:** May 4, 2015\n\n**Crew:** Jebediah Kerman\n\n**Mission Cost:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A115,151\n\nKA-007 was a great, simple mission.

Missions that are manned landings have the special designation \u0022Lander\u0022 which sets them apart from other missions.\n\n**Total Number of Muna Missions:** 1\n\n**Failed Missions:** **0**\n\n**Success Rating:** **100%**\n\n**Total Program Cost:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A130,805\n\n**Mission Index**\n\n[Muna-1](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n**Muna-1**\n\n**Mission Date:** May 1, 2015\n\n**Mission Cost:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A130,805\n\nMuna-1, although failing in three out of four designated objectives under the recent Munar exploration contract, is generally considered a success, as the mission revealed tremendous amounts of data regarding Munar missions. The mission had, apparently, a deficit of battery power, and was unable to generate the necessary amount of power to sustain itself. Originally planned to touch down on the Munar surface, Muna-1 instead impacted the Mun at over 700 m/s. It was a fantastic fireworks show ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) The data collected from Muna-1 will aid future missions with absolute certainty!\n\nIn addition, a new procedure has been added to the data collection checklist for now and future missions: Reporting the cost of the mission. In addition, new counters have been set up to track the Program\u0027s public bank account sum and the total amount of Science points at any given time.\n\n**MET:** 3d, 00:12:26\n\n**Total Science Collected:** 0\n\n[**Back to Top**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T12:44:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:44:50Z","Content":"***-Newsflash!-***\n\n**Jebediah Kerman Cheats Death!**\n\n**May 2, 2015**\n\nEarlier today, Jebediah \u0022Jeb\u0022 Kerman, ace pilot of the Kerbal Space Program, was involved in an explosive aircraft accident.
