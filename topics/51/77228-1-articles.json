Well, I EVA, and as soon as the kerbal lets go of the ladder, suddenly the camera switches to orbital view, completely disorientating me. I tried to adjust and move the kerbal back to the command pod, but as soon as I got close the camera would switch constantly from orbital to reentry views, completely disorientating me again.
