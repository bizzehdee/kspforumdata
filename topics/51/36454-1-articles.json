This is Glauber speaking. Severino, do you copy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Copy, Glauber. Sitting nice and cozy here on top of all these tons of explosive rocket fuel. Are we clear to take off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Just a few more seconds, Severino. I was told to go over a few details about the mission with you again. I understand you were a last minute addition to the crew, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yep. My little brother was the designated pilot, but he fell with this girl and now isn\u0027t available to comit with a long duration mission such as this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And is was very nice of you to volunteer to take his place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What can I say? I was getting restless down here. Space is my one true love, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Very poetic. Are you getting along with you colleagues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sure, we\u0027re already best buds. Right, Marcos? Right, Viridiana?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Um, okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ain\u0027t Viridiana such a talkative girl? I know she\u0027s going to spend most of her time in the new base taking care of plants, so the greenhouse is sure to be full of loud conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t tease her, Severino. We have your clearance for launch. We go over the details later. You may start the countdown now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MFRfM0t2jsQ/UdDQ8BsEyYI/AAAAAAAAA94/VicMlaa6Sco/s1024/screenshot389.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot389.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VfWtgl8eLF0/UdDQ6QlEKHI/AAAAAAAAA9o/qKwWC2GVKn8/s1024/screenshot390.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot390.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vQQcwcyG-d8/UdDQ8Xx7tNI/AAAAAAAAA-A/zlxV0kd2AaA/s1024/screenshot391.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot391.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Woohooo! Low Kerbin orbit achieved! The Porreta I is ready for transminmunar injection!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Well done, Severino! While we wait fpr the transfer window, let\u0027s go over a few more bits. Not only you\u0027ll be on charge of getting this bunch safely to Minmus, but you will also be landing by remote control the equipment we have already sent to orbit the little moon. Are you familiar with this equipment?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sure, there\u0027s a probe on the surface that\u0027s going to be part of the base, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, that would be Turquoise I, which we sent a couple of weeks ago. I\u0027m sending you pictures of that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V3yEPndrlBM/UdCIgOKORiI/AAAAAAAAA5k/gzvHJQTpv14/s1024/screenshot345.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot345.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ILgieilfjfQ/UdCIgYlM3eI/AAAAAAAAA5o/76_NG-NIArY/s1024/screenshot347.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot347.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Apb93B3wj6s/UdCIiRONjnI/AAAAAAAAA6E/ejU0Hc-3-2M/s1024/screenshot353.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot353.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z28jlNBpR3w/UdCIk_htVdI/AAAAAAAAA6U/cK_ay9Y9dQI/s1024/screenshot357.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot357.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XdLBSUDv6ho/UdCIlJFpakI/AAAAAAAAA6c/GLfXtWkDjUk/s1024/screenshot358.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot358.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nice! That is one huge-ass rocket, I must say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, that\u0027s the Hecatomb I model. We launched three of those to get all the equipment you\u0027ll need in orbit. This was the first one. Notice the probe is a lot larger and heavier than would be needed for a simple landing on Minmu\u0027s small gravity. That\u0027s beacuse it carries a kethane-fueled power generator and a fuel reserve. You\u0027ll need that fuel, if the whole system we rigged to extract kethane from that deposit under the surface fails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I also noticed they landed the ship too. What was that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We decided to leave the nuclear ship a few kilometers away from the base site, as another fuel reserve, and maybe even as an emergency return vehicle. The ship was very efficient and we had lots of fuel to spare, and we\u0027re not taking chances with this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Other than having me as a pilot, you mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-okE5XcE89bE/UdCh4PzJ7EI/AAAAAAAAA80/FZYlcoPUsFY/s1024/screenshot382.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot382.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GpFHG--H1xY/UdCh4egIk8I/AAAAAAAAA84/faYTwiAHriI/s1024/screenshot383.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot383.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- That\u0027s the rest of the equipment, which we sent a few days ago. In the first pic you have the Extraction Module, with the robot lander and the manned rover. The second one shows the Habitation Module and the Hydroponics Module. Both were sent by the same rocket model as the Turquoise I probe. We plan on leaving those nuclear stages in orbit, as another fuel reserve. We\u0027ll need that fuel until we get the kethane refinery running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Neat. I hear that little rover is quite a marvel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, we\u0027re quite happy with the project. A very useful little vehicle. You won\u0027t be able to put the base together without it. Okay Severino, your transfer window is coming up. I\u0027ll let you do your work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Thanks, Glauber.

Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m fine. We\u0027re all fine here: me, Marcos and the near mute girl, Viridiana. I told you I was going to send you pictures, so I\u0027m sending a few annexed to this e-mail. I\u0027m afraid there isn\u0027t much to see here.

The rocket was just a big tank with a detachable thruster. We got rid of the atomic engine, and voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1: we had an orbital fuel reserve, which the guys at the space center decided to call \u0022Minmus Station One\u0022.

It was a very easy landing, a lot nicer than landing on the Mun. Going out and stepping in a new world... I thought I would never have that sensation again. It\u0027s a real rush! I can\u0027t believed Juca passed this opportunity for a girl. Good for me, now I\u0027m not only the first kerbrazilian in space and on the Mun, but also the first one to step in Minmus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V3vCJBT8kXM/UdGad_PLYVI/AAAAAAAABA0/yBXi_AITrt4/s1024/screenshot410.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot410.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s4IyI2R4wlg/UdGaegdbLxI/AAAAAAAABBA/bJzQiI9LUdE/s1024/screenshot413.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot413.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We didn\u0027t have time to enjoy the low gravity though. There was work to be done. After my two colleagues enjoyed their first visit to the surface I got back to the lander, where I remotely controlled one of the modules in orbit. It was time to land the extraction module. Again the landing was easy, and Marcos and I went check if nothing was damaged.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Mb6iNQiyNo/UdGafXB0J9I/AAAAAAAABBI/_KeMiHPc2ww/s1024/screenshot414.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot414.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eWf1_LD0rLs/UdGafvR9vwI/AAAAAAAABBM/oRWMt6Br3J8/s1024/screenshot416.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot416.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s me checking the controls of the Cambito, the little rover that came with the extraction module.

We couldn\u0027t sleep on a kethane drill, after all. Back at the remote controls in the lander, I undocked the robot lander that came with the extraction module and it took off back to orbit. Since the habitation modules, which were waiting above us, didn\u0027t have any thrusters, we needed the little ship to land them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kk7oeH9BGJo/UdGaj92okpI/AAAAAAAABB4/yG4Cf4TACOI/s1024/screenshot426.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot426.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lW1CAxgFud0/UdGalThJr4I/AAAAAAAABCQ/4ACxtPnzrQ0/s1024/screenshot428.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot428.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6q49nOleGSE/UdGalT0JoyI/AAAAAAAABCU/OHrd2mzaqMk/s1024/screenshot429.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot429.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And landing them was a challenge. Not only I had to bring two wobbly modules down, but also I had to drop them delicately on the ground separately, before landing the lander. No problem, though. You know how much I like challenges.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-018dusDbINs/UdGanRt2mmI/AAAAAAAABCs/9EooAIEfXVU/s1024/screenshot431.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot431.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QACBFHlFk7A/UdGanmWFPkI/AAAAAAAABC0/whZK_-2MiMk/s1024/screenshot433.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot433.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then Marcos and I were back on board the rover, speeding towards the modules. Another cool thing about the Cambito is the RCS propulsion system, which allows us to gain and loose speed more rapidly on the low gravity of Minmus. Soon we were bringing the greenhouse module back to the base. Viridiana lost no time, and went to take care of her little plants.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rvYHuMY9JFQ/UdGaqwOoSdI/AAAAAAAABDY/zJhu2Qa_UyI/s1024/screenshot438.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot438.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ev__txX6Edg/UdGarzghmkI/AAAAAAAABDo/2wlTEsMkKC0/s1024/screenshot440.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot440.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And in no time we were docking the habitation module in the Base. And so was ready the first kerbrazilian base on Minmus. Well, not ready, but inhabitable. Arcadia still had much to grow. I promise to write you again soon, Mom. Until then, take care. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings from Minmus,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Severino\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
