I\u0027m in the big desk, with huge shoes to fill. I look over the asset list and the science pools and just shake my head. We have a 7.2 million pool of resources and a science pool large enough to pull the trigger on a half dozen advances should we need them. And I\u0027m here because Werner made mistakes? If that\u0027s the expectation, it might not be as fun a place to work around here as it\u0027s been in the past. It will definitely be a tight-rope for me to walk. But lets discuss that later. I\u0027m Charles Kolden, the new KSP director. Lets look at today\u0027s mission activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 Mission KM2RovLP2 2.0\u00A0 Our Minmus rover mission. It\u0027s been on planet for 8 days. Pilot, Seanul, Engineer, Bill, Scientist, Shelbert. This is a stricken mission, with a rover that\u0027s been hugely reduced in effectiveness. We caught Seanul turning donuts on Minmus at high speed. When we told him to stop showboating, he pointed to the mission objective to test the new self-righting mechanism. With reluctant fairness to him, it did take 7 attempts before the rover failed to land on it\u0027s wheels. However, by the time he did manage to get it to land on the science jr, only 1 of the solar panels was functional. So now, multiple times during the day we have to stop and park the rover into Kerbol to recharge the batteries. One of Werner\u0027s mistakes was authorizing a replacement rover for them. It\u0027s still 5 days away from Minmus. However, they will have finished the major science efforts and the mission contract within 2. I\u0027ve repurposed the delivery mission. More on that later. They drove 7 km before I made them park to turn mission control over to the Minmus Probe teams Distance driven in this mission segment. 8.5 km 98 to go on mission route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 Mission KM2Pr 4.0 More than anything, the 3.0 and 3.01 Minmus probes cost Werner his position. The 3.0 probe arrived on it\u0027s assigned polar orbit, and the contract refused to pay out, citing a lack of mission critical equipment. The design team left thermometers off of both the 3.0 and 3.01 missions. 4.0 and 4.01 were launched, with thermometers and an upgraded probe core. 4.0 reached it\u0027s assigned orbit today. 4.01 is near it\u0027s assigned orbit, but we\u0027re waiting for it to be over the specified sector before making the final mission burns. Further millstones from these missions, all 4 have undersized antennas HG-5\u0027s and were overdesigned fuelwise. Both 3.0 and 4.0 have 1300 m/s worth of fuel left in their transfer tanks, beyond the 1038 m/s in their adjustment tanks. As they are in nearly the same orbit right now, I\u0027m considering the worth of sending the refueling probe into Minmus orbit to drain those transition tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Mission KM1RPrP1 1.0 Our bright spot for the day. We picked up Burlo from Munar orbit, and burned retrograde to the Mun to return them home. We couldn\u0027t get a free return, but it got us more than 2/3 of the way back, and the probe-guided ship still has 930 m/s in reserve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 Mission Rover delivery. This mission has been repurposed to finish a temperature survey mission from points on opposite sides of Minmus. We came up with a plan to dip in and out of orbit to pick up the 2 \u0027below altitude\u0027 requirements when we had Jeb in orbit, but it was deemed he had too low amounts of fuel left and he wasn\u0027t allowed to attempt it. At the time I thought \u0022this is Jeb, he\u0027s gonna do it anyway\u0022 but surprisingly he obeyed the command to burn out of orbit. I guess he was worried about his tank too. Anyway, we\u0027re going to do the orbit dipping with this probe and use the thermometer on the rover. Our ground rover drove under the point for the \u0027below 2300 m\u0027 requirement and confirmed it\u0027s in the lesser flats, so maybe we will drop the replacement rover there also. We burned today to move our entry trajectory from a high polar orbit to one with a periapsis of about 9000 m. A final check before committing the burn exposed a staging flaw that would have decoupled the rover when the lander stage\u0027s engines were triggered. That would have been an auspicious beginning for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnd Entry 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starchaser","CreatedById":139724,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T08:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Correction to above. it was really day 158)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntry 2, Day 158-159\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boys on the rover didn\u0027t manage to get far today, as rough terrain kept them moving slowly and other missions kept making them park while other teams used the control room.

The designated sector is slowly catching up with it. it still seems to be a quarter of it\u0027s rotation away from coming under the probe. Patience is a virtue here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew contracts. We were offered 3 new contracts today. Placing a new station in Munar orbit. I guess someone wants bookend stations there. The specifications for this station match the one we already sent into orbit. The lifting vehicle for our station design is large enough that although the payout seems huge, we\u0027ll only make about 40k profit on the mission. We accepted this mission and KM1Sta 1.03 is on the way to the Mun already. Going in and tightening up on smaller design flaws in the rocket made for a much smoother liftoff than the first station, which we almost scrubbed, but somehow the rocket came under control once the first 4 boosters were jettisoned. This was under control throughout, but still required us to delay the gravity turn until very late.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nan image of the rocket pre-launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/HLPw5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/HLPw5\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt got cropped out of the pic somehow, but Jeb managed to sneak aboard and we almost launched with him in the probe. He knows it\u0027s supposed to be under probe control in transit, but he\u0027s just itching to go into space again. DM0Pr 1.0 is hanging out just outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, waiting for it\u0027s burn window in 79 days for Duna. I haven\u0027t told Jeb yet, but 2 weeks before that burn I\u0027m going to authorize a manned mission in to orbit and conduct science in the Duna system. I am toying with it being a 3 man ship. We\u0027ll see how the group\u0027s track record looks over the next 60 days. Anyway, one of our probes caught this pic of the station entering orbit. Quite dramatic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/H9lmH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/H9lmH\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second contract was a completely new mission for us. A derelict probe in low kerbin orbit. I thought about this one hard. The design team gave me several options, but without seeing the probe I don\u0027t know what\u0027s viable. I thought about making a close flyby with existing material to get a look at it, but nothing was really close enough to make that effective. In the end I thought of an old Hal Kinden movie I saw about a suborbital passenger craft that suffered a malfunction and got blasted into orbit. It was laughable in several ways, however they solved their re-entry problem by using a slightly bigger heat shielded ship to ride interference. Never mind that there is no way that doing that would allow the sub orbital craft to decelerate fast enough to not crash into the leading ship. However it did lead me to approve sending a grabber unit mounted on a 2.5 meter rocket, and use the bigger mass to protect the probe. It presented a design challenge. With the grabber unit we can\u0027t mount a top parachute, and the engineering team assured me that modeling just bringing down the fairing base, and the grabber would be horribly unstable, and likely to flip, we are landing the maneuvering stage along with the probes to provide extra weight and stability. We all have our fingers crossed on this one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/0wPxX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/0wPxX\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last contract is for 2 tourists to land on Minmus.

There\u0027s 1 more science stop, then the contract survey to go. Then it will be time to drive back to the rover. As an aside, perhaps it would be a good idea to include a probe core on these landers, even if they are manned. It would have saved a lot of time if we could have moved the lander to the second survey area while they drove the rover there.

The other required survey location was almost exactly on the other side of Minmus, although both locations were below the equator. We passed just west of the location, however we were still over a different section of the Lesser Flats. A decision was made to land, and drive as a rover to the location, and then take off briefly again. The landing was successful.Then the \u0027fun\u0027 started\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny attempt to move the rover at all, resulted in the craft wanting to pitch over. It didn\u0027t take us long to discover that the craft\u0027s reaction wheel from the lander was also trying to execute commands given to it\u0027s wheels. We disabled the reaction wheel and were off.About an hour later, a tight turn was needed but the top-heavy rover couldn\u0027t handle it. One of the lander\u0027s solar panels paid the price. Turning the reaction wheel back on, and we were able to get the rover upright easily enough\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bJx2MFU.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bJx2MFU.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn image of our wounded craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the turn, it\u0027s a straight drive to the test zone. This unit has plenty of electricity, over the previous rover, as it has the batteries of the rover and the lander. We debated pushing on to target, but after flipping it, we were all kind of shook up and decided to put it to sleep for the night\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starchaser","CreatedById":139724,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T03:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Oops.
