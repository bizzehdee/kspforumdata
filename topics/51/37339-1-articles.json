The pit is very wide, at it\u0027s widest well over a kilometer I should think though I have no precise measurements as of yet. These pictures should hopefully give you some sense of scale.

As the pit narrows it becomes very hazardous as any bump into the sides can send your kerbal spinning uncontrollably, they will accelerate downwards and the next time they hit the sides they will be squished. The jetpacks are only barely able to overcome the gravity. I let the kerbal free fall from 5000 meters to 4500 meters and then never stopped thrusting upwards trying to slow down for the rest of the trip. Eventually it was narrow enough that although collisions were unavoidable they were frequent enough that the speed was kept low and I descended to the bottom which had an altitude reading of 199 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen things got weird... the bottom is too narrow (like a cone) for the kerbal to stand so he was constantly glitching and twitching. After a few moments the view went completely black and the altitude started spewing out non sensical numbers of the form 111111 or 555555 or 777777, it finally stopped at 666666. I thought the game had crashed but the clock was still ticking, I just couldn\u0027t see anything. I switched to the tracking station and it briefly reported that my kerbal was on an escape trajectory from kerbol... then he was gone forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Got some pictures from the bottom this time.. very strange!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/CKh27\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

A word of advice, do not make them round, the hole is actually more squarish so they end up pinned at two points and turn over on their side.
