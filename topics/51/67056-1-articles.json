It received a signal from far below and aimed itself towards the coordinates received. It sighed silently. It was time to wake Jeb 9000. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb 9000 was an idiot in it\u0027s experience. \u0022Who needed to speak when they can compute?\u0022 It asked itself before sending a blurt of data to the Jeb 9000 module attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb 9000 woke immediately. \u0022Hello! Ready to get started?\u0022 It asked, as far below Alby Kerman sent it a signal to fire it\u0027s engines. The mission had begun. The burn was long, and almost exhausted Hyperion Eeloo\u0027s nuclear transfer stage, but it was not decoupled. The extra Delta-V would be needed to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at KSC, everyone was asleep except for a single engineer using a file for a pillow. The file\u0027s name?
