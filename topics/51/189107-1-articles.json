I\u0027m not sure how far it\u0027ll go, but I\u0027ve got sufficient material for at least a few chapters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout further ado, here\u0027s a little prologue, to establish the backstory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe warning light flashed on, then off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Ah, it\u0027s nothing.\u0022 Jeb dismissed it, tapping the console. \u0022I thought they told us this thing was state-of-the art.\u0022 Their vessel was indeed state-of-the-art, the best ever constructed. Their mission was to land on the Mun, but it seemed as though that would never happen, perpetually delayed by minor technical problems. They\u0027d already been sitting in Munar orbit for five days.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002248.76\u0022 height=\u0022499\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402568987289976835/635574440994013184/screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Hermes 1, our boys on the ground have given you the go-ahead to land.

It seated two astronauts, with room for all the supplies they would need on the surface. It also came equipped with a heat shield and parachute, for the return to Kerbin. Sure, the thing was ugly, but it got the job done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n* * *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack in the Mission Control facility, Gene Kerman was nervous. He\u0027d just told two of his finest crew members that nothing was wrong, but he wasn\u0027t completely sure of that. Sure, the computer guy had insisted that his device would perform flawlessly, but Gene doubted that would be the problem. He knew too much about the capsule\u0027s fragile design to be so na\u00EFve. Any number of the dozens of subsystems could fail at any moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Alright, beginning deceleration burn.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E Bill\u0027s voice sounded cautious as he relayed what Jeb was doing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe craft began to descend, just as it was supposed to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot12.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002248.76\u0022 height=\u0022499\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402568987289976835/635574431401639956/screenshot12.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene watched as it fell, its altitude going from 25000, to 10000, to... 16000?
