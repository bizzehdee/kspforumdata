So he scrounged some parts and created what he called the Belly Flopper Mk I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3677/12641141303_5625605073_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641141303_5625605073_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core of the machine was the ladders on the deck in the middle with posts at the ends to push against. Thus, both acceleration and braking. Sadly, no steering control unless he quit pushing to tell the probe to do it. And because the probe was facing up, it didn\u0027t do a very good job of this. Also, because Jeb had no idea how much thrust he could make, he built it as light as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://ycpi-farm8.staticflickr.com/7435/12641140943_600983c181_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641140943_600983c181_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis worked surprisingly well. So well that it led to the discovery that Jeb could easily push the vehicle faster than the little wheels could stand. So Jeb walked back to the shop and created the Belly Flopper Mk II by the simple expedient of putting on sturdier wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://v4s.yimg.com/sj/2836/12641012535_6932dc48b1_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641012535_6932dc48b1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this way of mounting the lander can caused Jeb to experience a Hell Kraken attack when he tried to jump down onto the Belly Flopper. This problem, however, was easily solved once Jeb got back from Hell, and the Mk II took off like a bolt of lightning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://v4s.yimg.com/so/7296/12641140563_7185030b87_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641140563_7185030b87_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, Jeb was easily able to tear the wheels of this version, too. What he needed was wheels that could stand high speeds. Besides, others around KSC were claiming he wasn\u0027t really pushing the vehicle, the powered rover wheels were doing it. So when Jeb finished the long walk back to KSC again, this time he used aircraft wheels for the Belly Flopper Mk III.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://v4s.yimg.com/sk/3747/12641490844_38417b75c6_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641490844_38417b75c6_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the most successful version yet. It was still quite fast, although not as fast as the Mk II, but the wheels held up. Jeb easily reached the ridge at the edge of the plateau west of KSC and then climbed it with ease. Then he went tearing off across the high plain. Eventually, however, he got tired, so was able to test the braking mechanism for the 1st time. And it worked great, although he then had to quickly get the probe core to set the parking brake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb then wanted to get off and plant a flag to mark this success. There was the question of how to get back aboard, however, because the Mk III lacked a boarding ladder. So Jeb simply retracted the landing gear. This led to the discovery of a new problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5550/12641140133_9bfa41a82b_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641140133_9bfa41a82b_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals on ladders don\u0027t go well with retracting the landing gear. Jeb decided he needed a chair for this. But then he couldn\u0027t pedal the thing. But if he was in a chair, he could steer. All he needed was to con somebody else into pushing. And then he could enjoy the ride a lot more. And then he wouldn\u0027t have to walk home wearing his Belly Flopper like a hat \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanymore......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater that day:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Hey Bill, wanna see my cool new rover? I call it the Belly Flopper Mk IV.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3768/12641140023_c7c66c02fd_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212641140023_c7c66c02fd_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Jeb, this thing\u0027s got no wheel motors. It can\u0027t move.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022It\u0027s got a new type of motor. To see it, you have to get on this ladder between our seats and look through that tiny hole in the center of the deck.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as Bill got on the ladder, Jeb snapped the shackles around his wrists and ankles, trapping him there facing backwards. Then Jeb pulled the cattle prod out of his pocket...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Hyah, mule! Giddiup!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022OUCH!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd away they went, Bill sweating and straining and Jeb steering with 1 hand and wielding the cattle prod with the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/laATcdj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022laATcdj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon they reached the slope up to the plateau. But for all Jeb\u0027s strenuous efforts with the cattle prod, Bill just couldn\u0027t get the Mk IV up the hill. But fortunately, the Mk IV allowed Jeb to steer better. As the Mk IV petered out and started rolling back down, Jeb turned and then applied the brakes, stopping to take the slope at a shallower angle. And this time, Bill managed to get to the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yFW7DoP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yFW7DoP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb was perplexed. He\u0027d gotten the Mk III up this same hill no problem. It must be that Bill was just weak. It couldn\u0027t be that the Mk IV was too heavy. But just to make sure, Jeb decided to test it out on the highest hill atop the plateau.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bbncgbi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Bbncgbi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, Bill proved unable to take the slopes head-on, confirming Jeb\u0027s suspicions that Bill was just out of shape from eating too many snacks. It required a long, spiraling route but eventually the Belly Flopper Mk IV reached the summit. Good thing, too, because the batteries in the cattle prod were nearly exhausted. Jeb put it aside, set the parking brake, and enjoyed the view. Simply amazing! He had a rover that had gotten all this distance without a motor or using any fuel or electricity (other than the cattle prod). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GSO9zp8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GSO9zp8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb decided to plant a flag so he retracted the landing gear and jumped down. And while this didn\u0027t create any noticeable glitch at the time despite Bill still being chained to the ladder, a glitch had apparently happened. That\u0027s because when Jeb planted a flag on the very apex of the hilltop, the flag teleported out of his hands and ended up half a mile away, floating about 15 feet above the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NPA6CIQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NPA6CIQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is rather a shame because Jeb had attached a lovely message. Now nobody will ever be able to read it because the flag\u0027s up out of reach, besides not being in the right place. But Jeb had memorized the message and kept telling everybody about it when they got back to KSC that night. It read:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKPV Mountain\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Divine Jebediah chose this spot to demonstrate the awesome power of his Kerbal-Powered Vehicle, which will usher in a new Golden Age for all Kerbalkind.

It was at least going fast enough to bounce, flip, and partially explode over a long distance when failure occurred. This bouncing was due to not all wheels failing quite simultaneously as they had on the Mk I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe airplane wheels on the Mk III and IV never failed so when they got going fast, I switched to the probe core to check the speed.
