lot of pancakes. \u00A0This is because Tiktaalik\u0027s MEM is designed to operate differently than the one in Voyage, despite being the same craft in general. \u00A0Tiktaalik\u0027s requires a chute and ballute for a safe descent. \u00A0Voyage ditched these two parts and had the MEM just use aerodynamic braking and a powered descent phase. \u00A0Therefore, trying to do a Voyage-style descent in the base MEM results in death and destruction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

couldn\u0027t slow down fast enough to prevent a crash. \u00A0Furthermore, I discovered that the descent stage lacked enough fuel to make a safe descent, only containing 900m/s delta V. \u00A0My solution was to add more fuel in the descent stage to extend the usable descent burn time and hopefully have enough delta V to slow the craft down for a safe

were longer than this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to squeeze in enough fuel to bring the descent stage delta V to about 1800m/s while keeping the Martian \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at 1.0. \u00A0A few more descent tests resulted in the craft being better able to kill velocity, but I still ended up crashing due to bad piloting (practice makes perfect). \u00A0Also, the additional fuel meant additional weight, but the deorbit solid motors were still able to get the MEM into an orbit that either fell below the ground at 150 km or resulted in aerocapture at 300km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, even with the additional fuel, this may still not be enough to allow for a Voyage-style ascent. \u00A0Delta V margins are still tight, and so are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel margins. \u00A0Turning the craft ate up precious \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel and descent delta V, so\u00A0I found that I would always run out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E trying to keep the craft stable during powered descent, and on the last test, even with the large gimballing range of the aerospike engine, I ended up tumbling and crashing after running out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Every other time, I was fighting to keep the vertical velocity low enough to hope that the MEM slowed down enough from air resistance to get the surface speed below the remaining delta V. \u00A0This took practice, and I almost achieved this on my last descent attempt before the tumbling hit and I lost the lander and crew to a fiery crash. \u00A0The other times, I would end up unable to kill my descent fast enough with the engine, and I\u0027d pancake. \u00A0This is not including my attempts at doing a skip re-entry, which uses up \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E as well as I need it to angle the MEM in the hopes of gaining a bit of lift on descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I\u0027m stuck with this issue of needing more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel for descent, which adds more weight and thus requires more descent fuel, eventually leading to an unsolvable problem thanks to the law of diminishing returns and the rules of the book. \u00A0The only possible solution to this is to use some of the ascent stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on descent, but I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s enough margin for that. \u00A0Furthermore, I still may need more descent fuel as it is to ensure I don\u0027t run out, as I have never got the craft slowed down below 400 m/s before a crash or unrecoverable tumble (most of this velocity being horizontal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, I\u0027m stuck wondering if it\u0027s even possible to do a Voyage-style descent in the NAR MEM. \u00A0I\u0027m also stuck wondering what Columbia did in the book to supplement the removal of the chutes and ballutes. \u00A0I vaguely remember them removing them because they weren\u0027t going to make much of a difference, but i don\u0027t have a copy of the book with me to check what they did, or if there\u0027s any indication of how Gershon landed the Challenger. \u00A0Maybe the book took an artistic license on the whole thing, which would seem odd for a hardcore science fiction novel. \u00A0As a result, I may have to break the purity of this recreation and use chutes and ballutes for my descent, or add aerobrakes. \u00A0This is not something I want to do because I think it would ruin the challenge of doing it by the book, but if the book presents something that is impossible in the game, I may have to just ignore the book and think outside the book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m open to

\u00A0It means that I have to activate the descent stage at around 35 km - 40 km\u00A0altitude at peak shock heating in order to even have a chance to prevent pancaking. \u00A0I go by time to impact on MechJeb to see when I should fire, and with the current engine, I end up having to fire at no less than 2 min 30 sec until impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to look at the thrust myself from the Atomic Rockets page, but when I convert their kilograms of thrust into newtons, I get crazy numbers in the millions of newtons, and this was after converting it in two different ways (assuming the thrust was kg force and assuming it was N/(gravity)). \u00A0I\u0027m not sure where Atomic Rockets gets their number, and I can\u0027t find any documentation on the NAR MEM that would allow me to figure out what units they were using and convert from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChecking the Atomic Rockets page, that looks a lot

I did it in a single launch, but I needed something like the equivalent of 40 F1\u0027s to get it off the ground (in the form of 4 radial Pyrios boosters and a sustainer using 24 RD-171Ms (more powerful then the F1).
