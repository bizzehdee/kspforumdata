I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve managed to push past that initial phase, and onwards to greater things. I got so excited that I decided to write about it. Which is great, except that for the first few years of my program, I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t taken any screenshots. Boo. Ah well. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not about to bloody restart again; that would defeat the whole point, and you wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be reading this! Instead, I have decided over two posts to catch up on the last few years of my game as best I can, and this week has been perfect for it \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 no time to play KSP, but lots of small bites of time with which to write.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this iteration of the universe, a world not unlike our own is playing out a history not unlike ours, except that the Kuban missile crisis never quite resolved itself, and the Kerlin wall remained standing. The tension that divided our world in two for half a century persisted through the new millennium, and still exists now. Spurred on by the fear of total annihilation and the eradication of all Kerbalkind, various smaller space agencies banded together in 2015 to form a global initiative. With funding from all participating nations, the agency was designed from the ground-up to focus on the colonisation of other worlds and the preservation of Kerbalkind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am currently in Year 5 of the game, and have a number of different projects underway, and assets floating about being useful in some shape or form. The first three years don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really need much catching up on; I flew into space, I did science, I came back from space. I went to the Mun. I went to Minmus. Only at the end of year three did it get interesting, with my first interplanetary mission to Duna; VOYAGER I. Unfortunately, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any images of the mission itself, but it was simple enough: a crew of Jeb, Bill and Bob, with a lander, sent out to land on Duna and Ike, and return. They returned pretty much on day one of Year 5, having successfully completed their mission. What I do have is a picture of the Multi-Purpose Exploration Vehicle (MPEV) lander they used being assembled in the VAB:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aJJk0zB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aJJk0zB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was sandwiched in between a heatshield that could detach and reattach, and the transfer ship, which was basically a Mk1-2 capsule and two hitchhikers bolted onto a tonne of liquid fuel and a single Nerva. It was my first interplanetary mission, and while simple, it taught me a lot, particularly about using more than one Nerva. 25-30 minute burn times are just not fun. The mission left my bank account with some \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,500,000 through contract completions, so I could begin to really kick-start some big ideas I had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s where we are in terms of overall context. Whilst the orangesuits were away though, Year 4 saw a lot of action that can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really be glossed over so easily. The following ramblings are mostly for context for future posts, and don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really reflect chronological activities within the game during that time, but I thought I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d share my main objectives for that year, and then provide a little context on them, as well as summing up all of my existing assets. This post will look at those, and provide a short summary of the different ships I use in my game to date. The next post will look at those ships, provide a list of mods currently being used, and lay out the current objectives for that game year. Hopefully by this point, work will have calmed down enough that I can get back to playing AND reporting as I go! With, of course, less babble and more photos!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gf3reCf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gf3reCf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEstablishing the Core Teams\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is a core team? To me, a core team is a pilot, an engineer, and a scientist. It probably is to most people; one of each skill to cover all your bases. One of my objectives whilst the orangesuits were off at Duna breaking records, was to make sure that by the end of Year 4 (2019 in my game) I would have two \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153core teams\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, with every member at least at two stars. This means they would be able to perform basic repair, piloting and scientific tasks, and in my game, is the qualifier for teams to deploy on \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Other-world\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 missions out into the wider Kerbol system. I knew that the orangesuits would hit this target as a team by visiting Duna; in fact, they were all already at level two when they left! So, a number of training flights to the Mun and Minmus were conducted, using established hardware (talked more about in the next post), to bring a second core team up to scratch. This went on throughout the year, and was pretty ad-hoc. In future, the plan is for a more regimented training program to be conducted with new members, and using permanent infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Research and Refuelling Station (ORRS) Demonstration\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to maintain a permanent other-world presence, it was decided that the first important step would be developing an orbital station capable of providing the necessary support and administration to our explorers. It was envisioned that these stations will become the first foothold in a network of assets that link the worlds of the Kerbol system. With that guiding principal established, the following requirements were put in place:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe station must be modular. This will allow for the future redesign of existing stations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach station must be able to support an enhanced crew of 4, for as long as is necessary between transfer windows.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach station must be capable of processing resources, and hold a store of those resources appropriate to each system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach station must possess a laboratory, to enable it to act as the orbital research centre for a given system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter much fettling and tweaking, a series of 5 modules was designed that could be assembled to create a simple but expandable orbital \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153hub\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. The first module forms the core of the station, and is always launched first (subsequent modules can be launched in pretty much any order I choose, though it is generally a good idea to launch the solar armatures shortly after, so that control isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t lost over the core). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LQaNW26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LQaNW26.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core consists of a laboratory, and a monopropellant store, with two structural hubs. It holds a large amount of electric charge, and also provides the reaction wheels. The idea is that the structural hub sandwiched between the lab and mono-store will be expanded upon with habitable modules and visiting crewed ships, whilst the hub attached to the mono-store will hold fuel tanks, an ISRU unit, and provide docking space for mining vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second module is a series of solar armatures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OaXDkoN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OaXDkoN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot massively exciting, but these hard-dock to the mono-store ports and provide a basic power supply to the station, enough to run the laboratory and sub-systems. They don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to be able to power the ISRU, as any mining vessel will require power for the drills, and when docked to the station this power can be applied to the ISRU. Simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule three is a pair of habitable areas, designed to give some much needed breathing space (literally) to those staying on board:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CDWF5rI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CDWF5rI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing worth noting about their design is that once installed, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re a tad difficult to get rid of. They only have one docking port, and stack-separated once in place. This is to save on part count, as it means two less docking adaptors on the station. Besides, if a particular station ever needs upgrading, it will provide more of a challenge to replace them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule four is a single fuel tank. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it. Nothing more to see here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kCIISL1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kCIISL1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s launched fully loaded, and provides on-orbit storage of LOX products. A pair of these will typically be installed, providing enough storage for most vehicles. Not very exciting, but it does the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fifth and final module is the ISRU unit. It is separate to the core for reasons of modularity \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 There may be cases in future where I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want ISRU capability, but do want a permanent orbital station. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty much just an ISRU part, docked and strutted on-orbit using KAS. You\u0027ll note with all of the additional modules, A \u0027Service Tug\u0027 is attached to move them and dock them once they achieve orbit. It\u0027s a pretty simple device, that is disposed of once its job is done. It could stay on orbit if needed, but at the moment there\u0027s no need, so they\u0027re de-orbited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QgWqBX2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QgWqBX2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any pictures at present of the orbital launches or assembly process, as I did this several weeks ago when I wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t recording my games here, and to be honest; it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just docking and strutting. Instead, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an example of a fully assembled ORRS in orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XA9Yqr4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XA9Yqr4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the second ORRS I\u0027ve built. The fuel tank with the engine attached is actually the upper stage from the core module launch - i realised during the demo construction that I can just leave it attached, top up the fuel as I add the other modules, and use it to move the station to where it\u0027s needed before dumping it. This second ORRS is destined for Duna, but more on that later!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe SPIRITUS Program\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPIRITUS is my third-generation launch family, which was designed around a relatively simple set of tenants:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. All stages must be recoverable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Each size (2.5m, 3.75m etc.) must have a common core, and can be expanded upon with a variety of boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The first stage must have 2100dV, and the second stage must have 1400dV.

Up until this point, it hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t caused any problems, and my latest rocket family (the SPIRITUS that we talked about in the first post) is about 95% debris free (the occasional fairing finds its way into orbit, but this tends to be on manned launches where health and safety insist they remain attached for the protection of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153vital crew systems\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Boring.) However, I was playing tonight, and when launching a payload element for interplanetary flight, a number of pieces of debris came to within 250m of my rocket. Had they impacted, I would have been toast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has happened to me before, in fact. A space station, many saves ago, was functioned just fine until the part where it spontaneously exploded. Back then, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d never even heard of Kessler Syndrome, let alone considered it to be the root cause (this was back when the kraken was pretty much the default choice for all your woes). However, a number of astonishing reverts made it quite clear: a booster segment had collided with the station and eviscerated it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned, my current launches are not adding to this problem in any great volume, but I have over 200 tracked pieces of debris (not all pictured), and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s only a matter of time before the inevitable.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to work outwards from Kerbin, and talk a little about each asset currently deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O7SBVaR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022O7SBVaR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently two things in orbit around Kerbin (not counting debris \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 then it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more like 200). The first is my second Orbital Research and Refuelling Station (ORRS), \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Lazarus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. I featured a screen of this in the first chapter half, and nothing has changed, but here is a different angle on things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kre5u6q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kre5u6q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan here is to send this out to Duna towards the end of the year, as part of the VOYAGER III mission (more on that later). It will hopefully insert into Ike orbit, and act as a hub for operations there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second vehicle is my first Interplanetary Transport Propulsion System (ITPS), \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Nicodamus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.

Next, we come to the Mun. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like the Mun. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s thirsty on dV, which is a problem that limits mining and surface operations. Couple that with having Minmus so close by, and (beyond initial scientific yield) it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s difficult to justify trips there. Still, I have to train astronauts somehow, and the occasional contract means I visit every so often:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aEWjTQ9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aEWjTQ9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three things in orbit around the Mun. The first is a Multi-Purpose Exploration Vehicle (MPEV) lander from a recent training mission. This was left fully fuelled, ready for the next visitor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cQF99lP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cQF99lP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is actually a second MPEV orbiting at an inclination (you can see it in the picture of Munar orbits). I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bothered to photograph this because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s practically the same, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m disposing of it shortly. The third object is worth mentioning, and is an Orbital Survey System (OSS) that is used to identify surface deposits of valuable resource from orbit, working in conjunction with the Surface Mining Vessels (SMVs) to access this ore:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3sOXb6k.png\u0022 alt=\u00223sOXb6k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe picture quality isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t great, but you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not missing out on huge amounts. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s essentially two monopropellant tanks with a service engine at one end, and a dish at the other. Thrilling, but practical and cheap. There is another of there in orbit around Minmus, which you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get to see later; I promise. Try not to be too excited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re moving on to Minmus. This is by far the busiest place, and that makes sense, as it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s my departure point for large missions, a refuelling hub, AND a crew training centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1SnVMAb.png\u0022 alt=\u00221SnVMAb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main asset in orbit is my other ORRS, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Lucina\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. This model has deployed, so does not have the core launch stage still attached. It also has an MPEV, which you can JUST about see hiding at one of the central docking ports (read: more screenshots is good, but quality needs working on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ahYq9QI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ahYq9QI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the bottom, you can see my Interim Crew Transfer Vehicle (I-CTV) which delivered the first working crew of one pilot and two scientists. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s called the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Interim\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 CTV as it took over from my first iteration, which used my old J-30 rocket and had shorter fuel tanks, but it will be replaced (when the program can afford it) with a shorter-range, higher-capacity vessel. This new version will launch up to 7 people into LKO, where a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 will move them out to Minmus prior to further departure. Consider that a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153stretch-goal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 for Year 5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn slightly higher orbits, the two ship icons are the Voyager Class Vessels (VCV) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Melampus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Magdala\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. These are second-generation long-range crew transporters, which are fully reusable and capable of taking a four-man team pretty much anywhere they need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yVh0vcF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yVh0vcF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir construction is two-part, with the cabin made up of a cupola (the cockpit), airlock and docking node, and sleeping quarters. The engine is essentially an IPTS unit, with added life support. They are the pride of the fleet, and pending their trials on the VOYAGER missions, it is anticipated that more will be produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the surface, we have the appropriately named Surface Mining Vessel (SMV) which collects and delivers the ore for the ISRU on board the ORRS. It has an ore capacity of 4800, and at the time of writing has been tested and approved for use on Minmus and Ike. It takes about 14 days to fill up, and a day to convert all the ore into product. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heavy and slow, but works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mQdcyHe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mQdcyHe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on the surface is the second Minmus MPEV. Nothing different to add here, except why it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s on the surface; to reduce part count. I have a pretty beefy computer, but when you have the SMV, ORRS, a VCV, I-CTV and two MPEVs occupying the same space, frames do tend to start dropping. So it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s chilling out, waiting for a future mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aE3ZGY2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aE3ZGY2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, as promised, the second OSS!

Stop disappointing me! I blame bad lighting for the poor photo, but we all know it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a lack of skill. At any rate, the poor, lonely OSS holds this entire operation together, providing data on the best spots for that juicy, juicy ore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnwards and outwards, then. My first (poorly documented) (actually, undocumented) visit to Duna left in place some goodies for the VOYAGER III mission to discover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tINXpmF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tINXpmF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, just one goody then. Still, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a useful one. An MPEV lander, and the deep-space version at that! So what is different about the deep-space version? Well, the main two changes are a larger battery capacity (for overnight stays on the surface), and parachute modules to make the most of atmospheric decent. The dV budget is largely unchanged, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about 20% more expensive, so the accountancy department insisted it only be employed beyond the Kerbin SOI. Fair enough; they control the budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vOOdgJ5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vOOdgJ5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat tank attached to it is an old Fuel Transfer Vehicle (FTV) that supported the VOYAGER I mission. The FTV was replaced at the beginning of Year 5, with the advent of more powerful lanuchers, by the ERV (below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESharp eyed readers will notice that the Emergency Resupply Vehicle (ERV) was not mentioned anywhere here, but was on the list. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s only just come into service:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MAZsidF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MAZsidF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel capacity is much, much larger than the original FTV, and it has multiple nodes for docking. The idea is that this can be used in a dual-role, acting as a hub in Munar orbit for crew training. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to invest half a million roots in setting up a Munar ORRS, when I can use a disposable ERV to do the same job, and much quicker. Other than that, it will be used pretty infrequently; it is for emergencies, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYear 5 Objectives\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew. So that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s where we are. As I mentioned in the previous post, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re currently (pretty much) at the beginning of Year 5, which is the year 2020 in my fictional universe. For this year, I have set the following objectives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CrDcUiU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CrDcUiU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe costs are rewards are quite fluid, and based on contract returns. The only finance I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t currently have in place is for the Munar Training Facility, which I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m hoping to get in the form of flag-planting and science returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of the year, I plan to expand the two core teams into two \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153enhanced\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 teams. This means adding a scientist to each team, bringing the total number of members in each team to 4. This means that an enhanced team can operate a laboratory on missions, which itself means not only a greater science yield for the expense, but the periods where they are travelling between planets can be filled with useful work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second objective has in fact already been achieved. Basically, I wanted to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153prove\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 the technology I was going to send on the second and third interplanetary missions, and Minmus was to be my playground for this. The demonstration ORRS was put into orbit there, as well as an SMV. These have worked well, have required very little in the way of modification \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 my SMV has had an engine upgrade, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be discussed later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjectives three and four are the big ones for this year. The VOYAGER missions are the flagship project for the space agency, and it is this banner under which all exploratory missions come. VOYAGER II will be my first foray to Eve, and will be an expanded, modernised version of the VOYAGER I mission to Duna. An enhanced crew will travel in a VCV, and an ITPS will carry an OSS to scan Gilly for fuel, and an MPEV to land on Gilly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VOYAGER III mission will revisit Duna, carrying more equipment and aiming to establish a basic foothold in the system. Again, an enhanced crew will use a VCV to make their way to Duna, followed closely by an ITPS with an identical payload to that on the VOYAGER II mission. My second ORRS will be built and deployed into low Ike orbit, and an SMV will be placed on Ike\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface. This will mean refuelling can take place in the Duna system, and the presence of two MPEVs (the new one, plus one from the original VOYAGER mission) will allow for a wider exploration to take place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I plan to establish a Munar Training Centre. This objective fell out of the need to train enhanced crews cost effectively, and in time for the VOYAGER missions. In order to satisfy the short time frame between now and the launch window, and at an effective price-tag, I will not be building a third ORRS this year for the Mun. Instead, I will use an ERV in low orbit to provide a source of fuel for the local MPEV, thus reducing cost significantly. When this ERV is drained, another will be launched as and when required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just like that, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re ready to rock and roll. I said in the last post that we are on day one of Year 5; that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not quite accurate, as my TAC alarm clock screenshot shows below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mHFED99.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mHFED99.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re on day 20, but in those 20 days I pretty much refuelled the two VCVs you saw in orbit around Minmus, in preparation for their missions. So unless you want me to talk about how much fun it is piloting 80 tonnes of ore up, and down, and up, and down, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll gloss over that. Hopefully, I will find a couple of nights this week to start making progress. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably be another interlude between now and then, as I have a few ideas bumbling around that I think I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d enjoy talking about.

There are so many options available, and the most common is undoubtedly the chemical rocket. In one of my previous posts, I talked a little about my current family of launchers, known as the SPIRITUS family. But how exactly do I go about developing these? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UcW3wwh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UcW3wwh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine my process is not dissimilar to most, but I am quite rigid in the steps taken, simply for the sake of uniformity. My launchers are practically identical to look at, and it is the way I designed them that causes such likeness. I started with a set of three core tenants, which I have already discussed. From this, I set out a specification to follow when designing, which also acted as a checklist for the finished product. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TABLE=class: grid, width: 500, align: center]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Design Aspect[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Considerations During Design[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]dV Requirement[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]2100dV (Atmospheric) 1st Stage; 1400dV (Vacuum) 2nd Stage.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]TWR Ratio[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]1.2 on the 1st Stage; 0.9 on the 2nd Stage.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Parachutes[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Both stages; enough to lower return velocity to 3m/s.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Struts[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Cross-braced across opposite cores.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Fuel Lines[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Running in all directions within the stage.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Retro-Motors[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]Applied (in correct direction!) to the upper stage.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TABLE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dV requirements are split over the two-stage design. The first, atmospheric stage should have roughly 2100dV (atmospheric). The second stage needs roughly 1400dv (vacuum). This is enough to make orbit at 85x85kmx0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, with a little margin for error. Fuel Lines are added from the external boosters to the core, and from the core to the externals, allowing fuel to flow in all directions. This means that the boosters do not \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153shed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 through flight, but rather detach with the core as a whole. This is less efficient, but requires less parachutes and therefore less moving parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) is finely tuned to provide a large enough \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153bang\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, without damaging the payload. I normally aim for about 1.2 on the first stage and 0.9 on the second, though this is subject to a variance of \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B10.1. I know it would be more efficient to aim higher on the first stage, but I like how a lower TWR helps me suppress the trajectory early, and achieve a lower orbit \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 something useful when playing RSS, for example, where the engines can only be started once, and with limited/ no throttling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach stage has to have parachutes, provided by the Realchute mod, that are tuned to carry the dry stage back to Kerbin for a soft landing. This sometimes means draining the upper stage before deorbiting. The upper-stage deorbiting is provided by a number of solid retro motors, which are tested to ensure they can lower the periapsis of the upper stage sufficiently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower-stage cores are then strutted in a linear fashion, at the top and bottom, to ensure they act as a single unit. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not so sure how necessary this is, as I use Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, but old habits die hard, and for the cost of two struts, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worth it just for effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always start by designing the largest launcher I will use for a given diameter. This will inevitably be a three-core, all-liquid rocket. It is shaped to meet both the specifications in the table, and to match up visually with its sister designs, all the while being monitored for its maximum payload. Single-core variants are literally that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the booster are deleted, TWR and payload is tweaked, and the rocket is tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153simulation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 feature in Kerbal Construction time is then used to validate the basic design. I will fly two or three flights, with a mixture of payload sizes and masses, to check how controllable the launcher is in different scenarios. When I am happy, it will join the flight line, and start operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already discussed that I have certain qualifiers for manned flight and nuclear payloads. These are completely self-imposed, and are there just to add an element of purpose to tracking and recording flight stats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/st42X9u.png\u0022 alt=\u0022st42X9u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where will the family go in the future? Well, the table in Chapter Zero shows where we are right now, with two 2.5m and one 3.75m launcher(s). Future development will head down two distinct paths:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Variations on the external cores within each diameter class, which allows for greater variation in the payload limits. For example, a 2236 might have its two liquid boosters replaced with solids, which reduces the maximum payload but reduces initial cost as well, and is specifically designed for smaller payloads rather than simply being able to accommodate them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Increasing the diameter further, through the SpaceY mod (amongst others). 5m, and even 7.5m launchers are being considered, although there is no immediate requirement. This launcher size would be able to loft some of the designs that currently require five, six or more launches (plus assembly and docking). There may be a small cost saving, but the biggest saving will be time, in not having to assemble my missions as much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a while off. For now, the focus is on slowly verifying the existing designs for higher-level tasks, and on achieving tasks at all!
