Eventually, this was agreed, and three ships were initially sent from Kerbin. The first ship carried the surface base itself. The second was a stack consisting of part of an orbital station, a hybrid rover/aircraft for ground exploration and a small lander for a side-mission to Gilly. The third ship was made up of the other section of the space station and a return vehicle for the crew members not landing on Eve. A fourth ship was sent later, carrying a fuel station plus an improved ion-powered plane and a more substantial rover (more on that to come later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe join the action in orbit of Eve, where the three ships have rendezvoused and docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HOpNbCq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HOpNbCq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll three payloads were brought here by a standardised nuclear tug. Tug01 and the base module can be seen at the far right. Tug02 and the station/lander/roverplane stack were docked to it using the medium docking ports on the rear of the tugs, with the science packages sandwiched between for now. The base will shortly make the descent to the surface, but for the time being the crew return/station ship and Tug03 have been docked as one piece to a side docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Our intrepid explorers (Base commander Admund, chief engineer Gilbrett and scientists Gus and Obski) are all veterans of the space program, having logged many hours during the exploration of the Mun and Minmus. Lenke is still aboard the space station and will pilot the rover/plane hybrid down later. Hadson, Dangee and Malsy won\u0027t be landing on Eve, instead doing a side-mission to Gilly before returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After a short while, the landing site came into position under the Station\u0027s orbit. The eager colonists manned the base module and detached. One of the remaining crew was able to take this shot while on EVA, allowing us to get a good view of the base as it prepares to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xh0HQsW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xh0HQsW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmund: \u0027Separation confirmed. All systems showing go for atmospheric entry. I\u0027m retracting solar arrays now.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lenke: \u0027Roger, Base 1. Eve station confirms go for descent. See you guys on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The base has accomodation for 12 Kerbals in the crew quarters above the three fuel tanks. The central section has the important science lab, and a lander can which will control the descent and later act as the operations center. The three refuelling arms will connect to the plane to fill its tanks. They also allow data transfer between the plane and station, so the onboard experiments can be analysed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The entry flames were quite substantial in the thick atmosphere of Eve- good thing the base is made of high-durability alloys that can withstand the heat. Here we see the base descending to the target area between the hills. The lakes in the distance will hopefully be the subject of one of the first exploration missions, once Lenke has landed the Roverplane at the base.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j9hA6CX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022j9hA6CX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus: \u0027Hey, Brett, what do you make of those lakes to the East?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gilbrett: \u0027Initial data suggested a lot of hydrocarbons. Who knows, there may even be some propellium in them thar waters. It would certainly be useful if we ever decide we want to leave.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Obski: \u0027Maybe we find fish. Then we can have first barbecue on Eve.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Admund: \u0027Honestly, comrade, do you ever stop thinking about food?\u0027 Okay stand by for parachute deployment.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Given the previously unknown ground conditions on the surface of Eve, Dr. Von Kerman\u0027s engineers on Kerbin had opted for too many parachutes rather than too few. Three drogue chutes were deployed first, followed by multiple chutes attached to the four sections of the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vm4P0nV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vm4P0nV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmund: \u0027Fifty meters.

We got some guys up here about to turn blue, we\u0027re breathing again, congratulations.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Admund: I\u0027ll save a bunk for you, Len. Get yourself down here and bring that plane with you. We\u0027ve got chutes to untangle and a base to set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lenke: Did I mention I\u0027m allergic to hard work? I\u0027ll stick around up here until you\u0027ve got things sorted out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELenke boarded the Roverplane and detached from the station/lander stack, taking with it the docking adapter connected to the retro pack. The four radially-mounted engines are used to perform the deorbit burn, bringing the craft onto its final entry trajectory. The retro pack is then jettisoned and the plane lined up. I like the sunrise in green you get at Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GqXAZJA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GqXAZJA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking flames were even more impressive here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i1pUSu2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i1pUSu2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027d miscalculated the trajectory somewhat, so Lenke found himself falling short of the target area, seen in the distance near the lakes. No matter, this is as much a rover as it is an aircraft, and Lenke would get some good driving experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lenke: \u0027Plane 1 to base. I\u0027m coming up about 40km short of the landing zone. There\u0027s a reasonably flat area close by, I\u0027ll make a landing there to conserve fuel.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Admund: \u0027Roger Plane 1, road trip approved.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pzv23HF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Pzv23HF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lenke managed to bring the plane safely down to the purple surface of Eve. Retracting the nose gear to bring the two rover wheels onto the ground, he then set out to cover the remaining distance over ground to meet up with the guys in the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/znYRB4a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022znYRB4a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, the crew of Eve Station had some rearranging to do. With the plane gone, Hadson detached the Gilly lander from the station and unpacked it from the docking adaptors. Skilful RCS bursts sent the adapters clear and out of the way. The lander was docked to a side port opposite the return module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UQ4Nag0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UQ4Nag0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Next, Tug03 was undocked from its payload to allow the station to be built. The lab/crew quarters section has no control of its own, so the crew return module was used to maneuver it into position on the large docking port of the station core. Finally, the return module was brought back to the other side docking port, and Tug03 redocked to it. This will form the main ship for the trip to Gilly. When the time comes, the Gilly lander will be docked to the nose of the crew return ship, and the science packages (currently sandwiched between Tug01 and Tug02) will be taken along as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nXFI4G6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nXFI4G6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8YgmkOH.png\u0022 alt=\u00228YgmkOH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilbrett: \u0027Well hello, mister hotshot pilot.

I see you\u0027ve got things going here, what\u0027s for dinner?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gus: \u0027Not so fast, there\u0027s no valet parking here. Get that plane secured and fuelled. Then we\u0027ll eat.\u0027 Obski says he can make something good with the ration packs until we can get the hydroponics operational.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PdXEo5V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PdXEo5V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELenke turned the plane around and connected to the refuelling arm, then climbed aboard the base to claim a bunk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9fMqo27.png\u0022 alt=\u00229fMqo27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth ship destined for Eve carried a large, 4-man rover, an ion-powered scout plane/rover, and a fuel station carrying both rocket fuel and xenon gas. Aboard the ship are Lusen and Chadoly Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The rover and plane were deorbited together, and share parachutes. This resulted in an odd spiral descent due to the plane\u0027s wings imparting torque to the combination. The two vehicles fell into the mountainous area east of the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f77PV6U.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f77PV6U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just as the parachutes opened fully, Chadoly- aboard the plane- separated the two craft. The plane dropped quickly away and Chadoly established a controlled glide, flying large circles to stay close to the rover, now descending upright under the parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9vl6hnu.png\u0022 alt=\u00229vl6hnu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lusen: \u0027Rover to Plane 2.

I\u0027m visual with the rover, everything looks good from here.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chadoly landed the plane on a gentle hill and watched as Lusen\u0027s rover drifted steadily to the surface. Lusen dumped the support structure carrying the parachutes and then drove over to meet up with his fellow colonist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BROepbj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BROepbj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Meanwhile, the gas station was on its way down to Eve. The landing point was approximately 10km west of the base area, so it will be a short drive to refuel. Both planes have electric rover wheels so this shouldn\u0027t be an issue. We\u0027ll wait until the Kerbals inspect the gas station before we take a look at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BTRV3IY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BTRV3IY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lusen and Chadoly ended up some 60km away from the base, so set out to explore the hills on the way over. Lusen, aboard the rover, decided to drive around the main peak with its steep slopes, whereas Chadoly opted to fly mostly over it to test the plane\u0027s performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/heCTU8N.png\u0022 alt=\u0022heCTU8N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The large purple sea in the distance looks interesting, but exploring anything other than the shores will need a boat of some sort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FcZB6OZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FcZB6OZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chadoly: \u0027Plane 2 to Base.

On flat ground, he could manage a steady 20m/s (no doubt helped by the aerodynamic cockpits used for seating). The low-slung rover was stable at 30 on descending slopes, but started to get twitchy and risked overturning much above that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U3X9G1Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022U3X9G1Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One very steep slope needed much braking to maintain control. Fortunately the brakes on all eight wheels could still bring the rover to a controlled stop even on this slope. Climbing hills wasn\u0027t a problem- one advantage of conditions on Eve is that traction is helped by the higher gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j6amA84.png\u0022 alt=\u0022j6amA84.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With the first crew of seven all safely at the base, they posed outside for a photo.

Lenke Kerman was assigned to take the rocket plane with its experiments to the nearest one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The twin aerospikes are really a bit overpowered for use here. One would have been better, but caused issues in launching the plane from Kerbin. The best technique seems to be to make an initial climb, then use the plane mainly as a glider, with short engine bursts to maintain altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lenke quickly concluded that the most fuel-efficient way to travel was to not use any, and glided down to the surface for a landing. With Eve station on the far side of the planet, contact with the base was lost once he dropped below the hills. There isn\u0027t much weight on the nose wheels, so down elevator/torque was used to improve traction.

Lifting off into the air, he landed safely and stopped to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/woAiZWu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022woAiZWu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yNPa2mg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yNPa2mg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Soon enough Lenke found himself back with the others. Admund insisted on attacking him with a compressor to blow any remaining lake \u0027water\u0027 off before letting him inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GKd82OE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GKd82OE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore sunset, Lusen Kerman decided to survey the gas station outpost to the west of the base. The Ion plane needed refuelling, so it would be a good test of the route and hardware. The Ion plane is much lighter than the liquid-fuelled one, so is much more responsive as a rover. The 10.6km were easily covered by a combination of both driving and short gliding hops from the tops of hills. The plane is very stable in aircraft mode, flying at between 15 and 20 m/s. This makes transitioning between modes simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OebKRFC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OebKRFC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The hills to the north look like an interesting target for exploration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G1BdONv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G1BdONv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lusen: Plane 2 to Base. I\u0027ve reached the gas station area. The lander seems to be in good condition, only one leg to repair. One of the refuelling arms appears to have broken off somewhere though. The other two look good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gilbrett: Roger that, Lusen. See if the fuel pumps work. Did you remember the procedure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lusen: If not, I blame the teacher. Attempting fuelling now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ErYpSdD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ErYpSdD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After several attempts, the plane was connected to the gas station by its wing (the nose and tail are both at the wrong height, whereas the dihedral angle of the wings make them adaptable) and fully refuelled. The sun was quickly dropping behind the hill, but Lusen took a few minutes to check out the debris pile a few meters away. \u003Cem\u003EWhen using a claw for refuelling, you have to switch to the gas station (or whatever part has the claw) just before the two ships connect. Otherwise, the planet disappears and bad things happen.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SDBp3E0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SDBp3E0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Parts of the booster had apparently survived lithobraking. A probe core, fuel tank and a few sections of girder had landed close together. Too bad they\u0027re too large to haul back to base for reuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/02dHow0.png\u0022 alt=\u002202dHow0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lusen then set off home. A large part of the journey was covered by air, followed by a relatively slow climb over the top of the hill. Another fifteen minute journey and the base came into view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mNVaTRr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mNVaTRr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While parking up, Lusen noticed one of the tyres on the other plane had mysteriously sustained a puncture, so fixed that before heading in for the night. The base flag has also apparently blown away somewhere and will need to be replaced. Another day though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ikUL7bG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ikUL7bG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus ends the first day on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2aVgUcK.png\u0022 alt=\u00222aVgUcK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7CZw29u.png\u0022 alt=\u00227CZw29u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
