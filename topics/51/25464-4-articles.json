Update woes. Tsumani 0.20 hits.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose it\u0027s foolish to try to do a long term project in an Alpha game that could change file formats radically at the drop of a hat, but such is life. When KSP updated to version 0.20, I continued to use version 0.19 because I needed certain mods, such as the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod for keeping track of all the ships I have coming and going between Kerbin and Laythe. And it never hurts to wait a bit so some initial bugs can get squashed. So I didn\u0027t try to update until after version 0.20.2 came out and some of my needed mods had been updated. I read that the file formats were supposed to be \u0022backward compatible\u0022 so I had hope for a good result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I naively copied over my persistance file and fired up the new version... and a huge number of my spacecraft vanished in puffs of smoke. Ah. Let\u0027s check the KSP forums... Ah. It seems that when the parts from a mod are not available, the ships just get removed. Ah. And it seems that Squad changed the folder structure for where parts go, so I didn\u0027t even have the ones I installed if they were in the wrong place. Ah. And some of the older parts could work, but you have to edit the their part.cfg files and insert \u0022Part {\u0022 at the beginning and \u0022}\u0022 at the end. OK... I can handle this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after multiple attempts, I got most of my ships to survive loading. Huzzah! The ISA Mapsat mod wasn\u0027t available, so a couple mapping satellites vanished, but I can live without those. The Damned Robotics door hinges haven\u0027t been updated, so a few Folding Fido rovers vanished from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, Minmus, and Laythe...and the one on Laythe was the only one that concerned me...so I built a hingeless version of the rover and snuck it onto Laythe with persistence file editing...hopefully the boys won\u0027t notice the difference, since they have a newer rover to use, anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my big problem was the Dishy JEB 9000 units that I have been sticking on ships that I\u0027ve spread all over the Kerbol system. These are nice little parts that my friend George first told me about for adding MechJeb to your ship without having to attach a honking big ugly part. And they look like a HAL 9000 interface...so cool. And if I want to post a craft file, I don\u0027t have to worry about it having a non-standard capsule part to mess other people up...I just pull off the JEB 9000 part. Dishy released a Bill 9000 part that interfaces to MechJeb 2.0, but that didn\u0027t help me having all those JEB 9000 units everywhere. I found that I could install BOTH MechJeb 1.9.8 and MechJeb 2.0.8 (in different places) and Bill 9000s and JEB 9000s would both work...but I was leary of having both versions of MechJeb installed because I thought they might argue. In the end, I took the cfg file from the Bill 9000 folder, placed it in the JEB 9000 folder, and then edited all the \u0022Bill\u0022 references inside it to \u0022Jeb\u0022 or \u0022JEB\u0022 references (careful to capitalize properly in all places as needed)......and the JEB 9000 units now seem to link to MechJeb 2 just fine. I think...since I haven\u0027t tested it much yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last problem was that changes in the terrain on Laythe resulted in one of the rovers (with Kurt and Nelemy inside) appearing UNDERGROUND...and exploding when I tried to do anything about it. To fix this, I just moved the rover to a safe location in version 0.19 before updating to 0.20. Now I probably have lots of my old landers and landing site marker probes on various planets that will show up underground and explode...I haven\u0027t checked them all yet. But the Laythe Mission hardware is up and running!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s join the crew on Laythe as see how the update went for them. It\u0027s after lunchtime at Laythe Base and Kurt is in the bottom Laboratory level analyzing some soils samples, Thompbles and Aldner are in the middle control cabin level checking on the satellite data readouts, and Nelemy is up in the top sleeping quarters level reading a magazine. Then the Base begins to shake rhythmically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hey, Nelelmy! Knock it off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude...It\u0027s not me...I\u0027m not doing anything!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Base begins to shake violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Quake!

Everybody head for the SSTO!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys pile out of the Base and run for the rovers as dust settles. Thompbles and Aldner use the old Folding Fido (which they don\u0027t notice appears to have had all its hinges damaged in the quake, so they no longer function. But no loss).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NatHjOa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NatHjOa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey climb aboard the SSTO and Kurt starts flipping switches as Aldner reads off the emergency launch checklist to him. Thompbles calls up the data links to the Ocean Probes and starts analyzing wave height data. Nelemy stays in the open hatch and scans the waters of Fido Bay for any activity.

I think he\u0027s right...but it a very small decline. Anything from the probes?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022There\u0027s possibly a very long wavelength signal, but it\u0027s not large. Centimeters, maybe. It\u0027s down in the noise. But it\u0027s showing up in the data from both Ocean Probe 1 and DogFish, heading this way.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dudes! Wave coming!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hmm. Not too big...maybe one or two meters. What\u0027s the elevation here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022We are at 18 meters elevation, a little over half a kilometer from the shore.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Kurt, spool up the jet engines. Minimum power.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Roger. Spooling up jets. LV-T45 ignition circuits are hot.\u0022 (the roar of the wave is joined by the rising whine of the jet engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022The wave has reached shore...coming in.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude, the old Fido Pup probe just got swamped!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Aldner? How does it look?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hold. Hold. The wave is slowing... It\u0027s not even going to make it halfway here. Retreating now, Skipper.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK. Kurt, cut the jets. But stay ready.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022The wave has washed away that narrow peninsula at the mouth of the inlet. It\u0027s completely gone!

But nothing else came. Below we see the Fido Pup rover probe, which had been sitting happily along the shore of Fido Bay for 15 years, floating in the inlet after Tsunami 0.20 passed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/unlNDwR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022unlNDwR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day the crew checks over all the equipment at Laythe Base. The first thing Aldner did was check out the BirdDog, and then he tried docking it to each of the two GasStations to see if he could get good dockings after they had shifted position during the quake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yo, Commandant Thombles, sir! Good news.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What is it Aldner? BirdDog and GasStations check out fine?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Indeed they do, Oh Prophetic One. One of the docking booms that I was able to use on GasStation 2 no longer fits, but the other two now work.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Sounds good, Aldner.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022I also checked the cargo container on GasStation 2. The remaining cargo in there all shifted in the quake. It\u0027s a bit of a mess, but I don\u0027t see anything damaged. And I found the flag that was buried in back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022That is good news. At least after all this mess we can finally have our flag planting ceremony.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Aye, aye, Cap\u0027n.

That peninsula that Kurt named Macydean Point is completely gone. And there are now two small offshore islands instead of one...and a tiny island between them.

So I decided to send a another base module and a slightly-more-compact Fido rover. These will be landed on some other island on Laythe in the future where they can be useful, although I haven\u0027t decided where yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to send that payload off to Jool, I first needed to refurbish one of the Nuclear Tugs that had previously returned from the Laythe. Originally, the payload for refueling the Tugs was going to be the one shown below (and it still will be for the more recent-version Tugs). The two standard X200-32 fuel tanks, plus RCS fuel, etc., just about maxes out the lifting capacity of my Reusable Rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cY9K2oy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cY9K2oy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I like the extra command pod torque that the new version of the Tugs have because of all the probe bodies they have, so I decided to upgrade the older Tugs by adding extra probe bodies. The Refurbisher payload to do this is shown below being launched on a Reusable Rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pIc5f2X.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pIc5f2X.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Reusable Rocket barely had enough fuel to put the Refurbisher payload into a 115 km orbit, so I had to give the R.R.\u0027s sustainer stage a little extra fuel from the Refurbisher\u0027s tanks, and then the sustainer went back for a parachute landing at KSC (the R.R. sustainer needs about 100 units of fuel to deorbit and target the KSC for a parachute landing). The Refurbisher was left in orbit (see below). The front part of the Refurbisher (regular docking port, 18 OKTO2 probe cores, an X200-8 tank, and a Senior docking port) will become permanent parts of Laythe Tug 5. The X200-16 and X200-8 tanks behind it will be dropped when empty (in interplanetary space). The rest of the Refurbisher has fuel to refill the Tug\u0027s main tank and RCS tanks, and then it will return to KSC to be reused for refurbishing Laythe Tugs 1, 3, and 4 eventually. There are two 24-77 engines for orbital maneuvering so the Refurbisher can rendezvous and dock with Tug 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aXOmrLb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aXOmrLb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s where I ran into a problem: The Refurbisher had four small solar panels and small battery packs for power, and that would have been fine in the original design... but with the addition of 18 more probe bodies to the payload, it no longer had sufficient power to keep 19 probe bodies alive through the dark part of its orbit... and the maneuvers I needed to do for rendezvous with Tug 5 always happened deep into the dark part of the orbit, so I was making long burns with the 24-77 engines that were barely finishing before the batteries died during that nighttime pass. Too bad there\u0027s no way to selectively turn off some of the probe bodies on a ship. But, in the end, I made rendezvous, docked the Refurbisher to Tug 5, refueled most of the main tank and all of the RCS, then separated the rear section of the Refurbisher (below). I was not worried that the main tank was not quite full (the side pod tanks were also nearly empty) because there will be plenty of extra fuel sent up with the base/rover payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pANlCNL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pANlCNL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have MechJeb 2 installed, and I don\u0027t know where anything is. But I found enough of what I needed to target the Refueler back to KSC for a parachute landing. Oddly, MechJeb 2\u0027s landing guidance readouts no longer seem to give me the distance off from the target point in the north/south and east/est directions...only an overall estimated distance from the landing target point, with no direction specified. Maybe I have some settings wrong. There was no fuel/oxidizer left on the Refurbisher, so I did the reentry using RCS only, watching the MJ readouts to target the landing point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HGzZLWS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HGzZLWS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the new base/rover payload boosting on a Reusable Rocket just after the recoverable boosters have separated and just before the gravity turn starts at 18.5 km. The slightly more compact Fido rover is just a little shorter that the previous Fido KE design so that it makes a bit more compact payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/erQ7q3q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022erQ7q3q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI docked the Tug to the base/rover payload, then fully fueled the Tug from the Refueler Top (the base/rover payload is easy for the Reusable Rocket to lift, so it can carry the extra Refueler Top as well...and the Reusable Rocket\u0027s sustainer had plenty of fuel left (452 units) for a rocket-powered landing at KSC (and even had 208 units of fuel leftover after landing). Note that there are also two ComSats snugged in under the front and rear of the Fido, above the heat shield. These will be added to the two ComSats already in Laythe orbit to give more-continuous coverage (which will be important as I spread more kerbals around Laythe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IjjsXLn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IjjsXLn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPop goes the refueler top, and the ship is now ready for transfer to Jool (but must wait in orbit a while for the transfer window). When I did an \u0022engineering simulation test\u0022 of the base/rover payload over the KSC (to be sure that everything was sequenced properly), I noticed that if you use the probe body on the Reusable Rocket during launch (since it\u0027s oriented properly, this is wise...having one of the horizontally-facing rover command pods in control makes it difficult to fly the rocket), then when you separate the payload from the rocket in space, various engines and parachutes on the payload will be activated. This clears up the mystery of why the drogue chutes on the original Laythe Base got activated early (which caused them to pop open as soon as possible over Laythe)... so Kurt Kerman was NOT a squirmy chute-popper after all. The solution is to make sure that I have switched control to one of the probe bodies on the base/rover payload before separating the sustainer stage. Also you may notice that I now have the Crew Manifest mod installed... this is because KSP version 0.20 insists on populating a command pod when I damn well do not want a kerbal in it... and I can easily remove the kerbal with that mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IwpxQU1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IwpxQU1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile in Laythe orbit, Nuclear Tugs L6, L7, and L8 were being prepared for return to Kerbin. The Tugs left their rear tanks and most of their fuel with Laythe Space Station, but they have some additional fuel in their main tanks as well as the full side pod tanks so that they will hopefully return to Kerbin with a bit more fuel for orbital maneuvers there (and also because these tugs are a little heavier than the previous tugs because of their extra probe bodies). Below, the three tugs pop off of Laythe Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XJn1Ulg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XJn1Ulg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tugs were sent away from Laythe and off into Jool orbit to await the transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CnZ6Hv7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CnZ6Hv7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the previous batch of Tugs I sent away from Laythe, a couple of them had problems with Laythe trying to grab them back after they had escaped its SOI (since they were in larger, slower orbits about Jool, so Laythe could sneak up on them), which required some extra burns. So this time I sent the tugs out on escape trajectories that gave them Jool apoapses of 32,000 km (closer to Vall than Laythe, but still away from Vall\u0027s SOI). It took about 580 m/s of delta-V to leave Laythe on these trajectories, then another 160 m/s later to raise the periapses of the parking orbits awayf from Laythe\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hk09Y9k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Hk09Y9k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the Tugs waited in the parking orbits for the Kerbin transfer window to open. But here I also ran into problems. Kerbal alarm clock was telling me one thing with regard to when the transfer window occurred, and Protractor was telling me another thing. And when I tried to plot trajectories to Kerbin, I was not getting any encounters showing up (because the orbital inclinations were aligned at their most extreme at the moment, so the tugs would be missing Kerbin\u0027s SOI until the plane shift maneuvers were accounted for later). But my main distraction was that Laythe Tug 9 was coming in toward the Jool system carrying BirdDog2 and GasStation3, and I needed to pay attention to that (since incoming payloads are more important than Tugs that can wait in parking orbits). Oh...AND, back at Kerbin, it was time to boost Tug 5 with the new base/rover payload off to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RVi7sLF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RVi7sLF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Laythe Tug 5 and its payload burn for Jool. As usual, this burn was done in two parts. I was worried that the refurbished tug might be excessively wobbly because (unlike freshly launched tugs) its rear tank is not strutted in place. It did wobble somewhat at the standard docking port back there, so I couldn\u0027t use phys-warp, but it behaved fine at normal time speed. I used a Senior docking port to connect the rear drop tanks to the added section of the Tug to reduce wobbling (future tanks for these tugs will now need Senior docking ports on them), and I didn\u0027t notice that connection wobbling at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nu8bhnq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nu8bhnq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, we see Tug L5 and its payload leaving Kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn off in the distance, after having dropped the empty rear tanks (I ended their flights to avoid clutter). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QrxVfrW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QrxVfrW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer trajectory for Laythe Tug 5 was such that it would not reach its descending node (where the plane shift to match Jool\u0027s orbital inclination will need to be done) until shortly before it gets to Jool. This is actually a good thing because the plane shift will require less delta-V when it is done far from Kerbol. But I ran into another problem: the Kerbal Alark Clock was telling me that the descending node would be reached AFTER the Jool encounter, but KSP\u0027s marker for the descending node was clearly BEFORE the ship enters Jool\u0027s SOI (if only by a day). I don\u0027t know why. But I padded out the Alarm Clock alarm with some extra days so that it will remind me before I get to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FPnCPRi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FPnCPRi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Alarm Clock display in the previous image shows that the incoming Laythe Tug 9 is 8 days out from Jool\u0027s SOI, so it was time to fine tune its incoming trajectory. In the diagram below you can see why I love the Improved Maneuver Node mod\u0027s ability to easily changed to Conics Mode 0 so that I can see the incoming trajectory with respect to Jool (once I focus on Jool), but can still tweak the maneuver node out by Tug L9 (or by tweaking the numbers in the Maneuver Node mod\u0027s window). And if the maneuver node collapses shut (which it always does at the worst times), I can press the \u0022o\u0022 key to pop it back open. Here the incoming trajectory is being set for an inclination of zero and a periapsis of 114 km for aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Sk5VPVh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sk5VPVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND.... back to the Tugs in Jool orbit. OK... rather than mess with all of them (since I wasn\u0027t confident of getting a good Kerbin encounter), I decided to send off only Tug L6 and leave the other two Tugs sit in Jool orbit to be sent off during a later transfer window. I had incoming toys for the boys... I didn\u0027t want to mess with lots of tugs. So, below: The trajectory plot... and Laythe Tug 6 burning for Kerbin. Again, when I got the Tug out there on its way home and tried to set up an alarm for its ascending node, Kerbal Alarm Clock was giving me an incorrect date (this time wildly inaccurate)...so I manually plopped a node down at that ascending node point, and then added THAT node to Kerbal Alarm Clock\u0027s list of nag-me reminders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eAOCH18.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eAOCH18.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MRsTRrS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MRsTRrS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here comes Tug L9 with BirdDog2.

Below is the trajectory plot. Because I\u0027m using conics mode 0, you can see at a glance (look at Laythe) that the encounter is going to be in a counterclockwise direction around Laythe, just as desired. The ship is targeted in at 26 km above Laythe for an aerocapture there. Well.... That was easy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kn2KySc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kn2KySc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerocapture at Laythe had almost no flames (boring), and a further aerobraking pass and engine burn placed the ship into an equatorial 90 km orbit.

Aldner flew BirdDog1 down from orbit after the crew arrived at Laythe, but Nelemy would be remotely controlling the entry and landing of the new jet. First, the BirdDog2 is separated from the GasStation3/Tug L9 combo. This looks hairy as the plane goes tumbling away, but it\u0027s safely clear of the rest of the ship... and it wouldn\u0027t be anywhere near as hairy if the SAS had been turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qyShGfi.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022qyShGfi.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the retro burn. The ship is controlled from the OKTO2 probe core located on the end of the fuel tank stack of the retro pack for this burn (since it\u0027s oriented properly for this). Then the retro pack is separated and the plane is put pointy end first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KIJVxLl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KIJVxLl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntry flames! The thermal protection of the BirdDog2 only needs to protect the plane during the Jool aerocapture and the entry over Laythe. The rover wheels always look so vulnerable to me, hanging out in the slipstream, so there are heat shield plates positioned to protect the tires during entry, and then the heat shields get jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ENVBtuO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ENVBtuO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane comes in high, so Nelemy has to turn it around and fire up the jet engine a little to bring it back toward to base. Below we see the BirdDog2 coming around in a hard bank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Easy... Eeeeasy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022I got. I got it.

Down safe!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022You know, it\u0027s less bumpy if you come in from east or west parallel to those little ridges.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Hey, you know what they say: any landing you can remotely drive your plane away from is fine!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022But seriously, Nelemy, you need to watch your pitch with this plane. If you are going fast enough in thick air, you can quickly recover from those pitch-ups, especially if the avionics package is helping. But if you are in thin air at high altitude, it\u0027s a lot harder. During a test flight back over Kerbin at 20k, I flipped and ended up in an uncontrolled spin that I didn\u0027t get out of until I reached 500 meters. And if you get a violent pitch-up a low airspeed during a landing, you won\u0027t have time to recover, and you\u0027ll spread your pretty plane all over the landscape. Be especially careful when coming in for upslope landings here on Laythe... those require a lot of pitching up, so you need to come in hotter than you would for a normal landing in order to have the necessary speed. Corfrey and I smashed up a bunch of BirdDog prototypes in the hills near the KSC testing these beasties.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Aldner, can you write up a set of checklists and notes for Nelemy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Sure thing, Cappy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Checklists? Jebediah don\u0027t use no checklists.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Don\u0027t forget notes about how the ship handles in rover mode.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude, I have loads of experience driving rovers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Sure, but the BirdDog handles differently than the Fido. Especially when its heavy with fuel. Those innocent looking V-notch valleys that the Fido will shoot through with ease can smash the BirdDog. Corfrey hit one of those doing 40 and there was nothing left of his plane but the cockpit. And don\u0027t drive along straddling the top of a sharp ridge line... the wide set of the landing gear can allow the jet engine to bottom out. I left a turbojet sitting on top of a ridge during our testing, and that would be a lot more embarassing here on Laythe with no ride home... although the shorter jet engine we have on the BirdDog now should make this less likely to happen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022OK, Dude, I\u0027ll be careful.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Oh...and you know that feeling you get when you\u0027ve been driving along so long that you start to zone out, and seems like time is slipping by at 2, 3, or even 4 times normal speed?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Yeah! It\u0027s so awesome! My brain feels like it\u0027s fizzing and it\u0027s like time is warping. Almost the feeling you get when you go into a hibernation trance.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Right. Well, none of that fizz-warping while driving rough terrain. You must stay alert. Otherwise the BirdDog will just slide out from under you down a slope, and you can smash the thing up before you realize it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022OK. I\u0027ll remember. And that\u0027s for caring, Aldner.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Sure thing, little buddy.

Rather than bring it down to Laythe Base, mission planners wanted to position it as a forward base to allow BirdDogs to explore far afield from the Laythe Base area. Specifically, the geologists were very interested in studying the huge impact feature that dominates the trailing hemisphere of Laythe (the giant ring of islands in the hemisphere 180 degrees around from Dansen Island). GasStation3 will be landed on island \u002B6-68 (Mission planners aren\u0027t real imaginative about names), which is part of a big crater on the rim of the gigantic crater. Below, GasStation3 separates from Tug L9. Tug L9 will eventually be docked to the Laythe Space Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xWdSFZc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xWdSFZc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Retro burn of the six 24-77 engines, and GasStation3 drops in toward island \u002B6-68.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G9sOVGB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G9sOVGB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntry flames (finally...you wait a long time on Laythe for entry affects to appear) as the ship nears the eastern part of the island.

If not, Aldner could be stuck far from home without enough fuel to fly back. Calculations indicated that he SHOULD be able to fly there and back on one fuel load, if no mistakes were made in flying and navigating the plane, but this wasn\u0027t certain. However, there is the SSTUBBY single-kerbal SSTO rocket in orbit attached to the Laythe Space Station that could be used to rescue Aldner if he does get stuck with insufficient fuel.

I used 129 units of fuel out of 300, so I can make it back to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDansen, at least from this point. I\u0027m pumping fuel to the forward tank now to adjust the CoM, but I think I\u0027ll drive the rest of the way if the terrain is good. Also, I would like to name this fine island after Manley Kerman, the famous astrophycist.

He picked up some speed and caught some \u0027air\u0027 as he went over small ridges. Nothing he couldn\u0027t handle. But then he made one of the classic blunders, which was to allow the guy directing the movie to try lining up a shot to get a good picture from the side of the BirdDog going over some ridges... just when he came up to a really big drop off going about 40 m/s. And the BirdDog was airborne and flying free. Now this might have been disastrous for a regular rover... but BirdDog is, of course, an airplane, and Aldner is a pilot with sufficiently fast reactions, and he pulled up slowly after the nose suddenly dropped when the rover went over the ridge... and glided it down just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vEtRtox.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vEtRtox.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Well, not enTIREly fine, since the airplane isn\u0027t designed to land at fast speeds on its rover wheels, so he did blow a tire.

He decided it would be safe to tackle the highest mountain on the island. They didn\u0027t have precise elevation data, but it appeared that the highest mountain peak was off to the northeast. Below, he had gotten above the \u0022sand dune\u0022 level and into the \u0022weathered cratered terrain\u0022. Off in the distance we can see Lake Nelemy and Kurt Lake.

And he could stop for supper without having to listen to Nelemy\u0027s weird ideas about whether intelligent aliens might exist, and whether or not kerbals could ever reach other stars with faster than light drives, or whether it would be possible for really low density worlds to exist, or whether or not there might be a multi-deity mode where the universe could be run by several controlling beings at once (\u0022Look, Nelemey, that\u0027s just crazy talk...don\u0027t ever let the Astronaut Squad hear you talking about it\u0022), or...well, it just went on and on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA primary area of interest that Kurt was to explore was the triangular lowland region jutting off the east coast of Dansen Island.

It was a nice wide-bottom bowl, certainly well protected from tsunamis. A good place for an inland base. The ridges surrounding the valley also kept out the wind, which probably explained why the location was so quiet. Another dull location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gvHccIG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gvHccIG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at Laythe Base, Thompbles was finally satisfied with Nelemy\u0027s training on the simulators and with his preparations and planning, so he approved Nelemey taking the BirdDog2 out for a short shakedown mission. Happy as a clam, Nelemy got up at the crack of dawn and readied the BirdDog2 for takeoff. This time he remembered to head west for takeoff, parallel to the low ridge lines.

The rest of the island looked to be more of the same, and Aldner could see something more interesting off to the left: The smaller, round island in the center of the Manley Crater formation, which must have been caused by the crust rebounding after the impact that created the crater. The geologists wanted samples from there, and it looked like more of a challenge to the bored Aldner.

I\u0027ll call in the name.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner started his drive, intending to reach the peak of the island...but it soon got to be very steep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OaRE5dV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OaRE5dV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TxJ3Qkl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TxJ3Qkl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Damn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s up, Aldner. Problem?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Well, I\u0027ve been navigating some pretty steep terrain, slowly winding my way around and up the island, when the batteries of the BirdDog started to go dead. It\u0027s that big-ass green thing hanging in the sky...it\u0027s blocked off the sunlight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Are you safe in place?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Sure. I\u0027m even at what passes for a moderately level patch for the hillsides of this island. I guess this is Big Green Thing\u0027s way of telling me it\u0027s time for lunch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe eclipse of Kerbol by Jool lasted for about an hour, giving Aldner plenty of time to eat, collect some more samples, and have a quick nap before Kerbol reappeared and started recharging the BirdDog\u0027s batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y2dRRd6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y2dRRd6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EyTmtKX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EyTmtKX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner continued winding his way up the island mountain, only considering a few times if this was too dangerous and maybe he should point the nose a little downhill and fire of the jet engine and take off. But he stuck with it, eventually having to go more than 360 degrees around the island to get to the peak. Or the two peaks, actually, separated by a lower saddle. He planted his plag on the taller peak at 1,975 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Calling Thompbles. Come in.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s up, Aldner?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022I\u0027m at the peak of the island. Those geologists better appreciate the work I went through to get these samples. There are two peaks here. I like to name one \u0027ItsOne Peak\u0027 and the other \u0027ItsTwo Peak\u0027. Except please note that these are to be written in the Ephebian Numeral fashion, with run together numbering.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022So...those would be spelled \u0027I-t-s-i\u0027 and \u0027I-t-s-i-i\u0027 correct?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yes, sir. Isti and Itsii. Itsi Peak has an elevation of 1,975 meters\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK, Aldner, I\u0027ll call it in and explain the numbering. I\u0027m sure nobody will notice.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022As long as one person notices, it will be mission accomplished.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s next, Aldner? Camp? Or fly on?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022I\u0027ll fly over to the next island.

This island had no high mountains, and it had at least two likely looking harbor areas. Prime real estate. Aldner headed for the bay area on the east coast of the island and landed with no difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X9EZit8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X9EZit8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9vPvEfi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229vPvEfi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yo, Thompbles.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Hi, Aldner. Telemetry signal is strong. Shows you stationary at low altitude with no recent high acceleration spikes. I assume you are calling to report a successful landing?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022It\u0027s like you can read minds, sir. Nice site. Beautiful bay. I\u0027d like to name this fine island Hellou Island if you would be so kind as to register that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Named after Hellou Kerman, the scientist who taught the astronaut squad all about geology, I presume?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yes, sir. She\u0027s a very famous scientist. She even gave me private lessons when I was having difficulties with the igneous rock stuff. And I\u0027d like to named this Feldspar Bay. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll remember why.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK, Aldner. Hellou Island. Feldspar Bay. Did you know that she applied to be an astronaut?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022No, really? When was this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Just last week. There are some people lobbying for the inclusion of female astronauts. They are hoping that the Astronaut Squad will change their minds and allow it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022That would be great. She\u0027d be a hell of a lot more use here than I am. All these rock formations are starting to look the same to me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Hellou Island, with Feldspar Bay on the lower right side. There is a small ridge that separates the bay from an inland lake in a bowl. The flats by the bay could be an excellent landing base area, and other facilities could be set up in the bowl with the ridge to protect the site from any small tsunamis that would swamp the landing area. Aldner next drove north to check out the two little lakes there...he waded in and found them to be deeper than a kerbal. Then he drove on to the northwest to the other bay area on the west coast of the island. Note that the island has no really high elevations, but the terrain is somewhat rugged in places with those dangerous little V-bottom-valleys that you don\u0027t want to go barreling into too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VXfap3z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VXfap3z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Captain Thompbles. Pick up the phone, please.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022I\u0027m here, Aldner\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022I\u0027m at the bay on the western shore. Broader. Protected by some sand bar islands. Some moderately flat areas. Excellent investment opportunities. Would you like me to send you a prospectus?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022I assume you\u0027re calling to name it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Aye, aye, Skip. Please register it as Labradorite Bay.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Labradorite? Can\u0027t say I remember it. Some mineral from your private lessons?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Oh, aye. I have fond memories of those geology lessons. Anorthosite bodies with interesting cleavage. Intrusive formation. And the ultramafic cumulates!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK, Aldner. Whatever. The name is noted. Laythe Base out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ojeYSaR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ojeYSaR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all that thinking about geology, Aldner thought he might like a nice swim in the cold waters of Laythe\u0027s oceans. So he decided to swim out to the big sand bar island. The distance to the island was about 180 meters, and Aldner swam it in 3 minutes flat, so that\u0027s a speed of 1 m/s. That was swimming with the Shift key held down, so I assume it\u0027s faster than regular swimming speed (without the Shift key held down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Syz9x7x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Syz9x7x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q1pSdUO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022q1pSdUO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner swam back and boarded the BirdDog to rove around the rest of the island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ARaF13G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ARaF13G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Looking south toward Labradorite Bay.

Should Aldner keep going north to the fiddly bits of islands just north of Manley Crater, or should he save fuel for some major pushes around the rim islands of Big-Ass Crater (or whatever we\u0027ll decide to call it). The islands to the south look inviting...but the arc of islands to the north offer the opportunity to get long distances on less fuel with roving. And what of Nelemy in BirdDog2? Should I send him off to the three moderate sized islands to the northeast? Or off to the big islands to the northwest. Aldner could certainly pick up a couple southern islands (like that cool dragon-shaped island) on his way back to Dansen Island eventually. So many decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut enough for now. Remember... Fly safe! Thanks for watching. Later, guys. And if you liked the video, please do like the video.
