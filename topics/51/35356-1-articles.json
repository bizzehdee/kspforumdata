I watched Scott Manley\u0027s video on deorbiting a moon in KSP. It said how many solid boosters would be needed to deorbit a moon, if it was possible. After a bit of using Google\u0027s calculator function, I discovered it would take 1.7e\u002B24 thrust to do it. So, I punched that number into a custom .cfg edited engine. Well, it seems that doing so makes the craft float. It breaks physics and starts spazzing out, as if it was stuck inside something, even though it was in mid-air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T4X4fZl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022T4X4fZl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone wants to try replicate it, you should have infinite fuel, unbreakable joints and no crash damage turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwoHedWlf","CreatedById":7163,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T06:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is you had so much thrust that rather than moving the ship you moved the universe instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entaran","CreatedById":67823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T08:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice impulse figure you have there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T10:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TwoHedWlf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TwoHedWlf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is you had so much thrust that rather than moving the ship you moved the universe instead.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo he created the Planet Express ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
