Took about 20 hours of testing the construction.\n\n![LOWHsMl.png](http://i.imgur.com/LOWHsMl.png)\n\nGently inserting Orbit and dettaching Main Tank. OMS propulsion with onboard stored LFO, enough to fool around alot in Kerbin Orbit.\n\n![tLBP9Ez.png](http://i.imgur.com/tLBP9Ez.png)\n\nIntercepting the Nuclear waste, Valentina is Commander of the \u0022Kerminger\u0022 Space Shuttle Salvage Mission. Preparing the CLAW to grab the Spacejunk and deorbit this dangerous Piece away from harming other Kerbonauts.\n\n![k8lb2D3.png](http://i.imgur.com/k8lb2D3.png)\n\nPerfect RCS Handling, a expert Copilot does the Job while Valentina is preparing for a short EVA to investigate the source of this Pollution, to send an invoice to the former owner of the LV-N atomic rocket crap...\n\n![FXlBKph.png](http://i.imgur.com/FXlBKph.png)\n\nValentina successfully investigated the factory plate on the LV-N, also happy of successfully cleaning up LKO.\n\n![MUR6Agx.png](http://i.imgur.com/MUR6Agx.png)\n\nOvershooting descent, but no problem for the \u0022Kerminger\u0022 Shuttle, it falls down like a concrete Flower crate, but very stable and nicely. Blasting off a bit LFO in Atmosphere to make a nice turn to the opposite side of KSP runway, approaching without a single problem.\n\n![KrahSow.png](http://i.imgur.com/KrahSow.png)\n\nGently landing the Shuttle at Runway 27, Bobby is a four Star Pilot, peanuts for him. Mission completed after 1 hour and 19 minutes.

Its the biggest fun in my lifetime in PC gaming... Its gorgeous. SQUAD you are the BEST. Really ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif).\n\nIf someone likes to have the craftfile...\n\nHere you are:[https://www.dropbox.com/s/uh8jffevk6uuttz/Space%20Shuttle%20KERMINGER.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uh8jffevk6uuttz/Space%20Shuttle%20KERMINGER.craft?dl=0)\n\nTake a close look at anything, then you see its not so difficult to make a NASA style Shuttle carrier.\n\nI had to tweak anything, also thrust limiters and offsetting the wings, RCS,... \n\nWhen you start, engage SAS, set throttle to 2/3, then slightly throttle up until staging the Boosters, then make a nice gravity turn to your liking, engage RCS, throttle down while depleting the main tank, stage it off, switch to OMS manouvermotors (Actiongroup 2, 1 shuts down the main thrusters ), open shuttle tanks, finish Orbitinsertion, now you have alot of dV left to do what you wanna do. It starts eastwards, no rollmanouver needed like the original... when descending keep some liquids at the front and balance it if necessary, so that it makes a nice level flight. If falling can be considered \u0022level Flight\u0022 at all ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nNo really, this one is just great in handling. It has a dockingport on the the top up like the real ones had sometimes.\n\nTake a look at the actiongroups.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T16:39:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**\n  \nBackground fun text:)... and TYPOs, sure, added craftfile...:) killed the rep thing:)killed myself off title :)"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T13:13:00Z","Content":"Very impressive, Mikki.

Great looking shuttle. Those quad main engines must really shift.\n\nHi GehringGame\n\nfor now, i did not found a better solution, the mammoth is set down to about 73 % thrust in the VAB, i am investigating other solutions for the Shuttle, my current Goal is to make a NASA like looking Kerbal shuttle with Stockparts, only using the provided 1.0.2 assembly options of offset and rotating the Stockparts.\n\nI had an idea today at work, to skip the Mammoth 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to vertical engine alignment, or trying to make a smaller one with 3 Skippers... but that is maybe not possible... its all a thing of proportions. The new Stock big Shuttle wings are a bit too... small. but i really dont want to critizise SQUAD, we have to handle with that.\n\nHave a good time and thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T17:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**\n  \nuuuuuuh, TYPO, sure:)"}]}
