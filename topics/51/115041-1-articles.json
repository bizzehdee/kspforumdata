Planning can be a wonderful thing, if done properly. This mission started out rather simple, but rapidly spiraled into a mess.\n\nOrbiting to meet up with the Station was a pain in itself, but then I released an error in my planning. The craft only had RCS thrusters mounted on the front of the unnaturally long vessel!\n\nI learned 2 things about RCS that day:\n\n1. The more RCS thrusters you have attached, the easier maneuvering gets! [A little Captain Obvious, I know!]\n\n2. IF you go without enough RCS thrusters, then you are doomed to Space Krakens Wrath! Do not make an attempt to maneuver or your crew will surely perish!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It only appears to move when you move the camera because it\u0027s located inside the ship but is drawn on top of the ship\u0027s pixels, so as your angle of view of the ship changes, the parts move past the CoM.

I mean\u0027t more along the lines that you should have enough RCS thrusters attached to the vessel and don\u0027t, like I did, have them on one half of the ship and not the other.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E hmmm...am I the only who has discovered how to turn off unnecessary RCS thrusters?\n\nDon\u0027t worry, you\u0027re not the only one. When I was altering the angle of the annex, I turned off two of the closest thrusters to the docking port. There are a few images that don\u0027t seem to show my craft tilting, but that\u0027s due to the fact it was going really slowly.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E RCS placement should be aligned to the vessels centre of mass.\n\u003E Sadly, the COM indicator floats around when you pan your view in the VAB, so your RCS can never be placed perfectly. \u003C----- SQUAD PLEASE FIX: COM should be static and locked to the vessel not the camera viewpoint.\n\nThanks for the advice. I\u0027m not really that experienced with RCS placement (The above example for case and point!) but I usually judge by general coverage areas and distance between them. I didn\u0027t really know that they should be placed closer to Centre of Mass, but now I know.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Props for performing an impromptu daring EVA maintenance.

I really do love KIS/KAS as it really adds a lot more to EVA in the game (It\u0027s really useful for covering up mistakes made prior or during launch!). I\u0027d love for it to become an offical mod or for there to be an equivlent!"}]}
