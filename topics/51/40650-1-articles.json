Curiosity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s lazier, older, (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/1ivw39/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebalder?\u003C/a\u003E) fatter relative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been waiting for a few more updates before I do more than tinker around here and there in KSP. But seeing as how others have been launching Duna rovers to celebrate Curiosity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s landing I figured I would try something quick and dirty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built myself a rover and launcher from scratch using what I call Stock\u002B\u002B. The first \u002B is for Engineer, because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be damned if I have to sit around guessing how much delta-v a stage has (or calculate it myself, ha), or constantly play in map mode just to figure out my orbital parameters. The second \u002B is for all of the stock parts that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve duplicated, or in some cases triplicated, and tweaked. These include reaction wheels, antennae, rover bodies, and a few others. I altered their parameters accordingly, so none of them are what I would consider cheats, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re just variations on stock parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few hours building and testing my design the rocket is ready to go. And here it is on the launch pad with the rover, skycrane, and orbital relay perched on top. The rover itself is made up of about 100 parts, with another 150 or so parts for the skycrane and atmospheric entry system, then another 100 or so parts for the launch vehicle (and no struts on that, I\u0027m surprised it didn\u0027t fall apart). The auxiliary fuel tank on the launch clamp allows for main engine startup first, followed by SRB ignition and launch clamp separation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Launchpad.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Launchpad.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the tower is cleared the liquid boosters ignite. There is no asparagus staging or fuel cross-feed here, so the main engine cuts out fairly soon after liquid booster separation. The orbital insertion stage worked out nicely, with just enough delta-v to put the rocket in an 80km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Liftoff.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Liftoff.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Duna transfer window opens the rocket makes one long ejection burn. Only a very small correction burn is required to setup the final encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Dunatransfer.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dunatransfer.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a long trip the rocket nears Duna, as Ike orbits close by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/DunaArrival.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DunaArrival.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I had a dilemma. The rover is not designed to get into orbit around Duna before landing, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s on a direct descent path. But I need the orbital relay to get into orbit before the rover begins its landing. And I obviously can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do both at the same time. So I came up with this. A sepratron powered, spin stabilized, ejection system that boosts the relay ahead of the rover. I wish I had a recording of this, as it worked perfectly. A 5\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E twist of the sepratrons was enough to spin up the probe, followed by separation of the orbiter and deployment of the solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/RelayDeployment.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RelayDeployment.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd best of all, it worked to get the relay there ahead of the rover. Those four sepratrons gave it enough of a boost to get it to Duna with just over three hours to spare. Only a small correction was needed using the probes main engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Periapsis.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Periapsis.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a dip into Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere the probe settles into a stable 125km, equatorial orbit and deploys its antennae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/RelayOrbit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RelayOrbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to Indifference now, the transfer stage makes its final burn to setup the approach path, then separates and falls towards the planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface. And the rover prepares for descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/TransferDrop.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TransferDrop.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now the fun part begins. The heat shields protect the vulnerable wheels, while the ablative coating on the exposed sections burns off. After peak heating the parachutes are deployed. There is one regular drogue chute, and four of my custom made, 1/2 scale, Mini-Mk25 chutes, these have about 1/4 of the drag, but fully deploy a little earlier than the full size drogue chute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/AtmosphericEntry.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AtmosphericEntry.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the heat shields no longer needed, they begin their two-stage decoupling process. First, the two outer sets are pulled down and out using a single sepratron motor. Then the center shield fires directly down using a pair of sepratrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Heatsheild.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Heatsheild.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Mini-Mk25\u0027s deployed Indifference begins to lose most of its horizontal velocity over the surface. The main drogue is cut loose before it fully deploys (wouldn\u0027t want to make things too easy) as the first stage skycrane prepares for active flight mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/DrogueDeployment.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DrogueDeployment.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 250m above the surface the remaining drogue chutes are cut loose and the skycrane enters fully powered mode. With it\u0027s descent velocity slowed to nearly zero, the first stage skycrane separates. A probe core and reaction wheel keep the now departing skycrane stable and a small radial engine pushes it sideways. The second stage skycrane, known informally as Skycrane 8, The Ocho, then powers up to gently lower Indifference to the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Skycrane1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Skycrane1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ocho carries Indifference down the rest of the way. Once safely on the ground the reaction wheel stabilized skycrane decouples and lifts off, again, pushed to the side by an auxiliary motor. It appears, unfortunately, that one wheel was slightly damaged in the landing, but thankfully I packed a wheel repair kit, otherwise known as Notepad, with the rover. And for those wondering, I\u0027m not manually taking screenshots during the descent stage. FRAPS has a great function that automatically takes screenshots in intervals as small as one second. You can end up with a ton of pictures if you leave it on for too long (you can set a key to activate and deactivate it), but it works great for these high pressure moments when manually taking screenshots just isn\u0027t an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/Skycrane2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Skycrane2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll systems appear intact, and with the damaged wheel repaired, Indifference deploys its suite of antennae. On the front you can see two steerable, high-gain antennae. On one side is the backup, low-gain antenna. And on the back we have the large mast antenna, a 2X rescale called the Communotron 116. In the picture on the right Indifference tests out its retractable drill known as the Diggatron 16, a 1.5X rescale of the Cummunotron 16 with a toggle deployment option. If you look carefully you can also see my special made, Not-Rockomax Dead Weight modules installed next to each wheel. These bring the center of mass close to the bottom and prevent rollovers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/RoverLanded.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RoverLanded.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all systems checking out Indifference sets off to the southeast.

A few samples are taken from some interesting rocks along the way using the Diggatron. That may look like a strut on the lower section of the rotatable drill arm, but it\u0027s actually a sample sluice tube that carries material from the drill to the analysis cube, perched on top of the mini rover body section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Indifference/RoverDrill.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RoverDrill.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, well, well, what do we have here.

The whole thing is appropriately Kerbal. Because the launch clamps are only on one side the rocket leans toward the VAB before launch. And because of my multistage ignition process (the whole thing blows up if I try to ignite everything at once) the rocket just kind of slides sideways when I blow the launch clamps and ignite the SRB\u0027s. It only really starts to stabilize once the liquid boosters are ignited. Since there are no struts on the boosters they do that thing where they sort of bend out like they\u0027re about to break off, but they settle down pretty quickly. My custom made, Big Inline Reaction Wheel (with 40 torque I think) probably helped stabilize things, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because there is no fuel crossfeed the central engine is dropped off very soon after the liquid boosters, so I avoid having to deal with a really long, unstable rocket for very long.
