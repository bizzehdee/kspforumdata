Low orbit and even high orbit trips, gathering and collecting information for the scientists back at base. Well finally Jeb had gathered enough, and the scientists had produced a space ship that could make it to the mun! Of course after speaking with many lawyers and sticking \u0022not responsible for lost kerbals\u0022 stickers on the the rocket they sent Jeb to the Mun! Lucky for Jeb he was a skilled Kerbalnaught and managed to slingshot around the mun and back to Kerbin, where the scientists went a buzz over all the data he collected. So the scientists tried to launch and land a probe, which needless to say did not do anything when crashed into the ground. Finally a master piece was born, after several rocket tests/probe launches Mun Lander 2 was created! Jeb asked what happened to Mun Lander 1 and was told never to speak of it again... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyways enough goofing around here is what i had to do to get to and back from the Mun in career mode (with plenty of full to spare) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/ugLmY#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/ugLmY#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
