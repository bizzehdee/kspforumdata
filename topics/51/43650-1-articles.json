It\u0027s very inefficient fuel-wise when you are in space, and it weights a lot. Personally i would put Clamp-o-tron Sr. there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is exactly what I am trying to achieve. I want to be able to lift an orange tank into orbit with a Clamp-o-tron Sr. on each end so that I can build ships in orbit. But they keep failing at the docking ports during lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T11:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat to hear, i did make it to Duna this week to, but i dont have a lander so i cant land on it. it is now in orbit around around Duna.
