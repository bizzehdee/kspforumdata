The worst part is going to be the burn to lower apopasis, and then the corresponding burn to raise it again once you\u0027ve got him. Might be able to use Eve again on the way back too, which would have the added benefit of making aerobraking into Kerbin orbit a bit gentler than a direct return. Drop him off in Kerbin orbit and send up another ship to bring the pod down; no sense carrying parachutes and heat shields all the way down there and back. Other than that, I figure just pack as much delta-v as you can get around a probe core and a claw. Fortunately his ship is only 1.8 tons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS. This might be a good mission for ion engines, since the highest delta-v burns are so close to the sun you might get away with one Gigantor per two or three ions. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to get 10,000\u002B m/s of delta-v to work with that way, plus whatever you used for a Kerbin departure stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPPS. I just took a look at it in map view: getting to that orbit and back directly from LKO is going to take at least 9,000 m/s \u003Cem\u003Eeach way\u003C/em\u003E. You could save some of the Kerbin departure burn (~500 m/s) by leaving from Minmus, probably another 1000 or so each way with Eve encounters, and potentially most of the Kerbin arrival burn (another thousand at least) by aerobraking, but that\u0027s still on the order of 14-15 km/sec of delta-v you\u0027ll need to put into LKO. Even more taking into account the extra 1.8t payload on the return trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a nuclear departure stage, then go to some kind of asparagus ion setup? Probably no getting around having a ridiculously low TWR at some point here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPPPS. It\u0027s definitely possible with ions: stacking a bunch of xenon tanks, two Gigantors, the big probe core from Asteroid Day, a claw, and a single ion I was able to get about 24,000 m/s in one stage, down to 17,000 m/s once I added a cupola (which Obemy\u0027s ship almost certainly is), but of course the payload is only carried for half the trip. Mind you the TWR was about 0.04 so this might take some patience even with 4x physics warp. The whole think costs about $150,000 and weighs 5.7t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSticking a Kerbodyne tank drained of oxidizer under this with some LV-N\u0027s as a departure stage adds another 5-7 km/s of delta-v (depending on the radiator requirements and on how patient you are with low TWRs) and increases the cost to around $200,000--still a decent profit margin, even taking into account a launch vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how 1.0.5 heating will affect this, I\u0027ve never aerobraked or gone near the sun in 1.0.5 so that might be a problem. I also discovered that xenon is apparently set to drain evenly like monoprop, so getting a multi-stage ion setup will require careful management. Also, the stack xenon tanks are inexplicably not radially attachable (!!) so getting them to be jettisonable could be annoying. Still, I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-17T18:42:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2016 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Hotaru\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T19:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nISRU outpost on Moho?

KSC.\u00A0 Bubbly, intoxicating beverages were uncorked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe festivities were hastily curtailed, however, when Obemy said \u0022What!?\u00A0 Didn\u0027t you send any \u0027hydrazine\u0027 up in this thing?\u00A0 A bit unfair of you to be making me listen to you drink.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey ground controllers promptly refocused on the return trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, I was very pleased.\u00A0 Plenty of extra dV left over.\u00A0 My initial plan called for only the final stage to do the entire return trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I began to go through the journey in my mind some \u0027concerns\u0027 began to grow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, the reaction wheels were on the two remaining outer stacks.\u00A0 The inner now had only the probe core and the cupola module.\u00A0 I checked in the VAB and the cupola has plenty of torque, so I figured we\u0027d be okay in that regard.\u00A0 And, we\u0027d only have to finish the burn with the centre stack.\u00A0 We\u0027d start it with the reaction wheels attached.\u00A0 So, again, my concern was allayed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, the batteries were located on the outer stacks as well.\u00A0 The only batteries we would have available would be the probe core and the cupola.\u00A0 This would be fine until we were forced to decouple the final tank and the solar panels on reentry.\u00A0 We would need enough power over enough time to hold us retrograde until we were through the dangerous part of the aerobraking process.\u00A0 Well, we might have to be careful with setting up our reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, MechJeb began reporting very weird numbers for dV after the capture.\u00A0 I made sure to set the probe core as the \u0027Control from here\u0027 point, but the number was way off.\u00A0 I knew from my design phase what it should be without recalculating it.\u00A0 Then, I realized I still had KER installed.\u00A0 Checked its dV readout and was comforted to see the expected values.\u00A0 We were going to bring Obemy home!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I was ready to set up the burn for home.\u00A0 Extremely easy to set up the maneuver and get an encounter when starting from a solar orbit.\u00A0 I see why some people do their interplanetary trips that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the biggest single burn, but since there were only 9 Nervas left I was fairly confident in the cooling.\u00A0 The other advantage of starting from a solar orbit is that it doesn\u0027t matter if the burns take a long time.\u00A0 You\u0027re not on a rapidly changing trajectory like when you\u0027re at Kerbin periapsis so there\u0027s no need (other than heat) to split the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GRWwxn4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

maintainers of MechJeb.\u00A0 The burn was crazy long but MechJeb absolutely nailed the 300 km periapsis at Kerbin that the burn was supposed to result in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship returned with enough fuel to complete insertion into a 75 x 75 km orbit and still had about 300 m/s left in the tank.\u00A0 Deorbit and reentry were completely nominal, the electricity lasted through the shock heating, and a happy new recruit to our space program was returned safely to his home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LcC1QbM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

need a new ship in the Thundercraft series which is a spacecrane to complete that one.\u00A0 The other two Vall rescues, on the other hand, will be a perfect test of the Thundercraft 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I think we should talk about all the various craft in the Jool flotilla.\u00A0 The Jool Science Lander and the Jool Miner (yeah, I really need some cool names for these) were showed off quite well in the last post.\u00A0 One point to note is that the Miner is driven by one Poodle and the four Terriers.\u00A0 These are tied to action groups for ease of flying.\u00A0 The Miner is designed to be able to land on Vall, but is expected to mostly operate on Pol.\u00A0 Obemy (the Kerbal sun-tanning champion) is piloting the Miner.\u00A0 He is teamed up with Dabelle, the senior engineer on this mission and second in experience only to Bill, himself.\u00A0 Dabelle is a veteran of the Voyage of the Duna Miner (another thrilling tale) and is

there bother to actually calculate the delta-v of these Scansats and compare that to what they\u0027d need?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 End rant.\u00A0 Joan

Hopefully I didn\u0027t mess anything up with the save file editing.\u00A0 I\u0027ve never tried to alter a craft that way before.
