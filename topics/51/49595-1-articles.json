After staying in Jool system for awhile, the crews returned to Kerbin safely. Totally, four planetary flybys were performed to save fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from LKO (with 2200m/s of delta V left in Kerbal X), the delta V required to finish whole trip was around 1500m/s, which means there was around 700m/s left when the spacecraft back to Kerbin. The major burn of this mission was the burn to Eve, as it cost around 1200m/s of delta V. The rest of it were due to correction burns and human mistakes. A lot of delta V was saved because of several gravity assists used around Eve, Kerbin and Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrip summary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: launch Kerbal X into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: A close flyby around Eve to gain some momentum, and swing the spacecraft back to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Perform a close flyby around Kerbin to gain some momentum again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Perform a second flyby around Kerbin.
