It is told in story format.\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart I: Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Kerman was sitting in his capsule on the launchpad. He was waiting for what he dreaded, LAUNCHING. After that it was mostly okay, but this time he was on a flyby to the Mun. Last time he did a flyby around the Mun was to get some high altitude science reports, now he needs some low altitude ones. He sure wished there were more snacks packed, and when he started wondering if he had remembered to refill the gas on this thing, the engines fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines were powerful, and the asparagus rocket was efficient at what it did, but Bob was no where near those results when it came to launching.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022WHAT DO I DO? HOLY CRAP! GET ME OUT! AGHHHHHH!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Calm down, Bob, you\u0027re fine, but if you keep overreacting your vitals will quicken and you might just die,\u0022 the Cap-com skillfully explained, however futile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit was achieved rather perfectly, and then the burn for the Mun began, a free return was difficult to get as we wanted a low periapsis over the Mun. There wasn\u0027t a hitch. Yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart II: The Mun\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was for Bob to actually enter orbit around the Mun and get some low altitude science. He performed well, but screamed a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the lot for the return was staged, and a problem was noticed, Bob was in a retro-grade orbit, not good. So instead of burning retrograde relative to Kerbin, Bob had to burn prograde. He did so valiantly, but something was noticed during some of his EVAs......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart III: Eventful Returns\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bob was spacewalking, he noticed a peculiar lack of something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Umm, Mission Kontrol, I have a problem. Those engineers forgot the parachutes again!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob shivered at the thought of Muna 1b, where he had to use the engine to brake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve done this before, Bob. You can handle it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay.....\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry was initiated and Bob was coming in extremely fast. He had a couple hundred m/s to slow down, and only 6 km to do it, and just an LV-909........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich was more than enough. He landed without a hitch, but we lost the stage, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/23C06\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Due to the Muna program, many techs have been unlocked, and many Kerbals have made the ultimate sacrifice, not eating snacks, to reach this goal. Many other Kerbals got stranded on the Mun, even with asparagus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-17T03:19:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2013 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KASASpace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T01:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo pics? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T02:54:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo pics? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will edit them in once I figure out how to.
