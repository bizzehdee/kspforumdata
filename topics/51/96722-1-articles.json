I am undecided about allowable extensions, but I am strongly tempted to include NEAR or FAR, as stock aerodynamics are so very far from (our) reality (although FAR/NEAR/REAL aerodynamics fit neatly with a discussion of Kuckingham... still offering bonus points for the reference).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T12:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more things in Heaven and Kerbal, Koratio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlkBltChemie","CreatedById":135033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T14:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a pretty cool idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick trick you can use in PowerPoint that may make your life easier if you still want to go that route.
