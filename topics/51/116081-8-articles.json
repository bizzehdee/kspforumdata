But please do **resist posting predictions for where this is (obviously) going based on your knowledge of what I am parodying!** I think it\u0027ll be more fun if I get to do the big reveals in graphic form in my own time--which will be pretty fast, a lot of this is already plotted and drawn.\n\nWhat I mean by a prediction that I would rather NOT see posted is something of the form \u0022Aha! He\u0027s going to do [this scene] from [that movie] and [so-and-so] is going to say/do [that thing from this scene in that movie].\u0022 That\u0027ll be bad if I don\u0027t do it like you predict, and even worse if I do because you will steal the thunder! In-universe speculation based on what you see in the comic and know about KSP is perfectly fine. \n\nAnyway, this is just a request and I hope you\u0027ll agree that it will be more fun if I get to do the big reveals. I will not attempt any policing other than this note--but I will also not respond to any such predictions. Thank you. \n\nIf you MUST make a prediction, you can always write it on the back of a 500-fund banknote and send it to Mortimer, care of this station--or PM me, of course ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T21:29:07Z","Content":"Don\u0027t worry about predictions from me, I don\u0027t recognize the parody.
