I decided to try for a manned \u0022There and Back Again\u0022 Duna mission. It took a couple days messing around in the VAB, but I finally got a lander I was happy with. Unsurprisingly, it was startlingly similar to my Munar/Minmusar lander. Then I needed the Orbital Transfer section (read: large gas tank). I had \u0022back of napkin\u0022 calculated (read: pulled from the wiki) my needed Delta-V for the various burns:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch to LKO: 4500 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELKO to Duna: 1100 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Ike encounter?: 300 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna landing: 1000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch to LDO: 2000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna to Kerbin: 700 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal recovery burn: 500 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Delta-V for entire trip: 10100 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring construction, I gave myself plenty of buffer - a few hundred m/s in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was to launch the whole ship in one go. ...yeah, that didn\u0027t work. I\u0027d need to put 100t into LKO; something I\u0027m not skilled enough for. (Plus, I don\u0027t have those cool orange tanks yet.) So, I decided to launch it in two pieces and assemble it in orbit. Slightly saner option, despite my lack of docking experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander was pretty easy. It was only 24t, so a standard setup worked a treat. Got it into a fairly circular orbit ~79km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot68.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot68.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot69.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot69.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the orbital stage still attached.

Nearly twice the weight of the lander itself! So, my previous lifter wouldn\u0027t do the job. I rebuilt the lifter a dozen times before trying an option I hadn\u0027t tried yet - Asparagus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter much experimentation (just about 6 hours of playing last night), I finally got one that worked. An asparagus-staged main lifter. Two rings of six double-stacked X200 tanks, with 4x LV-T45s under each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot71.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot71.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot72.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot72.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot73.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot73.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up getting it into a nice circular orbit 2km below my lander, with a whole ~150 m/s left in the main tank. Pretty good, if you ask me. I jettisonned the remainder (deleting the orbital debris so it didn\u0027t cause... problems), and jumped over to the Lander. I realized I didn\u0027t need that extra gas (plus, it was in the way of my docking port), so I jettisoned it. I had added a probe body to it specifically to burn for re-entry, so there was no need to delete the debris. Then it was time to do the time warp again while the transfer module caught up to the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 orbits later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we\u0027re close. I decided to begin my approach ~7 km, to give plenty of time before the units passed each other. Approach, slow, approach, slow, approach, slow... (Thank you, Scott Manley.) Got the units close enough to turn on RCS, and began the final docking sequence. They were still 45\u002Bm apart, but some good RCS and patience closed that gap. Before long, I had them lined up and began approaching at ~0.3 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot74.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot74.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloser, closer...
