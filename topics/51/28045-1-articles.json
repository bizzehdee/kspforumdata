Some of my previous saves attempted to have a theme but they quickly fell apart. This one I determined to make and stick to. The name? Munbase. So far it is living up to this goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this save I actually laid out a goal and steps to accomplish it (instead of building rockets and flinging them willy-nilly across the solar system). My goal was to have a permanent manned base near the equator of Mun with exploration capabilities (rovers and science equipment), crew return and rotation capabilities (that are actually used), abort-to-orbit options, and a Mun-orbit station to support Mun-side activities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo pave the way I sent up Pathfinder III to mark the Munbase location and potentially serve as a surface-to-orbit shuttle (Pathfinders I and II didn\u0027t make it off the launch pad). Jeb and Bill made the flight and I plopped them down about 3* south of the equator on a relatively flat plain that isn\u0027t an apparent impact crater. No pictures of Pathfinder III by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step was my orbital base of operations. This would serve as my orbiting fuel depot and staging point for surface-to-orbit taxis, crew living quarters/waystation for Kerbin-Mun traffic, and local command and control center for Mun operations. Its name? M.O.S.S., or Mun Orbital Science Station. MOSS was inserted into a circular-ish equatorial orbit at about 55km. Commander of MOSS at the moment is none other than the legendary Bob Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WFCJIRW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WFCJIRW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOSS core inserting into Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5L1bGjM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225L1bGjM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOSS with Kerbin Return Vehicle (KRV) docked at service node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext the surface habitation unit was launched from Kerbin and landed some 35 km ESE of Pathfinder III. Instead of worrying too much I just moved Pathfinder III over. This used up enough fuel to probably strand Pathfinder III on the surface but it got Jeb and Bill to a permanent habitation unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F5mIjoO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F5mIjoO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar base \u003Cem\u003ELonely Outpost\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile in orbit MOSS gets a new addition: a Munar Shuttle, designed to transfer Kerbals to and from the surface.

I\u0027ll deal with that after Bill and Jeb have a way to get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few orbits later (and after checking on my crew at Lonely Outpost) I come back to MOSS to find \u003Cstrong\u003Echaos\u003C/strong\u003E!!! Something has made \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Prescott\u003C/em\u003E spawn inside MOSS, causing intense damage. Not all is lost, however. A save file edit puts things to rights and ends up with \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Prescott\u003C/em\u003E safe and on the regolith. The boys on the moon now have a way back home. Having taken care of that I decide to equip the crew with a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p8F6pj4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p8F6pj4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar rover \u003Cem\u003EVerde\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s disappointing ending 2.5km from the base. I am starting to wonder about the quality of the pilots KSP trains. So now I have the idiots in \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Sedona\u003C/em\u003E looping around the place and these two clowns upside-down when they are almost home. What to do first? Save the idiots or the clowns? I opted for neither and built part of an interplanetary mothership to ease my frustration and then launched a comsat. Having achieved a couple successes I was ready to get back to the crew at MOSS/Lonely Outpost. Most importantly: I had learned how to get a full orange tank into orbit with my mothership construction. I figured that I would need that fuel at MOSS to support my next two operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nWLeHOA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nWLeHOA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAOTtO (Auxiliary Orange Tank to Orbit) with some gas left. By the time we get to Mun the tank will be 4/5 full. I might be able to get some performance tweaks lower down to ensure a full tank to Munar orbit with my existing launcher though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ex1hU4l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ex1hU4l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t take any photos during the rescue of \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Sedona\u003C/em\u003E but you can see it here docked to MOSS, along with the AOTtO and the Munar Tug. I planned to transfer the two-man crew out of \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Sedona\u003C/em\u003E so that I could pick up the guys in the rover and still have extra space down below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rbzow9G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rbzow9G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis freaking idiot again. After gazing dumbfounded at the south pole AND getting stuck in a stupid orbit he decides to forget how to grab a ladder. I press F and he violently recoils from the station at an unnatural angle, right through one of MOSS\u0027s solar panels. I thought about abandoning him to the cruel void of space but I hadn\u0027t killed anyone yet so I didn\u0027t intend to start then. I reluctantly jetpacked him back to MOSS. Next KTV outbound is containing him though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo photos of the descent but \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Sedona\u003C/em\u003E with one aboard performed a precision landing only ~800m from my flipped rover. The two rover drivers walked over and are currently aboard. Tomorrow I\u0027ll hop \u003Cem\u003ESpirit of Sedona\u003C/em\u003E over to Lonely Outpost and we\u0027ll prepare for the next phase of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xWxiEv3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xWxiEv3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am inordinately pleased with myself for pulling off this landing.
