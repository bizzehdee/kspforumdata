I had (have still, actually) left gaming as a whole due to time, study and life constraints. The last time I played KSP was on version 1.1.3 last July, when I was part of\u00A0the Go For Launch team. And 1.1.3 is the last version of KSP I have installed. Before saying goodbye to all of this world, however, I started writing a small story on a Word document, mainly to improve my English. I then saved it, and never saw it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few months ago, I was browsing my computer for stuff to delete, when I came across this file named \u0027IPAAV\u0027. I opened it, and found a very (and I mean it) raw test of the first two chapters of the story I had begun to write the previous year. After\u00A0from the horror I underwent trying to read that... thing\u00A0(you can\u0027t possibly understand how bad was it), I decided it was time to rewrite it. So here I am now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will be a long term project. And a complicated one as well. Maybe even too ambitious. Time will tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main story (In Perpetuum Ave Atque Vale) will be posted here on the forums. The missions will be made with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the common suite of mods that follow it. IPAAV will be very character-centered, instead of mission-centered.\u00A0It will follow the story of Danilo Visco (biographies coming soon) as he tries to fulfill his dream of exploring space, and will take place in\u00A0the years between 1947 and 1965.\u00A0It will contain:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A Prelude, a recap of the history of the world until 1947;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A prologue and the main chapters;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A Debriefing, the final chapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found out, however, that Visco\u0027s story is too complicated to be explained in brief flashbacks. So there will definitely\u00A0be two spinoffs/prequels to the main story:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-IPAAV: The Snake -\u00A0the story of Visco from 1926, when he met his best friend, to 1933, when the then 18-years old protagonist had to escape from his country.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-IPAAV: The Legend of the Phoenix - the wartime experience of Visco from the Spanish Civil War in 1938, to the Italian Civil War in 1939 and the Second World War from 1940 to his last ill-fated mission in March 1945.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey will be written with a great degree of probability before the main story, so there may be delays. We\u0027ll see.\u00A0These two aren\u0027t in any way KSP related, and won\u0027t be posted here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, if all goes well and I find great ideas, there will be a sequel, IPAAV: The Next Generation, which will follow the main story and will take place from 1967 onwards, but as of now I\u0027d rather prefer the story to end in 1965.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpect lots of Metal Gear, Star Trek and more quotes, references and Easter eggs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess it\u0027s time to boldly go where no man has gone before, then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTRIVIA: the name for this story comes from a phrase of the Latin poet Catullus, specifically when he last salutes his deceased brother. The reason why I chose this phrase, which FYI means \u0027forever go, and show what you\u0027re worth\u0027, is very important, but I can\u0027t reveal it yet.
