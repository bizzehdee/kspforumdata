This series is by request by him. My decision to use his model over the rather fantastic looking shuttle model by Zekes, is mainly due to part count. I don\u0027t really want to try to use Zekes model as it may be a bit too much for my computer to handle alongside the filming software. On the other hand, inigama\u0027s space shuttle is a bit more manageable, by far.
