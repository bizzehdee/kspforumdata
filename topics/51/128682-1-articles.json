That\u0027s why I\u0027m making this thread. So that you guys can encourage me on my way around the planet. It\u0027s also going to be easier if I post a few screenshots at a time for a long time rather than what I did for my last giant mission, the Jool-5 And Then Some project. I\u0027ll try to make a bit of a story to go along with it, because stories are more fun than raw mission logs.

They had visited all the other planets in the system and planted flags. There were stations around\u00A0Duna, Minmus, and Tylo. Bases on the Mun, Ike, and Gilly. Probes had mapped almost all the bodies. Then, one day, a couple of\u00A0interns working in the R\u0026amp;D department were looking in the Science Archives for pictures of Kerbin\u0027s southern night sky. They looked on every shelf, asked everyone they could. No one knew if there were any such pictures. The interns, Jogy and Kerzy,\u00A0discussed this strange fact\u00A0over their lunch break. While they were eating, another Kerbal came running up to them, panting. They recognized him, he had been working in the Science Archives earlier that day. His name was Dereny. He said: \u0022Hi, um, sorry to interrupt, but, you were looking in the Archives earlier, right? For pictures from Kerbin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, that was us,\u0022 Jogy replied. \u0022What\u0027s wrong?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dr. von Kerman says he\u00A0wants to talk to you about that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerzy almost spilled her juice hearing that. \u0022Werhner von Kerman wants to see\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E? Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ll see him right after lunch,\u0022 said Jogy. Both girls could hardly contain their excitement and wonder as Dereny jogged away. \u0022What\u0027s so important about us not being able to find something in the Archives? Wouldn\u0027t he rather talk to someone who actually knows where to find things?\u0022 They finished lunch, and went to Werhner\u0027s office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerzy tentatively knocked on the door. \u0022Come in,\u0022 said Werhner, who was sitting at his desk, drawing something on a sheet of paper. He frowned and crumpled it up. There were several such crumpled sheets, but a few were not crumpled at all and had been set aside. They looked like drawings of a big, complex rover with crew pods on it. \u0022Sit down, make yourselves comfortable,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, why do you want to talk to us so badly?\u0022 asked Jogy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vell, it haz come to my attention that zere is not a single picture from Kerbin\u0027s surface in ze Science Archives. Zis has made us realize zat ve have conquered ze solar system, but zat ve have not at all conquered Kerbin itself. So ze engineering team haz come up vith a rover design, and ve have determined zat it should be able to go to vatever place on ze planet. I have decided zat ze best vay to show ze vorld how amazing Kerbalkind really iz, iz to bring zis rover all the vay around ze planet. I propose zat you, Jogy and Kerzy, take zis craft around ze globe. It vill be ze most perilous journey, but you vill be vorld heroes if you return. Do you accept ze challenge to become ze first Kerbonauts to be true Kerbinauts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJogy and Kerzy looked at each other in awe. \u0022You vould have two more crewmates, to help on your journey,\u0022 said Werhner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re in!\u0022 both said at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPART I\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe full crew was: Jogy Kerman, Commander and Pilot. Kerzy Kerman, Primary Engineer. Tedrick Kerman, Secondary Engineer. Dereny Kerman, Scientist. The ship was tested, they were reassured, and it would be able to go over all the terrain they would encounter. They were given a map, with the path they were to take marked in black pen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u00223uvpwkM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3uvpwkM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship had 10 all-terrain wheels, an ISRU unit and 2 drills, jets for the inevitable periods of sea travel, solar panels, SAS, batteries, crew cabins, snacks,\u00A0everything one would need for a long-duration ground-based mission. The journey would be about 5080 kilometers long, and would take about 130 hours of driving time. Finally they were ready to set out. Kerzy went and planted a flag right in front of the Astronaut Complex for all to see. The team would drive around the planet and return to that very flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f7E6cx2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f7E6cx2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right, time to go!\u0022 said Jogy.

It was mostly gently (occasionally not so gently) hills, and they were basically able to go straight southwest.

I put these in as placemarks in Google Earth and name them according to when they were taken. For instance, the one called \u0022Rover Location 12/27 Morning\u0022 means that I took the coordinates after I was finished driving this morning. But then I came back later in the afternoon and drove some more. \u0022End of Day 1\u0022 is where I stopped for the night after sunset on Kerbin.
