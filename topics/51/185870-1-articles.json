That\u0027s a considerable amount, about 10,000 - 12,000 m/s. In science mode, I could build ships to unlock parts that would allow me to build a large ship. I knew that it doesn\u0027t take a huge ship to have a lot of delta-V. I would focus on fuel tanks and engines, and eventually go there in a simple pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started out with the typical first flight with a flea and pod, with a few extra Mystery Goo attached. I would try to get as many science points as possible on each flight, to progress quickly. My second flight was a tall liquid stage with four SRBs. The little fuel tanks would do. I found that it had enough oomph to perform a quick Mun flyby. I took this opportunity to get more science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the Mystery Goos exploded during reentry, so I lost the data from those. I still gained enough to make some more advanced boosters. My next rocket had enough delta-V to make a Mun landing. However, it didn\u0027t have legs, so I would have to land in a flat area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven still, the rocket was not stable enough to turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E as would be required to leave for a surface sample and EVA report. Instead I deployed the materials bay and Mystery Goo from inside and took off again. I would still get plenty of science from the mission. I could probably have done a hop to another biome to get more science, but it would take too long and I had a high chance of tipping over on landing so I just went home. This time the mystery goos survived as I had changed the design of the pod slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/iiJhYVZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/iiJhYVZ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI now had enough science to unlock a variety of Rockomax 2.5 m parts. This would enable me to fly to Dres and land there. I stripped the pod of science experiments and made what is essentially a larger version of the Mun rocket. It would have enough delta-V to reach Dres and return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI consulted delta-V maps and transfer window maps, and timewarped on the launch pad to more or less the right phase angle. I took off and headed into orbit, then determined the right trajectory to intercept Dres. After finding a good burn and determining that it was within the range of my rocket, I was on my way. One correction burn would be needed to align to the right plane, but it took only half the acceleration I had allotted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy lander stage performed the insertion burn and set itself up to land near the canyons. I hoped to land at their edge, but it didn\u0027t happen and I didn\u0027t have time to be picky like that. The landing gear were being too bouncy and setting the craft to trend towards a horizontal position, so I lifted off a few times and manually lowered the spring strength. Then I went to a flat spot and set the ship down safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/Bi5BvcO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/Bi5BvcO\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI planted a flag on the surface and got back in the ship to plan for the transfer window. It was time to consult another transfer window calculator to find the right window. Once I got it, I timewarped to that time and went into orbit. It was difficult to get a Kerbin intercept at first, but finally I found a trajectory that would get me there. Again, one correction burn would be needed for the plane change. I did another small burn to align myself exactly to intercept Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at the right altitude, and then simply had to wait. I had plenty of fuel left, which I burned off before hitting the atmosphere to slow down a bit. The entry went without a hitch, and I recovered the craft\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E1:39:35\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0after starting the space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
