Even when rockets tore themselves apart or flipped end over end it teaches you something about the game. I\u0027ve opened up most of the tech tree and have mined the Mun and Minmus just because it\u0027s a new challenge. Sure it can be frustrating when your \u0022carefully\u0022 planned deployment system sends your rover crashing into the grond the moment you remember you haven\u0027t saved in ages. Or you hit Z and nothing happens because the Sun has been at just the wrong angle and you\u0027ve run out of power. It\u0027s all on the learning curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving checked for any upcoming transfer windows for my first steps outside the the local neighbourhood, I found the next one was for Moho (I\u0027m currently at Y2 D307 if memory serves). Not the easiest of targets from what I\u0027ve read. So, I built three identical science probes, Alf, Betty and Cecil (not every name has to be \u0022K\u0022 centric!) and sent them off using various figures I\u0027ve found online. Having now done the burn to match inclination, I\u0027m delighted to report that 2 out of 3 are on target for Moho SOI. Alf, sadly, has missed the mark and will probably lack the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v to get things back on track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetty and Cecil on the other hand are heading for an encounter. Some minor tweaks should line things up nicely. Discovering this happy fact was one of those great moments in gaming, when you find yourself grinning like a space crazy Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not used any Mods so its been down to pen and paper and a keen eye on the time/date as I\u0027ve also been landing a base on Minmus. The other big resource I\u0027ve relied on has been these forums with a wealth of answers and ideas. Thank you to everyone who helped make the above possible.

Moho Probe Cecil, despite being the last to leave, was the first to reach Moho. Due to the approach speed it turned into a flyby mission.

Betty will be next and in an attempt to bring the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v down to a manageable level for capture, she will be passing by at just 6,500 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:- Departure was Y2 D253 and arrival was Y2 D365.
