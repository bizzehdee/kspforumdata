Also, the GasStations and SSTO rocket are full of fuel, so moderately heavy)... Therefore when I try to open their legs later, one leg will often permanently clip deep into the ground (unless I deploy with Hack Gravity on...which jumps the ships high into the air and requires a long wait for it to settle back down (and meanwhile other nearby vessels are slowly shifting around). But this was one of the tricks I used when changing over the ships in the save file before (but that exercise was wasted effort when I found out that the legs would collapse under weight anyway...so I just decided to use the old leg config files instead).

I previously did an update to 0.22 where I used the 0.22 legs (using various techniques to rescue the toppling bases), but found the legs unacceptable...which is why I still have the old ones. With the ability to lock the suspension, I expect the 0.23 legs might be acceptable (although my initial experiments with the new legs were showing strange results), so I will do the update and rescue all the toppling ships again...when I have time.
