Currently I\u0027ve built and flown my Duna Explorer mission. \u00A0The ship below was built and launched to orbit over 3\u002B launches. Not shown is the unmanned refueling vessel and the crew transport vessel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis trip took 7 Kerbals to Duna. Left 3 in the science lab in orbit around Duna for science! Landed on Ike as well. And returned to Kerbin orbit, ready to refuel and go on the next mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWondering if I could take this to Jool. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/Michael_Lucente/Sol%20Explorer%20at%20Duna%203_zps4trxc8gc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Sol%20Explorer%20at%20Duna%203_zps4trxc8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/Michael_Lucente/Sol%20Explorer%20at%20Duna%202_zpslobj2rfc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Sol%20Explorer%20at%20Duna%202_zpslobj2r\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T21:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOOO! Nice ship you have\u00A0there!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy the wings? The wings I sorta understand, but why flaps? Is it meant to fly? Or maybe to help with heat management? I like the modular design so it can be reused! I also like the idea of nukes on a lander! With an isru pod and a tylo decent stage, I bet you could do a Jool 5 with that!

Wings are just for looks and to bump the engines out. \u00A0Haha. And I used the nuke engines so I can just have all liquid fuel and not need oxidizer. It should have plenty for a Jool mission.
