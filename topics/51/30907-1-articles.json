At first I just couldnt get to the moon in general, once I figured out how to get there, I couldnt slow down fast enough, so I made a better lander, which also was a larger lander. So what did I have to do? Make a larger rocket! The biggest rocket possible! This behemoth has been named the Serene MK 1 (the greek goddess of the moon) On the 3rd launch of the Serene Mk 1, we finally made it! I will probably add pictures later of my huge lander that unfolds into its own space station, but Id like to hear about your guy\u0027s stories \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E How long did it take you to land on the Mun? Were you using any mods? Any tutorials? I used no mods, and I watched some video tutorials but they made no sense so I ended up eyeballing it xD (when the Mun rises over the horizon I gun it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonathanS223","CreatedById":60263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T19:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to land on the moon though I got the Krebnik I (a probe) to orbit it.
