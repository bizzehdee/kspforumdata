Many nights have been spent by our ancestors gazing at the night sky with a burning in our hearts and a glazed bliss in our eyes. Impossible, it seemed, that we would ever manage to reach that goal which evolution has denied from our species. But no longer!\n\nThe Kerbal Space Program was founded with the intention of reaching for the stars (metaphorically and literally), furthering our understanding of the universe, prove our collective courage and intelligence, and realize the very goal of Kerbalkind: Sail amongst the stars like our ancestors have been dreaming of doing. With that goal in mind, let us take the first small steps and giant leaps into the space age!\n\n![PD6D3I9.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/PD6D3I9.jpg?1)\n\n**CONTENTS**\n\n**Section 1: Agency Information**\n\n[**Active Crew Roster**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n[**Kerbal Space Center**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n**Section 2: Mission Reports**\n\n[***-Newsflash!-*** **Chronology**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n**Space Programs**\n\n[Stayputnik Program](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129569-A-Spacetime-Oddity-My-Kerbal-Space-Program?p=2103473\u0026viewfull=1#post2103473)\n\n[Kommercial Satellite Program](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129569-A-Spacetime-Oddity-My-Kerbal-Space-Program?p=2122235\u0026viewfull=1#post2122235)\n\n**Active Crew Roster**\n\n[**Back to Top**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\n[table=width: 1000, class: outer\\_border, align: center]\n\n[tr]\n\n[td]![NpcI1rR.jpg?2](http://i.imgur.com/NpcI1rR.jpg?2)\n\n**Pilot**\n\n**Veteran**[/td]\n\n[td]**Jebediah Kerman, Jr.**\n\n**Status:** **Unassigned**\n\n**Ranking:** 0 Stars\n\n**Total Missions:** 0\n\n**-Flights:** 0\n\n**-Spaceflights:** 0\n\n**Background:** Jebediah \u0022Jeb\u0022 Kerman graduated first in his class at the Kerbal Flight Academy, and has passed the psychiatric evaluation exam \u0022by the skin of his teeth,\u0022 earning a reputation for being an eccentric and reckless pilot.

Stayputnik 1, has successfully attained what is known as \u0022Low Kerbin Orbit,\u0027 or LKO.\n\nThe historic announcement came just this afternoon when the KSP PR Department confirmed that the launch of the mission had been a total success and the probe was operating nominally.\n\nThe probe, made up of two seperate probe cores, sort of brains for the satellite, includes for transmitting antennae, four AA batteries, and a thermometer and Gravioli detector attached to a small metal truss. When asked to confirm if \u0022Gravioli\u0022 particles are even a real thing, the KSP Research and Development center released no statements.\n\nThis launch paves the way for all future Kerbal spaceflight missions to follow, and it is confirmed that tens of contracts have already been offered to the Space Program by private companies to put their own hardware, and their name, into space to perform all sorts of tasks from communications relaying to scientific experiments.\n\n![Uw6yZaG.jpg?3](http://i.imgur.com/Uw6yZaG.jpg?3)\n\nStayputnik 1 atop a yet-unnamed rocket.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T23:21:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T19:59:38Z","Content":"* * *\n\n***-Newsflash!-***\n\n**STAYPUTNIK 2 REACHES ORBIT, SPACE PROGRAM CELEBRATED**\n\n**August 1, 2015**\n\n*By Jaybree Kerman*\n\nBy some accounts, the successful launch and mission of Stayputnik 2 is even more important than the first Stayputnik launch earlier in the week. \n\nMission controllers celebrated the launch, which proved the Kerbal Space Program\u0027s capability to handle multiple launches in a small time frame, as well as several other goals. Not only is reliable space travel possible, analysts say, but the capabilities of the upgraded K1 rocket (as the Stayputnik launch vehicle was recently christened) have far exceeded expectations.\n\nIt is reported that the mission was executed so flawlessly that both stages meant for orbital insertion and maneuvering remain attached to the Stayputnik probe for possible future use, as there is still large amounts of fuel remaining in the upper stages.\n\nWhether or not the Stayputnik probe will continue to function beyond providing scientific measurements in High Kerbin Orbit, or HKO, is still up for debate.
