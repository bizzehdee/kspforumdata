Basically what\u0027s going on is this: In the PART node for a FuelLine, there\u0027s a child node named PARTDATA. That PARTDATA node has a \u0022target\u0022 attribute named tgt. On \u0022broken\u0022 fuel lines, that tgt value is set to 0. On \u0022working\u0022 fuel lines, it\u0027s set to the \u0022cid\u0022 attribute of the part the fuel line is flowing into. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of a working fuel line, trimmed for space: I have a fuel line flowing from a fuel tank to a Small 1.25 - 0.625 flat adapter, to which an LV-909 is attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flat adapter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPART\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E   name = adapterSmallMiniShort\u003Cbr\u003E   cid = 4294623296\u003Cbr\u003E   ...\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel line:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPART\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E   name = fuelLine\u003Cbr\u003E   cid = 4294612946\u003Cbr\u003E   ...\u003Cbr\u003E   PARTDATA\u003Cbr\u003E   {\u003Cbr\u003E      tgt = 4294623296\u003Cbr\u003E      ...\u003Cbr\u003E   }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the pre-0.90 saves, the target of the fuel line was defined as a direct attribute of the PART node like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EcData = tgt: adapterSmallMiniShort_3; pos: -1.66164,-0.04181697,-0.00677514; dir: -0.9996764,-0.02510512,-0.004097404; rot: -0.5,0.4999998,-0.5000003,0.5\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it was referencing the part it was connecting to by name, or more specifically, by NAME_treePosition.
