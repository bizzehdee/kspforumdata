What is that thing?\n\n![ujh5mhF.png](http://i.imgur.com/ujh5mhF.png)\n\nLanded. Geological activity? Alien life? Portal to another universe?\n\n![aDwUcq9.png](http://i.imgur.com/aDwUcq9.png)\n\nOutside it was strangely dark. Things came over all \u00222001\u0022 with this shot.\n\n![ifBXOav.png](http://i.imgur.com/ifBXOav.png)\n\nOur fearless explorer left the craft to investigate. \u0022It\u0027s full of stars!\u0022 said Kerson.\n\n![yjs3oT4.png](http://i.imgur.com/yjs3oT4.png)\n\n![FmVNfxs.png](http://i.imgur.com/FmVNfxs.png)\n\nIt\u0027s bigger than expected, and Kerson doesn\u0027t think it looks natural.

Unfortunately the flagpole wouldn\u0027t go into the rocky surface.\n\n![W8lBxct.png](http://i.imgur.com/W8lBxct.png)\n\nGene Kerman has since negotiated with the contractor of the planned Mun base to deploy it here in order to study the arch in greater detail. Look out for Arch Base 1, landing here soon!"}]}
