the installation contract (including the advance), and that a lot more spending is still on the horizon.\u00A0 It certainly doesn\u0027t hurt to save a few funds where possible.

tug for pushing other things around.\u00A0 Two reaction wheels may seem excessive, but the extra torque can be helpful for maneuvering this sort of package into position to dock on the surface.

Z-1 Double-D is built as a Single-Stage-To-Mun craft and comes packaged with a very nice little lander, but I wont be using it for that.\u00A0 The amount of fuel it carries allows for some pretty aggressive maneuvering in LKO, and it\u0027s very easy to extend the cargo bay and adjust the wings for long-ish payloads (which most of mine are).\u00A0 It can be quite challenging to find a decent
