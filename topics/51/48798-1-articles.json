Especially so in a coherent format that doesn\u0027t make an average readers\u0027 eyes bleed. But I\u0027ll give it a whirl here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new patch? Yeah, I\u0027m a fan. In the old sandbox game, I\u0027d build giant monstrosities to accomplish the smallest of tasks. I took great delight in this. But now? Now I have to plan. Now, I have to make decisions. I feel like a brand new player again. I\u0027m making a Munar run right now, even as we speak. I have very little unlocked. I do not have fuel lines. I do not have big tanks or engines. I\u0027m almost at demo level.
