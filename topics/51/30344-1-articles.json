Seeker 0-2/0.2 didn\u0027t do a spazz, however. Seeker 0-2 still didn\u0027t make it. Seeker 0-3 was then launched, and made into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2161/screenshot23e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeker 0-3 then undocked its small probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5592/screenshot24e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a final picture of Seeker 0-3 in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img5/5892/screenshot25c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, Seeker 0-3 had little fuel left after the orbit burns. A test will be done soon to see if Seeker 0-3 can have enough fuel to get to the Mun. Incase it runs out of fuel, more testing of the Seeker satellites will have to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
