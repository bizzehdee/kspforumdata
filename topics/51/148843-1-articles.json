After a new installation, the engineers at KSP found themselves capable of flying larger ships with higher part counts. This lead to a desire to take up a mission so challenging that it would test the abilities of the new computer tech at hand. Thus the Juno 5 mission was born. \u00A0The mission profile calls for six kerbalnauts, 2 pilots, 2 engineers, and 2 scientists to visit all five moons of the Jool system and then return safely to Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first issues faced by the engineers was designing a command module with enough DeltaV built in to safely get the CM to orbit in the event of an emergency in mid-ascent from either Tylo or Laythe. This meant that any engines on the CM would have to be attached radially in order to make room for the 2.5m docking port at the rear of the CM. Then Public Relations made the job ten times worse when they discovered that public opinion found cargo bays to be \u0022kinda kool\u0022. Thus, the CM needed radial engines that could fit inside a Mk.3 cargo bay. After about three different reiterations, the Intrepid class CM was built. With 800 units of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox mix and 900 units of monoprop, the CM has a little over 2100 m/s of DeltaV. The Intrepid CM is also fully equipped with scientific instruments and onboard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0to provide constant and steady electrical power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the CM was designed, the Tylo and Laythe landers had to be worked out. The Laythe lander is pretty much a freefall, aerobreaking design. The detachable heat shield has a small fuel supply meant to power the CM\u0027s radial engines just enough for the CM/Lander to fall\u00A0gradually from low Laythe orbit. The biggest challenge is managing to\u00A0land on solid and\u00A0level ground. Once i\u0027m over a landing site, lateral momentum is killed with drogue chutes, followed by the\u00A0main parachutes. Then,\u00A0before landing, the heat shield and its small fuel tank are jettisoned,\u00A0the Mainsail engine is primed, the landing gear is deployed, and a minimal retro burn is fired as briefly as possible. \u00A0With Laythe\u0027s lower gravity and thinner air, there should be\u00A0plenty of fuel to return to orbit in the CM, even if too much fuel is used in the descent. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tylo lander is attached to the forward section of the mothership. Its an\u00A0orange tank with six smaller radial tanks. It\u0027s powered by 6 aerospike engines and,\u00A0by the time landing approaches, will have plenty of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to safely land on Tylo. After, the lander should have 1/4 of its fuel supply left to start the ascent, the rest being attained by the CM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Vall, Pol, and Bop lander is a fuel tank with poodle engine and landing legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mothership holds the CM, VPB and Laythe landers in two very large cargo holds. These holds are flanked by the majority of the fuel for the single rhino and six LV-N engines. Foward of the holds is a Mk. 3 passenger cabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunching the mothership and all its tenders took some practice, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E of 94,000~ meters was attained. \u00A0The next and hardest part of the pre-mission phase were the eight\u00A0separate refueling missions. Eigth identical launches carried fuel and crew members up to the Juno 5 mothership as it was in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and passing directly over the KSP launch center. \u00A0All pre-mission resupply flights and crew transfers were completed and the Juno 5 broke \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E mid-day on year 8, day 419 in order to exit Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, make an orbital plane change, and commit a planned Jool rendezvous burn on year 9, day 44. Planned Jool \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E intercept is year 11, day 390, followed by an aerobreaking maneuver in Jool\u0027s upper atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext mission update will be post-plane change and rendevzous burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T22:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJ5 is no joke, I wish you the best of luck!
