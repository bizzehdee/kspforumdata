This game rocks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... to do what many others seem to have done as part of their KSP initiation I too have designed, tested and successfully completed an Apollo inspired mission. This was not intended to compete in any challenge and definitely NOT an attempt to build out a stock-alike or a look-alike Apollo-Saturn mockup. It was intended to keep the flavour, launch sequence highlights, and key mission elements in a easy enough format that they could be enjoyed and hopefully expanded so as to press on to Duna with the same basic architecture. Through this process I have come to greatly appreciate the efforts of all the other KSP players before me who have done much more complex attempts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve posted the craft file here... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/9x791bchquw6zxq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/9x791bchquw6zxq\u003C/a\u003E you can examine it to see the action groups, etc. Feel free to make changes to match up with your play style as you see fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt includes the main launch stack the CM, MEM, LES, Rover and a Munar escape system. I\u0027ve attempted to build a Munar equipment bay deployment system which better mimics a side panel stowage and deployment architecture. Be forewarned, it only works effectively when you target a level landing site! Pressing 7 blows the decouplers and drops the two equipment bays to the Munar surface (most of time!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI hope I\u0027ve edited the imgur album and inserted it correctly with mission comments embedded...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/60Wll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
