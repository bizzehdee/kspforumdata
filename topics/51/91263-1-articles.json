He was trying to go forward but the thing he was on was turning, trying to stop him from doing so, therefore he was ALWAYS moving towards the side. producing a gravity-like sensation. Regardless, it worked amazingly. I also learned that you don\u0027t need a circle to do this, ANY structure will do this if you spin it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T00:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool!
