Last night I decided to try and build the lightest most minimal ship I could in an exercise to see how far you can go on how little. The ship is made of one Mk1 Lander Can, one FL-T800 Fuel Tank, one LV-N Atomic Rocket, three LT-2 Landing Struts, three Modular Girder Segment XL, and three EAS-4 Strut Connectors and one Telus-LV Bay Mobility Enhance and one MechJeb unit because it is lighter than an ASAS. And the girder and struts are only there because the Atomic Rocket engine is longer than the landing legs. But that\u0027s it just 14 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t know how far it could go but with Eeloo being the furthest planet away, I decided to aim for that and see how close I got. It\u0027s funny Eeloo seemed like this daunting challenge being so far out and here I am having landing on when just experimenting with the simplest ship possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh course, poor old Sean Kerman doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to get home, and I haven\u0027t currently designed a ship that can reach Eeloo and back, so now I\u0027ll have to design a rescue mission. I think it will go like this: I\u0027ll wait for Eeloo to reach the closest point in its orbit and the Sean will take off and use every last drop off fuel to get as close to home as possible. And rescue ship, probably the one I used to get to Dres and back will rendezvous with Sean somewhere out in deep space and he will EVA on over into it and that will fly him home. But that\u0027s all for another day, til them poor ol\u0027 Sean will just have to wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/ouscooby/ksp/screenshot50_zps402717b9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot50_zps402717b9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamps","CreatedById":70484,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsually smaller is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough that\u0027s definitely not what she said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations dude!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cesarcurado","CreatedById":60073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m yet to land on Duna without crashing... lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESean doesn\u0027t seem to mind getting stuck on Eeloo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you burn for the inner solar system when Eeloo is \u003Cem\u003Efarthest\u003C/em\u003E from the sun, you don\u0027t have to kill as much velocity to drop into the inner part of the system...and maybe you can arrange for an aerobraking encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESean doesn\u0027t seem to mind getting stuck on Eeloo. \u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you burn for the inner solar system when Eeloo is \u003Cem\u003Efarthest\u003C/em\u003E from the sun, you don\u0027t have to kill as much velocity to drop into the inner part of the system...and maybe you can arrange for an aerobraking encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing on about that, I wonder if it would be possible to use a gravity assist from Jool to drop your orbit as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tiberius_solus","CreatedById":6119,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done!
