In any case they exist only as quoted by the characters in the story. I do not have any list of them other than what appears there. That part where Mort trails off while quoting General Order Three? I have not even completed the sentence in my own mind. All I have is a list of which numbers I\u0027ve \u0027checked out\u0027 already so I don\u0027t re-use them.\n\nNow as to the lawyering thing, that\u0027s always fun. I\u0027ve dabbled a little in patent law and appreciate a good argument as much as anyone else on the Internet. But in this case I can\u0027t see Mort getting convicted on GO #3, Bob or no Bob. For one thing, Mort is not a Kerbfleet officer. He\u0027s a civilian administrator, as is the rest of the Mission Control staff. (though Gene may or may not have held rank in the Air Service at one point, shhhh) Even if Mort were a KF officer he was not given any order, lawful or otherwise, that he could have disobeyed. Remember, the Dipperkraft crashed before the re-org. He simply ordered on his own prerogative as Chairkerb that due to the expense and extreme danger no rescue should be attempted. This actually follows GO#1 and GO#2 pretty well, and Lawyer Bob agrees or he would not have put that flag up.\n\nIf anyone was guilty of anything, it would be under GO#2 which says you only send the minimum crew required to accomplish a dangerous mission. Bob quoted that when he objected to the Dipperkraft mission for the final time. Dilsby decided that the mission did not violate that Order, being that a pilot was required to fly the craft and a scientist was required to reset the experiments. Yes, they could have done some of the science with a probe--but not *all* of it, and in fact there was no such probe present.\n\nIn any case it might surprise you to know that there is no General Order--canonical or otherwise--designed to prevent stupidity, negligence, poor design, boneheadedness, nincompoopery, dereliction of the senses, or, to put it it more generally, being kerbal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T03:04:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:06:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No one gets left behind\n\nBest line ever. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:07:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In any case it might surprise you to know that there is no General Order--canonical or otherwise--designed to prevent stupidity, negligence, poor design, boneheadedness, nincompoopery, dereliction of the senses, or, to put it it more generally, being kerbal.\n\nNope, no surprise at all.\n\nEDIT: Can someone put together a list of all the text from each General Order?\n\nAlso, Kuzzter, I think you have a good place to start work from for your next interlude: the kexpedia.kom ratings."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:08:49Z","Content":"Might I suggest that this be put in Fan Works?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:09:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Might I suggest that this be put in Fan Works?\n\nIt is, under the under-sub-forum \u0022Mission Reports\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:10:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh my goodness no, ... there is no General Order--canonical or otherwise--designed to prevent stupidity, negligence, poor design, boneheadedness, nincompoopery, dereliction of the senses, or, to put it it more generally, being kerbal.\n\n\u0022You must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Kuzzter again.\u0022\n\nJust so you know.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:14:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is, under the under-sub-forum \u0022Mission Reports\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAh!

The only way to work like that in this case was landing of the unlandable ship.\n\nAnd, of course, the Order Zero - I was suspecting that it is what it actually is (maybe not the way it was introduced) for quite a while.\n\nOf course, everybody running to KSC2 was a good surprise (on the other hand, M7 can launch from anywhere if it\u0027s meant to launch from Eve). Looks like Wernher had this planned for quite a while. And that\u0027s the answer to the question who is really in charge!\n\nOh well, still brilliant beginning, and now that being Kerbal for the purpose of the script is kinda mostly over... now the actual big mission the Kerbal way may start!\n\nAnd what\u0027s the crew capacity of M7? 5 Kerbals? Holey Moho! Wasn\u0027t 1 Kerbal EAV already quite a challenge before? I definitely was expecting a 2-Kerbal ascent vehicle just to pick the guys up.
