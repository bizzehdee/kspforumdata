If more space is made underneath it, then base modules could be placed underneath, and released when on the surface. Alternatively, a larger ascent stage is possible, and with parachutes and MOAR STRUTS, it could become a planetary lander, at least Duna-capable. New features in future updates (mining equipment, for example) should be accommodated by it\u0027s spare dv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 The rover... needs work. I need to make it much more stable, as a simple turn could send it into the non-air. Also, on the flat Minmus oceans, it would stay put when deployed, but on any sort of hill, it runs off, meaning my guys have to chase it down.
