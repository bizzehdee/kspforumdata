As those \u0022things\u0022 got bigger and more explosive, the group decided to charter a company in the hopes of making money while exploring space. Through the small science capital they built up from their experiments on the ground, they managed to build the Pollok II, a small but reliable ship, based on their Pollok I ground tests. The first flight went suborbital, but the second achieved real success in attaining a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q6QQXu6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q6QQXu6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, due to a parachute glitch the pilot was killed in re-entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this did not stop the Pollok Program. Within a week, two more Pollok IIs had been launched, and managed to rendezvouses with each other despite lacking electrical power or RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y1m8av1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y1m8av1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next ship, the Pollok III, was able to do large amounts of science (due to their having extra batteries), but was restricted to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/le5bu27.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022le5bu27.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPollok IV was able to get into Low Munar Orbit, and conduct lots of science, but lacked the fuel to land.
