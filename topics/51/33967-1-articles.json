Not being forward-thinking, none of my castoffs have docking ports (addendum: would this even be a good idea? I\u0027m not sure) and certainly don\u0027t have RGS units, so I had to find an alternate way to deal with them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter the Deorbiter Mk 1!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v128/Varsis/screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy landing gear makes a surprisingly good stabilizer, which means I can basically treat this like a less-fiddly docking maneuver and then just slowly accelerate to keep the spent booster in place while turning to retrograde. The only real issue is if I hit too far away from center of gravity (note to self: most of the mass in a spent booster is the engine) and not having the turning force to counteract the imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this was a proof of concept, I already have plans for the Mk2. The prototype\u0027s flight managed to deorbit two boosters, but ran low on monoprop. I plan on giving the Mk2 a second monoprop tank, and better solar/electrical support (the Mk1 tended to die about 2/3 across the dark side orbit, which screwed up a third rendezvous). I\u0027m considering developing a sort of offshoot Mk3 as an orbital \u0022Tugboat\u0022 as well, slapping one of each size docking port on it and keeping it docked at my refueling station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
