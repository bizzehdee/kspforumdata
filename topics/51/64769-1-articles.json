Often, he\u0027s killed by what he doesn\u0027t see coming; a Munar lander that started the burn too late, a jet whose landing gear didn\u0027t open...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I just had what may be my worst experience to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was attempting to build a little glider, to be launched by a single large SRB. All was well and good (figuratively, the darn thing never wanted to get off the ground) until the final test run. Sure, he died a few times when the booster flipped over, but on this final run, the glider sepp\u0027d from the booster successfully, and he was off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was like a movie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe began flying towards the great ocean, using the Infiniglider glitch to go faster and faster. 100 m/s, 150 m/s... And then disaster struck. The glider spontaneously exploded. Jeb was catapulted skyward. I was looking from the front at the time, and I saw him give a frightened frown. I turned to look at Jebediah actually frowning... And what I saw will haunt the rest of my KSP days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked into his eyes, his terror obvious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen his frown faded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe began to smile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe knew what was going to happen and he went like a true Kerbal: Hollering and smiling the whole way through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe hit the ground with a shout of glee. His last seconds spent in utter fear and ecstasy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love you, Jebediah. No longer will you be just the first Kerbonaut to fly my rockets, no more just another green-skinned, psychopathic, space-loving, looker-at-of-explosions Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are my hero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER.I.P.
