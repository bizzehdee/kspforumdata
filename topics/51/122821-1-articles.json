Rather than some boring \u0022about me\u0022 post, I thought i\u0027d share with you all my recent mission! Previously got featured on KSP\u0027s Facebook page with a screenshot I sent them which I was pretty proud of \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying through career mode (haven\u0027t played for some months so only just getting used to the new physics) and accepted several contracts, include a \u0022rescue from orbit\u0022 and several \u0022place sattelite into orbit\u0022 missions. So...I figured I would combine them all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigned a probe-dispersing rocket (I\u0027m sure there are plenty of people that have done this but first time for me!) with a rescue pod underneath.
