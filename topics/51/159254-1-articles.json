Yes, everybody remembers the nerve-wracking moments when Matdard Kerman made his historic first flight to space, and the relief when the chutes finally opened and he landed softly in the ocean. Everybody watched the first flight around the Moon, and the first landing of Grissom IX, as Lagerberta and Chadus became the first Kerbals to step on another celestial body. The world has seen several more Moon landings, and several more accomplishments of the program, but slowly lost interest. After all, the finals of the Kerbal Kup are on tonight, why would I watch \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eanother\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Moon landing, eh?

Until today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, in his new year speech, the president John F. Kerman surprised everybody, when he made a bold statement. \u0022Kerbin\u00A0should commit itself to send a Kerbal to Mars and bring him back before the decade ends. We choose to go to Mars.\u00A0We choose to go to Mars and do the other things. Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\u0022 From this very moment, space exploration was again a headline material, and several of the Space Agency directors were considering booking a one-way flight to Bolivia and never coming back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, the space program was a very succesfull bussines so far. The daring series of missions that lead to the Moon landing had a few bumps on the way, but no Kerbal was lost in space and all the objectives were ultimately met.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all begun with the fifth flight of the Lovell spacecraft, that was sent on a free return trajectory and completed a lunar flyby:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227c8cUlP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7c8cUlP.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen a new, three-manned capsule was developed.

The exception was Grissom X, which was aborted during ascent because of an engine failure - the crew survived, and later flew to the Moon on Grissom XIV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral satelites were sent to interplanetary space and to another planets.

They realized that the next step will eventually be to send Kerbals to other planets. They just did not expect that it would have to be this early. Considering we haven\u0027t even landed a probe on Mars, the timeframe was really tight. And a lot of the things we learnt during construction of the lunar base in Struve crater will surely come in handy - be it precision landings, surface assembly or long distance roving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zVbYiK0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zVbYiK0.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022B4kfFCA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B4kfFCA.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HYaIgPy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HYaIgPy.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also had a bit of experience with prolonged stays in orbit - several crews stayed more than a month aboard the first space station - Skylab I:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bVVEFhn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bVVEFhn.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this, this will be a different thing altogether.

And will have to be done fast. We know nothing about Mars, we know nothing about deep space journeys, we know nothing about the effects of these journeys on the crew, yet we are supposed to send kerbalnauts on one and explore our closest neighbour. So, we should\u00A0start learning. After a series of meetings of the board and the senior scientists and engineers, the decision came to focus on three main projects for now:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst -\u00A0long term stays in orbit and finding out what the main issues are and how to deal with them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond - a transfer window to Mars is coming soon. So we must send probes there and find out as much as we can\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird - We need to develop procedures and mission rules for working on the martian surface. It was easy on the Moon, the mission control could communicate with the kerbalnauts almost without delay. Mars is another story - it will take several minutes before mission control gets your message, and several more before you get your answer. So the crew must be able to operate without direct guidance most of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalt Kerman was named the head of the Skylab program. As of now, Skylab I has been in operation for a few years, and three crews of three visited the station. They have proved that it is possible to survive a month in space, and performed a few scientific experiments, but that\u0027s about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bVVEFhn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bVVEFhn.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the conviction of Walt that the logical thing would be to send the next crew to Skylab for about half a year, and just see what would happen, the previous crews disagreed almost unanimously. Skylab was not ready for this kind of permanent stays. It was too cramped, lacked proper equipment and suffered from occasional power problems. The crew could tough it out for a month, but there\u0027s no way that they would stay there for half a year. The board disagreed, claiming that with all the investments in R\u0026amp;D and the martian probes, there wasn\u0027t enough money left for expanding the station - while kongress approved the martian program, no money had arrived yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince there was no hope of an agreement between the two parties, Gus Kerman, the head of operations, suggested an experiment - the members of the board will try to live and work for a few days in the Skylab training facility, a scale model of the station, to see what the crew\u0027s reservations were about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the experiment was supposed to last a few days, it was a very short one.

Their lander almost killed three kerbalnauts on its first crewed Moon landing. Luckily, the crew survived the crash landing, but that was about all the good news there was. The crew was now stranded on the Moon, and they had to think of a way to get them back as soon as they could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There is no way we could design, test and build a completely new vehicle in time. We could send them supplies to ensure they can stay at Struve longer, but it is risky. If any one launch goes wrong, it\u0027s a bad day for all of us. On the other hand, we built two of the LSTVs back then. So, the second one is already assembled and tested, so it\u0027s just a matter of putting it up on a rocket and sending it to the Moon. We could do it in less than a month. We finished a report and sent it to the board to review.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene still wasn\u0027t convinced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You claim that you identified and fixed the problem. What exactly caused the malfunction?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was a mistake of one of our engineers who was responsible for the assembly and integration of the two engine systems. There were two independent clusters of engines on the vehicle - the throttlable landing engines, and the restartable main engines that did most of the lifting work. The main engines could be theoretically restarted as many times as you needed, that is why they were chosen for the job. But, the problem was that they were rated for thirty minutes of burn time, and our colleague, ehm, overlooked that. That is why the first\u00A0unmanned landing and takeoff went perfectly, but as the engines reached the critical burn time on the second trip, they started to shut down. The LSTV as it is can not be reused multiple times, but is the safest bet for one trip to the Moon surface and back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see...

Sending a Kerbal to Mars was not the hard part - even our Grissom lunar missions had enough power and fuel to go to Mars. But if you want to come back, preferably alive, this is where it gets hard. The trip will last about three years. Just try to imagine how your fridge looks like, how much food is inside. That is probably food for a week. Now imagine fifty times that. That\u0027s for a year. Now imagine three times that. That\u0027s for the whole trip. And finally, three times that once again. Your buddies need to eat, too. You have to pack all this with you.

If we\u0027re going all the way to Mars, we need to land there, and gather as much information about martian surface as possible. And how are we going to land there?

I am the senior engineer of the Krumman lander team that built the LEM, the machine that took us to the surface of the Moon. Considering we were the only company on Kerbin with experience of building crewed spaceships designed to land on another celestial body, it was not much of a surprise that we got the contract to buld the MLV\u00A0- the Mars Landing Vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Moon landings were not easy, but in comparison to Mars landings, it was a piece of cake. Much weaker gravity, much lower orbital speed. No atmosphere to slow you down during\u00A0your ascent. So a lightweight vehicle could be designed, and our lander worked perfectly. In the recent years, we learnt a lot about martian surface and atmosphere. The surface was solid, so no problems there. But the atmosphere was tricky - while dense enough to slow you down during ascent and heat your craft up during entry, it was nowhere near thick enough to slow you down to land with parachutes - at least in a craft as heavy as a lander with life support systems and fuel to get you to orbit again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J8F9O4t.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J8F9O4t.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lSoJb0A.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lSoJb0A.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HptAg6I.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HptAg6I.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Landing only on chutes was possible for light payloads only - such as the rover the Agency sent to Mars in 1973. But could the chutes be used to slow down a bit, so we needed less fuel for the powered landing? That was one of the many questions that needed an answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA vehicle that could land three crewmembers on the martian surface, allow them to stay for at least ten days, and then go back to low orbit to rendezvous and dock with the Glenn spacecraft. And, please, don\u0027t make it too heavy. That was all we got from the agency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many different approaches to a mission with these specs, and our engineers came up with a lot of different designs of the lander. After a year of reviewing and preliminary testing, we had three different concepts to show the Agency officials.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fUNYWvL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fUNYWvL.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Concept one uses drogue chutes to slow down in the upper part of atmosphere, while a retro burn is performed at 80 kilometres to prevent the chutes from burning up. Four engines then perform the landing. On the other hand, Concept two uses its greater surface area to aerobrake, and chutes and a short burn to land. Concept three is much heavier, but is similar to the LEM design - one stage to land, one to go to orbit again. Nothing too fancy, but if you decide to stick with what we know, this is the way to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter several meetings with the engineers and kerbalnauts, the Agency has decided to go with Concept one. The oficial reason was that Concept three was too heavy and Concept two too ugly, but I think they were just afraid they could not handle the aerobraking descent with enough precision \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ETo be honest, they were not, but I was, Michal.don)\u003C/span\u003E. \u003C/em\u003ESo, that was it. It was no longer Concept one, it was the official MLV, the machine that will one day land a kerbalnaut on Mars.
