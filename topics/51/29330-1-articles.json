I have finally gotten an interplanetary mission done. It was easier than I thought, just need to know how to do it right. All I really did was stick a nuke engine on the lander stage of my Mun lander, stick a probe on top, and I was on my way. It was also a lot faster than I thought it would be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a little trick I learned. Set the planet you want to go to as your target. Find the descending node if your going to the inner planets, or the ascending node if your going to the outer planets. Put a maneuver node there. Adjust accordingly.
