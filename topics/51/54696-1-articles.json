There have been lots of experiments with propulsion systems for the Jool Explorer (more on that some other time,) but the real concern has been with landers for Tylo and Laythe. I decided the ship would need one lander for each moon, and that they could probably also be used on the other moons as well before going to the bigger satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese landers would need to be pretty big to land two crewmen and a rover and take off from these challenging destinations. My first thought was to upgrade my Duna Lander. It is still untried on Duna, but I reasoned that it would need a lot more power to take off from Tylo or Laythe anyway, so I would see if I could get it to work on Kerbin--if it works on Kerbin, those moons ought to be no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the design to work on both might be a problem, so I decided to concentrate on atmospheric landings and takeoffs. So, I had to get the thing into orbit on Kerbin first:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/btL8f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so this isn\u0027t such a good design. I needed something lighter. I designed a new ship from scratch with both Laythe and Tylo in mind. It would need over 3000 dV for both the landing and ascent stages for Tylo, and parachutes for Laythe. I reasoned that by using aerobraking to land on Laythe, I would have lots of fuel in the landing stage still, which could be used to assist the takeoff in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. Here\u0027s what I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RMBzh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last successful landing seems to be a proof of concept, to me anyway. I had to move fuel back and forth between its various tanks to get it to stand upright, thanks to those mushy legs. Once it was vertical, I transfered fuel back into a balanced condition, raising and lowering individual legs to compensate for the shifting center of mass. I\u0027m still quite concerned about the thing\u0027s ability to land on even a slight slope. We may have to use the F5-F9 compensator to correct problems in that area. I may add Infernal Robotics jacks to manually adjust the lean without using the legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, since Laythe has less gravity and atmosphere, and I accomplished the landing and takeoff with less than a full load of fuel, I think it\u0027s pretty certain the ship will work on Laythe. According to the dV numbers, it should also be capable of landing and taking off from Tylo. There\u0027s no way to know until I get there, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, work continues on the Jool mothership.

I present to you, the Joolian Endeavour:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4Ut6qo0.png\u0022 alt=\u00224Ut6qo0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost 1000 tonnes fully fueled, 915 parts, and a crippling nexus for lag beyond all reason. Five actual seconds pass for every in-game second logged. Surprisingly, however, the ship is very stable and maneuverable and MechJeb can lock the ship on course effortlessly. The ship uses 5 large ASAS units plus 9 more smaller units at the rear, which allows it to turn without using any RCS. There is no flex in the spaceframe at all while under acceleration, which had been a problem with earlier versions. I can\u0027t get a precise delta-V figure for the ship, but I think it\u0027s around 15,000. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D6G3dqA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D6G3dqA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocked to Sr. ports on either side of the command/hab section are two identical heavy landers, one each for Tylo and Laythe. Each lander also carries two rovers for surface operations. Besides the two heavy landers, the Endeavour also carries two one-man landers for smaller bodies, two MechJeb landing probes for scouting landing locations, and a pair of mini orbital probes. I have also developed a tug which will be docked to the front of the ship which will assist the heavy landers in reaching their descent orbits without using their on-board fuel, and then help recover the ascent stages when they return from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ngClv24.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ngClv24.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 9 LV/N engines mounted at the rear of the fuel tanks, but only 8 want to fire. Fortunately, the one which is not working is the middle one, so there are no balance problems. I am flying it to the Mun and back as a test run. The burn was estimated at almost 20 minutes for 745 dV, and with the lag, that would take over an hour. I fired it up and went to watch a movie, expecting it to be done when I got back, but miscalculated in that I forgot to take into account that after 15 minutes it would be firing at 90 degrees to its orbit trying to stay on course. I shut it down after wasting a bunch of fuel and it\u0027s on its second approach to the node now. I will fire it up 10 minutes before the node and hope it can escape orbit this time. This means several orbits would be needed to get enough speed for Jool insertion, unless I mount more engines on the back. Just what my poor CPU needs, more parts on this beast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m running out of time before my Jool window opens (less than 5 in-game days,) so I will have to figure out what I will do quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJK\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T21:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my stars and garters...what a magnificent, beautiful monstrosity have you built \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Of course, building two, or even three smaller ships to get lag to be manageable is unthinkable for a truly devout KSP player:sticktongue:.
