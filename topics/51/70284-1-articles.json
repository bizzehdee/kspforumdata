In an unfortunate twist of events, Jebadiah was crushed by a command pod rolling downhill on top of him as he was trying to board, thus came the birth of the \u0027Jeb 1\u0027 rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe spared no expense on this rocket; as we were on a mission to set foot on Mun in memory of Jebadiah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter much preperation, we had blast off. The rocket achieved orbit with plenty of fuel left - and we began our burn towards Mun. Halfway there, the \u0027transfer stage\u0027 gave out and ran out of fuel, so we had to rely on our lander to get us the rest of the way, land, and bring our men back home. I am proud to say that it successfully did so, and we now have a flag plant on the Mun in memory of Jebadiah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when we were coming back home, on our descent, we ran out of fuel at about 552 meters. This wasn\u0027t a problem as the parachute was more than capable of handling just the command pod, especially only at 42 m/s, so we dropped our lander stage (unfortunate, we wanted to keep it!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon our final landing, we noticed something odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander stage, everything was there except for the booster. This stage fell from 550 meters, starting at a rate of 30 m/s, and not only survived, but look how it landed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/615049254598449728/C4EB744162B73FA697466660ADA95A117607D91A/\u0022 alt=\u0022C4EB744162B73FA697466660ADA95A117607D91A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
