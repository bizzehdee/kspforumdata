This has been largely due to gaps in my playtime, updates, other interests and so forth. However, recently I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve devised a style of play that suits me, will guarantee I follow through with my game goals, and will let me post updates in a leisurely fashion: real time. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s right, a game without time warp. Fear not Kerbals, the furthest interplanetary transfer is only six months of your life. Now, since I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve started playing that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always wanted to log it in some fashion, as us geeks are wont to do. So here it is; the diary of the digitized descendants of Apollo I.\n\nA few explanations and ground rules: as I am making this as realistic as I want it to be, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve installed the following mods and am following these rules for 1.0.2:\n\n- Capsules, Probes, Orbiters, Landers, Rockets, and Station Parts must first be tested in ground, flight, suborbital, and orbital flight to the extent possible (i.e Station Parts will only have a ground test before being flown up)\n- For my own amusement I will only fly IVA in manned vehicles with RPM mod and hullcam POV for probes but can use the orbital map to simulate mission control\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s viewpoint\n- Send probes before Kerbals for exploration and landing\n- Due to the plentiful supply of Kerbals, unmanned testing has not been invented at the start of this Space Program\n- Progression will be done with Programs that have their own missions with specific goals/flight plans to be accomplished (i.e. what NASA does)\n- Game mode is normal but with no tweaks (recoverable Kerbals, reverting etc)\n\nMod list:\n\n- SCANsat\n- Station Science\n- UKS\n- Hullcams\n- Tarsier Space Tech\n- RemoteTech\n- MechJeb2\n- RPM\n- TAC LS (configured for Mk1 pod-1d of supplies and 2h of electricity; 1h supplies EVA)\n- KCT (build time set at 0.1 of normal so this is still feasible)\n- KIS\n- KAS\n- Universal Storage\n- Final Frontier\n- Vessel View\n- StageRecovery\n- DMagic Orbital Science\n- Docking Port Alignment\n- Background Processing\n- EVAFuel\n- Contract Packs for ScanSatLite and RemoteTech\n- DangIt (oh, yes I did)\n\nI wanted to add some science mods like FieldScience but they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still in 0.90 so these will do quite nicely. I may add or remove some depending on their performance and impact but only in extreme cases. Also if anyone knows a mod that simulates non-active vessels\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 orbits please let me know. Enjoy the ride!\n\nEvery mission will have a briefing, description, and after-action report with pictures. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably get around to one mission a day, no doubt slowing down the further down the tech tree I get (due to KCT).\n\nThe Space Program\u0027s Mission Statement is as follows\n\n*Founded to learn all scientific data in the Universe as well as establish Orbital and Surface Bases on all available Celestial Bodies, capture Unknown Objects for study, create a Solar Communication Network, and explore the depths of Deep Space.*\n\nIs this all very long term? Yes, but with plenty of excitement along the way. First mission will be uploaded soon.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T15:52:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zedsdead**"}]}
