The Kerbals were not interested in space flight in the slightest and the fledgling KSP had a paltry budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then one day everything changed for Jeb. In fact, everything changed for every Kerbal, but Jeb would be the first to feel the effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small group of amateur Kerbal astronomers had identified an asteroid the size of Duna barreling through space out past Eeloo orbit; whatever had taken a swipe at this giant had sent it hurtling through the inner system, and even the most pessimistic of those with the ability to do the math acknowledged the inevitability of a catastrophic Kerbin intercept some 5 and a half years hence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the Kerbals did what you would expect of such heroic little green buggers. They panicked, looted and generally wasted the first 6 months of the time remaining to them before the authorities finally regained some semblance of control and announced the bootstrapping of the Kerbal Space Program to ensure the survival of the species.

The assumption is that the vast majority of the stock tech is available on Kerbin but needs to be adapted, repurposed and generally obtained for the program. Mod tech and the new KSPI techtree nodes represent companies and groups on Kerbin backing the evacuation plan, rather than some crazy scheme like huge underground bunkers or giant frikkin lazors to shoot the rock down. They therefore accelerate their research to help KSP out. Completing generally impressive tasks and showing proof of concept will also win backing and investors. In this way the science collected to unlock the parts for this scheme is better imagined as public relations and exposure. If it looks like the plan might work they might work faster!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(a bit of basic tech was moved to start node to avoid a series of sub-orbital spam)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane is installed at the moment as I may at some point add ExoplanetaryLaunchpads which I recall being dependant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont intend to actually mine Kethane since KSPI adds plenty of options, though I do like using the scanners to balance out against RT dishes so that may happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did start a run at this challenge once before, but got interrupted and then discovered KSPI, hence the reboot, and this time I took loads of pictures to share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T12:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T13:23:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb was so excited he could hardly sit still.
