I decided to timewarp to get up there faster. For a millisecond, all of the individual parts of my plane were scattered across the screen and then I was flipping through space. I believe this is a recognized kraken. I stayed, watching it for a while, and then the screen went black. The altitude meter was blank, the speedometer said NaN, and the navball literally went dark. I\u0027m traveling so fast Jeb is screaming in horror, and he doesn\u0027t do so lightly. I\u0027m not joking. Jeb was screaming. All the RPM displays went totally dead too. I tried to eva and the game crashed with a crash log. Wow. Thank you so much, kraken. You\u0027ve just added a few more pounds of totally worthless mystery to my life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
