The concept is that a large spacecraft with lots of amenities could be used as a residence for long interplanetary trips, smaller shuttlecraft would do the high-delta-V transporting of the crew between the destination planets and the cycler as it flys by. I\u0027ve seen it discussed a lot in KSP, but here are some articles on the concept. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLpc6NDm0qs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EQuick introduction\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\nMind-numbingly \u003Ca href=\u0022http://russell.ae.utexas.edu/FinalPublications/ConferencePapers/03Feb_AAS-03-145.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecomplicated but thorough\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure of the practicality of cyclers over fast high-energy missions, but the search for cycler paths fascinates me a great deal.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEarth-Mars cyclers are the most studied. Almost all papers I\u0027ve seen make 3 simplifying assumptions about the motions of the planets to ease the search, as follows:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) The orbits of Earth and Mars are circular and coplanar.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Mars\u0027 orbital period is 1.875 times Earth\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Mars makes no change to the cycler\u0027s path, only Earth does.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs we shall see, these assumptions cause problems when it comes to actually flying these paths.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of the cyclers are described are ballistic, that is, after the cycler is placed in its path no further dV needs to be expended other than small course corrections. Others require substantial manuevers to keep them on track, for instance the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/james.m.longuski.1/JournalArticles/1993/CyclerOrbitbetweenEarthandMars.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAldrin cycler \u003C/a\u003Erequires a 230m/s or so correction every synodic period.

In the case of the ideal Earth-Mars this is 2.143 years, for the real planets it is 779.95 days or 2.135 years, for Kerbin and Duna it is 227.38 Earth days or 909.5 Kerbin days. This means that if your ship leaves Kerbin on a given day, and then comes back to it 454.76 Earth days later with the same energy and moving in the right direction it can repeat the Kerbin-Duna-Kerbin path indefinitely. Note the requirement about the energy! It is easy to find a path that goes K-D-K, and even one that does it in 455 days, but it will come back with much more energy that it left with because of that flyby of Duna! If you don\u0027t use a Duna flyby or a deep-space maneuver then it is tricky to get back to Kerbin when it is that extra .135 orbits further in its path, so the big challenge in cycler searches is moving the apsis of your Solar orbit forward. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the last few years a very good cycler orbit has been discovered for the Earth-Mars run, it is called an \u0022S1L1-Ballistic cycler\u0022. Here\u0027s the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://buzzaldrin.com/files/pdf/2002.AIAA_PAPER.Analysis_of_a_Broad_Class_of_Earth-Mars_Cycler_Trajectories.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epaper by the original discoverers\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3HD9sk4yoc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evideo of the path\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Check out the low Earth and Mars intercept speeds, most other cyclers fly by much faster, especially ones that repeat after only two synodic periods. This cycler works even better with Kerbin-Duna because Kerbin\u0027s orbit really is circular, so running it in stock KSP is a great way to study it. Also Duna\u0027s SOI has a limit, so you can fly fairly close to Duna without it affecting your path unlike in the real world.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I first figured out the S1L1 path without the flyby of Duna, I wanted to see if Kerbin system could emulate the flyby angles and rotation of the apsis necessary without the complication of flying by Duna. Here it is. Note I\u0027m using Earth time, I\u0027ll translate to Kerbin time below. I\u0027m using a great little mod called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128952-105-kerbal-slingshotter-visualize-ship-and-all-planetmoon-positions-at-a-selected-time/\u0026amp;_fromLogin=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESlingshotter\u003C/a\u003E, it is helpful for planning this sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/DT1bv/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuccess! My ship returned to Kerbin 456.4 days after leaving it with only 9m/s less V-infinity. It only used 11m/s for course corrections after the initial 1255m/s to get started. Note that one cycler would only do the Kerbin-Duna run once every 2 synodic periods, and only in one direction. You would need another one timed to encounter Duna on the way in for the return trip, and another in-out pair to cover the other synodic periods. These limitations are common to all cyclers, I\u0027ve seen paths that would require 14 cycler ships in order to be able to get a ride inwards and outwards every synodic period!\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo in Earth days if you initially leave Kerbin at 0 you must fly by it again on day 301.24 and day 454.76. In Kerbin time this is day 1205 (2Y 353D) and day 1819 (4Y 115D).\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I ran the path again, but this time with a flyby of Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/8vFTi/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOuch! The flyby of Duna added a lot of energy. I think this can be compensated for by flying by alternating sides of Duna, or one could stay outside it\u0027s SOI at all times. That leads to spending several days in the shuttle vehicle and a couple hundred m/s of dV to get from the far-away cycler to the planet and back though. The bigger problem is that Duna\u0027s orbit is not circular and so it will not be in the same place relative to Kerbin every 454.8 days!\u00A0 This means you must change the cycler orbit constantly back and forth to pass close to Duna each time. This could be done using flybys of Duna, but I don\u0027t have a tool to calculate how to set this up yet. I need something that handles multi-orbit, symmetric double flybys.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn Kerbin time this cycler started Y1 d67.68, flew by Duna Y1 d104.3, 1st Kerbin flyby Y2 d2.8, 2nd Kerbin flyby Y2 d158.4.

My guess is that a z-axis only perturbation from Duna will not change the period of the Solar orbit, which is the desired result. I\u0027m going to try it. The trick is that the ship has to stay in the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit between those two Kerbin flybys so a small thrust might have to be done later to get back in that plane... although it might not if the Duna flyby is just right...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis stuff is tricky. Yesterday I tried to run the S1L1 path when starting with 50m/s more (so 1305 instead of 1255) just to see what happens. It turned out I could still find a path that repeats every 454.8 days, the biggest change was the timing of the 1st Kerbin flyby- instead of 301.25 days it was 299.25 days, but the second leg could be made 2 days longer (so 155.5 days instead of 153.5) by flying by Kerbin a little closer. In other words if one of the two \u0027legs\u0027 of the trip is made longer by adding energy, the other one can be made shorter to compensate just by adjusting the Kerbin flybys. It makes me wonder why the discoverers chose the timing for the 1st flyby that they did- my guess is that they chose it so that the two Earth flybys happen at exactly the same altitude, or maybe it\u0027s the minimum energy that works. More experiments!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could figure it out much faster with the right tools.

Holy crap! The even bigger problem is that there can be more than 1 solution for getting from here to there in a set time when multiple orbits are allowed, so how does a program pick the best one, or how do you display all the possibilities in the output?

There are two problems I see with that though, the smaller one is that in the real world Mars will always have some influence, and even in KSP you have to stay pretty far away from Duna to keep out of it\u0027s SOI, and by keeping far away from the destination planet you require a very long ride in your shuttle (depending on how much dV you\u0027re willing to have the shuttle use to get from the cycler to Duna). The bigger problem is that Duna\u0027s orbit isn\u0027t circular so the actual synodic period between it and Kerbin varies from cycle to cycle- in my 2nd test run above the cycler\u0027s closest possible pass to Duna to keep it on the right schedule was nearly 2 million km, because Duna was near its perihelion and moving faster than average. (And it\u0027s even worse in the RSS.) To me that leads to shuttle rides so long you might as well skip the cycler altogether. In practice the cycler will have to vary from the ideal path and the cheapest way to do that is use Mars to move it.

I took a look for paths using Flyby FInder and couldn\u0027t find any acceptable ones. My first suggestion would be to capture the cycler at Jool for free using Tylo, then kick it back to Kerbin for free when your mission is done. If you could do a flyby of Kerbin that goes back to Jool in 1212 days (so 2 solar orbits later, a reasonable near-Hohmann orbit between Kerbin and Jool can have a period of 606 days) without slowing at Kerbin you would have a cycler that goes K-J-K-J-etc. for almost nothing. 606 days is 5.7 Kerbin orbits though so you would only encounter Kerbin once in those 1212 days.

This would probably not be a worthwhile method for Duna, since the crew would spend so long out of the main cycler vehicle that it would defeat much of its purpose. But since the Jool transfer is so much longer it\u0027s most likely far more efficient on resources. Additionally, the nature of the Jool 500 challenge means that, if I do decide to use this method, I\u0027ll already have the infrastructure to transfer crew around in the Jool system, as well as\u00A0to refuel the cycler from the Jool system for whenever it does need to make course corrections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, to do this I\u0027ll need a cycler which goes above Jool\u0027s orbit and below Kerbin\u0027s orbit, so that I can get the desired bidirectional transfer, but that should be possible. I just have to hope that other planets don\u0027t get in the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T18:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made another try at an S1L1 cycler, this time using a big carrier and launching crew from Kerbin and landing them at Duna to see how those procedures would go.\u00A0 I also flew above Duna instead of beside it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eNnlj/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConclusions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-It takes about 2400m/s to get from LKO to a rendezvous with the cycler as it flies by Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-It takes about 200m/s to get from the cycler to Duna\u0027s atmosphere if a 20-hour transfer time is allowed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-With my skill at its current level the cycler uses a couple hundred m/s per one complete cycle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Flying more above Duna than to its side allows a reduced flyby effect on the cycler path, and only needs a few m/s of z-axis corrections later.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is rather difficult (for me anyway) to plan the next cycle because I would need to see the 2nd-from-now Duna flyby before the next Duna flyby occurs, and the game can\u0027t reasonably be used to plot that many flybys ahead. As a result I need a lot of course corrections. Therefore I need a tool that plans this like Flyby Finder does.\u00A0 I shall be messing around with that for a while.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other option for people trying this would be to accept some very distant Duna flybys, where you never get closer than a million km or two to Duna. It is easy to keep coming back to Kerbin every cycle, the hard part is the Duna encounter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u0027ll note that the ships that get from Kerbin or Duna\u0027s surface to the cycler have to have more than enough dV to get straight to Duna (or back to Kerbin) on their own, so the only reason to do all this is to have the gravity and habitable volume of the cycler during the interplanetary transfers. And the cycler is only in use for about 10% of the time. It seems a lot of trouble for what you get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T04:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222539497\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138113\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461615054\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104158\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PLAD\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/25/2016 at 3:10 PM, PLAD said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cycler is a craft that repeatedly passes between two or more planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOuch!
