And it\u0027s actually the *first* time I\u0027ve ever came back to Kerbin from another planet\u0027s sphere of influence (let alone two planets and four moons). The idea of the mission was to investigate strange anomalies on Vall which turned out to be way more mysterious than the Kerbals ever thought. For this mission \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E decided to refit an already proven \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with refueling capabilities so that it could complete the journey and come back.
