You can also call me Jeb.\u00A0Anyways, some rocket scientist from the second floor (\u003Cs\u003EVerner\u003C/s\u003E? \u003Cs\u003EWherner\u003C/s\u003E? \u003Cs\u003EWerner\u003C/s\u003E? Wernher? Something like that) came yelling down the stairs that he had found it. Whatever he found, Gene seemed pretty excited about, which let me off the hook for my latest tower buzz at nearly Mach 1. Gene\u0027s also called a meeting of all the pilots, plus a couple of the board members, scientists, and some engineers. The meeting\u0027s tomorrow, so that gives me some time to speculate. The last time Gene called a general meeting of all the pilots was when they discovered some moon around Jool (\u003Cs\u003EPob\u003C/s\u003E? \u003Cs\u003EBlob\u003C/s\u003E? Bop? yeah that\u0027s it!), so we know its going to be something big. Anyways, I personally think they might have found another moon or maybe another planet (which would be awesome!) to tell us about, or\u00A0to remind us why the rocket division is still experimental, which is a much more somber thought. Last time we had a reminder meeting, the news was that a close friend of mine, Jackson Kerman, had been killed when his experimental rocket afterburner exploded in-flight and he wasn\u0027t able to eject. I hope its not another of those meetings. I need to get some sleep, maybe chat with Bill, Bob, and Val tomorrow.

This is big. And by big, I mean BIIIG! Even Bob, the normally stoic engineer, is actually excited about this! So the scientist guy I mentioned yesterday, Wernher Von Kerman? He discovered a way to control gunpowder, which means when its funneled through an engine, WE HAVE FIRE \u003Cs\u003EAND FLAMES\u003C/s\u003E!!! Which means that our rocket division may get off the ground, if you\u0027ll forgive the pun. That means that Val and I get to start training while the engine is run through its paces. We have exactly 126\u00A0days to launch day, which is gonna be the first day of the new year, probably by no coincidence. I guess by launch on Y1, D001 they\u0027re trying to both literally and figuratively turn over a new leaf. AnyJWKkdfhoiwFKJ WHAT WAS THAT!!!! I just looked out my window and saw... I don\u0027t even know! Wait... of course! That was the first engine te... (*faint explosion*) oh. Well, it lasted for a while before it exploded. I guess that\u0027s why they test these things on the ground first. I hope they get that figured out fast. Anyways, I\u0027ll also be starting\u00A0new Journals (Journal J10 and J11) to log the missions and my downtime. I think Bob and Bill should fill in when I\u0027m not at HQ. I\u0027m trying to remember what the engine was called... the \u0022Flee\u0022 maybe? \u003Cem\u003E*offscreen facepalm*\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENope. It\u0027s the Flea, not the Flee, you dingus! Bob, out!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Thanks, I guess.\u00A0That makes more sense. Anyways, the mission plan is to stick one of the pilots in a little can on top of the booster with a parachute. I think Scott or Jim might fly first, maybe Val. Not me, that\u0027s for sure. I fly experimental JETS, not dangerous rockets. The mission has been named Arc 1, I think due to the shape of its launch curve. Not 100% sure, but I think we should be getting a crew announcement around D400, which means that the (lucky?) Kerbal chosen gets just 26 days to prepare for launch. If Jeff is chosen for some reason, it might take them all 26 days to stuff him in there because he\u0027s so fat... that was mean. But true. Anyways, I\u0027ll be back in 99 days to log the choosing ceremony.

Bill Kerman here. We here at the Engineering Department have been absorbing the kilobytes of data \u003Cem\u003E(Bob Here! All Those bits, bytes and kilos have been a gracious gift from the science department!\u003C/em\u003E) from a total of just under 14 seconds of flight; the full 8.8 seconds of Valentina\u2019s launch, and 5.1 seconds from Jim\u2019s. We also tracked down the problem from Jim\u2019s flight to an issue in the engine bell that was caused by an improperly insulated wire, which melted in the heat of the launch. We\u2019ve also been adding the data returned from the flight to the Hammer, and we should be able to get about 24 seconds of flight from the Hammer. They\u2019ve also announced a third Hammer Hop (Arc 5) due to launch on the NEW PAD 1B!!! AHHH SO EXCITED!! *ahem* The new Hammer booster will use a better fuel (Ammonium Peklorate Komposite Propellant), called APKP, or more commonly known as just SolidFuel. \u00A0Other than that, I could go ranting on about the stuff we collected from the flights for a couple of hours, but I won\u2019t make you all listen to that. It\u2019s pretty long and kinda boring to anyone outside the engineering building. Anyway\u2026 there are also rumors of some new kind of engine, called the \u201CEX-L1 Swivel\u201D that\u2019s in development for the flights after the Hammer Hops. Not sure what it is, as those of us who just got transferred over to the division don\u2019t have high enough clearance yet, but it\u2019s supposed to be kinda big compared to the Flea and the Hammer. It is rumored to be some kinda liquid fueled rocket engine, but we haven\u2019t seen anything with liquid fuel yet, and the first three tests of a liquid fuelled booster have ended in catastrophe, with all three exploding (the last one was particularly spectacular). If they ever can get it to work, at least two of the pilots have said they\u2019ll eat their own helmets. Not sure if they\u2019ll actually do that, but it would be funny. I\u2019m also sure that Jeb would document it either way. Actually, thinking back on it, Jeb might have been one of the guys who said he would eat his helmet\u2026 nah. He\u2019s not that cra-- never mind\u2026 pretty sure I just heard him buzzing the R\u0026amp;D buildings. He\u2019s about to get so chewed out! Man\u2026 Gene is going to be so ticked off. I also have some confidential information that \u201Caccidentally\u201D got leaked (and by leaked, I mean placed on my desk)!! It\u2019s gonna be Jeb with the first Hammer Hop, Scott\u2019s got the second one, and some new kid named Keryan will be flying the third. He\u2019ll be so excited when he hears that he\u2019s gotten a flight, but I think he\u2019s only got about 15 flight hours... should be interesting! I haven\u2019t seen him fly yet, but some of the scientist guys are saying that he\u2019s almost as good as Jeb, but not even anywhere close to as reckless. Not sure if that\u2019s a good thing or not, but either way it\u2019ll be interesting. I really can\u2019t wait to see the new pad though. It should be great! Man, I gotta stop rambling on like this.

The next leak was far greater in order of magnitude! Remember that EX-L1 Swivel engine Bill was talking about? Turns out they\u2019ve also prepared a radially-attached decoupler (similar to the horizontal one we\u2019re using for the Hammer Hops due to the higher altitude) to attach either a Flea or a Hammer to it and make it go even higher. If that works\u2026 well, I\u2019m already eating my helmet if it does start working before my flight. They\u2019ve set a tentative date, D140, but more likely than not it will end up being about D120 at the earliest or D190 at the latest. Anyway, the plan is for that mission to go suborbital, just barely poking out of Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere. There are currently plans for 3 of these missions before we hit the Merkury phase; moar boosters, moar struts, moar thrust, and (maybe) moar Kerbals per flight, but that isn\u2019t too likely with the cost of developing a new capsule, although if that is the case, then I want to fly with Valentina. Hopefully she doesn\u2019t catch wind of this, but I think she\u2019s really cute, not to mention she\u2019s smart, pretty funny, and isn\u2019t afraid of taking risks.

I\u2019m not that good, but if someone would like to turn this into a comic, just message me the word and I\u2019ll give it the go for launch! In addition,, I\u2019m slowly adding more stats, so be prepared! There are six months in the Kerbal world, each with 71 days. The months are named after the other six planets of the Kerbol system and in this order: Moho, Eve, Duna, Dres, Jool, Eeloo. Simple enough! It also wont say the year; it\u2019ll just say (Year) (Month) (Day). Now, on with the story!\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u2019s been close to a month since we actually had anything leave the pads, but it\u2019s time. The R\u0026amp;D folks, led by Bob, have developed something they\u2019re calling a probe core-- it allows us to control the rocket without a Kerbal. We\u2019re testing it out on the first Hammer booster, so we\u2019ll see how it goes. It launches in a little under 30 seconds, so we\u2019ll see how it goes. *glances at Valentina* Val and I\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve gotten closer since I last did a journal entry, and I think soon I\u2019ll be able to tell her how I feel. Honestly\u2026 I\u2019m nervous and excited\u2026 but we\u2019re about to launch. *shifts attention* *checks watch* Alright\u2026 10 seconds. 5\u2026 4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026 *flames begin belching from the bottom of the rocket as it rises* woah. Look at it fly\u2026 is it supposed to be tipping like that? *glances at Gene* Gene: No\u2026 something\u2019s wrong\u2026 Jim: that\u2019s exactly what happened before-- *rocket explodes* crap. That\u2019s not good. No kidding, Sherlock\u2026 We gotta figure out what went wrong, and fast. We got 15 days, people! Grab as many engineers and scientists as we got, and let\u2019s get out to the debris field! That sound good, Gene? That, my boy, is exactly why I wanted you in this space program\u2026 You can take control of any situation, no matter how bad it is.

Gene has had us working around the klock, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve slept at all. Gene put me in charge of the disaster committee, and we think we\u2019ve got the issue nailed down. Or should I say\u2026 bolted? The problem was discovered to be that one of the two accelerometers that we had installed on opposite sides was\u2026 installed upside down. That small mistake crippled the mission, as the probe thought one side was going up, and the other down. It caused the probe to flip out and break apart under the g forces. *yawns again* man\u2026 on the other hand, the center has its End of Month awards getting ready to occur in about 15 minutes, so I\u2019ll probably log that. The first true month that we\u2019ve existed is big, so the awards competition is fierce, but I\u2019m excited to hear if any of my friends got anything. The big one people are looking forward to is the Pilot of the Month award, as it seems to be down to Val and Jim. Should be cool. *hops up from Mission Control console, and begins to walk towards the Administration building* Let\u2019s see what the awards are this month\u2026 Scientist of the Month? Huh\u2026 Blooper of the Month is definitely going to whoever installed the accelerometers\u2026 Engineer of the Month is definitely going to Bill as he\u2019s done the most work\u2026 Pilot of the Month\u2026 hmm?
