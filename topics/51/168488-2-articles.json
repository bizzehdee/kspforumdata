Bill just kept saying yes. We had a minute of celebration, and then we started to ready the ship for long-term habitation.

The days passed slowly. Preforming science experiments and testing out the vehicle\u0027s capabilities. Space walks were taken every two days to check up on how Neptune held up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were multiple engine test fires to certify that the Neptune\u0027s primary monopropellant motors did not clog up and explode. That was one of the primary worries with the new monopropellant engines designed for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally relented to Bill\u0027s constant pestering to lower the orbit down to 100 km so that communication could be re-opened. I liked the freedom of making decisions out in the cosmic void, even if they weren\u0027t overly important.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of fifteen days, the radio crackled for the last time, \u0022This is Mission Control, you have permission to return to Kerbin.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill waited patiently for my reply.

Please give us a trajectory.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio was silent for another moment, and then Gene Kerman himself said, \u0022Neptune has been experiencing some mechanical problems. Small things like delays in circuits and small cuts of information. This has been growing terribly fast. I need to say this, if you stay any longer than one more hour up there, then we can\u0027t safely say that you will return in one piece. If you don\u0027t wait for two hours for us to get a trajectory for you, then you have a risk of burning up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shoot.\u0022 I muttered. The decisions really do come down to me.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went the option that my gut agreed with, \u0022We\u0027ll wait for an hour for a quick trajectory to follow. Is that possible?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. Very much possible.\u0022 The radio cut out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill hit himself hard in the head, \u0022Idiot. Why didn\u0027t I tell them about the throttle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe throttle could now only go max or go out. There was no regulating it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It isn\u0027t a big problem.

I escaped his grasp and dropped into the water. It swallowed me and it did the body of Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI let myself sink for a couple meters, hovering in the void. The water was cold on my skin and burned my eyes. The sea was black as the Kraken\u0027s maw. In fact it became the Kraken\u0027s mouth for a second. I saw an eye of fire racing towards me. It was fate. I let myself limp. Then a strong arm grabbed me and pulled me from the waters onto a life-raft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Bill, sitting there smiling.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bill!\u0022 I cried. I tried to move to the other side of the raft, but it kept expanding further and further. It started to turn a metal grey, then I realized I was back on board the ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI slumped against the side of the railing. A towel hung over my shoulder and my clothes wet with the ocean.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey!\u0022 The surgeon caught up with me. He was clinching his fists in anger at me.

Please!\u0022 I sunk to the steel floor and wept. My mind whirled once more and all was black, all was silent. All was quiet and peaceful. I lingered in this unconscious state, and dreamed fantastic dreams where the Kraken caught Neptune in his mouth, and gave the pod to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI raced inside to find that Bill had shoved open the hatch and waited to embrace me. I did so. He kept saying, \u0022Its okay. Nothing bad will happen to you again. It\u0027s Okay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wept into his shoulder, \u0022I\u0027m sorry,\u00A0 I\u0027m sorry I left you to die. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry that you died because of me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy consciousness flew once more from my body and dove all around the transforming ship. Once it was a pirate ship with the name Fart of the Wind. The next it was Neptune with Bill under every hatch. Next it became my home town and I wandered in disguise all over it, seeing how it had industrialized and turned into steel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I could point at a single minute in time where I completely knew my surroundings. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roni. Its me. Gene Kerman.\u0022 I raised my face to see my director and looked a question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was helicoptered aboard. I am told you have been in serious trauma.\u0022 I stared into his face wide eyed in shock.

I winced and slapped it like a high-five. Now he winced in pain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bill didn\u0027t make it from the crash. We found his body floating a kilometer away from here and it is now on board. I have been told that if you were to see it, you might go crazy and you might not.\u0022 I turned my head to look at the fresh beard sprouting from his chin, just like Bill\u0027s. Then it was Bill returned from the grave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roni? Roni can you hear me? Roni?\u0022 I descended back into blackness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDays or weeks later I arrived at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E without much fanfare. I know because they were restraining me to lash out at GeneBury Kerman, my tormentor in the days when I learned to fly. The belittler, the mocker. My fists want to have five minutes at him to show him how a \u003Ci\u003Egirl\u003C/i\u003E can whip his *beep*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, at last I was knocked to sensefulness. Yes. I had just stolen a kar from the space center and was racing down a street when a kar hit me side on, toppling my kar. A piece of metal hit me over the head leaving a gash.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal who ran into me quickly opened his door and climbed out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you okay?\u0022 he asked. My mind couldn\u0027t place him anywhere, just that he was cute. Insanely cute. With curly black locks which covered his head and a clean shaven green face. He wore a hippy\u0027s outfit of old, and colorful rags and a pair of sunglasses with one lens missing. The left one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022 I answered simply. I managed to crawl out of the wreckage which was the remains of my kar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let me drive you to a hospital.\u0022 I nodded, and then climbed into the passengers seat next to him. Finally I was reliving the past two weeks. Not the fake past I had convinced myself existed. I had been going through trauma counseling. Everything stored in my brain from that finally clicked into place and I now banned myself from my other world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw the world clearer than ever now. I just devoured the nature views around the kar while the cute kerb beside me endlessly rambled about his job as junior technician and the spectacular 1,000 a year credits he earned. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was delivered at the hospital on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E grounds and got my wounds stitched up. During that phase I realized the severity of the trauma I had contracted from the crash. I was told to stay in a bed at the hospital and I did so. \\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene came by and I surprised him by getting out of bed, \u0022Roni, who am I this time?\u0022 he asked sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yourself, sir. I think everything up here has been fixed for the most part.\u0022 I tapped my temple twice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you sure?\u0022 He looked elated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Positive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes!\u0022 He pumped his fist, turned all the way around and sized me up again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Its about *bleep* time.\u0022 He continued, \u0022Neptune has been modified and test flown. It all checks out now. There will be a mission to Minmus Orbital Outpost in a couple of days to pick up the crew and science there. You are our last pilot on the ground so you must go. We have found a scientist who wants to come with you. Name\u0027s Assey. She\u0027s new and fresh so show her the ropes once you leave this prison.\u0022 He added a sly wink to that remark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes sir!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E5 days\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello. My name\u0027s Assey.\u0022 The scientist shook my hand then sat down on the other side of the desk Gene provided for the purpose of breaking her in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m the pilot. Roni.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was silence, then I started the conversation, \u0022I have seen your credentials. They show you have scored very high on the KAT.\u0022 Assey smiled an embarrassed smile. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good sign, \u0022But we want to know what makes you mandatory on this next Minmus mission.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was quick to answer, almost interrupting me, \u0022Kerbin\u0027s radiation belts actually reach out to Minmus. That in combination with the sun\u0027s radiation will pose a hazard to any kerbonauts we send down to the surface. I have an experiment which we can use to approximate the amount of radiation on the surface and to see if the radiation differs on any part of the surface.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe paused for a breath. I thought that was it but she continued, \u0022Also the Neptune is designed to have two Kerbals minimum on it. As I have dual science and engineering degrees, I can help with that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked about 40, probably old enough for her claims.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, these are good reasons. But something you don\u0027t know is that 3 tourists are coming on-board to see Minmus close up. We have room enough for them and for Jeb, Val, and Irfred on the way back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Neptune can hold 8?\u0022 she asked in wonder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There have been some modifications and yes. Now it can hold 8. You can go back to the simulations.\u0022 I leaned back in the chair.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Am I on the mission?\u0022 asked Assey nervously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, yes you are. Just arrive on time and the rocket will carry us to Minmus.\u0022 She got up to leave.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait for a second though. Has BillyBob talked to you about the sims?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stopped at the door, \u0022No, not yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, here is what he says about simulations. They aren\u0027t trying to simulate every situation. They are trying to give you pointers so that you can solve anything the Kraken throws your way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe nodded, \u0022You believe this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes I do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shut the door. I waited a minute then the phone rang as I was about to leave. I picked it up, \u0022This is Roni. Who is it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roni, something happened with The MOO.\u0022 I listened to the phone for a couple more seconds, then slammed it back down on the receiver. It clanged, but that noise was quickly overwhelmed by the sound of my running out the room and slamming the door. My footsteps echoed along the abandoned hallway. Underneath the noise of the footsteps was the sound of my sobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T05:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223267466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168488\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515901001\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166007\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alpha 360\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/13/2018 at 9:36 PM, Alpha 360 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wept for Bill, I wept for the family man who died, I wept for the engineer who was content with his work.

Or are you simply a greedy kerbal who cries for more?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. I did not come here for any of those reasons.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then why is your father languishing in prison broke as my body when you left it inside Neptune!?\u0022 I stared absently through Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But my father is dead.......\u0022 I murmured.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You are disgusting, Roni.
