Not only did it totally destroy the might 24-ship armada en route to Jool (and its crew of 12 expendable presses and 4 not-so-expendable scientists) but it laid utter waste to Kerbin itself. Nearly all the KSP boffins, the subcontractors, and all their accumulated knowledge was wiped out, forcing KSP literally to reinvent the wheel and every other rocket, rover, and airplane part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing really interesting happened during most of this process, just the usual flurry of suborbital hops, then several landings each on Mun and Minmus. This recovered most of the lost knowledge but there were still several thorny problems to solve, which called for more ambitious solutions. The first of these was Science Station Duna, to test out the new Mobile Lab the boffins had recently researched, for which they created the A-Series Modular And Disposable New Extraplanetary Ship System (MADNESS). This consisted of probe-controlled fuel, tug, lab, and lander modules all docked together in orbit and crewed by Jeb, Bob, and Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/12240831203_94933dbc50_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212240831203_94933dbc50_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the A-Series MADNESS was developed prior to the invention of RTGs and 2.5m probe cores, the lack of which was one of the main reasons for the mission. Anyway, with all this mass, the beast required a 20-minute burn to get off to Duna, making all involved wish they\u0027d added a 2nd tug on the back. But otherwise it performed its mission admirably, transmitting repeatedly from Duna orbit, going to Ike so Jeb could land, and then returning to Kerbin. Once home, Jeb came down in the lander but Johnden had to fly up in with a 3-man pod to recover Bob and Bill, and all remaining data stored in the lab (which wasn\u0027t much). By this time, the A-Series had made itself obsolete so the boffins brought it in for a spectacularly explosive landing, allowing a couple of surviving RCS blocks to be put in the Kerbsonian Museum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this was going on, Lengel set out with the Eve Flotilla comprised of 5 ships: his Gilly lander, an Eve-orbiting-and-returning probe, and 3 Eve probe landers. Sadly, Lengel was eaten by the Hell Kraken before he even passed Mun so Matby hurriedly launched in the reserve Gilly lander and chased after the probes. All ships arrived close together which made doing all the aerocaptures interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/12240852373_f7dcf663b5_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212240852373_f7dcf663b5_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that all worked out OK and Matby, assisted by downwards-pointed linear RCS thrusters, got safely to and from Gilly. There was then another traffic control crisis when the Eve probe, Matby, and the Duna expedition all arrived back at Kerbin more or less simultaneously, but again things worked out OK and Matby managed to beat Jeb to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd he probably wished he hadn\u0027t, because without even getting to pose for a photo op, he was crammed back in a capsule and sent off on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66049-The-Adventure-of-the-Sun-Skimmer?highlight=adventure\u002Bskimmer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESun Skimmer\u003C/a\u003E mission, which required 218 days mostly waiting for Kerbin to synch up with him for his return on fuel vapors. Jeb, Bill, and Bob, meanwhile, went on a long celebrity vacation and publicity tour. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile they were gone, the boffins rediscovered SCANsat mapping and kethane technology, and began sending probes hither and yon to FINALLY get the Kethane Travelling Circus going again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7297/12240794243_1d9f5cf6f9_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212240794243_1d9f5cf6f9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we see mapping probes at Moho, 2 at Eve, Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, and Dres (actually, that one\u0027s behind the KAC window). Also, 4 probes en route to Jool, 2 for Eeloo, and 1 more for Dres still en route. The reason for the repeat trips is that the early SCANsat models had low-resolution scanners but they earned enough science to develop the hi-res version. Of course, this happened before the early models got all the way out to Jool, but c\u0027est la vie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this brings us up to the present, the 341st Day of the 2nd Year since the Supernova of \u002723. The 3rd incarnation of the KTC is poised in Kerbin orbit, ready to establish a permanent station in Duna orbit. Plus land and return samples from Duna. There are still a few high-tech Kethane and KAS goodies to unlock, after all, and who knows what new technology might become available in the future? Best to have a wad of science in the bank come the day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/12240794473_8d208f15a4_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212240794473_8d208f15a4_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wave will consist of 7 ships (need to delete 1 redundant alarm I see). They incorporate several improvements over previous KTC ventures. To begin with, I put each ship in a different orbit so their ejection times would be more staggered, making getting the show on the road somewhat easier for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/12241575155_7605e1f4c8_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212241575155_7605e1f4c8_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/12241998744_db677c6149.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212241998744_db677c6149.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo begin with, the SCANsat and kethane functions have been put in their own probes. There\u0027s really no need to do kethane mapping in polar orbit when you\u0027re never going to get it from much off the equator. Besides, the hi-res SCANsat thingy likes 750km-ish orbits while the kethane scanner needs to be low. And the reason why the SCANsat thingy is so huge is 1) so it can do Ike as well, and 2, just to have space to mount all the parts. The boffins discovered that with 4x Gigantors, they can map at 10,000x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/12241574845_19951670ea_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212241574845_19951670ea_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s Ike Rig #2. Low and squat to be less tippy than its predecessor. Also, it carries the kethane refinery instead of having that in the mothership. While not as fuel-efficient, this really isn\u0027t a problem when operating from Ike. The center section of the ascent stage will also do most of its transfer burn and it\u0027s got plenty of fuel for the rest, so no tug needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/12241753383_1d793e714b_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212241753383_1d793e714b_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the B-Series Madness, complete with RTGs and 2.5m probe cores. The Gigantors are for transmitting in the result of an inability to return the data. Instead of a heavy Duna lander, it\u0027s got an attachment for additional station modules. This makes its transfer burn a more tolerable 5-ish minutes. The batteries on the nose are there simply to provide a flat surface to mount RCS on, and were the least useless type of dead weight I could think of. The mission is crewed by Hadfrid, Sidory, and Johnden under the command of Matby. This entire ship is intended to remain in Duna orbit as the core of a permanent science station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/12242049453_a46a8a5468_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212242049453_a46a8a5468_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna lander, weighing about 18 tons, is going out separately and unmanned, and will dock with MADNESS Duna upon arrival. It has my usual \u0022Science Pack\u0022 of 4 each Jr. Material Bays and 4x Goos, plus 1 each of all the other instruments, including the atmosphere analyzer on top. All instruments are grouped near the hatch for easy data extraction and each bay has a ladder segment for the same purpose. The lander will stay docked with the MADNESS for future use, provided another supermova doesn\u0027t happen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/12241998804_b5ea801036_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212241998804_b5ea801036_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, there\u0027s the SHEER (Somebody Has, Eventually, Essentially, to Return) MADNESS. The SHEER MADNESS differs from the regular MADNESS in trading the Hitchhiker for a small de-orbit stage, chutes, and landing legs. It\u0027s how the data from this mission is getting home. It will dock with MADNESS at Duna and then somebody will collect all the data from the lander and stash it in here, then maybe get to come home with it. I think the current ability to stash all data in capsules is unintentional and besides, I think it\u0027s more role-play to need a specialized thingy for that purpose anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it, the KTC Mk 3.

It was too late to alter the course of events so any last-minute anxieties of the boffins had to be drowned in whiskey. It had all worked before, so it should all work again. Except for 1 thing. This was the 1st time in KSP history that an entirely pressganged crew had ever been put under the command of another pressee. Always before they\u0027d all been equal galley slaves. But Matby had spent nearly all of the 3 years since the Supernova of \u002723 locked inside 1-man pods at various points between Kerbin and Kerbol, constantly absorbing both overt and subliminal brainwashing messages as well as daily doses of experimental chemicals. As such, he was as institutionalized as the KSP could make him and thus deemed fit to keep the others under control. Anyway, there was nothing to be done about it but burn for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2852/12261700255_8310c34f6b_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212261700255_8310c34f6b_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd Duna Expedition got off with a real bang provided by the kethane probe for Ike.

This cool feature of the design had been known for some time previously from launching kethane probes to other places, and had been retained for entertainment value. In fact, there is a sizeable faction of boffins who want to make this a standard feature of all rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/12262282566_bedd8d4de5_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212262282566_bedd8d4de5_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it happened, the Duna MADNESS was the last of the 7 ships to leave, burning out under full sail just because some boffins are still nostalgic for the pre-RTG days of square-rigged solar panels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/12262282426_898dc2a18a_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212262282426_898dc2a18a_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they\u0027re off!

As flotilla launches go, this one was pretty smooth and tight. While I much prefer to have flotillas of modular ships at the destination, getting them on the road is a bit of a chore which I sometimes put off until I can no longer avoid it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2835/12262282316_7b373b07cf_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212262282316_7b373b07cf_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours later, Duna MADNESS, still last in line, escaped the Kerbin system.

The 2nd Duna Expedition\u0027s 7 ships join the 7 probes already between Points A and B. In the time since the last post, the 2nd Dres probe has nearly reached its destination. And it got there just before the Duna ships reached their midcourse burns. So I was going to quickly get it orbit and then do the Duna tweaks when I had to go fight a house fire. In fact, the call came between the probe entering Dres\u0027 SOI and the capture burn. So, I quickly backed out of the game. When I got back from the fire, I decided I need to get this probe captured before I forgot about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/12262282266_aa98320805_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212262282266_aa98320805_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd having done that, I figured, WTF, I\u0027d just go ahead and fire up its kethane scanner and let that run while I cleaned up and had a late supper. I put this probe in an orbit inclined only 35^ on the theory that I\u0027d never use kethane any further than that off the equator and to make the scanning go faster. When I got back, the scanning of Dres\u0027 \u0022tropics\u0022 was done and here\u0027s the result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/12261699605_2eb2814cae_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212261699605_2eb2814cae_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the most pathetic kethane distribution I\u0027ve ever seen.

Due to having its miniscule amount of land area scattered about in tiny islands, doing kethane from polar orbit is actually necessary at Laythe; you really have to cover the entire planet to see where the land and kethane intersect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the Laythe Probe aerobraked around Jool straight into a Laythe encounter, shifted inclination between the 2 to come in under Laythe\u0027s south pole, and aerocaptured into an orbit reasonably close to the desired 260km @ 86^ orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3723/12281906816_8a9aeae276_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281906816_8a9aeae276_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the scanning began while the boffins watched their screen anxiously. Based on experience at other planets scanned so far, they knew the Supernova of \u002723 had scrambled the kethane so couldn\u0027t rely on old data. They had big plans for Laythe but couldn\u0027t work out any of the specifics until they knew what the kethane situation was now. And a few days later, they had their answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/12281366525_dc01056331_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281366525_dc01056331_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fairly representative example. As usual, most of Laythe\u0027s kethane is totally inaccessible in the deep oceans. But this time, there are actually more islands with some kethane on them. Problem is, in the majority of cases, it\u0027s only a small corner of a small island, or the entirety of an extremely tiny island. Where big islands have lots of kethane, naturally they\u0027re the most mountainous places on the planet. So the boffins scratched their chins and resolved to consider this long and hard over many drinks at a convenient time. But at the moment, they had other things to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5473/12281782024_2ac90125d6_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281782024_2ac90125d6_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was because no sooner had the Laythe Probe finished its job (and transmitted its data for 360 Science) than KethSat Vall burned through Jool\u0027s upper atmosphere while Laythe eclipsed Kerbol. It found no useful encounters directly out of aerocapture to an Ap between Vall and Tylo, but a prograde burn near Ap set up a nice Vall encounter after 1 orbit of Jool. This probe had only a kethane scanner (the radar is coming on the next probe in 90-odd days) so went into a 35^ orbit to scan the \u0022tropics\u0022. The plan for Vall is to be the fuel station for ships going to, from, and within the Jool system. Because much of Vall is greenish, the boffins hoped they\u0027d find a lot of kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7454/12281781984_b441fa8235_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281781984_b441fa8235_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were not disappointed. Vall\u0027s \u0022tropics\u0022 turned out to be full of kethane. And while none of it was on the equator, there were several fields within 5-10^ of it, at least partly on relatively level ground. So at least the Vall part of the upcoming Jool mission will be relatively straight-forward. KethSat Vall still has like 4000m/s in the tank so will shortly go scan Tylo and then maybe Bop and/or Pol if fuel permits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time Vall was scanned, the 2nd Duna Expedition was on the home stretch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7336/12281371345_60c0eff9a5_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281371345_60c0eff9a5_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, Duna MADNESS had passed the entire field while KethSat Ike, the early leader, had faded badly down to 2nd-to-last. Ike Rig #2 was still in 2nd place and the rest were still in a big mob, except KethSat Duna had dropped well behind the rest. The interval between the 1st and last ships had grown to nearly a month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7433/12281513763_d0825e8e79_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281513763_d0825e8e79_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna Madness begins its approach to aerocapture with Ike conveniently out of the way.

The A-Series MADNESS of the 1st Duna expedition, with weaker construction and a lander precariously balanced out front, had survived a similar pass so there were few worries even when the faintest hints of fireworks began to form on the extremities. Matby, having previously experienced a harsh 4000m/s aerocapture at Eve, slept through this one, while Hadfrid, Sidory, and Johnden thoroughly enjoyed the experience, or at least wanted to imitate Jeb\u0027s usual expression. I\u0027ll have to check them all for badas$ness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/12281513673_9d1d658792.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281513673_9d1d658792.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, out the other side, Duna MADNESS circularized into a 150km orbit, pretty much what I wanted from it. It joined in orbit a lo-res SCANsat that was launched in the previous window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3706/12281911246_7b2c3026dc_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281911246_7b2c3026dc_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 days later, Rig #2 arrived. Because it was going to Ike, it aerocaptured at 13km, which put it into an orbit out near Ike. One orbit of Duna later, it phased up and transferred over, where it went into a 900km parking orbit just inside Ike\u0027s SOI. There it will wait until KethSat Ike tells it where it needs to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/12281370615_690f3055fa_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281370615_690f3055fa_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few days later, it was the turn of SCANsat Advanced Duna-Ike. Being rather behind in the race, it was going relatively slowly and needed to end up in a 765km orbit so set its Pe at 13.2km. On the way in through Duna\u0027s SOI, it shifted to an 88^ inclination and came in over Duna\u0027s north pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7424/12281370665_9debe5dd98_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281370665_9debe5dd98_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna Lander arrived next. It rediscovered Aerobrake Canyon, a familiar sight to the original KTC. Aerocapture produced an orbit of about 250km, where it waited until the rest of the gang arrived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2851/12281786104_c75f23f048_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281786104_c75f23f048_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly a few hours behind the Duna Lander came SHEER MADNESS. It aerocaptured into an orbit of about 400km and also waited there. The 2 KethSats were the last to arrive. That for Ike did a maneuver similar to that of the rig, aerocapturing out to near Ike, synching up, and doing a short transfer over into a 35^ orbit. And finally KethSat Duna arrived well after the others, also going into a 35^ orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3829/12281513213_bc71d17fd4_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281513213_bc71d17fd4_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo finally, the entire 2nd Duna Expedition was in place, as shown here. Over at Ike are its KethSat and Ike Rig #2. At Duna, the big polar orbit is the hi-res SCANsat, the blue 35^ orbit is the KethSat, the small polar orbit is the old lo-res SCANsat, and around the equator from outside in you have SHEER MADNESS, the Duna Lander, and Duna MADNESS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it was time to assemble the Duna station. First, the Duna lander rendezvoused with Duna MADNESS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/12281785734_26f5f9217e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281785734_26f5f9217e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in close, the lander proper separated from its tug and both pieces docked separately to Duna MADNESS. The original plan, which I\u0027ll eventually implement, was to put them both on opposite sides of the orange tank. But at the last moment, I decided to see if I could back the lander\u0027s tug onto the MADNESS tug with their engines interlaced and pointing in opposite directions. Totally useless but interesting, so that\u0027s what I did, and it worked. But then I noticed I\u0027d put the lander out of line with the hatches on the lab and hitchhiker so I had to move it to another port. Sadly, this all happened on the dark side of Duna so the pics didn\u0027t come out well. But you can see the result in the pics below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time to bring in SHEER MADNESS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5484/12281910686_0cc093587c_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281910686_0cc093587c_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, SHEER MADNESS is in the foreground and Duna MADNESS, with the lander parts attached, in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/12281370305_aa227df412_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281370305_aa227df412_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you get when you mix Duna MADNESS with SHEER MADNESS?

Sadly, the best meaning I can come up with for that is Uselessly Time-Trashing and Excessively Redundant....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter posing it for the above pic, the sheer size of the thing really sank in, so I had to EVA a Kerbal to tour it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/12281512853_f34ffb6428_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281512853_f34ffb6428_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, Matby inspects the lander and verifies in the process that the 1st Duna Expedition had left zero Science floating around in Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there we are. There remains the scanning of Duna and Ike for kethane, mapping both in hi-res, refueling things with the Ike Rig, and landing on Duna at least once, maybe twice if the parachutes will work a 2nd time.

Realistically, finding kethane and mapping the system were the most pressing jobs but Mission Control knew there was no rush to do any of them, it being about 100 days before anything could leave Duna. Naturally, the boffins decided to do the coolest thing first and land on Duna, which was really the point of the whole show anyway. So Matby was told to pick somebody to ride down in the lander. Matby decided Johnden, having already done a quick orbital hop to retrieve Bill and Bob at the end of the 1st Duna Expedition, had more value than cherries Hadfrid and Sidory. In the weeks they\u0027d been orbiting Duna, Hadfrid had annoyed Matby most so that\u0027s who got the job and with it a trip home, where Matby hoped he\u0027d be dissected for Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further ado, Hadfrid was shoved out the hatch and had no choice but to climb into the lander.

Then the lander proper separated, moved a short distance away from the tug, and waited for a reasonably flat, Kerbol-lit patch of relatively low ground to swing into place to do the de-orbit burn.

Duna Lander 1 was refueled and Johnden and Sidory used the Duna MADNESS lab to clean out and rearm all the goos and bays. The boffins were insistent that the lander go again to gather data while flying. With Hadfrid out of the equation, Matby to choose another victim for the 2nd and rather more dangerous, trip. Would the repacked chutes open correctly this time, especially since that useless Hadfrid had repacked them? Johnden had been lording it over Sidory due to his previous experience and having actually flown with Bill and Bob, and had completely failed to get along with Hadfrid. Thus, Matby thought it would be fitting to send him on this mission and then, if he somehow survived, to have to ride home with Hadfrid.

So the boffins picked an equatorial patch with a lot in it and on reasonably flat ground, and brought Ike Rig #2 down into a 100km orbit. The chosen spot was on the side facing Duna which at the moment was eclipsing Kerbol, so they had to wait a few orbits to get it in the light, then sent down the rig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2824/12295495834_90c5b3ba1c_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212295495834_90c5b3ba1c_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt got down safely, landed smack on the kethane as expected, and promptly went to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7373/12295230843_47a548156a_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212295230843_47a548156a_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it was busy refueling itself, a junior boffin, busy making a fresh pot of coffee, thought to check his almagest for future launch windows and was shocked to discover the next Jool window was only 17 days away. He quickly brought this to the attention of his superiors, who decided they\u0027d just finish up the refueling chore and then put the 2nd Duna Expedition on the back burner while they quickly threw together something for Laythe or Vall or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as you can see, Ike Rig #2 departs from previous KTC tradition in doing its own refining instead of humping kethane to a refining mothership. Thus, it has only a small kethane tank, just enough to prime the refinery, During operation, the (small size) drills put kethane into this little tank and then the refinery kicks in, converting the kethane into LFO and mono at about the same rate it\u0027s coming in. The main advantage of this system is that the rig doesn\u0027t have to worry about running out of fuel before delivering kethane to the refining station. But OTOH, it has to move not only the drills but the refinery as well, and it doesn\u0027t deliver as much fuel at the station as if it had carried an equal mass of kethane. Also, it has a lot of mono tankage to deliver that finished product as well, for even more extra mass. On the Ike-Duna run, the resulting inefficiency won\u0027t ruin the mission so it was a good place to try this method and compare it to previous practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/12295230723_f770755e98_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212295230723_f770755e98_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, eventually Ike Rig #2 did all it could and set off for Duna. Being unmanned, this 2nd landing on Ike went unmarked. The boffins were disappointed that Jeb\u0027s flag from the 1st Duna Expedition was in a kethane-free zone because they\u0027d hoped to land beside it. Soon, it was once again alone on Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/12295638436_84e40d77ba_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212295638436_84e40d77ba_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke Rig #2 aerocaptured at 15km directly over Hadfrid\u0027s recently-planted flag. Sadly, no easy encounters with UTTER MADNESS appeared on the other side so there was nothing for it but to burn into orbit at its 250km Ap and wait to synch up. Which it did after an orbit or 2, and soon Ike Rig #2 was docked with UTTER MADNESS. The rig\u0027s center tank was empty but the 4 radial tanks were each still at 85%, so that\u0027s 3.4 out of 5 tanks still full when it arrived. Pumping fuel around to refill the center tank (to get back to Ike) and emptying the others means it actually delivered 2.4 full tanks to UTTER MADNESS, a bit less than 1/2 of its total amount of fuel. Still, this was enough to fill the empty orange tank up to 60% and change, meaning 1.33 orange tanks are now full. Given that the SHEER MADNESS only needs about 1/3 a tank to get home, this should be enough to fulfill all remaining mission requirements. If additional requirements come along later, Ike Rig #2 can go get more kethane, with the knowledge it can provide about 60% of an orange tank per trip. The boffins considered this good enough for the Ike-Duna situation but knew it wouldn\u0027t work elsewhere with tighter margins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/12295638326_53dd3b03d6_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212295638326_53dd3b03d6_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly to reduce the part count of UTTER MADNESS, the Ike rig was sent back to Ike to wait in a low orbit until needed again. And there things at Duna will sit for bit while the boffins apply the lessons learned to getting a kethane system for Vall off the ground in time for the next window. Meanwhile, Johnden is locked in the lander can, nervously contemplating his upcoming descent on repacked chutes. Will he make it?

They decided that the previous plan for Jool hadn\u0027t paid enough attention to infrastructure so decided that\u0027s what they\u0027d concentrate on this time. With the favorable kethane scan of Vall in hand, the boffins decided to build a pipeline in the sky between Vall and Laythe, to have ready for actual mission-type missions in the future. The inefficiencies accepted previously would not cut it this time, and the volume moved had to be much bigger. These objectives led to the creation of the KVETCH Series (Kethane from Vall Exported To Colony Hubs) of vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe objective of the KVETCH Series is to move a full 16,000-barrel kethane tank from Vall orbit to Laythe orbit, for refining at the destination.

Nothing much to it. It\u0027s anticipated that, being so light for the return trip to Vall, it should only need refueling there, although of course it can be refueled at Laythe if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so there\u0027s the \u0022pipeline in the sky\u0022. Now it needed the orbital refineries for Vall and Laythe to fly between. Again, these were fairly easy projects. All you need is the refining unit itself and the power to run it, and adjacent small input kethane and LFO tanks, the idea being to pump kethane in as fast as it\u0027s being used and pump finished product to where it\u0027s really need as fast as it\u0027s made. Such a thing could be a module for a station or be a small, unmanned station itself. But the things still had to get out there somehow and might need to move around within the system, so the boffins decided to make this unit self-propelled, able to use its transfer fuel tank for output. This thinking led to the development of the KVETCH-01 Orbital Refinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/12311565624_259448f2d4_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311565624_259448f2d4_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2841/12311719416_26b0c207df_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311719416_26b0c207df_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vall Flotilla has 2 of these, one for Vall and one for Laythe. The one at Vall will be a stand-alone thing, serving as a transshipment point for the kethane bound for Laythe and also refueling the KVETCH-00 Kethane Ferry. It will also refuel any ships passing through the Jool system that aren\u0027t bound for Laythe. The one at Laythe will probably end up stuck on whatever station eventually gets built there, to support the space-based side of Laythe operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow attention turned to the rather more difficult problem of getting the kethane up from Vall\u0027s surface. Nothing less than filling up the kethane ferry in 1 lift would suffice, which meant lifting rather more than 16,000 barrels of kethane, the extra going to refuel the ferry and also the inefficiency of the refining process. The boffins figured 24,000 was all they could lift at once, 50% more than the ferry can carry. They felt fairly confident this would be sufficient given the ferry wouldn\u0027t have completely empty tanks. Still, lifting 24,000 barrels of kethane is no small job, so they really had to hit the bottle, er, I mean put their thinking caps on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/12311719396_3f8bb91363_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311719396_3f8bb91363_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a look inside the boffins\u0027 lair near the end of the design process. They\u0027re using spare 3-man capsules as ballast to simulate the loaded weight of the kethane tanks, which are slightly heavier than the kethane. Even so, the beast has just barely enough delta-V to achieve Vall orbit, although rendezvousing with the Vall refinery might require the refinery coming to it or a tug to move the shuttle. Otherwise, the boffins were rather proud of it. The CoM remains in the same place regardless of fuel state so docking shouldn\u0027t be a problem, especially because the docking ports on both ends are relatively unobstructed. All while keeping the overall shape squat for stability on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFully loaded, the contraption weighs over 104 tons, 55 tons empty. Either way, it\u0027s more than conventional landing gear can support. even if they\u0027d been able to reach the ground from where they\u0027d have to be mounted. Thus, the boffins decided to try this idea they\u0027d heard of somewhere of using box girders as landing gear. Now, this thing will only land empty but the boffins still didn\u0027t trust the idea so decided to give the thing a good drop test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5482/12311130105_66f94604f2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311130105_66f94604f2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the result. The beast, with ballast attached, was dragged out to the Launchpad and dropped from the guesstimated height of 4 Kerbals. It hit the ground at 6m/s and only some of the ballast fell off, but no damage to the actual vehicle. The boffins considered this a successful result and, with a few final tweaks, approved construction of the KVETCH-02 Vall Shuttle. Now there was the job of getting it off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/12311130065_7cc3e6080e_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311130065_7cc3e6080e_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich turned out not to be that big a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/12311719046_ea1274fafa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311719046_ea1274fafa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the problem was, how to get it to Jool. This led to the creation of the KVETCH-03 Shuttle Tug, a 57-ton monstrosity itself. The 8x LVNs were there to keep the transfer burn time down as much as possible. And it could use the same launcher as the shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3693/12311129925_cea98b6a87_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311129925_cea98b6a87_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the tug was sent up to rendezvous with the shuttle.

The tug will be available to drag the shuttle to the Vall orbital refinery if need be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, how to get the shuttle loaded? The simple option would be to land the shuttle next to the Vall rig but such precision in landing is not the forte of the KTC. Therefore, the boffins decided, as their predecessors had before, to mount the drills on a rover that could drive to the landed shuttle. As long as the shuttle came down somewhere in the kethane field, all would be well. So, all they had to do was mount the drills and a refinery (to refuel the shuttle) on wheels. Of course, this would require using the KAS system to connect the 2, which is why the shuttle has the standard ports on it and ladders to reach them. But at the last moment, the boffins developed the new KAS pipe system, which hopefully will reduce the risk that was always present with the old cable mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/12311718746_e0e34689b5_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311718746_e0e34689b5_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result was the KVETCH-04 Vall Rig. It\u0027s not that heavy, even loaded, but was built big and wide for stability and to spread the weight over more wheels. Instead of winches, it has boxes full of KAS pipe parts. It also has enough engines both to land itself (on the retractable legs) and get to Vall orbit if need be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this roving drilling/refining rig needed a way to get to Jool, and it needed a Kerbal to make the pipe connections, and the Kerbal needed a place to live when not humping pipe. So the boffins combined all these needs into the KVETCH-05 Tug-Hab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/12311564844_200e4ff4e7_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311564844_200e4ff4e7_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it was assembled, a pressganged Kerbal with a modicum of mechanical aptitude was chosen essentially at random and locked into the hitchhiker can. He will be the 1st Kerbal not only on Vall but in the Jool system as a whole. He\u0027ll probably also be the last to leave, if he ever does, as his job will last as long as KSP\u0027s interest in Laythe. And he\u0027ll get no credit or glory for any of it. What was his name again? Oh yeah, Luney, appropriately enough. But hey, he\u0027s got gainful employment for life, a hitchhiker all to himself, a company car, and an important part to play in the advancement of Kerbalkind. He should be grateful he\u0027s not still living under a bridge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/12311289263_8d17490589_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212311289263_8d17490589_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, KVETCH-05 linked up with KVETCH-04. The Vall Flotilla was now all set to go with 14 days to spare. While this was less time in LKO than normally allotted for training pressganged Kerbals, the long trip to Jool would compensate. And while Luney had been kvetching all during the ascent, he settled down once in orbit and actually seemed to be enjoying himself. Or maybe that was just the indoctrination starting to take effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there we are.

The boffins, knowing it was Happy Hour at their favorite bar and in a hurry to get there, retorted that now that all the rocket parts had been researched, they no longer cared about Science. So the 2 sides clashed in a classic War of the Nerds, hacking and stabbing away with their sliderules. The scientists had numbers on their side (compare the size of the Science Center to the VAB, most of which is empty space) and eventually forced the boffins into a negotiated surrender. The boffins agreed to come up with a Vall science mission using lots of existing designs to get it done quickly.

The Mk IV here differs from the Mk II currently in use at Duna in having 48-7S engines on the tank and trading 2 small side docking ports for 2 large ones, to help eliminate the problem of hitting the wrong port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/12326873125_1e489014e4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212326873125_1e489014e4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the B-02 Tug Module Mk II.

The boffins were mystified as to the cause but the destruction did much to improve their mood. And the next time they launched the tug, it worked just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/12326873035_2e05e084fd_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212326873035_2e05e084fd_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all 3 parts rendezvoused and created the Vall MADNESS. While it had way more than enough delta-V for the job (and will refuel at Vall to test the KVETCH system anyway), the TWR would have resulted in a transfer burn over 10 minutes, which the boffins utterly refused to countenance, especially given they had all the KVETCH stuff to send out at the same time. Rather than spend the time designing a better transfer vehicle, they just sent up another tug. Which exploded in mid-air shortly after launch. Sadly, it was by now dark at KSC so while the explosion lit up the sky to the gratification of the boffins, photos of the event failed to do it justice so are omitted from this chronicle. Again, the cause was a mystery and again the next launch worked fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7393/12327319864_c152ec255c_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212327319864_c152ec255c_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the 2nd tug, the Vall MADNESS would only need a 7-minute burn. Better, but not great. The boffins also noted a loss of about 700m/s, something to think about later. But by now they\u0027d done what the scientists had demanded and Happy Hour was nearly over, so that\u0027s what it\u0027ll be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext morning, the hung-over boffins returned to work and returned their attention to Duna. It was now time to sacrifice Johnden to the repacked chutes, er, I mean make a valiant attempt to gather Science from up in Duna\u0027s atmosphere. Johnden, who\u0027d been locked in the lander can for several days now dreading the future was now just wanting to get it over with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/12326884875_92cf480ba0_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212326884875_92cf480ba0_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the lander disconnected and shoved off for its second landing on Duna. It had enough fuel to land without chutes if need be but wouldn\u0027t be able to take off again, so as a back-up plan, it was aimed at an equatorial patch of kethane. That way, in the future, it might be possible to land something else nearby to refuel the lander and salvage the data, er, I mean, rescue Johnden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2815/12327035153_9def0fa955_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212327035153_9def0fa955_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to the surprise of the boffins and the intense relief of Johnden, the chutes actually worked. The boffins attributed this to firing the chutes via the action group control the 1st time instead of staging system, and also the 2nd time. See, it wasn\u0027t until Hadfrid was making his 1st descent that the boffins realized they\u0027d attached the engine pods with radial decouplers as they\u0027d done for all previous landers, even though this particular lander wasn\u0027t going to need them. As such, the boffins had used their lock-out/tag-out system on the staging system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7442/12326884265_dcf41f21c9_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212326884265_dcf41f21c9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverybody was so wrapped up in watching the parachutes that they nearly forgot the whole purpose of this trip: getting Science while airborne.

However, the boffins were confident it could reach orbit. Worst case, the Duna Lander Tug, waiting in 50km orbit from Hadfrid\u0027s flight, could tow the lander back to UTTER MADNESS. But this contingency plan proved as unnecessary as landing on kethane and the Duna Lander made it back to dock under its own power. Johnden was ecstatic to still be alive and also not marooned on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3669/12327331084_09c4faaa22_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212327331084_09c4faaa22_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this time the lander hit the correct docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/12326883745_8530cf9bbe_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212326883745_8530cf9bbe_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Johnden also was able to extract the data from the Atmosphere Analyzer, something that had eluded Hadfrid.

The lighting on UTTER MADNESS, intended to make docking in the dark easier, provided WAY too much glare for this operation so they waited about 1/4 of an orbit to finish the job in the daylight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3672/12326883645_ae75083d8d_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212326883645_ae75083d8d_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce this task was accomplish, Johnden was locked in the SHEER MADNESS lab with Hadfrid and immediately began boasting of his superior skilz. Meanwhile, the lander was shifted down the length of UTTER MADNESS to the corresponding port on Duna MADNESS, where Matby and Sidory used their lab to rearm all the experiments. Its job is done for the time being but the scientists assure the boffins that someday they\u0027ll be able to get even more data by discovering that Duna, like Kerbin, has multiple biomes. And so it, Duna MADNESS, and the kethane operation will remain at Duna for the time being. But meanwhile, it was time to prepare SHEER MADNESS to depart. But no hurries there; still 96 days before it can leave. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, the scientists could only drool in anticipation over all the data they\u0027d soon have. If they couldn\u0027t get their hands on it yet, they could at least take inventory. They discovered that Hadfrid and Johnden between them had accumulated 34 experiments in the lab with them.

The one going long is Luney\u0027s boat, which will also have to make a major correction. And the boffins are already pointing fingers as to who is to blame for not giving the thing enough delta-V. It will probably be OK to get into Vall orbit but the expected scenario after that is for Luney\u0027s Tug/Hab module to go scrounging fuel from other ships in Vall orbit just to have enough for both parts to land safely.

I\u0027ve used Firespitter since 0.20 and the joints of the pontoon sections have always been questionable, which I\u0027ve dealt with by strutting them all together and many struts to the rest of the plane. But as noted above, this made the LOSS have 279 parts. So the boffins were determined to cut down on this and eventually came up with a breakthrough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3818/12450118043_667b4f76c1_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212450118043_667b4f76c1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from the bare minimum needed to stabilize the assembly, the number of struts has been greatly reduced. No more double row of struts along the pontoons, and likewise for the multi-part wings (geez, I miss B9). So the LOSS is down to 200 parts.

All these parts plus the stuff needed to be an SSTO and seaplane were carefully arranged using RCS Build Aid so the CoM doesn\u0027t move as fuel burns. It uses linear RCS thrusters also placed with RCS Build Aid to straddle the constant CoM without introducing undesired rotation. You can see 4 such ports on the wings just outboard of the LFO tanks. It has a small docking port on the nose for refueling and to facilitate data transfer between trips. The wheels in the floats have electric rover-type motors so the LOSS can taxi on electric power, both forwards and backwards, and there are small wheels under the lower wingtips to prevent damage during bad landings. From the LFO tanks outboard, it has a biplane configuration to keep the wingspan short using stock wing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving spent a great deal of time designing the LOSS, the boffins then worked on getting the thing first off Kerbin and then to Jool. Their initial idea was to attach a transfer tug to the nose docking port, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2808/12449962885_538d81b467_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212449962885_538d81b467_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, tests showed this wasn\u0027t a good idea. The LOSS weighs 21 tons to start with, 16 tons if it flies itself to orbit. The transfer tug was considerably more than that. And the small docking port connecting them proved too weak. In the unlikely event of the assembly surviving the transfer burn from Kerbin, it didn\u0027t do well in simulated aerobraking, and 2 such maneuvers were necessary. So this idea was scrapped and the only alternative was to attach a transfer stage on the back more rigidly, and send the whole thing up on a rocket, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/12450117373_688ec600f8_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212450117373_688ec600f8_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything from the nukes up weighs 77 tons, yet the 6-barrel asparagus lifter under it is quite capable of getting that to orbit without the transfer stage having to burn.

It could have been done with a lighter transfer stage using fewer engines but that would have meant a longer burn time and the boffins were utterly tired of 10-minute burns. If a shorter burn meant having to develop an 80-ton lifter, so be it. Luckily, that wasn\u0027t much of a chore. Anyway, the LOSS will get to Laythe, dock with the Laythe MADNESS, pic up a crewman, refuel, and head on down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings us to the Laythe MADNESS. As the twin tugs of the Vall MADNESS had demonstrated, the B-Series wasn\u0027t really optimized for trips to Jool so the boffins set about tweaking it into the C-Series. The basic mission components were fine, they just needed better ways of getting there. Relying on the KVETCH system to provide fuel for the return trip, it was possible to dispense with each component needing an orange tank. Instead, the modules used big transfer tugs with enough engines to keep the burn times low. Thus, the boffins just designed such a tug and tweaked the essential parts of the modules to incorporate lessons learned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3790/12450467904_df4883d218_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212450467904_df4883d218_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the C-Series Laythe SHEER MADNESS. It consists of the C-02 Recoverable Mobile Lab Module, which is everything from the big docking port forward. That part\u0027s the same as B-05 currently at Duna but with less-intense lighting. Below the docking port is the new C-06 Module Tug. Compared to the Duna ships, this weighs rather less due to not having to carry fuel for the return, and that combined with 8 engines makes for considerably shorter burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs at Duna, all the data gathered by the LOSS will get stored in the Mobile Lab here and returned to Kerbin.

Again, the actual station part is the same as the B-Series at Duna but with dimmer lights. It uses the same transfer tug as the Laythe SHEER MADNESS. Due to the publicity surrounding Laythe as a home away from home for Kerbalkind, the only highly trained kerbalnauts, who at great risk rediscovered most of the lost science, have come out of retirement for the trip. The plan is for each of them to do one trip down the LOSS. But 2 Kerbals must remain at Laythe manning the lab for future expansion. Right now, the idea is for Jeb and Bill, the most famous and reliable of the 3, to come home in the Laythe SHEER MADNESS, leaving Bob and Seangel at Laythe.

IOW, there was a stretch of relative downtime ahead. The boffins took advantage to amuse themselves for a few days watching totally impractical and unnecessary SSTOs crash but then decided to get down to the all the necessary chores. And so we get to a lot of unexciting but sadly necessary probe housekeeping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start with, the boffins decided to see what more they could get out of KethSat Vall, which had completed its mission and had beaucoup delta-V left.

This was necessary to leave the place. While cheaper transfers were seemingly possible from the prograde side, \u0022simulations\u0022 showed that Vall quickly caught up and sucked the probe into lithobraking. Only by leaving with a relatively high outwards velocity could the probe escape Vall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/12533477275_e48b0d1dc2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212533477275_e48b0d1dc2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with this seemingly inefficient but actually survivable trajectory, the probe safely got to Tylo and set to work scanning its tropics for kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/12533477165_b0695920cd_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212533477165_b0695920cd_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis scan was quickly accomplished and proved interesting. All the tropical kethane was on the leading side of tide-locked Tylo, with nothing on the trailing side. This led the scientists to theorize that Tylo\u0027s orbit contains free kethane leaking from something else, perhaps green Vall from tidal heating, which is then swept up by Tylo. In any case, there turned out to be a couple of equator-straddling fields, which will perhaps someday be useful for landing on this sinkhole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith nothing else particularly pressing on the agenda, the boffins then sent the probe to Pol. They really didn\u0027t want to skip Bop but did so for 3 reasons. First, the probe had to leave on the retrograde side of Tylo only worse than Vall, with escape putting it out slightly beyond Pol\u0027s orbit anyway. Second, Pol required less of a plane change so it was thought better to only have to do the big plane change for Bop once. And finally, there was a legend around KSC that Pol was perhaps the spawn of Daemon Sultan Azathoth, which had to be investigated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://v4s.yimg.com/sj/2887/12533965844_bcbac80949.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212533965844_bcbac80949.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo KethSat Vall eventually arrived at Pol, which gave no immediate signs of being the spawn of Azathoth.

A tweak between Jool and Laythe to come in under Laythe\u0027s south pole, then aerocapture at 26km, resulted in a 900km-ish Ap, which the probe quickly adjusted into a 757km mapping orbit. Laythe had already been scanned for kethane, biomes, and low-res altimetry so all this probe had to do was the hi-res. It made a pretty map which can now be compared to the kethane map to decide where to send the MIRVs of the Laythe Probe Bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere in all this jumping around from probe to probe, the Vall Flotilla\u0027s various members all made their mid-course tweaks. There is still a fair amount of concern for the KVETCH Tug\u0027/Hab and Mobile Rig combo, especially after its rather large correction burn. But it will certainly be able to capture into at least a Jool orbit and then something can go give it a boost to Vall. In any case, not a critical problem at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boffins then looked up from their work and discovered that all this mucking about with probes had used all the time before the departure date of the Duna SHEER MADNESS. Only a few hours remained before it was to shove off for home. And so the boffins fired up the communications link to Duna for the 1st time in 90-odd days, to discover about 500 unread messages from the Kerbals there. Given that all these messages were complaints and whines, and because they couldn\u0027t do anything about them even if they had cared, the boffins promptly deleted them all without bothering to read any. Instead, they issued orders and ran diagnostics to make sure the Duna SHEER MADNESS was ready to depart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/12533978234_63eab5964d_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212533978234_63eab5964d_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boffins were glad to see that neither Hadfrid nor Johnden had escaped and that all 34 experiments were still in storage. Also, none of the fuel had leaked out; the ship still had about 1/2 tank, way more than enough to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/12533608133_acff0d34a1_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212533608133_acff0d34a1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so there was nothing left to do but wait until the planets aligned properly and the Duna SHEER MADNESS came to the right place in its orbit, then burn for home. The scientists could barely restrain themselves at the thought of all the data now heading their way, even it would still be weeks before it arrived. And then, of course, it had to land safely.

As KSP is about exploration and colonization, I think this era is the best analog available. All the great voyages of discovery, all the expeditions of conquest and colonization, all the empire-defining naval battles of the era, were done by a horde of faceless, expendable sailors. In those days, no ship left port without expecting to lose anywhere from 25-75% of its crew along the way to work hazards, disease, starvation, enemy action, and desertion, over the course of a multi-year voyage. And there was a rather sobering 5-10% chance that the ship itself would be lost to the perils of the sea. The admirals and generals got peerages, the empires they served got the goods, and the sailors got worked to death while being fed the bare minimum of the cheapest, nastiest food possible to keep them alive just long enough to accomplish their mission. But hey, these sailors were considered the dregs of society so this was fitting treatment for them, and better such scumbags be shipped off around the world where they\u0027d probably die than stay at home doing crime.

But what did Duna need? A better kethane infrastructure for Ike? Additional station modules for Duna MADNESS? Or a permanent colony on the surface? After much debate, the boffins decided on the latter, as a way of creating a base for future exploration. They\u0027d heard dim legends that their predecessors, back in the original KTC before the Supernova of \u002722, had had an airplane flying around on Duna and they thought it would be cool to do that, too, eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first, a base to support it. This would definitely have to be on a kethane field so the 1st thing was to design a kethane system. Because this kethane would be for use on Duna, the whole system could be put on a single vehicle without any need to get back to orbit. So the boffins did some tinkering and eventually came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3818/12575123933_3a0770866b_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212575123933_3a0770866b_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the SKRAP-01 (System for Kethane Recovery At Planets) Duna Rig. It has 2 small drills and a small refinery, and not much else because it\u0027s intended to run only when a customer is attached. To this end, it carries a couple boxes of KAS pipe parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new feature of this design is the kethane-burning generator, which will power the whole system by burning a little of the kethane that\u0027s coming in. This is a new toy researched with the Science! accumulated by the various SCANsat probes. It\u0027s way lighter than using several Gigantor solar panels. The small solar panels are needed to power 1 drill just long enough to get some kethane in the input tank, after which the generator will take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the idea is for the Duna Rig to land somewhere and customers come to it. The KAS system needs a Kerbal to make the connections and the Kerbal has to live somewhere, which will probably end up being several miles from the rig. Thus, the Kerbal needs a vehicle to get from his house to his workplace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7348/12575023785_04f73f601d_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212575023785_04f73f601d_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is that vehicle, the SKRAP-02 Duna Utility Rover. It\u0027s just a simple chassis with 2 lawn chairs and 2 boxes of KAS pipe parts and ground pylons. It will land with the 1st skycrane system ever used by the KTC. All previous landers had their engines permanently attached. Anyway, the thing is so light that it could use an LV-T30 for the transfer engine in furtherance of the boffins\u0027 goal of minimizing burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, of course, the Kerbal needed a place to live. But not just 1 Kerbal. Oh no, far from that. See, the know-nothing politicians, easily swayed by mindless clamoring of the know-less-than-nothing masses, who had been led astray by starry-eyed visionaries unable to visualize the realities of space travel, demanded a full-blown colony. On Duna, of all places. Just to occasionally pump gas. Oh well, the political masters had spoken so the boffins had to obey. So they argued a bit as to how many Kerbals constituted a colony and eventually decided that 8 with room for 16 would satisfy the pols for the time being. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boffins then set to work designing the necessary hardware. Somebody suggested they land a bunch of modules separately and dock them together on the ground, or just leave them separate in a nascent form of urban sprawl. However, neither idea looked good either on paper or in practice so eventually they decided to launch the whole colony base in 1 piece, and came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3829/12575023695_893bd4032f_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212575023695_893bd4032f_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis the GUNK-01 Duna Colony. The basic vehicle can be tweaked to work on any planet and will no doubt soon be adapted for Laythe. It\u0027s just 4 Hitchhikers radially mounted to a central rocket. It contains 8 Kerbals led by the intimidating Jengas \u0022Khan\u0022 Kerman, who has vowed to conquer Duna or die trying. He previously ran the Kali Kokaine Kartel before his inkarceration. His understudy is Gregnard \u0022Grognard\u0022 Kerman, a 20-year veteran guard at Kerbal State Prison recently implicated in trafficking kontraband into the penitentiary in the pay of Jengas. Then there\u0027s Camming \u0022Camshaft\u0022 Kerman, the appropriately named engineer, who is the actual gas station attendant and only essential Kerbal in the krewe, doing hard time for a DWI vehicular kerbalslaughter. And Ribdun \u0022YO, Yer Ribs Are Done\u0022 Kerman, the cook, and his lazy assistant Lofen \u0022the Loafer\u0022 Kerman. The colony is rounded out by pressganged vagrants Thomlong, Gusger, and Wehrbald.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that this thing will plunk down somewhere in the general vicinity of Duna Rig 1 and accomplish nothing unless and until the KTC sends something there in need of fuel. In the meantime, the colonists can stare at the walls of their cans or go outside to stare at the endless, useless, uninhabitable sand of Duna. Meanwhile, the pols will be happy and hopefully stop interfering with boffin business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA window for Eeloo was also coming up so the boffins decided to send something there, too, while they were in a designing mood. There are no plans currently for anything major at Eeloo but someday it will need a kethane system so they might as well get that going. So they came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/12575492874_6b04329772_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212575492874_6b04329772_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the SKRAP-03 Eeloo System. It\u0027s like a cross between the rigs at Duna and Ike, in that it lifts the refinery and drills to move product (like at Ike) and runs on a kethane-burning generator (like at Duna). It has 1 of each size docking port so no matter what the boffins send to Eeloo in the future, this should do the trick. Inefficient, but tolerably so. The monstrous tanks needed to move product provide so much delta-V that the beast doesn\u0027t need a transfer stage (hopefully). However, that will be cutting it close. Also, it has a glacial acceleration around Kerbin so several senior boffins expect to retire before its transfer burn is complete. But this was acceptable because it\u0027ll be going out alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/12575142223_1f631eff02_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212575142223_1f631eff02_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven its great weight loaded, the SKRAP-03 uses I-beams for landing gear, somewhat like the KVETCH-03 Vall Kethane Shuttle. So the boffins gave it a nice fully loaded drop test before approving production. It survived an 8m/s impact with no damage so is considered good enough to land with mostly empty tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7424/12575123343_5bda0ac8aa_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212575123343_5bda0ac8aa_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this made for a crowed LKO.

However, as it turned out, Mun was fouling the range come the day of departure, causing the 1st few ships to have fly-by encounters. While this didn\u0027t mess up their trajectories, dealing with all the SOI changes totally hosed the carefully arranged burn schedule.

This one is all about probes, Duna in the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, last time the Duna SHEER MADNESS was homeward bound and 40 days out from Kerbin\u0027s SOI, so it was a good time to do some boring probe chores. KethSat Vall had just moved from Tylo to Pol so set to work there. During the 8 days it took to scan the tropics for kethane, the moon gave no sign of Azathothian tendencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/12699857544_a6e9e23795_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212699857544_a6e9e23795_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the probe moved to Bop.

Also, all this time the boffin\u0027s had been noticing a lack of bandwidth when trying to communicate with active missions. While they liked having space full of ships as a monument to their work, they decided all the probes that had outlived their usefulness had to go to clear up communications with more important stuff. Thus, it was decided to deorbit a scad of probes, beginning by sending KethSat Ike down to try to catch a glimpse of the white spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/12699374935_2d4b8dd5ac_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212699374935_2d4b8dd5ac_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the probe saw nothing strange on the way down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the Great Probe Massacre began.
