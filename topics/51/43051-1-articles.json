As I had no intention of making major modifications to my fleet designs to accommodate the plugin, the remaining option was to modify the plugin. A few launches later, I had my answer: MJ likes to oscillate. At staging, it would continue it\u0027s oscillation between separation and ignition, causing a strike with the falling tanks. Setting the separation delay settings to zero corrected the issue, however the oscillation issue would rear its ugly head later on in testing. Aside from that, MJ was able to figure out staging times and priorities without difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf note was how quickly MJ began the lateral translation, almost half the altitude I typically use. Upon seeing this, I though \u0027man, I\u0027m screwed, this thing is gonna have so much fuel left\u0027. Incredibly, my much less aggressive launch profile produced almost the same efficiency to 100km: 2070dV remaining to MechJeb\u0027s 2156. The human gets an efficiency rating of 96% versus the machine, and with none of that oscillatory wall-to-wall crap. And before you ask, orbital declination \u0026lt; 0.1 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinner: TIE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EROUND TWO: RENDEZVOUS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetup consisted of two identical iterations of the testing platform, both in identical 100k orbits and slight declination difference, at approximately 90 degrees phase difference. Given the problem, Mechjeb chooses a high (\u0026gt;200k!) orbit to match phase. While I understand that it is possible to set one\u0027s own orbit to match phase, I cannot comprehend why it would by default burn so much delta-v. The amount of time saved doesn\u0027t justify the use of consumables. After arriving near the target, MJ reduced relative to 0 and then approach the target via main engine, albeit slowly and wobbly. Disconcerting, however unimportant in the final scheme. I would like to see an option to use RCS at this point but hey, it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinner: MECHJEB (just remember to set your own orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EROUND THREE: DOCKING\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat began as a minor annoyance has become a killer. The oscillation with RCS at this point becomes incredible. While the docking was successful, it was a long and tedious process, regardless of how I adjusted the maximum speed allowed. It would have been downright graceful had my poor ships not been shaking like an epileptic watching anime. Small though it was, I was just waiting for those solar panels to get thrown off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinner: JEBEDIAH KERMAN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EROUND FOUR: LANDING\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossibly MJs best event, a precision atmospheric landing. This is difficult to eyeball properly but with some practice can be done with a steep descent angle and some cautious RCS use.

Especially interesting was how much of my intent it was able to accomplish without me actually putting an option in anywhere. Most of the steps it took to an open-ended problem were quite sound. That being said, it suffers enormously from oscillation relating to how it \u0027looks for zero\u0027, and doesn\u0027t seem to capitalize on all resources available. At a minimum, I would hope that it would make more use of gyros for attitude control instead of wall to wall thrustering, but it seems to be able to accomplish the goal most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I do NOT recommend MechJeb for a new player. The skills that I have picked up in the last four weeks have been invaluable to understanding the game overall. While I could certainly see utilizing such a utility for mundane, repetitive tasks that I have done before, I would strongly recommend never doing anything with MechJeb that you aren\u0027t already able to accomplish with a reasonable degree of efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T02:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you share the staging?

MJ seems too anal about synching your ship\u0027s orbit up with the ideal burn time for a given launch window. Rather than be a few minutes to hours early or late for the current window (which makes no real difference at all), it prefers to wait around for months until your ship\u0027s orbit synchs up. So if you want to go in the window open today, you have to plot it yourself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELanding at a specific spot on a planet with an atmosphere. It doesn\u0027t like parachutes or seem to know how to use them, and it deliberately ditches them just before touchdown if you butt in to deploy them yourself. If you don\u0027t intervene, it will never use the parachutes even if the lander doesn\u0027t have enough TWR to land without them. And at Duna, it will NEVER actually land. It\u0027ll start to and make it look like it\u0027s lined up on the target.

This version of MJ does something I don\u0027t remember in earlier versions. That is, the MJ part itself always steals the \u0022control from here\u0022 function from the command pod. Thus, unless MJ is placed antenna-up on the side of the rocket facing your by default in the VAB, the navball will display incorrectly until you right-click the command pod and say \u0022control from here\u0022 on it. Also, MJ always thinks the antenna on its part is pointing forward. So if you place the MJ part where the antenna is NOT pointing forward, MJ will try to fly your rocket sideways and Bad Things will happen. And as mentioned above, because MJ is on the side of the rocket instead of being centered on the axis, it will line the MJ part up with the center of the target docking port, instead of aligning the centers of both ports. So it\u0027s usually always a good idea, before you do anything else, to set \u0022control from here\u0022 on some part other than MJ. But you have to do this every time you come back to that ship, like reloading a save or after flying something else for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that this version of MJ does not use the new SAS system of 0.21, which means that if your rocket is inherently wobbly (due to lack of struts, imbalanced weights, etc.) it will be rather more wobbly with MJ flying than if you were flying with SAS on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T04:23:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meltro","CreatedById":78609,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T05:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy own observations of the current 2.0.9 version of MJ:\u003Cp\u003EI find it does the following things extremely well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELaunch and ascent, whether you do it on autopilot or just have MJ project a target mark on the navball for you to follow the carefully tweaked ascent profile you\u0027ve developed.

Engine gimbals, especially on powerful engines at high thrust like during ascent, are not precision control systems. They\u0027re great for making actual turns but are total overkill, and thus induce lots of wobble, for making frequent, very minor tweaks to keep the rocket precisely on course, which is what the MJ autopilot is trying to do. If you\u0027re flying it manually, you\u0027re probably only giving it an occasional tweak when it gets reasonably far off course or, if it\u0027s nice and stable, only touching controls to make the gravity turn. Hence, you get less wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, older versions of MJ were definitely spastic with aerodynamic control surfaces (just like the old SAS, too), which could lead to RUDs. But MJ 2.0.9 is no longer spastic. And the thing about tail feathers is that they provide it a means for the nearly constant stream of very minor control inputs that the autopilot likes to give to stay exactly on the ascent path. So, give MJ some tail feathers or even RCS to play with during ascent and I bet you won\u0027t see much, if any, wobble like you do now. In 0.20, I used FAR so got in the habit of putting big tail feathers on my rockets. Even though I haven\u0027t yet installed FAR in 0.21, I still make FAR-style, non-asparagus rockets with beaucoup control surfaces. Hence, I\u0027ve never noticed any wobble with MJ on ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs far as doing orbital tweaks \u0027Just So\u0027, I can see that yes, but at this point in the game my burns are all fleshed out afterwords with lateral RCS translation.
