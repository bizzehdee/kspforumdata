So I decided to take my knowledge, scrap the station I had in orbit (essentially sacrificing multiple Kerbals to the Kraken), and start fresh with a Mun Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent my de-orbit device up, docked, and started the burn. Suddenly the whole thing jackknifes and the device explodes. Luckily, the station was de-orbited so I sat back and waiting for the crash. Now, to give you an idea of this station, I had a ring of XL solar panels at one end and somewhere towards the other was the ALCOR lander I used as a station core. The station had been modular and docked together using tricouplers to make it sturdy. So the moment arrives. The station strikes at the Power end first and everything explodes, killing 7 kerbals. The ALCOR, however, goes flying into the air and bounces not once, not twice, but THREE times and comes to a halt right side up. The lucky Kerbals on board....Jeb, Bill, and Bob. I swear, those three have the luck of the Kraken and then some.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T05:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like quite the harrowing experience indeed.
