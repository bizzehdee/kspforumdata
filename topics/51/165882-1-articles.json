It\u0027s a fairly complex design that\u0027s taken a long, long time to tweak to perfection. Imgur isn\u0027t great for long explanations, so I\u0027ll go into detail here about the technical aspects and what I\u0027ve learned from the mission.\u00A0I started out with the following parameters in mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA separate set of vacuum and atmospheric engines\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAround 100 Kerbal capacity\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTail landing\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMining/refueling capability\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLarger than normal diameter\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first four are obviously taken straight from the design of SpaceX\u0027s ITS, but the last one was a challenge. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/CommanderSpork/Sea-Kraken\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve done fuel tank clipping before\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0to get vehicles that exceed the largest stock tank size, but I had never attempted to create one that was larger across multiple stages because it\u0027s really hard to do right. I designed the upper stage/spaceship first with all the capabilities I wanted before moving onto the booster because its interstage would depend on how the ship\u00A0turned out. Since the editor only allows for a single connection between two parts, the whole stack is only connected a single 1.25m decoupler that attaches to the docking port on the aft of the ship. From there, adapters widen it out and connect to the booster. Fairings wouldn\u0027t work to cover up the interstage area, so I built up radiators and it worked surprisingly well. Compared to the spaceship, the booster is pretty simple and my only parameter was to use only Vector engines, since the ITS will use bunches of Raptor engines. I put in as many as could physically fit on the booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/8HlcII8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8HlcII8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00228HlcII8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the serious business is crammed into the end of the spaceship. The most notable pieces are the engines, and they were definitely the easiest to install, but there\u0027s also a probe core, batteries, monoprop tanks, drills, lights, and a docking port. Since it\u0027s designed the way it is, pretty much nothing can be attached to the sides, which means that real estate on the bottom of the ship is in high demand for all the miscellaneous components that it needs. There\u0027s also an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter and ore tanks jammed up somewhere inside it, but those don\u0027t need to be exposed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put the docking port in with no specific purpose in mind, but as with most ships in KSP, you end up needing one at some point. And indeed, it actually saved the first mission to Duna. I had forgotten to put an antenna of any kind on the ship before launching it to Duna unmanned, and only realized as it was on an escape trajectory. So I had two options: Abort and launch a new one with an antenna or... fire off another rocket to catch up and deliver one. Yep, I went with the second option. A satellite dish was sent after the ship and successfully attached via docking port. It was a little ridiculous to have this awkward antenna between the engines that almost scraped the ground when it landed, but it worked. Afterwards, I immediately put in the antennae it has now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rOWbZEx.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022rOWbZEx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose of you with good eyes may notice that the exit hatches are right above the solar panels. I did not catch this until I was already on Duna and had to unload 96 kerbals without breaking the panels. Sometimes you just don\u0027t figure things out until you\u0027re doing it for real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I learned is that the ore drills suck up a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of electricity. I added more batteries after the first mission, but I still needed more. In fact, the one limiting factor to how far out in the solar system the ship can go may be its capacity to generate power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have trouble with landing it because it has a tendency to bounce after touching down. When I returned from this mission, I actually went and did tests with different settings for the spring/damper to try to minimize this. It\u0027s a little stupid to plop this big ol\u0027 multi-ton spaceship down and have it bounce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sBlh0Yc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022sBlh0Yc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best part about this ship is that it is definitely capable of going pretty much anywhere since it has around 5000 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and can top that off any time it is on the ground. I got to experience the math of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E firsthand when I noticed that the first half of the ship\u0027s fuel only supplies about 1 km/s since it starts out very heavy (it\u0027s over 1 kiloton fully fueled). Aside from maneuvering issues (there\u0027s just no way to get something that heavy to turn fast), it\u0027s very easy to use and low-risk since it has the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget to not need aerocapture. Even when coming in to reenter Kerbin from an 80x80 orbit, I didn\u0027t need a heatshield and just slowed my velocity propulsively as I hit the thicker part of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s easily the most complex and complete ship I\u0027ve made, and it can stay in space indefinitely. I really look forward to sending it wherever it can go.
