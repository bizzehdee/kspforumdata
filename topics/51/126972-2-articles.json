Nearly identical to the C-1, the C-2\u0027s most obvious change was the inclusion of a hatch that could be opened while in space and safely closed again.

Slowly Thing B appeared against the inky black backdrop, looking just as strange in space as it did from the ground. Nobody quite knew what to make of the grainy, barely-visible images in the television feed, but she knew exactly what she was seeing. An equipped and fully operational space station.

Several hatches and entry ways were visible along its many sections, as well as a number of docking ports.

Agake held on to the handle on the inside of the door for dear life as the escaping gasses caused the craft to spin around, the door flopping wildly and off-balance. A few blasts from her jetpack and the chaos was over, the rotation minimized, and the C-2 hovering near the station once again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, be advised in the future we may want to depressurize the cabin before opening the hatch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s item three on the checklist.

Maybe it was that thing that flew past as the hatch exploded outwards? Who knows. She let go of the small craft and jetted around the station, taking notes as she went. Her suit warned her immediately that it was low on electric charge, having depleted the Carbon 2\u0027s meagre stores as it was charging up.

She pulled two of the omni-direction ones out by hand and tapped on them to make sure they\u0027d work. (Is that how they worked?

There\u0027s no air of any sort, and it was completely powered down when I first came aboard.

She tucked them into the pockets of her EVA suit and went back to the C-2. It was night again, and even though the station was well lit it still seemed more than a bit dark outside.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few shots from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the C-2 was backing away from this strange station.

The deployed solar arrays were for some reason not capturing the amount of solar energy that was claimed on the tin (NaN not being something the batteries knew how to store), resulting in a net power loss during the craft\u0027s safe-mode operation. Since the vehicle was soon to be met by the C-4, mission planners opted to shut down the craft\u0027s long-range communication systems and place it in a fully automated mode.

Placed into a nearly circular 71km orbit, Sieta and the C-4 were only 2 degrees or so off from the inclination of the Be-5. Unfortunately they were nearly an eighth of an orbit ahead of the satellite. So the mission planners fired the C-4\u0027s main engines to boost its apoapsis higher, which would allow the lower-orbiting (and crippled) Be-5 to catch up to her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept somebody forgot to watch the fuel gauge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151216_0023_c4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151216_0023_c4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully the mission planners had included an EVA suit for Sieta, which could be used to shove the craft into a lower orbit. But first they wanted to try to complete the mission. Around this time the Be-5 passed directly over the space center, allowing the ground controllers to reactivate it. They pulled it down to a barely-orbital 70km orbit, just skimming the edge of the upper atmosphere, in the hopes it might catch up to the C-4 and deorbit it before Sieta\u0027s life support situation became critical.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, three hours later and with her life support supplies running dangerously low, Sieta got to partake in the time-honored kerbal tradition of getting out and pushing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151216_0025_c4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151216_0025_c4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few pauses to reorient herself and the craft retrograde (and to stop its mad spinning), she had the periapsis back underneath 67km.

The bigger question was would it reenter before or after the last of her oxygen supplies ran out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if it did, where would she land?

Still traveling well over 1800m/s and nearly 30km up, it was really a good thing the water and oxygen supplies were running low, because there\u0027s a good chance they might have boiled off.

And still the heat and the flame continued.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst part of the whole ordeal was knowing that no one, not a single other kerbal, was aware of her situation. She had lost contact with them somewhere around 65km when the Carbon\u0027s service module was jettisoned. Even if she had an antenna she couldn\u0027t have communicated with them during the 15-minute-long plasma storm.

There were a few minutes of concern until it fully unfurled, but once that was done she knew the craft was home-free. And sure enough, with only twenty minutes of oxygen left in the tanks, the Carbon-4 dropped onto the very edge of the South Polar Ice Cap.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSieta wasted no time in getting out and planting the recovery beacon, though that had more to do with the internal temperature being something just short of boiling. She took a few samples of the ice as her still-glowing and possibly still-molten capsule sizzled its way into the frozen shelf.

Ultimately the cause would be determined to be a lack of monoprop tanks on the C-4\u0027s second stage, as needed by the LV-15 engine\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. These were present on the Be-5 launch, but were either omitted or fell off the craft during the C-4\u0027s ascent.\u00A0As a result the second stage drained off excess monoprop from the spacecraft, resulting in a critical fuel shortage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe science data returned by Sieta (including a rather harrowing upper-atmosphere EVA) partially made up for the mission losses, but without the rendezvous and docking the agency would be forced to actually run the next two Carbon missions.

Oh, right, the switch. Thomlock reached up and flipped the wake alarm switch to the off position. Wake alarm. Right. Programmed only to sound when the craft was nearing another celestial body. How long had he been in cryosleep this time? A decade? More? Who knows. He glanced at the mission clock on his board. 95 years, 134 days. So, what then, 28 years? Cryosleep?

He pulled up the predictions to see where he was going. When he was last awake\u00A0it was a near-miss with Eve. Thankfully. Having left Kerbin he knew his orbit would eventually match up again someday, provided no other body pulled him out of it. Eve was the biggest danger along with Kerbin\u0027s two moons, an encounter with any of them might condemn him to an eternity amongst the stars. (Or a quick death.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm. Kerbin then. In five days he would pass underneath the South Pole and spar with the atmosphere at some 3,500m/s, give or take. Would it be deep enough to capture? He certainly hoped so.\u00A0He could still remember the last time he saw Kerbin.

Things hadn\u0027t been going so well; that Jebediah kid couldn\u0027t have survived his crash, and they had all watched Bob\u0027s Hawk 3 explode mere meters above the launchpad. That other guy, the one they called\u00A0Bill, nobody knew what had happened to him. The Hawk 2 capsule landed safely on the beach, parachute and all, but with nary a kerbal inside. Some suggested he bailed during the launch, driven insane with fear by the roaring engines. Thomlock wondered if he\u0027d ever been in the craft in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151219_ksp0065_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151219_ksp0065_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then it was his turn. It was a bright, sunny day, not a cloud in the sky. A whole planet of blue skies. The first Hawk 3 had only made it those 2 meters before the solid rocket boosters impaled the ship, so the mission controllers had decided to name his the Hawk 3-2 instead of something logical. It must have worked, as his launch went perfectly. Perfectly straight. Perfectly upwards. Perfectly away from Kerbin and into the inky black, never to be seen again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever, except for every 32 years or so, when his path would cross that of his home\u0027s when his home was almost in the same place as him. The first two intercepts had been duds, missing the planet by enough to not come back and too much to go somewhere else. This time? This time looked promising. He would either burn up on reentry, or his 95-year-old heat shields would work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid he have heat shields? Where did he get the air he was breathing? What was he eating? Maybe it was best to just not think about such things. He decided to pop open the hatch and take a good look outside. Maybe check the heat shielding he may not have. He was happy to have all the extra handholds... at least he couldn\u0027t fall off. He hoped. Gee, wouldn\u0027t that be anticlimactic. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151219_ksp0064_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151219_ksp0064_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe crawled back in and took a good long nap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;WHIIIIR-BEEP!\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;WHIIIIR-BEEP!\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort nap, comparatively. Only five, cold, worry-filled days. The ship\u0027s computer woke him up just as they entered low Kerbin orbit. First time he\u0027d seen that since... when was it again? He glanced out at the M\u00FCn, drifting silently by the spinning capsule. He wondered if that Nelsey kid had made it back after the Hawk 4 flight;\u00A0if they had even named it Hawk 4. Or had they cancelled the program when he went sailing off into the cosmos? Fourth loss in as many flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship bucked as it bit into the thin parts of the atmosphere. The endless spin finally chose an axis, a rather\u00A0different feeling after nearly a century of the same spin. And then the craft snapped back violently as it chewed into the heavier air. 3,382m/s and accelerating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151219_ksp0094_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151219_ksp0094_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe night over Kerbin\u0027s South Pole was as dark as ever, but sunlight started to peak through the clouds\u00A0as the Hawk 3-2 burned into the sludge. Not that Thomlock could see it, all that was visible beyond his window was a bright plume of orange plasma, and that was only when the violent shaking turned his head the right way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151219_ksp0103_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151219_ksp0103_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;BEEP!-BEEP!\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm. Resource alarm. He wasn\u0027t sure what ablator was, or why it had suddenly appeared on his craft\u0027s resource list, but considering how fast the ship was burning through it he was happy to have it. Or maybe he wasn\u0027t. Maybe he wanted more. The light show outside stopped around the same time as the vibrations, and soon the parachute rattled free. Could silk even survive 95 years in a vacuum? Apparently, as after one last snap the capsule was dangling happily from the antique bed sheets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe leaned forward in his seat to get a view through the tiny window. Spinning, still. Pitch black outside except for the trace amount of twilight. He thought he was seeing the lights of a small town off to the... North? South? ...who knows which direction. Somewhere. Had anyone seen his reentry? Was there anyone left? Would he find the planet overrun by intelligent, speaking, slave-driving\u00A0cacti?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Hawk 3-2 landed with a thud. Thomlock decided to nap until morning.

Nearly a century in space had left him a bit weak, and lesser creatures might have been troubled by the sudden onrush of a full G of the old G. But not Thomlock. He jumped out of the tin can, extracted himself from his EVA suit, and took in a deep breath of the clean, non-recycled air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151219_ksp0105_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151219_ksp0105_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHome again. Finally. His instincts told him to head North, and so he made ready for the trip. Reaching inside the capsule he grabbed the survival backpack, the first aid kit, and several pocket-fulls of snacks. He wasn\u0027t sure how far those town lights were, but guessed they might be more than a few minutes walk. One last look at the ship\u0027s computer before he powered it down, smiling when he saw the mission clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220151219_ksp0107_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20151219_ksp0107_hawk3-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n95 Years, 139 Days, 27 Minutes.
