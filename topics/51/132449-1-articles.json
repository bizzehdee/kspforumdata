It all started some 135 days ago, 25 days into the save game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill and Jeb kerman parted ways as he and bob got into the M\u00FCnar lander. They said what may have been their final goodbyes and Jeb closed the hatch, leaving Bill alone. They decoupled and Bill pulled back on the joysitck just enough so that they drifted seamlessly apart, in the day of spacecraft ballet that had been going on. Jeb turned retrograde and put on full throttle, burning from 10Km to 2, right above their landing site, on the highlands. 15 minutes passed, and once again, he burned, to now a suborbital level. He postitioned the craft for the burns about to take place. At T\u002B16.30 minutes, he turned on the descent engine for the final time. Gene in the background, confirming the\u00A0numbers and positions Jeb fed him. \u002214 meters and 10.... 12 meters and 5.... 6 meters... flaring... 2 and 1 1/2... 1 meter... Contact light! We have la--\u0022 Jeb was cut off, to be told operations were nominal. several minutes later he and Bob were getting science and planting flags. Meanwhile, in orbit, Bill was plotting something... their trajectories and angles. They waited, and around came Bill, ready to dock. They got in and blasted off. It took a minute, but they docked, and headed home without a scratch. Thus concluding the first manned landing on the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tIo1KbQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tIo1KbQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is Pt. 1 of 5ish... maybe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-21T22:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2016 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AlextheBodacious\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlextheBodacious","CreatedById":139447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T06:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter 6 misisons to the M\u00FCn, it was time to set up a home. But before that, a station was to be built. And it was. First the B module was orbited. Then the A, docked, and sent M\u00FCn-ward. While heading up, the two solar arrays were launched on direct trajectories, all to a perimun of 20Km.

When the crew gets in, it lifts off with the same engines, (to avoid debris) and uses them to get just past munar orbit. the second engine kicks in and the periapsis is ~20Km. It has a full heat shield so reentry is not a problem, and it gently descends to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
