I installed the typical 100 mods, played around in a new career game but already felt a bit bored after quite some time by the need to grind money for all the missions I want to do. Naturally, I switched to a sandbox game, played around a bit and also began to build a space shuttle once more, just because it can be complicated, beautiful, overengineered and fun at the same time \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBut why building a shuttle just for the sake of building a shuttle when there is still the shuttle challenge around? I\u0027ve participated in many missions of the 5th iteration of the challenge before, so why not give it another shot in the 6th iteration. Well, the thing about the shuttle challenge is....you have to do every mission one after the other. Launch, do stuff, land, repeat. While the launch and landing can be tricky in the beginning, it becomes fairly repetitive once you\u0027ve figured out a good shuttle design and you literally start browsing the internet during the launch.\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWith this in mind, I thought myself: Nah, I\u0027m not going to do that again, I feel a bit lazy...I\u0027m going to launch once, perform every kerbin centric mission and then land again. Basically, doing all the fun stuff but less of the boring stuff \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll also aim for the \u0022commander\u0022 difficulty, just because \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese missions have the following goals:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESTS-1a: Get to orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\nSTS-1b: Deploy a 40t pre-build fuelpod in space (circular orbit, must fulfill some tight tolerances for AP and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSTS-2a\u003C/span\u003E: Deploy 3\u002B CommSats in equidistant, geostationary orbit, shuttle has to be in a 350km\u002B orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\nSTS-2b: Recover the previously deployed 40t fuel pod\u003Cbr\u003E\nSTS-3: Deploy and assemble a space telescope in a circular, inclined orbit.

For STS-1b and STS-2b, I don\u0027t allow myself to perform these in direct succession, otherwise, I could just un-dock and re-dock the fuel pod within the same 2 seconds, claiming to have performed these missions, but that\u0027s not the point of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor STS-4 and STS-4R, I will need a second shuttle but since I want to perform everything in a single launch, I allow myself to carry a second shuttle as part of my payload. At this point, I haven\u0027t decided yet if it will be a proper shuttle or just a funny little miniature version which roughly resembles a shuttle. We\u0027ll see...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost missions will be performed in or close to the highest required orbit, so somewhere around 1222km (that\u0027s roughly the required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for a dive orbit to deploy the geostationary CommSats for STS-2a).

This works well for the design I\u0027m looking for and allows me to control the orbiter in a decent way. For yaw control and stability, I\u0027ve added some spiky wings to the tail which also include some FAT aeroplane control surfaces.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYaw stability was one of my biggest concerns so far since large wing areas can easily cause some flat-spin during atmospheric flight. So far, the tail does a great job preventing this \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this point, the orbiter flights reasonable well, giving the size of the craft. Unfortunately, roll-control is mediocre at best, which makes it really difficult to fly precise maneuvers. I haven\u0027t decided yet if I want to attempt to change this or just try to aim more precisely when setting up the reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also placed quite a few \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster across the orbiter but I may have to reduce them a bit to find a balance between control and fuel usage. Right now, the 300 units of monoprop are used up within ~75 seconds of continuous firing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster.

As it turns out, reentry is a bit tricky but not for the reason I\u0027ve expected: I assumed the wings will be ripped apart very quick so I had to go for a shallow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E during reentry. As it turns out, I actually have to use the shallow angle for a different reason: the front of the \u003Cstrong\u003Eempty \u003C/strong\u003EOrbiter is too light to counteract the lift created by the wings so it tends to flip over very quick. an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E of 10\u00B0 is already enough to flip the orbiter, so I need to point pretty much straight prograde during reentry.
