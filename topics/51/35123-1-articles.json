The thing is, since I\u0027m brazilian, I\u0027ve written the entries in portuguese. I added a translator widget to the blog, though, so if you don\u0027t mind the slightly weird google translation, you can read it in your language. Worst case, you can check the pictures; there are tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve sent a few satellites, probes and a rover to the moons of Kerbin, landed on Mun and put a space station in orbit.
