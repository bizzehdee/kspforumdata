The plan was simple, exit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, get a Mun orbit, land on the Mun, plant a flag, fly back, enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and land safely. How could this possibly go wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell. try making it all the way to the Mun, which took 40 mins of reverting my flights, by the way, and then have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E bug out on me by accidentally burning too much with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E set to retrograde. So, I end up tossing, tumbling, turning, all the way down. I then land sideways, crushing half of my solar panel array into broken dreams. Then, and OH BOY then, do I fatfinger FULL THROTTLE, causing my lander to go speeding across the Mun, and then explode because duh. Also, it killed three of my kerbals. I love this game, but oh boy if this didn\u0027t make me want to die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-15T06:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/221422-heiro/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022221422\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/221422-heiro/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Heiro\u003C/a\u003E, your thread has been moved from KSP Discussion to Mission Reports. You are not an idiot, you are one of us because even with thousands of hours in the game I still kill the crew occasionally.
