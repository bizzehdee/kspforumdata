Then on my first set of missions, first I sent and deliberately crashed an \u00A0unmanned probe to Jool (Jupiter), It parachuted through the atmosphere and exploded when it reached 250 m below ground\u00A0level. Then I sent another unmanned probe to explore the unknown objects, which after launch into orbit the main liquid fuel tank failed to decouple, so I let it on its mission, dragging the tank along.\u00A0Then I left the probe and went\u00A0command other missions. When I returned, the probe was well out of the solar system in escape trajectory from the sun. So I pressed the self destruct button and ended the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext adventure was bizarre I wish I had put it on video, \u00A0but all I have is a few pictures\u00A0on my first manned mission, I sent 3 kerbals to the mun (moon). That went well, then I proceeded from the mun to Eve (Venus)\u00A0without doing any research.\u00A0I touched down hard and the main engine exploded, leaving my 3 kerbals stranded. So I sent a rescue mission using an almost identical rocket\u00A0lander. It landed 32 km away from the stranded craft. I realized it could not lift off, so itself needed rescuing. Then I sent a space plane and retrieved first the original crew, then the rescue party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent another manned mission to the red planet. engine exploded on hard touch down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis image shows the rescue craft on the red planet:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/1ob5O\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/1ob5O\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent a rescue mission and landed 1 km from the stranded craft. The other craft had brought with it 2 rovers, so I used the rovers to transfer the kerbals 1 km to the rescue craft, and one of the rovers exploded because of speeding. but the rescue was successful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal mission, I sent to moho (mercury). I landed on hilly terrain and the craft toppled over: as in the image below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/6QYPY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/6QYPY\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI attempted to recover with thrusters but the craft exploded, luckily though, the pod containing the kerbals remained intact and they survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/2aB6v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/2aB6v\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent yet another rescue mission which was also to continue the original mission. A craft with a lower center of gravity. Upon arrival, the stranded crew were in the night side of the planet, so the rescue craft had to orbit the planet for 20 days until daylight arrived on the crash site:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/lGkSN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/lGkSN\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally I landed just 100 meters from the crash site and rescued 3 kerbals. The mission now had a total of 4 kerbals in the craft. I took off and began heading for the next planet, Dres (unknown equivalent)\u00A0. This time the mission went well, after which I headed off to Eeloo (pluto), which is ongoing at the time of this post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-06T03:41:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2017 03:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by sprotz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrect image links\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-06T13:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool, and welcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/51-mission-reports/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ea sub-forum dedicated to in-game reports\u003C/a\u003E, you might want to take a look at other users\u0027, too.
