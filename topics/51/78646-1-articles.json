Spaceplanes are a lot of work compared to SSTOs, especially as you can\u0027t learn about the transition from flight to orbit and re-entry to flight until you\u0027ve spent ages getting high and fast. At least you can quicksave in atmosphere now, it used to be a real pain when you had to start each flight on the ground or in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing practice you can do what real pilots do though - circuits and bumps.
