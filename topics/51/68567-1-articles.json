Only hot and wet. And the capsule had been heavily modified to contain its own small engine powered by Professor Kerbenstein\u0027s secret \u0022Wow-Wow Juice\u0022 monopropellant. Small globes of this festoon the capsule. The green thing underneath was a lead-acid battery to power the control systems. The intricate machinery below it was a gyrostabilizer using heavy brass flywheels an all axes. This required a fair amount of electricity so in the early stages of the flight, it was kept spinning by a portable generator (burning whale oil and oxidizer), which was the brass gizmo mounted below the gyros. But once out of the atmosphere, parabolic mirrors would unfold from the capsule to run the generator on steam, thus saving on whale oil needed by the main engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of all this Wondrous Vertical Propulsion was to put a Kerbal on Mun and, if at all possible, return him alive.

All to save fuel. Soon the steam boosters were exhausted and the whale oil core took over.
