His\u00A0balled hand\u00A0struck only force field, and Cheng was sent sailing backwards into the aft of the ship by the recoil, clutching his fist in pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He is a highly illogical human,\u0022 remarked Bob Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Agreed, Bob. Whack-A-Kerbal, anyone? Or, perhaps a nice game of Chess? I\u0027ve always wanted to learn to play.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEthan here again. As you can see, Cheng\u0027s being somewhat of an idiot again. I\u0027m at a loss as to how Jeb manages to put up with him (also, yay! Apparently they can talk now).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may have noticed Jeb saying that we had to build our module in less than half an hour. Uh, it\u0027s a bit of a long story... but then again, so is everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the rest of day three nothing much else happened. I went to bed early, and thankfully nobody tried to murder me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn day four we got through two more rounds of the so-called \u0022bracket,\u0022 getting us down to four designs, with one complicated artificial gravity ring, the shuttle based design, and two very similar conventional designs. I also finally got to ride the rocket powered merry-go-fuge (or is it center-go-round?). It was fast. And I mean, crazy fast - I\u0027m told it got up to fifteen gees. I told them to turn it down a bit, as those kind of forces could kill someone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I would later regret not shutting it down right there. Just saying - you\u0027ll see in a little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn day five, the four designs had a final showdown, which started at about eight AM, after the engineers and scientists had\u00A0consumed\u00A0their fair share of coffee. The first pairing - the two similar conventional modules - was wrapped up by nine. Their final design involved three hitchhikers, a MK1-2 command pod, radially mounted static solar panels, a science section, and a small tank of liquid hydrogen just in case fuel got low. There was also four radial docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second group - complex gravity ring vs. cool looking shuttle - took a whole lot longer. Both designs, in my opinion, looked seriously awesome. Each had it\u0027s advantages and disadvantages - the ring design relied on somebody else sending up a space tug to rearrange the several segments, but offered gravity and a ton of docking ports. The shuttle design completely conformed to my initial specifications, fit in the fairing without orbital assembly required, and was overall more practical. However, it had the off center docking port, and lacked science experiments (although it had a science lab).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m ashamed to say that the battle raged on until ten PM, when both groups were so thoroughly exhausted that they both agreed to\u00A0a coin toss. The shuttle design won (Tails!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hadn\u0027t been doing that all day, though. That would have driven me crazy. I checked in every half hour or so, but most of my day was spent teaching Obbury piano, playing the piano with Evelina, texting my friends (Apparently Phillip has\u00A0a girlfriend that he just met), and playing giant floor chess with Oliver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you ask, what\u0027s giant floor chess?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, since we didn\u0027t need the rover wheels, someone\u00A0made it their pet project to make humongous chess pieces that utilized about 120 of the small rover wheels - and more batteries than I could count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it turns out, Oliver is \u003Cem\u003Ereally good\u003C/em\u003E at chess. We battled long an hard, and I was winning, but then he set me up so I accidentally stalemated him... GRR! So, technically nobody won. He won the two other games I played against him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the really interesting day was day six (out of about nine-ish, since we started at around midnight on day one), so I guess I\u0027ll start there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cu\u003EKerbin Day\u00A0Nineteen\u00A0(Earth Day Six, 12:00 PM\u00A0Ethan Central Time) - Launch Minus 11 Kerbin Days (2.75 Earth Days)\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it was about twelve noon. Life was progressing as normal, and Kerbin had begun offering the aforementioned \u0022Personal Item Transport Service,\u0022 and I had been waiting in line that day for a while. I was planning on teleporting my art supplies from Earth to Kerbin. Apparently, a lot of people had mostly the same idea (I mean, with stuff other than art supplies) and I happened to be one of the last people to get in line. I had finally gotten near the front only to have the guy in front of me argue with the Kerbal in charge for fifteen minutes about teleporting his cat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But he\u0027s so adorable!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry sir, but as I have said many times, Earth and all of the organisms on it are in\u00A0a state of temporal suspension. It is exceedingly dangerous to\u00A0teleport a\u00A0living organism from Earth while it is in a state of temporal suspension.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How dangerous?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It would almost certainly annihilate your precious Fluffy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, then unfreeze the entire system!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know what would happen if I did that? Planes would come crashing down, cars would careen off the roads, driverless, and who knows what else might happen in the five minutes it would take me to locate your Fluffy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t care! I want my Fluffy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry sir, but the temporal suspension device has a range accuracy of plus or minus one hundred kilometers. I\u0027d have to unfreeze your entire country to get your fluffy back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know what? I\u0027ll just get him back myself!\u0022 And with that, the man burst forward out of the line and leapt the counter. He charged for the teleporting machine - and before the Kerbals could stop him, he tried to mess with every single lever and button on the thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of a sudden, a large purple beam of light emerged from the machine and created a sort of oscillating rift which floated in midair for about half of a second before moving towards me\u00A0- and swallowing me whole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was abruptly silent. Silent, and - weird. Deathly silent. The only things I could hear were my heartbeat, and the blood rushing through my ears. I opened my eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was in the theater at my high school in Illinois. It was completely abandoned - and completely - I wanted to say frozen, but that wasn\u0027t the right word. There was just no temperature of any kind. At all. The theater was tinged purple, and had an eerie, haunted look to it. Nobody was there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello?\u0022 I tried to shout. No sound came out. My mouth was moving, but the sound didn\u0027t come out. I began to panic. What had happened? I must have been back on Earth! I attempted to stand up. I found it extremely difficult. The air was the consistency of Jell-O.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Um, hello? Ethan, can you hear me?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E I jumped. I mean, I didn\u0027t really, because of the whole Jell-O thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This is Obbury. It\u0027s been about an hour since you left, for me anyway.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E And hour? What? \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I realize this must be very weird to you. I need you to do something for me\u00A0- for the purpose of synchronization, start counting seconds in your head. Trust me.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E With nothing else to do, I counted the seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Good. That\u0027ll do. Now, for some explanation. The short version is that you\u0027ve been teleported to Earth. Except Earth is in a state of temporal suspension.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, get me out of here!\u0022 I thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Sorry, I can\u0027t do that right now. If I teleported you while the space around you was in temporal suspension, you\u0027d die. No easy was of putting it. In order to get you out, we have to unfreeze part of the planet. We can\u0027t do it to the whole planet or else we\u0027d crash all the planes and stuff.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what else do you expect me to do, Obbury?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Ethan, most of the Kerbals were opposed to bringing you back to Kerbin at all. The risk was too great to unfreeze the whole planet. But Evelina argued with the higher-ups for a long time, and they were able to devise a solution.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what is it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Our unfreezing device has an accuracy of plus or minus 100km, as you heard earlier. So, we need to get you to a spot on Earth where there is nothing for a hundred kilometers in each direction. You\u0027re not going to like this.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh-oh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022If you want to live, I need you to walk to the middle of the nearest ocean.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWHAAAT?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Um, also, are you able to move?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really! It\u0027s like swimming in Jell-O!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Good. So you can move. You know, frozen planets haven\u0027t been explored at all, yet. You\u0027re the first contact we\u0027ve ever had on one. So, Jeb says to be sciencey about it. Uh, I\u0027m really glad you\u0027re able to move. The freeze must not work on gases very well. Um, have you had to breathe yet?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI HAVE TO WALK TO THE MIDDLE OF \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E OCEAN?!?!?!?!? Wait, breathe? No, why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Okay, good. Hold your breath, no matter what. If you haven\u0027t suffocated yet, then your metabolism has frozen, but not your muscle movements. Hmm, the universe is strange. If you breathe out, you may end up breathing in the Jell-O air, and that will make your movements extremely sluggish.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long do I have to hold my breath for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know. How fast can you move?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stood all the way up, with great effort, and tried to walk. It was a very laborious task, but I didn\u0027t seem to get tired at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Okay, uh, about one kilometer per hour, so, uh, shoot. You\u0027re not going to like this.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022It will take you a month of walking\u00A0to get to the Atlantic ocean.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried facepalming, but it was pretty hard to move my hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Wait, wait! Never mind, actually there\u0027s this thing called \u0022Lake Superior\u0022 that you can get to in just under two weeks.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh. That\u0027s still forever! And, genius, how do you expect me to get to the middle of the lake? Is there a boat I can take or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Uh, try to move something solid.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E I tried to move the movie theater seat up. It didn\u0027t work. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Okay, so that\u0027s a no. Is there a glass of liquid somewhere?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E I walked over to a levitating Styrofoam cup of water that someone had presumably been holding when they teleported to Kerbin. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Okay, touch it and see what happens.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E I touched the water. It didn\u0027t give, similar to the solids.\u003Cem\u003E \u0022Okay, that\u0027s good! You can walk on water. So, you better start walking. First off, find an open exit to the building you are in. If you can\u0027t find an open exit, then you\u0027re doomed.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoomed how?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Time is literally not moving for you. Even if we unfreeze your solar system, an infinite amount of time will have passed for you before it happens.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOuch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022So, get right to it! Yell when you find it, I\u0027ll scan your timeline for brain activity. This is so weird!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI eventually managed to get to the end of the balcony. A stupid idea, as the door was closed. I tried it anyway. It wouldn\u0027t budge. I slowly turned my head around. The other purple tinged door on the other side of the balcony was closed. So was the door in the middle of the balcony. Drat. I looked forward and down - the two doors next to the stage were also closed. I would have to jump off of the balcony to see the other doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it turned out, you can\u0027t actually jump off of stuff while suspended in purple Jell-O. I tried and immediately froze in the air. I panicked, thinking I was stuck because I couldn\u0027t reach anything. But then I realized that you could swim through the Jell-O easily enough, and \u0022swam\u0022 to the ground. I looked behind me. The front doors - and the side doors - were closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I began to panic. Eternity stuck in a theater? Great. Just great. Wait! There were backstage doors! Yes! I slowly swam towards backstage, managing to squeeze underneath the now rock solid curtain. I looked left. Closed. I looked right. The right hand stage door was also closed. I tried to let out a yell of frustration and accidentally breathed in the textureless Jell-O. Great, now I had nothingness inside of me. I continued on behind the stage area to the set painting area - there was a piano in the room, a full grand piano, as it to taunt me. In the same direction was another closed door. I tried to sit down at the piano desk. I was going to play a song called \u0022eternity,\u0022 but I couldn\u0027t move the keys. Not that frozen air could conduct sound anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, well. Eternity without sound, then! Hooray, I\u0027m dead. Ooh, I\u0027ve never been in this narrow hallway before - should I satisfy my curiosity now, or wait 8,000 years?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to wait five minutes before I gave into my curiosity. Thankfully - the hallway ended in an - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E OPEN DOOR! HALLELUJAH! Oh. Wait. This was just the dressing room. I mean, cool, I\u0027d never been in here before, but the only door out was closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was fairly confident that that was all the possible exits. So, hey. I mean, I had a good-ish life. I had been somewhat of a nerd. I had been almost murdered once. Been to space. I wonder, how long would it be before I forgot my old life? 100 years? A thousand? A million?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d never had a girlfriend. Drat. Something I\u0027d never be able to do. I mean, why had I been such a freaking coward? I bet I could have asked Andrea out perfectly fine. But I am, was, and WILL ALWAYS BE A FREAKING COWARD! I\u0027m such an idiot. Why had I not gone out for a sport at any time? Why hadn\u0027t I finished my Rube Goldberg machine? Or released my album? Or actually done something on my YouTube channel?!?!?!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked out the room\u0027s only window. Oh, look at the hundreds of stars. Yay. Given enough time, I\u0027d name all of them, forget the names, and repeat the cycle. Hooray. Welcome to eternity, the most boring thing eve-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe window was open.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=========================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two weeks of walking did not feel like two weeks. It felt like two minutes and two years at the same time. Thankfully, I never was hungry or thirsty, or oxygen deprived. The universe is a funny thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, water feels really weird when you walk on it. On my trip, the most annoying thing in the world was running into mist particles. They couldn\u0027t move, so I had to \u0022swim\u0022 above them. Which was a real problem when I ran into clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, according to Obbury (for whom the whole experience had taken a little over a half hour) I was in position, a hundred kilometers from the nearest landmass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, just hold on, Ethan, we\u0027re coming for you. We\u0027re in the process of priming the unfreezing device, and fixing the teleport. It will take a day or two - for me at least. If I get this right it should pass in seconds for you. We\u0027re coming for you, Ethan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, please, don\u0027t miss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, we\u0027re back. It actually only took four hours. So, just a recap, we\u0027re going to unfreeze a ten kilometer radius sphere of space for twenty seconds, locate you, and teleport you out. Got that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm, okay. You said this was inaccurate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep. Luckily, we found a way to constrain the Y axis, so there\u0027s that variable removed. We estimate that there\u0027s 1 in 100 chance we\u0027ll get you unfrozen the first try. We can\u0027t increase the radius, otherwise we have a chance of disrupting landmasses. Actually, we have a 1 in\u00A05 chance of crashing a plane... so, I mean, I hope that doesn\u0027t happen. Three, two, one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did anything happen?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think, genius?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, we\u0027re recharging. See you in four hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour hours?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, I\u0027m back. Firing in three, two, one... Nope. We may have clipped a beach. We should be fine, though. Again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so it continued for a few dozen tries, until finally...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Attempt number I\u0027ve lost count, but more than thirty. In three! Two! One!\u0022 There was no flash of light, or anything. Just all of a sudden, the water below me became wet again. The instant I found I needed to breathe, I was plunged into the ice cold water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022BLGGGGHH!!!!\u0022 I shouted, but then I thought the better of it and tried to hold the little breath I had. Why wasn\u0027t I floating upwards?\u00A0Had all of the laws of physics been broken? Was this a side effect? I was sinking!?!?!?!?\u00A0Come on, Kerbin! Hurry up! Get on with it! I just needed to hold my breath a little longer. Just a little longer. Had it been twenty seconds yet? Did something go wrong on the Kerbals end? Was I going to drown? Or worse\u00A0- be time frozen in Lake Superior for eternity? Just a little bit longer. I felt unconsciousness coming on. A black tunnel.\u00A0Whatever was at the end? Just a little lo-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there was a WHOOOOOOOOOOSH!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf a second later, me and all the freshwater within a two meter radius of me had been teleported onto the main floor of Team One\u0027s assembly hangar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EKerbin Day\u00A0Twenty-nine\u00A0(Earth Day Nine, 4:00\u00A0AM\u00A0Ethan Central Time) -\u00A0Construction Cutoff\u00A0Minus\u00A0Two Hours\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fell about a meter as the sphere became a non-sphere.\u00A0The water\u00A0cascaded across the whole floor of the hangar, and swept away the nearest five people - and the nearest two Kerbals. I sputtered and gasped, drawing the first breath I had taken in two weeks. I was collapsed on the wet floor for about fifteen seconds, before Evelina ran up to me and shouted:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ohmygoshareyouokay?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022*cough* yeah, I\u0027m *cough* fine.\u0022 *sputter*\u0022 She extended her hand to help me up. I took it. I was somewhat surprised when she brought me up straight into a bear hug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We were all - well, at least a few of us - were really, really worried about you. I mean, not your other nine commanders, but, wow. You had no idea how hard I had to work to convince the Kerbals to try and save you. They said it would pose a significant threat to the state of the Earth. Even with the revised method, they said\u00A0there would be a five percent chance of a substantial disruption to the planet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, *cough* wow. Are you sure I\u0027m worth that much? I mean, you could have destroyed the Earth.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey. No man left behind. Especially you, the first friend I met on this strange new world.\u0022 The hug ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow. I have no words to describe how thankful I am. I\u0027ve only met one person so far who would risk destroying a planet for me.\u0022 She blushed slightly. \u0022So, what did I miss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n===============================================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uvIc6qP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uvIc6qP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently, I had arrived back on Kerbin just in time to witness the stacking of the payload. It was now about cutoff minus 45 minutes, and there was a crane preparing to lift the habitation module \u0022Skywalker\u0022 onto the Ariane 5. In my opinion, it looked a little large compared to the lifter, but that was probably just Earth mass ratios playing tricks inside my head. Obbury and Evelina had wheeled the spinet out of my apartment and were playing music for everyone. They appeared to be taking requests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Ethan! Permission to lift?\u0022 asked the crane operator. The cables had been attached to the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Granted. What\u0027s you\u0027re name again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ron. How was time traveling?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It wasn\u0027t time travel. It was more of being the only thing moving through time on a world where nothing did.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh. Lifting now!\u0022 The cables slowly grew taut, and with a groan, the Skywalker left the ground. There was a chorus of cheers from the 800 engineers. I walked over to Evelina, who had stopped playing momentarily to witness the spectacle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Evelina. A few days ago, didn\u0027t you say that the top two modules would be built?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that was the plan, but we didn\u0027t have enough time to build both, so we took a vote. The shuttle design won.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah. Okay.\u0022 I glanced around the room. The countdown clock on the wall showed 43 minutes. The rocket powered merry go round/centrifuge was running. There was nobody in the passenger seat, but there was one in the middle seat. I took it that there was some kind of game going on - \u0022How long could you go in the middle without getting too dizzy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI walked around\u00A0until I was almost directly beneath the \u0022Skywalker.\u0022 It was now only a dozen or so meters from the Ariane 5, and the crews that would attach the last bolts and fairings were already in position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, I heard it.\u00A0That high pitched whining sound. Something was wrong. I looked in the direction of the centrifuge. It appeared to be oscilati-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of a sudden, the centrifuge arm ripped off from the base. Almost as if in tragic slow motion, the arm careened through the air like a tomahawk - flew above my head - and made the most terrible noise of metal on metal I have ever heard in my life - as the heavy metal plates embedded themselves into the hull of the Skywalker. The wires snapped - and the\u00A0sixteen ton piece of metal came crashing down onto the factory floor, pieces of the arm flying everywhere. One of them hit me in the head, and I blacked out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==============================================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came to with a groan. Before I opened my eyes I remembered the whole thing. I could hear the crowd\u0027s panicked whispers and desperate vulgarities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, my head.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, good. You\u0027re alive,\u0022 said Evelina.\u00A0\u0022How many times have I said that? Three? Four?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I think we have bigger problems to deal with. What\u0027s the time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thirty one minutes. We\u0027re doomed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No kidding.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m officially out of ideas. It\u0027s been fun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These parts are modular. What\u0027s to say we can\u0027t try to build another Skywalker in half an hour?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have got to be kidding! Those mark three parts aren\u0027t cylinders, and require large forklifts to transport.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can\u0027t we throw something together?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re being delusional, Ethan.\u0022 She buried her face in her hands. \u0022That was the only design we ever thought of building.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, that second design that tied with the shuttle. The Apollo ISS.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027ll never work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you have the schematic on your phone? Mine got destroyed by the water.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, just give up! This is a lost cause!\u0022 I was silent for thirty seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, there is a two percent chance that this will work. Just like there was a two percent chance that I would have ever become an astronaut. A two percent chance that we would meet. A two percent chance of the Skywalker being destroyed. Less than two percent chance that I would be teleported to Earth. I mena, out of the hundred or so spaceplanes, ours crashed! I mean, I could list them all but it would take the rest of our half hour! My point is, for two percent chances, we\u0027ve been doing awfully good so far. So, why should it stop here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked up at me, her face freshly tearstained. Wordlessly, she lowered her eyes, smiled a little, and handed her phone to me. I sprung up, and ran towards the stage and microphone, while at the same time sending the schematic to everyone in our group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Attention everyone. At this time, we have exactly twenty-nine minutes and fifty-two seconds to get something on top of that rocket! I have sent you all a schematic of the second place design. It is round, and thinner, and should be easier to assemble.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re insane!\u0022 shouted a voice from the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We lost, can\u0027t you see, kid!\u0022 shouted another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look, I know things look bad. But, all I\u0027m asking of you is that we at least try. The fate of humanity could be at stake here! And, look! The design work is done, and the\u00A0parts completely prefabricated! If everyone works, we just need to connect, what? One part a minute? There are EIGHT HUNDRED of us! We can do this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I put this? Uh, well, I was booed off the stage at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was frustrated, and hopping mad. I wanted to do something. I couldn\u0027t just stand here and watch the last chance at completing the mission evaporate away! So, I marched right up to one of the hitchhiker modules that was next to the giant chess board and began trying to roll it towards another one. I struggled to push the two and a half ton part. It didn\u0027t budge an inch.\u00A0I must have looked stupid as heck. I was crying and sobbing, trying to drive my willpower into that large metal cylinder. Please, I screamed inside my head, just move an inch! Then I will know I have done something! That I have at least tried!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Easy, mate. Let me help you with that,\u0022 said Oliver, as he approached the huge part. \u0022On three. One, two, three!\u0022 We both shoved the cylinder. It moved - but only an inch. \u0022One! Two! Three!\u0022 He shouted again. We shoved. It moved another inch. More laughs from the crowd at our pitiful attempt to save humanity. I didn\u0027t see any of them even try to do anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then that rude Chinese man who had called me a ten year old idiot came out of the crowd and started pushing with us. We could now consistently gain an inch every second or so. The crowd grew quiet as two more people stepped out and began shoving along with us. The cylinder rolled faster. We were now only a meter or so from the other hitchhiker. Another five or so people stepped forward from the crowd to orient the other can in the right direction. another stepped out holding a handful of connector bolts. He lined up two of the holes and shoved bolt through. It made a deep, resonating \u0022Clang\u0022 going in. The room suddenly got deathly quiet. Then, one member of the crowd shouted four words that would save all of us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022For Earth!

Someone shouted \u0022WE CAN DO THIS!\u0022 Everyone ran for their tools, or for another spaceship part. I looked up from my work, saw the tsunami of people raiding the workhouse, saw the multitudes of people - saw them putting aside their differences, their prejudices, and their cares and worries - saw them coming together, no matter how crazy the idea was, to save the mission. To save the Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETwenty Three Minutes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe had the hitchhikers fully connected by this point. The crowd was going crazy. I saw a line of men and women lugging giant thermometers, barometers, and other experiments over to a work station. Across the shop a group of people were wheeling a science bay towards the same people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETwenty Two Minutes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third hitchhiker module was nearing the stack of two we had.

After one of them had been declared the leader of the group, she tried to explain to the crowd of engineers how the meeting had gone terribly, downplaying my proposition saying it was \u0022ludicrous,\u0022 proposing an alternate spaceship plan, and lying about\u00A0everything in\u00A0general.\u00A0Not a good start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, after a day of analyzing the situation, the engineers on\u00A0Team Two\u00A0realized that her statements had been weird and oddly negative. She had bribed the other commanders to keep their mouths shut. A day later they had decided that although the plan I had given was not the best, it was the only one they\u00A0had. So, they built a fuel tank module. Later, they realized that they did not have the parts to build a robotic arm. So, they built a small space tug with a \u0022KLAW\u0022 device instead.

However, in my opinion they overanalyzed the parts, spending the first four days calculating exact mass ratios, as well as other stuff. That left them with little time to design and built. However, fuel tanks are pretty straightforward. The Bop/Pol lander was also pretty simple. It was determined that the lander did not actually need landing legs. Thankfully, they included four more docking ports.

An asteroid shot out of Stratovogmnolia, which turned grey, signaling resource depletion.

However, suddenly, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EVoyager\u003C/em\u003E shook violently (drat, I thought we fixed that reaction wheel!) throwing Valentina off balance - which had catastrophic results on the Infernis system. Moons and planets went everywhere - colliding and destroying everything. Valentina\u0027s planet plowed into the star Infernis, and Bob\u0027s planets were completely annihilated by a barrage of wayward moons. The Infernis system was as good as gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Minus twenty percent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m out anyway!

All of a sudden, a moon thrown from Infernis plowed into Draggnad\u0027s ring of moons (of which I had taken over four), creating a domino effect and destroying them all. \u0022Never mind, I\u0027m out!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m in, and so is Jack,\u0022 replied Alonya.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, so, this is in fact the final battle!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Until we play again. Hey, Cheng! Want to join in next game?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No thanks, losers. You\u0027re from Russia, you\u0027re African, you\u0027re a kid, you\u0027re a gamer, and you\u00A0four are aliens. Why should I associate with you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, I tried!\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s such a jerk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Remind me again why we can\u0027t throw him out of the airlock.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because, Jack, he\u0027s the only person actually qualified to be on this mission, and we need him to land on Tylo for us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, good point. Also, WHACK-A-KERBAL!\u0022 shouted Alonya as she launched an entire\u00A0barrage of\u00A0moons\u00A0at Jack\u0027s home planet. Everyone gasped. The moons arced closer and closer... Until, suddenly\u00A0they pushed out of the way by... one of my old abandoned planets! This was going to be a good finale!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, uh, it\u0027s Ethan again. Did I just accidentally turn on voice to text? I probably did. It caught quite a bit of the game, I\u0027ll presume. *checks* Yep. I\u0027ll edit what\u0027s happening into there later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, it\u0027s edited, time for some explanation. You just witnessed a game of Whack-A-Kerbal, my new favorite game ever. It\u0027s sort of half video game, half *board* game, the board being a three dimensional patch of space on a table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a bit confusing at first, but I\u0027ll try to explain it the best I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhack-A-Kerbal is a game\u00A0that can only be played in zero gravity. I know, right? That already makes it awesome and I\u0027ve not even scratched the surface! The players sit around a table that has a few reference markers on it to stop out of bounds planets. The game focuses on large magnetic spheres. The largest are stars, up to 15cm in diameter. The smallest are ships, which are about the size of a B.B. Each sphere is a certain color, the smallest ones are just painted, while anything moon size or larger changes colors depending on what happens to it - and each piece is connected to the main computer unit which controls all of the inputs that people give from their control consoles. The goal is to eliminate the other players by destroying the planets. It\u0027s really, really, REALLY cool!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt actually simulates orbital mechanics fairly well, for magnetism. It\u0027s also very fast paced, which makes it very hard to keep up. It\u0027s really cool to see the system of 100 magnetic spheres orbit each in zero gravity a few feet from your face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnough of that, I\u0027ll explain it more in depth later. I do have six months until Jool, I\u0027ll get to\u00A0it sometime.\u00A0So, I was talking about mission controls. Our setup was... uh...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, you got it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can you go over that one more time, Dongun?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not rocket science!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It actually is!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, fair point.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y1rNBBb.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y1rNBBb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, Ethan, you have your keyboard in front of you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why a keyboard? Since when are rockets flown with keyboards? Can I at least have a joystick?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Joystick functionality is buggy at this point. We had to write this code in less than forty days, you know! So, WASD controls the rocket. Pitch is W and S, but it\u0027s flipped if you\u0027re not a plane flyer, normal if you are. Q and E are roll. Space advances the staging, and T toggles the sickness avoidance system - sorry, stability assistance system. The bottom blue thing is what direction you\u0027re pointing, shift and control control the throttle, the left is your staging, top is altimeter and a few other things, and top right is resources. Bottom right is me, but I\u0027ll show you the astronauts in a second. That big window in the middle is your engineer, also known as \u0022easy mode.\u0022 It was agreed that you could use it for this mission. If you touch the button marked \u0022H,\u0022 the whole planet dies. Got it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a mental note not to touch the \u0022H.\u0022 \u0022Um, can you say that all again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. I\u0027ve already said it ten times. You\u0027ve got about\u00A0a dozen people trying to backseat drive. You\u0027ll be fine! Just, don\u0027t kill Jeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, Ethan! You\u0027ve got this!\u0022 shouted Evelina from across the room, at her chair position as \u0022Assistant Senior Mission Controller Chief.\u0022 \u0022Are we ready to begin the countdown?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope, but the launch window is in about two minutes, so, begin flight polling!\u0022 I shouted back across the noisy room. There was a shuffle as Evelina dropped her checklist onto the ground and picked it back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Booster!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ariane five is go! I mean, as far as I can tell,\u0022 shouted a Japanese woman from across the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Range safety!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, I think so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go, then!

I have no idea what I\u0027m doing!\u0022 At that moment, Evelina accidentally held the checklist a bit too close to the fan. There was a ripping sound as it was chopped up by the blades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, launch abort system?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t have one of those.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I may or may not have lost my list! Ethan, are you go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope, but I\u0027m as ready as I\u0027ll ever be!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Astronauts!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbonauts.

Two kilometers up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And already forty five degrees,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How important is this module again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is the fuel and the light lander.

The people surrounding the pilot were in a panic. The pilot herself was holding the \u0022A\u0022 key as if for dear life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Heating at eighty percent of maximum!

They have this one the size of a trash can that can\u0027t even run a computer for an hour.\u0022 We both chuckled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, it\u0027s good to know that we\u0027re good at something besides killing each other.\u0022 There was a silence for a while after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cleared my throat a minute or so later and said \u0022Okay, so, uh, I sort of fell asleep a little bit after the Atlas launched. It docked okay, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, yeah. Perfect docking. Those docking port magnets are a lot stronger than they look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Should I pull up the stream on my phone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure, you can go ahead and try. I doubt it will last another six hours, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I can plug it in somewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Negative on that, this viewing place is ancient. Most modern maps of the space center don\u0027t even include it. Not an outlet in sight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not that Earth outlets and Kerbin outlets look the same at all. Should we move to another viewing area, one that has outlets?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I like it here. It\u0027s mostly quiet, which emphasizes the volume of the rocket launches.\u0022 I smiled as she said that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I like it here as well. We\u0027ll just use my phone sparingly,\u0022 I said. We sat and watched as the next rocket, the Falcon 9, was rolled out onto the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sometimes I really wish Sweden had a space program,\u0022 Evelina said, her voice near a whisper. \u0022You\u0027re really lucky, being an American.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t quite sure how to respond, so I went with \u0022Well, you\u0027ve got Wintergatan. That\u0027s got to mean something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you guys went to the moon. And sent robots to every single planet. And built a space station. Guess what Sweden has.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, close to nothing. We at least have the SNSB, or Swedish National Space Board. It only has a dozen or so members, and we\u0027ve built a whopping six satellites. Two of those were so small they shouldn\u0027t count, and one was a joint mission\u00A0that included\u00A0a few other countries. The last time we built anything was seven years ago, and we\u0027ve never seriously considered a launch vehicle. The closest thing we have to a launch vehicle is our two percent ownership in the ESA.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ouch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You said it. At least we have one astronaut, Christer Fuglesang, who flew on an American shuttle. I\u0027ve dreamed of space my whole life -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As have I.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I never thought I would be able to actually go there. Then aliens abducted us all, and an hour later, I\u0027m in space. I could get used to this. I wonder if the Kerbals will let us use the launch facilities after the Jool ship has left. That would be awesome.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a loud rumble a few seconds later, just as I was about to reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eeypW7R.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eeypW7R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see what I mean, Ethan?\u0022 she shouted, elated. \u0022I mean, look at that! Where on Earth could you go and see rockets launch every half hour from less than a kilometer away? In a way, I\u0027m glad that the Kerbals found us.

I won\u0027t let you down!\u0022\u00A0There was a fresh wave of applause, and some tears as well, as Marie was directed to the side of the stage by another Kerbal. She appeared to be crying.

They were hushed up quickly, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cheng, if you won\u0027t tell us about yourself, I will have to,\u0022 said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fine, then.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I could start with the spaghetti incident in year eight -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, there\u0027s no need to do that!\u0022 exclaimes\u00A0Cheng as he scrambled for the microphone. \u0022Hello, everyone. My name is Cheng. Like you all, I\u00A0 was abducted by aliens on April 29, 2017. Like you, I have been forced to live among foreigners and assemble a spacecraft so that mankind can compete for its existence. Like you, I hate the -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cheng, your early life.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was a jet pilot, if you needed to know, and you didn\u0027t need to know,\u00A0you green skinned piece of trash!\u0022 This insult drew more gasps from the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That will be all, Cheng. Please take your position next to Marie.\u0022 Cheng, with some grumbling, walked across the stage, and took his spot - noticeably farther away from Marie than he should have been. The crowd was deathly silent. Why in the world had one of the rudest people in the group of ten thousand engineers and scientists\u00A0been picked?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Raise your right hands again.\u0022 Everyone rose their right hand (except for the aforementioned amputee).\u00A0\u0022Our third space traveler is from the country of Russia.\u0022 Again, most of the hands dropped. \u0022She is a woman.\u0022 Two thirds of those hands dropped. \u0022She works as an engineer in the aerospace industry.\u0022 About half of the hands went down. \u0022Specifically, she works on the Proton lifter.\u0022 About five hands remained. \u0022And finally, our fourth space traveler has piloted the replica Delta IV Heavy into orbit! Give it up for Alonya Chadova!\u0022 An excited looking Russian woman was teleported to the stage. She looked to have been about sixty years old, and was obviously very excited at the prospect of going to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? Me? Oh, my... I\u0027m...

But, I wasn\u0027t! I was elated! I thought that within a decade or two I could go to space! But, as you all know, that never really happened. Uh, I have a twin sister, Vasilisa! Oh another interesting fact, my name was supposed to be Alyona, but the name got written down wrong, and it had been Alonya ever since. I like it, it brings in a certain uniqueness... It\u0027s really weird how misspellings get transferred between Russian and English. I know both, actually, but we have that fancy translation thing...\u00A0Hey, have I ever told anyone about how I met Svetlana Savitskaya? Oh, I could go on for hours about that! And - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Alonya, you may share that story with the world after we perform the launch. We do have about an hour, you know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, yes!\u0022 She ran across the stage, a joyous look on her face, and joined Marie and Cheng.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right then. Our final astronaut is a girl.\u0022 A lot of the hands dropped, including mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey,\u0022 said Evelina, who was standing next to me now. \u0022This is the first time I\u0027ve actually kept my hand up past the first question!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our final space traveler is from the country of Sweden.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OHMYGOSH! I mean, I probably won\u0027t get it, but, hey!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, lucky you! I haven\u0027t raised my hand more than once at all!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She is under the age of eighteen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022AAAAAH!\u0022\u00A0Around five\u00A0hands were up at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And she lives on the island of Gotland!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Aww.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You got close, Evelina.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s all welcome our final astronaut, Isabela Jeanette!\u0022 There was clapping. But no accompanying scream, and no teleport. \u0022Uh, Isabela? I saw you here for the Atlas launch, are you still here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne member of the crowd spoke up. \u0022Her\u00A0mother\u00A0was injured earlier today and she\u00A0had to leave. Something to do with a revolt in one of the cities.\u0022 A murmur passed through the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well then, I guess we\u0027ll have to go with out backup\u00A0space traveler.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, so she gets out of it and\u00A0not me!\u0022 shouted Cheng, whom Jeb ignored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell, that threw a\u00A0wrench in the works, as the humans said. The entire plan hinged on having someone\u00A0youthful and innocent on the flight team. Someone that the lower age range could look up to. Drat. The next eight people we considered for that role had not applied to the engineering team. The next few people on the list had proved to be... less than ideal candidates. The plan directed\u00A0Jeb to choose Noah Brown, an elderly Australian. However, he could not see Noah contributing anything to the mission. It left the youth of Earth without anyone their age to look up to. It was a really bad idea, now that he thought about it. He had an idea for a new candidate right then - it felt right and wrong at the same time. The Galactic Council would\u00A0metaphorically kill\u00A0him for changing the plan at the last moment - but sending Noah would be a disaster in every other way. Jebediah made one very important decision right there - that would affect billions of lives in a very big way.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our new final space traveler is from the United States of America.\u0022 Hands fell. Mine stayed up. \u0022He is a boy - also under the age of eighteen.\u0022 My hand remained - along with two dozen others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, you have your hand up still!\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, surprising! Maybe I\u0027ll even get as close as you did!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, two percent chances, remember!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our final space traveler wears a watch.\u0022 There were three hands left. Was this actually happening? My heart beat faster. And faster. And faster still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan?\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He considers himself a space nerd.\u0022 One more hand fell. Two left. What? No! I wanted to go to space - but at the same time I didn\u0027t - I had a new life here. I may or may not have agreed to watch the rest of the launches with Evelina! My family was here! My friends! But - out there, the mystery that had been calling out to me ever since the day I was born - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022He lived in Illinois.\u0022 \u003C/strong\u003EWas that me - no.

He knew nearly nothing more about his candidate. He would have to take a reasonable guess - Did he have brown hair? Blonde? Why couldn\u0027t he remember? He had already used the \u0022Piloted a rocket\u0022 for Alonya, and didn\u0027t want repeats. The Earth rift would be a dead giveaway - and would make him into a \u0022too special\u0022 lucky person that everybody would envy. GRR! And just then, Jeb remembered something really important that he had found out earlier, and went with it. \u0022Here goes nothing,\u0022 he muttered under his breath. He hoped he wasn\u0027t making the worst mistake he had ever made. Admittedly, it would be pretty hard to top almost sending the entire Galactic Council into Sagittarius A.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Our final space traveler has taught a young Kerbal\u00A0to play the piano.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0_0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime moved in slow motion.
