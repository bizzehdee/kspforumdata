First, we\u0027re going to test out our new \u0027Hammer\u0027 solid fuel booster, keeping our still limited budget in mind, and if we are very lucky, we might even send the first Kerbal out of the atmosphere and into space. And to help us today, is Jeb! Say, Jeb. Would you like to go to space today?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Boy, would I ever!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then sign this Waiver of Indemnity, and climb aboard!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gee, Mr. Kerman. That doesn\u0027t seem like a very big ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re right, it isn\u0027t. In fact, due to budget restraints and the limitations of our ship designing bay, it is little more than a command pod attached to the Hammer SFB. But don\u0027t worry, to keep you pointed in the right direction, we\u0027ve also got three equadistant fins. We\u0027ve even installed a parachute in your nose cone. But the other reason the ship is so small is because of what we like to call the \u003Cem\u003Ethrust to weight ratio\u003C/em\u003E. Because it\u0027s not just the size of the kick in the pants you get, it is the ratio between the kick in the pants your booster gives you, compared to how much pants you have to kick in the vessel. So keeping it small and compact like this means you get to go higher! Plus is the least expensive vessel our engineers could come up with that had at least a reasonable chance of achieving our goals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, wow. That sounds cool! Will I get to go into orbit today?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It won\u0027t be a very big orbit, but yes, technically, you will be in an orbit of some description if you can escape the atmosphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow! Okay, I\u0027m all strapped in! Let \u0027er rip!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKiddo: We\u0027re going to need another Jeb, aren\u0027t we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Initial test of the brand new \u0027Hammer\u0027 solid fuel booster in three... two... one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, solid fuel boosters don\u0027t have throttling, and can\u0027t be turned off until they burn out. Needless to say, considering the total weight of the ship was on the order of five tons, the acceleration rate was quite impressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Woooooowwwwwwww... it\u0027s getting hot in here...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKiddo: We\u0027re going to need another Jeb?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s because you have accellerated to the point that air resistance is slowing you down, translating the force from acceleration into heat energy. But don\u0027t worry, you don\u0027t have much burn time left, hold it together.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel reaches a top speed of almost 1,200 m/s at a height of 25 km when the booster burns out. Of course, momentum being what it is, he kept going up. When he reached 60 km, Mr Kerman sent another transmission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb? I need you to record temperature, pressure, and activate one of those goo canisters now. Just put that button right there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow! I\u0027m doing SCIENCE! Am I in space yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Almost there...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel reaches the critical 70 km mark, and cheers erupt in Control, having successfully tested the Hammer booster AND sent a Kerbal into orbit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb? Now that you are officially in space, could you run those experiments and radio the data back to us again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? Oh, wow! Sure. Here you go. Look at me! I\u0027m doing SCIENCE! IN SPAAAAAACE!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You sure are, Jeb. You sure are.\u0022 As Mr. Kerman closed the com channel, he looks over to another desk, that gives him a thumbs up \u0022Send the data over to the boffins. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be able to do something with it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship reaches the Periapsis at 105 km and Jeb radios back \u0022Umm.. Mr. Kerman. If I\u0027m in space, how will I get down?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, don\u0027t worry about that, Jeb. Technically, you are in what we call a Decaying Orbit. That means you don\u0027t have enough energy to achieve escape velocity, and you don\u0027t have enough lateral vee to achieve a stable orbit. Which means that, sooner or later, you\u0027ll come right back down. I promise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKiddo: We\u0027re going to need another Jeb, aren\u0027t we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Mr. Kerman! I\u0027m taking a selfie with Kerbal in the background! Best selfie ever!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Say, would you mind texting me that selfie, Jeb? After all, you\u0027ll be quite the celebrity, being the first Kerbal in space and all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yea, sure thing. Oh, when should I start deploying the parachutes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh Jeb, parachutes don\u0027t work in space. They work by catching air and increasing air resistance. But there\u0027s no air up there to catch. You\u0027ll have to wait until you get lower to the ground before you can deploy that parachute.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the ship reaches 70km again, the speed of the vessel is already 500 m/s and climbing. At 60 km, it does a nose-over and points its nose directly prograde, having achieved 750 m/s and climbing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKiddo: Yea, we\u0027re definitely going to need another Jeb, aren\u0027t we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the vessel reaches 40 km and a speed of 1,000 m/s, Jeb radios in \u0022Uhh... Mr. Kerman? It\u0027s getting really hot in here again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s because you\u0027re bleeding off acceleration again, just like you did on the way up, and that bled off energy translates into heat. But don\u0027t worry, you\u0027re facing your nose \u0027into the wind\u0027, so you\u0027ll slice through it as easily as possible. So you won\u0027t be burning up in re-entry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Okay. That\u0027s good, I guess.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 20 km, the ship was still moving at around 900 m/s, and Jeb radios back \u0022Uhh... should I deploy my parachute now? The ground seems to be coming up awfully fast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It won\u0027t do you any good, Jeb. You\u0027re going much too fast, it would just rip off as soon as it was deployed. Maximum velocity for deploying your parachute is three hundred meters per second. But don\u0027t worry, because you angled on the ascent, you\u0027re going to splash down into the bay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, a water splashdown. That should be safe, right?\u0022 As the altimeter spun rapidly downward, there was utter silence over the radio. \u0022Uhh... Mr. Kerman?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKiddo: Say it! Say it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbal Space Exploder Mk. II impacted the surface of the water at 773 m/s, with unfortunate results for the vessel and its inhabitant.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re going to need another Jeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKiddo erupts in cackling laughter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that, my friends, is the reason that picture, in its grainy phone-camera resolution, is hung here in the halls of the complex. The first Kerbal to have ever left the atmosphere. His expression of pure joy and the breathtaking background of part of the command pod and the curve of Kerbal giving it an awe-inspiring feel. Plus it was worth a couple extra science for a crew report from orbit. The image went viral across Kerbal, inspiring dozens of future Jebs to flock to the Kerbal Space Program for recruitment, the fruits of the government-funded and neglected education program yielding perhaps the most profitable fruits since the invention of the production line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo whenever the call went out \u0022We need another Jeb!\u0022, there was never any shortage of volunteers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
