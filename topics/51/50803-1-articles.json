The goal was to thoroughly check the \u003Cem\u003EBellerophon XI\u003C/em\u003E spacecraft, as well as a new lander with a refuelable rover and other extras. Since the 2nd unmanned flight of the vehicle ended in only a few explosions, the engineers at KSC decided it should be \u0022pretty safe\u0022 to send some Kerbals on a trip to Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/cXz7f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

However, after the update (and installing FAR and Deadly reentry) I wanted to go after a more conventional approach, i.e. \u0022Apollo on steroids\u0022 as seen above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
