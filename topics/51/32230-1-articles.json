So it was decided to assemble an expedition from two standard \u0027Kerbster III\u0027 general utility craft and a heavy lander that had been proven to be capable of landing on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and making it back with fuel to spare. It wouldn\u0027t be able to land on Duna but perhaps it could attempt a landing on Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive brave Kerbals volunteered for this long range mission. They knew they wouldn\u0027t be back real soon. Between two capsules and the lander there was space for ten so it wasn\u0027t too cramped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s252.photobucket.com/user/James_Quirk/media/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot40.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/James_Quirk/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot40.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot40.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn intercept to Duna was plotted and the Poodle was fired up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s252.photobucket.com/user/James_Quirk/media/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot42.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/James_Quirk/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot42.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot42.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaving goodbye to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where things took a wrong turn. Unfortunately no pictures are available - they appear to have been erased and the crew of the Duna Explorer mission refuses to tell what happened. What is known is that just after leaving the Kerbin system, a fine-tuning maneuver was planned. Due to a mix-up of the \u0027control from here\u0027 buttons it appears that instead of accelerating, the combined craft fired in the wrong direction. After expending several hundreds of delta-V the crew realised that Kerbin was catching up with them. The expedition entered a wide orbit just outside the Minmus orbit. At this point the Kerbal Space Center ordered the crew to come home and give up. However, during their deceleration burn the crew realized that they had a unique opportunity for a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn slingshot out of the system. Before KSC realized what was going on the expedition was on an escape trajectory out of Kerbin again. All they heard over the radio was a quick \u0027Screw you guys, we\u0027re going to Duna!!\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s252.photobucket.com/user/James_Quirk/media/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot28.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/James_Quirk/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot28.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say their trajectory was not ideal and it took them quite a while to get there, but finally on day 213 Duna was in sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, a rescue mission led by Bill, Bob and Jeb was assembled but that is a story for another day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s252.photobucket.com/user/James_Quirk/media/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot40_aa.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/James_Quirk/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot40_aa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot40_aa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting close to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s252.photobucket.com/user/James_Quirk/media/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot36.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/James_Quirk/KSP%20-%20Duna%20By%20Eye/screenshot36.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot36.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrepare to break.
