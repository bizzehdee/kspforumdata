Every type of government has been tried, because the Helleniks are nothing if not experimental and ready to try anything. Most of the time, however, they have been a republic, though many think they are an autonomous collective. During the Great War, the Hellenik army successfully held off several Kermanian advances, and ultimately caused enough casualties that the Kermanic offensive found an easier target: South Kijani.
