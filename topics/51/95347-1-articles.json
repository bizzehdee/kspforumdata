After this surrender, much of Japan was seized by GE and occupied from 1935 to 1940 until the Pacific Nations (The West-American Federation, Portuguese Republic, and Franco-British Union) had begun pressuring the Empire to release this territory, for fear that GE could use it as a springboard to the Pacific. A brief conflict came about in what was known as \u003Cem\u003EThe War of Empires\u003C/em\u003E in the Pacific Ocean and its isles until GE and the Pacific Nations came to an agreement whereby Japan became a neutral territory largely controlled by a newly formed government within Japan. No military activity of any kind would be allowed over Japanese airspace or territories, including Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, which had been under control of the Franco-British Union until the start of the Great War in previous years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EWhile\u003C/strong\u003E the War in the Pacific is quite a bit different than what we know to be true, the war in the Atlantic Theatre was even more foreign; the biggest difference being GE aiding the Russian Monarchy (RM) in its efforts to defeat the People\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Nations. This change in manpower and military strength had cause the United Germanic People to collapse at a faster rate than ever, ending in 1942 with GE/RM forces taking the Reichstag and its leaders prisoner for trial. With supply being cut off to the People\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Movement Nations, the PMN\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s military collapsed with Franco-British forces pushing them back.

This introduction as well as the first mission is but a taste of what will come later on. I am hoping to flesh out this strange world even more. I wont say all that is going to happen, but there will be competitors and there will be failures as well as glorious successes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am heavily inspired by the likes of NathanKell, his RFTS posts and his introducing me to Alternate History has set off this little story I have going. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still working on a lot more of the history to this history. With such a world having such a drastic change early in time, the Butterfly Effect has caused massive change to the landscape of Europe. The Crusades did not happen in the way that we know it did. As such, there was significantly less power given to the Papal powers. Spain never converted to Catholicism, the Caliphates didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fragment or collapse but instead united, reaching from Spain to Arabia, going through N. Africa on the way. The Ottoman Empire also came out very differently. Its power to facilitate trade between Asia and Europe was challenged by the Khanate earlier in its history and was weakened by opposing factions. By the time this world\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s equivalent of WWI came about, there was even less of the Ottoman Empire than our timeline had seen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may have also noticed in my edit, I removed the USSR. This is largely because (and thanks to NK for this) I doubt the USSR would have existed. Instead, we have a reformed Monarchy thanks to Alex II who was not assassinated before he could have reform. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s complicated but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s best not to pull at these strings (lest my house of cards collapses).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-16T07:25:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceAnt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged names, and various events.

Most of the sunlight was drowned out and what little light that did push through the smoke barely helped. G\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCrragchaa\u0027s first instinct was to jump out of his seat, as he tried, he felt a strange pain in his leg. Looking down, he saw a large piece of wood that went up through his chair and into his leg, pinning him down. A loud creaking noise filled the plane before he realized that he was still not on solid ground, he was suspended in a tree. He reached for his pistol and tried to shoot the windshield open, as soon as it cracked, the explosive force of the flames behind him pushed out through the new opening. Before he knew it, he was completely engulfed in flame. G\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCrragchaa pulled a lever and his entire seat slid out of the plane and fell to the ground some three meters below. As he hit the ground, the pain in his leg shot through his entire body. His mouth filled with the taste of copper as he reached for the tree limb in his leg. With one swift pull, G\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCrragchaa managed to take the wood out of the seat and free his leg. The pain, still very potent, slowly began to fade into the back of his mind as he looked around him. The untouched white snow was stained by shrapnel of metal and wood, fuel from his plane leaked steadily from up in the tree, and in the distance, he could hear the booms of Anti-Aircraft guns firing off at his comrades still in the sky, though by now, they were at a great distance. Adrenaline now coursing through his veins, G\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCrragchaa stood up from his seat and limped around for his pistol that he dropped as he fell. This was not what he had in mind when he was given this escort mission...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImperial Palace, Khanbaliq, 1948\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EY\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BAB\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B3 was glad to be back in Khanbaliq, even for a short time, the snows in the country had begun to melt with the springtime. For the first time in months, you could even see the sun in all of its warming glory. What was worrying, however, was that Afiq was with him. It\u0027s very rare for a Persian to be summoned by the council, let alone have an audience with the Inner Court. If The Great Khan is present, Y\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BAB\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B3 just might have a heart-attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EDo you know what they\u0027re going to ask us?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Afiq broke their nearly three-day silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EYou know as much as I, Afiq.

He reached down for his cigarettes, one left. Afiq quizzically looked at the walls to the palace, looked down to his hands, then finally gestured around him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EWell, I am Persian, you are at least from this part of the land.

Both of you will have the rest of the day to pick the members of your teams.

Funding will not be decreased for MSI, and the Solid Division will have its own budget and goals.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Councilman Yasavi turned away from them and gestured to the door. There would be no arguing for reconsideration. Afiq hadn\u0027t broken his gaze off the Khan\u0027s seal on the parchment, many would consider it an honor to have a wax seal from The Great Khan, but this was only a dagger to his heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours had passed, Afiq and Y\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BAB\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B3 were never the best of \u0022friends\u0022 during their time together at MSI, but this change brought nothing but pain to their hearts.
