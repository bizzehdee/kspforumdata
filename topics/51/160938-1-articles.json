They built large spaceships to carry them to far off worlds such as Eve, Eeloo, Dres, and Jool, but eventually, the urge of space travel subsided. The space program gradually lost funding, and was shut down. Only after fifty years did the new government, the United Panthera Alliance, take notice. They hired a new director, director of the newly formed Panther Space Program, Gene Kerman, to lead them, and, giving him 250K, told him to \u0022do some spacy stuff and not blow up\u0022.

A new flag was placed, and the site was renamed to the \u0027Panther Space Center\u0027, or \u0027PSC\u0027 for short. Next up was hiring the staff for the space center. Allegedly,\u00A0Gene\u00A0Kerman found Wernher Von Kerman hiding out in the barn at the back of the space center, hoarding whatever supplies he could get, living like\u00A0a mouse, but this was disproved as lies.

Eventually, after several days, Wernher came up with an idea for the \u0027Aero-0\u0027. The Aero-0 was an unmanned rocket, taking a science package with it, all sticky taped onto an explosive tin can, which we later found out that it was called a \u0027Solid Rocket Booster\u0027. The launch went well, and it exceeded 10,000 meters into the air before the parachute deployed, and we got some valuable scientific data back from it.

Once the craft started falling back through the sky we activated the second stage. We had a Kerbal in space! The re-entry though, was a bit dangerous, as we were only learning about heat shields, let alone developing them. The trip went well and Asanna came down just short of 5km\u0027s from the PSC.

The \u0027Aero-2\u0027 was given an extra stage than the \u0027Aero-1\u0027, and was launched on the LR-1 \u0027Panda\u0027 Launch Vehicle.

A couple of big rocks floating around, and in the middle of them, linking them together is some kind of space station or large craft\u0022 With\u00A0a quick burst of his EVA jetpack, Jeb was floating towards the strange craft. Taking a closer look, he found out that the three asteroids were linked together by a Klaw each to the middle, which Jeb was thinking as being a space station or drilling/refuelling depot, using the asteroids for infinite ore, and processing it for fuel. \u0022I\u0027m right beside the craft, permission to enter, PSC?\u0022 \u0022PSC here, you have permission\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENebula 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb, trying to get into the mysterious vessel, found that the airlock had been frozen solid. He opened his space-satchel on his EVA suit and pulled out a small power cutter, and defrosted the ice around the door, rather than blow it open by cutting off the hinges. In a quick tug, the door opened, and he was inside. He looked around, and took off his helmet. Jeb was surprised that oxygen was still on the craft, but he was still cautious as the air supply could go out at any moment. Flicking a switch, he turned on the lights. Then he set to work, flicking random buttons and dials, knobs and levers, until he found the right combination to get it running again. \u0022PSC, the vessel seems to be called \u0027Nebula 1\u0027.

Jeb shut off his transmitter and looked around again. He decided to check all the rooms, doors, cupboards, filing cabinets, and everything else that may be hiding something. Then he heard a crunching noise, followed by a plastic wrapper of some sort. Jeb found a door with a sign that read \u0027Pegasus Dreams\u0027, and opened it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EEP Alpha\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lights were bright, dazzling bright, and the noise too. Once he had gotten used to the light, Jeb\u0027s eyes adjusting, he looked around, finding, instead of the Kraken,\u00A0three young-looking Kerbonauts sitting around the large room, eating snacks and playing games. \u0022Hi, I\u0027m Jebediah Kerman, who are you?\u0022 The three Kerbonauts stopped and looked at him, and began cheering loudly. \u0022We\u0027re saved, we\u0027re saved! It\u0027s not a dream! We\u0027re saved!\u0022 one of the Kerbals kept saying. \u0022Saved?\u0022 Jeb was perplexed at the meaning of all of this. \u0022Allow me to explain. I\u0027m Ceriel Kerman, or CK for short. Me and my friends Lizicca and Mitten Kerman were sent up here to fulfil a contract for Kerbodyne, which was to have a refuelling base in orbit around Kerbin. One day, all the radio chatter from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E stopped, and we\u0027ve been here in this room ever since.\u0022 \u0022So if you\u0027ve been in this room ever since, then how come you haven\u0027t starved already?\u0022 Jeb said. \u0022We were cryogenically frozen, and only woken up by the heat of something\u0022 Jeb looked a bit more relaxed now, and was thinking. \u0022So do you know why everything stopped? Why the radio stopped with the chatter?\u0022 Lizicca Kerman, the oldest of the three, was asking him. \u0022Maybe because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is gone? I\u0027m part of the Panther Space Program, and was sent into orbit to come down again. I found this large station and went inside, and-\u0022 Jeb was cut off by Mitten Kerman. \u0022It\u0027s gone? The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is gone?\u0022 \u0022Don\u0027t worry, we rebuilt it and renamed it the Panther Space Center, or PSC for short\u0022. \u0022Anyway, this room is called EP Alpha, or Emergency Pod Alpha. It\u0027s filled with snacks and supplies, so if we ever need to escape the station, we can undock this and float freely away\u0022, Ceriel explained. \u0022So how are we going to get back?\u0022 Mitten Kerman was asking again. \u0022I have a capsule, except there\u0027s only room for me\u0022, Jeb said. \u0022Why don\u0027t we use the Eagle?\u0022 Lizicca said softly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEagle A\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Eagle\u0027 was in fact three craft, named \u0027Eagle A\u0027, \u0027Eagle B\u0027, and \u0027Eagle C\u0027. They were, to Jebediah\u0027s amazement, not small capsules, but fully fledged SSTOs. The command cockpit had room for three, and contained a crew area behind that for four Kerbals. The crew area could be jettisoned from the main craft to act as an escape pod if something went wrong, which hopefully wouldn\u0027t happen anytime soon. Booting up his transmitter, Jeb radioed Mission Control. \u0022Jeb here, I\u0027ve found three Kerbonauts who\u0027ve been stranded here for quite a long time. Permission to bring them back?\u0022. A short wait, then a reply by Gene. \u0022Jeb, your capsule only has room for you, not three other Kerbals\u0022. \u0022Well, Gene, they have the Eagles, three SSTOs capable of carrying 7 Kerbals to and from the station\u0022. \u0022Ok Jeb, except you will need to transfer your experiments to one of them so we can get the science back\u0022. With that, they entered the \u0027Eagle A\u0027, and undocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlaming Wings, Part 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Eagle A\u0027, nicknamed \u0027Aerosol Can\u0027 booted up it\u0027s flight computer and proceeded to perform the undocking procedure.

Waiting for the re-entry insertion to land at the space center, which would occur in roughly 7 hours, the four Kerbals began to chat. Lizicca had been an engineer, and was the one responsible for the drilling. She told stories about Kraken attacks on Dres, and Bop, before Mitten told her to stop scaring him. Mitten had been brought up in a poor family on Kerbin, and had got into space by winning a lottery which helped his family survive the economical hardships and become nice, hard-working people, who later became rich after his father started up a business that made and sold Kraken plushies. Ceriel, on the other hand, was like Jeb, Quick thinking and half-crazy, she was a stowaway on board.

With a slight jerk the six engines propelled the craft through space, four at the back and one on each wing. Then, just as it started, it stopped. The in-flight computer was making final preparations before the \u0027Eagle A\u0027 re-entered the atmosphere, gliding to a landing at the PSC, after fifty years of service. Mitten was playing with the Kraken plushie. Ceriel was watching him, assuring that everything would be fine. Jebediah was informing Mission Control of the situation, telling them to get ready for a landing. Lizicca started talking about different ores, and drill rates, and what to do if the drill overheats, and what not to do, and so on. Speaking of overheating, they were just about to re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The lights inside the craft dimmed, and then turned off, but there was no darkness, as the flames started to hit the underside of the \u0027Eagle A\u0027. 50 seconds. 50 seconds to go before they were through. Jeb was sure that he could hear rattling noises, of bolts shaking loose, but nothing happened. The in-flight computer, now nicknamed \u0027OSNAP\u0027 (Orbital and Surface Navigation and Alignment Protocol), fired the engines once again, to align the craft for a runway landing. They were gliding over Meadow Ridge, the mountains that surrounded the PSC, and were descending rapidly.

From there, we would use the main purpose of the station (an infinite ore/refuelling depot), to transfer converted fuel into the Eagle A, replenishing it\u0027s tanks for (hopefully) enough fuel to reach the Mun, get into orbit, do some experiments, and return back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAndromeda\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this complicated mission we had chosen Lizicca, as she\u0027s the only one smart enough to operate drills and process fuel, Jeb, Asanna, and a new recruit, Phonica Kerman.

Kirsky Kerman, completed a space walk with his almost 50 year old EVA pack. \u0022I haven\u0027t had this much fun in years!\u0022 He then got back inside, and they passed the Mun.

I haven\u0027t seen that in years! It was the very first Munar outpost, used for mining and exploration!\u0022 It was indeed, the first. After five minutes of travelling, they gained their first proper look at the base. The place looked deserted.\u00A0Upon inspection of the ore storage areas and the mining platform, Lizicca found that the\u00A0mining drill was covered in a strange green substance. The windows inside the Hitchhiker containers looked very dusty, and someone had written a small message in one of them: \u0027Beware of K!\u0027. \u0022K either means two things.

The RTGs had long since run out of Blutonium-238, and were actually leaking the stuff, so they had to seal off that area to not contaminate their spacecraft. They entered the science lab, or what was left of it, after slicing a door open with their power-cutter. The door had been locked and sealed to contain something, possibly the same thing that was all over the drill. Shattered glass, fogged-up test tubes, labcoats long since worn lay tattered and ripped. \u0022What in Kerbol went down in here?\u0022 Lizicca said, amidst the chaos of the lab. \u0022Maybe we can use the rovers to explore?\u0022 Asanna suggested \u0022What rovers? I haven\u0027t seen any\u0022 Phonica replied, as Asanna was apparently interested in rovers now. \u0022I know what she\u0027s talking about! Every single \u0027A\u0027 and \u0027B\u0027 class base contains three rovers. Two LKTs (Light Kerbal Transports), and one HCR (Heavy Cargo Rover).

Strapping themselves in to the old seatbelts, which surprisingly didn\u0027t fall apart the second they touched them, they were off. The rover had a top speed of nearly 40m/s, and could stop completely within 5 seconds if need be.\u00A0Asanna tapped Lizicca on the back to get her to stop for a moment, and was pointing at something in the distance. Within minutes, thanks to the rover\u0027s impressive 35m/s speed, they were there. It turned out to be an archway, just sitting in the middle of nowhere, for no apparent reason. \u0022Hold on, I think I remember that there was a small science base near the arch\u0022, Asanna interrupted, amidst the silence. \u0022Well, it doesn\u0027t seem to be here now!\u0022 Lizicca answered. \u0022I can see a bit of something over here, possibly a Hitchhiker container or something\u0022, Phonica said to the group. He had indeed spotted something. Poking out of the grey and black surface was a quarter of a Hitchhiker container, with one of the windows turned upright. \u0022So, they just sank into the ground?

It was put on top of an LV-2 \u0027Smokestack\u0027 launcher, and was rolled out to the Launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmoke And Mirrors\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was held in the early morning, when the Mun was close to Kerbin. The rocket lifted off, carrying it\u0027s special cargo inside a 2.5m fairing. \u0027SRBs jettisoned\u0027, the Controllkerb told Mission Control through the intercom at his place in the room, overseeing the whole operation. Then, there was only smoke. \u0027What\u0027s happening, Wernher? Why is there smoke?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s only the new engine, Gene. The new \u0027Mainsail\u0027 as we like to call it, is very powerful and generates a lot of thrust, therefore creating a large cloud behind it\u0027. He quickly explained. \u0027Second stage jettisoned, Munar intercept achieved\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVelocity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew of the Andromeda was informed by Gene that the rover was coming, and were asked to \u0027prepare\u0027. The payload fairing was split, and the rover decoupled from it. Now it was relying on the skycrane for thrust. \u002750m/s, 48m/s, 44m/s-\u0027 \u0027Ronald, shut up\u0027, Gene told the Controllkerb, as he was relaying the speed back to the PSC. \u00275m/s, prepare for touchdown!\u0027 \u00274m/s, 3m/s...skycrane jettisoned, rover landed!\u0027 The PSC erupted in cheers, but a look of horror was forming on the Controllkerb\u0027s face. \u0027Sir, something\u0027s wrong. The rover isn\u0027t responding. It isn\u0027t appearing on radar, scans, or anything.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t have anything to scan the Mun, silly\u0027, Gene replied. \u0027PSC, something\u0027s happening here! The rover\u0027s disappeared! I\u0027m going to check out the area and see if I can fi-\u0027 Jeb was cut short by something. Screams were heard. Yelling. Crying. Wailing. And then...no more. The intercom went silent. The PSC went silent. Kerbin went silent. Only silence to be heard, silence to be seen...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-31T22:47:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2017 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The_Cat_In_Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-01T22:38:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMilestone Reached!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for 200 views! 200 people have viewed my story so far!

Millions of Kerbals had been watching on their TV\u0027s and other devices, and everyone was scared, fearful for the crew. After ten minutes of trying, Gene told one of the workers to monitor the communications, and alert him if they responded. He then headed into the meeting room at the Astronaut Complex, and called an emergency situation. Suddenly, Wernher, all the other Kerbonauts, and the highest RnD, Engineering, Construction, and Safety Kerbals, burst into the room. Gene guided them to their seats, and began the meeting. \u0027We know that Jeb was talking about seeing something on the surface, just before we lost contact. We know that they were at the base around one of the Mun\u0027s arches, and that Asanna reported that some of the Hitchhiker containers were on their sides, like something had come through here and destroyed the base.\u0027 \u0027So, what do we do?\u0027, the head Engineering Kerbal asked him. \u0027Hey Billy-Bobfel, you know how you guys have been developing advanced AI probes? Can we use one?\u0027, he asked the RnD head, Billy-Bobfel. \u0027Sure...just don\u0027t, don\u0027t break them!\u0027. It was clear that the scientists weren\u0027t very courageous, at least from Gene\u0027s viewpoint. \u0027So, we\u0027re going to build a small satellite, to fly into orbit, and try to get an orbit the speed of the Mun\u0027s orbit. In other words, we\u0027ll be rotating with it, at the same speed\u0027. Gene\u0027s proposal caused a look of fear on Billy-Bobfel\u0027s face, but Wernher was enthusiastic as always.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
