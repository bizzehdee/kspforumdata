I\u0027ve recently restarted the save for version 1.1.3 of the game, due to mod updates and the fact that my design style has somewhat changed. I had spent a fair amount of time exploring Duna and its moons (that mission is now outdated but it is still a good example of what I\u0027ll be doing in this thread), which I\u00A0have images of as an example of what I\u0027ll be doing in future. A lot of images. 85 images to be precise. That album will be shown at the bottom of this post. I\u0027d recommend flicking through it because Duna has had some modifications thanks to Xenonclave, as well as having a new\u00A0\u003Cs\u003Espace potato\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA list of all missions relating to this thread can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138771-extended-kerbol-system-exploration/#comment-2565104\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.

There\u0027s three things that are significant about me as a designer:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI usually prioritise aesthetics over efficiency. If something doesn\u0027t look good, I\u0027ll rarely let it take off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI love to make things modular. My launchers are saved as sub-assemblies, my upper stages are saved as sub-assemblies, my interplanetary transfer stages are saved as sub-assemblies, you get the idea.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI am the sort of person whose approach to building a spaceplane is not a highly precise design process involving such \u0027fun\u0027 maths as figuring out how much fuel and oxidizer are needed\u00A0to 4 significant figures. It instead consists of me being like \u0022well this looks approximately like a plane, hopefully it\u0027ll work\u0022. Results vary from \u0022literally the best engineered, most efficient, and easiest to handle spaceplane that has ever been constructed\u0022 to \u0022it looks good but flies like a moderately aerodynamic brick\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway though, that\u0027s about it for an introduction to this thread.

That particular NPM (Nuclear Propulsion Module) was more guesswork than design on the delta-v to be honest.

This is because Minmus has such low gravity that it\u0027s just easier to conduct that sort of mission. Since I already had the Mercury 1 capsule and am very pleased with how that design turned out, I decided to modify it to use it as a Minmus lander. The numerous additional fuel tanks\u00A0meant that it had a lot of spare delta-v, and probably could\u0027ve worked pretty well as a Mun lander too (but I didn\u0027t think of that when designing Medusa 1). I used a larger service bay to incorporate more science equipment,\u00A0I kept the docking port on top just in case I needed to send a rescue mission (not that that was likely though with the amount of redundancy I build into everything), and I replaced the Swivel engine with a Terrier because I couldn\u0027t clip it far enough into the adaptor whilst maintaining a good aesthetic. In any case, I was quite pleased with how it turned out. Having already spent some time updating the Tano series of launchers to use engines from Vanguard Astrodynamics, and consequently updating my knowledge of their new payload capacities, it was pretty simple to decide to use the Tano X2 for the ~20t lander. This was kind of overkill\u00A0because all of my Tano launchers are designed for transporting things to a 1000km orbit\u00A0and thus have several hundred more delta-v than is actually needed to get their \u0022maximum\u0022 payload to a parking orbit. However, I elected to use the upper stage for most of the transfer burn to Minmus in order to save a bit of extra delta-v on the lander. The lander would easily have been capable\u00A0of several biome hops with this extra fuel considered, but since this playthrough is for extended exploration I decided to only land in the lesser flats and save the\u00A0other biomes for later missions. The 1.25m fairing base at the top did somewhat limit my maximum radius, meaning that\u00A0I had to adjust the initial position of the landing gear, but this was not an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T13:19:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 01:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded mission goals.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T13:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMedusa 1\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission goals:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAchieve a crewed orbit of the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConduct an EVA in orbit of the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGather scientific data from space around the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAchieve a crewed landing on the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConduct an EVA on the surface of the Mun; plant a flag on the surface of the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGather scientific data from the surface of the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReturn all crew members and scientific data to Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qo4gh/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original Mercury 1 capsule which the Medusa 1 command/service module is based on can be found in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139298-eloquent-spacecraft-systems/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Espacecraft showcasing thread\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EDesign and Planning\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the very successful appearance of my new Mercury 1 capsule, I decided to use it for an Apollo-style (Munar Orbit Rendezvous profile)\u00A0Mun mission. The capsule is identical except for the lack of a service bay at the top, since I chose to put all science equipment on the lander (and the fact that the Medusa capsule has solar panels). In an emergency, the capsule could land on the Mun to serve as a habitat for the crew whilst a rescue mission was prepared. The lander is composed of an ascent module and a descent module. The ascent module consists of a docking port, crew capsule, MechJeb pod, and solar panels, as well as a single Iota engine hidden in the toroidal fuel tanks. The descent module has a lot more fuel, and four Iota engines (only one is necessary but it\u0027s good to have a fairly high thrust to weight ratio on landers). This level of complexity wasn\u0027t necessary, but it works well. The lander was over-engineered\u00A0and could\u0027ve done a couple of biome hops to nearby biomes, but I decided to wait until later missions before exploring other biomes.\u00A0Much like with Artemis 1, the size of the fairing meant that I had to adjust landing gear position slightly.\u00A0Once the command/service module and lander were complete, I had to decide on a launch vehicle. I decided to use the Tano Heavy, the latest upgrade to the Tano series of launchers. It is too powerful to get the just-over 20t assembly to Kerbin orbit, but it\u0027s perfect for transporting it to an elliptical Munar orbit with the upper stage (the command/service module engine had to be used to circularise but that wasn\u0027t an issue).

The IPT Red Star was put together out of several of these modules (initially in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to check delta-v information) which were chosen with a specific mission profile in mind: transport crew and cargo for early Athena missions, and assist on later Athena missions. The crew modules can in theory carry 13 kerbals (not including Athena Lab or other\u00A0cargo) but I always give my kerbals a good amount of space on any missions longer than a few weeks. For that reason, the maximum crew capacity of this vessel on journeys to/from Duna\u00A0is 6. For a similar sense of realism, I decided that certain parts of the vessel are pressurised, and other parts are not pressurised. Kerbals can only transfer without EVA between sections which are connected by 1.25m or 2.5m docking ports directly, and which do not involve movement through fuel tanks or non-pressurised sections (I am aware that there is a mod which has a similar effect, but I\u0027d rather not add more mods when I can achieve the same effect manually). I also made the decision that this spacecraft requires at least two crew members in the command pod (a pilot and a [flight] engineer) in order to control it safely once fully assembled. This is another decision for realism purposes only, but it ties in with the 6-kerbal crew capacity for reasons which will become apparent during the Athena 1 mission. I was rather minimalistic with the module design, so the final vessel (including all Athena 1 cargo) consists of only 105 parts. The mass before the Duna transfer is just under 200 tonnes (I think it might be exactly 200 tonnes if the monopropellant tanks were filled). The main safety measures of this vehicle are the vast excess of delta-v, the large heat shields, and the fact that if something goes wrong with the habitation module, the entire crew can survive inside the command module for long enough to get them back to Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EIPT Red Star System Checks\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aEB5f/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetween this mission and the Duna transfer window, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138771-extended-kerbol-system-exploration/#comment-2681223\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EMedusa 2 mission\u003C/a\u003E was conducted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T15:48:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrected link.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T15:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EMedusa 2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EMission goals:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EDeploy first module of Medusa Station in orbit of the Mun\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EDeploy small survey satellite in orbit of the Mun\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAchieve a crewed landing in the Mun\u0027s East Crater using new recoverable lander\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlant a flag on the surface of the Mun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGather surface samples from the Mun\u0027s East Crater\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAchieve orbit of the Mun using the new recoverable lander\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTest docking capabilities of the new recoverable lander by docking with the existing module of Medusa Station\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReturn crew and science data to Kerbin\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/t0qZR/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EDesign and Planning\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMedusa 2 was an interesting mission to design. This was the first time a vessel had to re-enter from a Munar trajectory without a heat shield, and it only just survived the heating. The new lander was based on the Mercury capsule design, since that proved to be effective for a Minmus lander.\u00A0It\u00A0has a lot of excess delta-v in order to leave a lot of room for error, and uses a Swivel engine for a high thrust-to-weight ratio. One good thing about this new lander is that I managed to attach a ladder to it, unlike the Medusa 1 lander. The design proved to be unsafe for re-entry, however it did serve as proof-of-concept for an efficient\u00A0single-stage Mun lander. The station module is a standardised module design which simply had to be attached beneath the Mun lander, and the probe was very simply put together so that it had a reaction wheel, a good amount of delta-v, and enough power generation to transmit its experiment data. The probe was attached where it was because it corrected the slightly misaligned (because of the station module) center of mass.\u00A0Once everything was assembled, it was a simple matter to choose the Jool 3B as the launch vehicle, because that was the smallest one with enough delta-v for the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T03:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is impressive!
