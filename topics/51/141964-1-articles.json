I\u0027m playing KSP since... well for pretty long time, but it is my first post here in this forum. \u00A0Actually most of my time i\u0027m playing with RSS mod. It\u0027s because of Macollo. Once i saw video about he\u0027s Venus mission, i was so impressed by epicness \u00A0of real flights and scales of real planets, so i decided that i must do similar mission. And about half year \u00A0after i did it. I landed on Venus and then took off. Unfortunately i was not recording this flight, so now i have only several screenshots about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple of weeks ago i decided to do another cool thing. While everybody flying to Mars or Moon, i thought that it would be great to get to one of the gas-giant\u0027s satellite. Sure most of them - pretty boring pieces of rocks and ice exept Titan. Titan have atmosphere, so it is possible to fly there. \u00A0In december 2015 i sent there a probe - small unmanned plane with propeller. Thanks to dense atmosphere and low gravity it was flying very well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow i decided to sent there manned mission. I already had a ship, named \u0022Neil Armstrong\u0022, equipped with electric propulsion engines and four nuclear reactors. So i only had to build an SSTO for Titan. Unlike atmosphere of Laythe, air on Titan consists only nitrogen and methane, so i could not use normal jet engines. I choosed \u0022Torch\u0022 nuclear turbojets for my plane. \u00A0I already used them in my mission on Venus. They work very well in dense atmosphere and need no fuel. Also the flight promised to be very long, so i had to load my ship with 200 tons of food, water and oxygen. It should be enough for 13 years of life of four kerbals. Due to very high effectiveness of ion engines, total weight of the ship was only 1000 tons. Unfortunately, ion engines as effective as they are weak, so my TWR during departure burn was very low (approximately 0.07G\u0027s) Because of that and because of my navigational\u00A0mistake, i spent too much deltaV to get to Saturn, so i had to cancel planned landing on Japetus. When i reached Titan\u0027s orbit, i saw mechjeb showing that i have only 7,5 km/s of deltaV left. One moment i even thought that i failed my mission, because 7.5 was totally not insufficiently to get back to Earth. \u00A0Fortunately when I threw the extra food and fuel for reactors, numbers recovered to the acceptable values.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn general, I want to say that this was the most difficult of all my missions, it cost me a lot of nerve cells and red eyes from lack of sleep. But it was totally worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a video of my flight and now i want to share it with you. Actually it is my first ingame-video and it\u0027s not perfect, but i hope you\u0027ll enjoy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/h504wSuIvf0?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart 2\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncoming soon...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-19T15:24:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2016 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Rus_1952\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerwaffe044","CreatedById":143917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T15:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u041E\u0442\u043B\u0438\u0447\u043D\u043E, \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 \u0435\u0449\u0451!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus_1952","CreatedById":165585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T09:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is second part of my video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5q4etso8Vd4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus_1952","CreatedById":165585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T09:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is some screenshots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e9b55ff038147c5621dab41c231f4d4e.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://s8.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2016/06/e9b55ff038147c5621dab41c231f4d4e.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f0a4e107a379e58ea5612c79f1c3ba1f.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://s8.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2016/06/f0a4e107a379e58ea5612c79f1c3ba1f.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022a5089b3557ebe6d2d6c99e469c6ae873.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://s8.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2016/06/a5089b3557ebe6d2d6c99e469c6ae873.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c8a51f5f9e7b1b941d8677b14ff69545.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://s8.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2016/06/c8a51f5f9e7b1b941d8677b14ff69545.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
