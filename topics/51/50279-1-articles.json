Started a new game to avoid editing my persistence file. Got about 100 science points racked up and I just don\u0027t feel like upgrading my parts. Almost got the timing down for burning off empty rockets in a timely fashion and just got a kerbal halfway around the globe on boosters. I haven\u0027t even touched a liquid fuel tank yet. Now I\u0027m obsessed, I\u0027m going to get one of these little monkeys to the north pole and another in orbit before I do my first parts upgrade \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have this fever?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T00:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI sure as hell tried my hardest to do what I could with only the starting pieces but I had to unlock the second tier. The starting pieces are just far too limiting right now. Given a few more updates, some additional parts and the tech tree being shuffled a bit, I look forwards to doing it again but yeah; as much as I like doing more with less, I\u0027m no master and I needed decouplers. Looking forwards to resources as well, you won\u0027t even have to \u0027fake\u0027 it when that happens, you\u0027ll literally have a limited part count as well as part types.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geckgo","CreatedById":76457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T02:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting the twinge, would still like to get to the ice caps, so I\u0027ll probably need to put a liquid engine on top of my stack, lol. I\u0027m also hesitant because I\u0027m still picking mods and my TAC Life Support parts still need to be \u0022tweaked\u0022 to fit in the tree.
