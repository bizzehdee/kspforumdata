That\u0027s screenshotted somewhere on the WDYDIKSPT thread about a week prior to the date of this post. I have really had a hard time repeating that however. Every subsequent attempt, the quad adapters for the rapiers have overheated. Since there isn\u0027t really much alternative to these, I have instead added a tiny patch that ups their thermal tolerance by 400 degrees, and increases their mass by 25%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E// TVR-400L stack quad adapter (2.5m to 4x 1.25m); seems to catch a lot of airflow, gets very hot.\n@PART[adapterLargeSmallQuad]\n{\n\t%maxTemp = 2400 // up from 2000\n\t%mass = 0.25 // up from 0.2\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is not\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stock anymore; but I hope the added mass reasonably balances it out. They\u0027re only structural parts, there\u0027s not a good reason they can\u0027t be made a bit tougher. The ascent is just a little heavier, the descent is vastly safer. Stock parts are very close to being able to handle JNSQ\u0027s scale, but the margin of error is too tight in this case. I am considering also patching the cockpit itself, because it does get very, very close to its threshold on descent. I guess I\u0027ll see with other airframes. I do wonder if a radiator on the top might not also be a big help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EAscent\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good, reproducible ascent under JNSQ made me throw away everything I knew about SSTOs in this game. Speed on air\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t matter nearly as much\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as altitude. The rapiers are there to get us to 20km. Whether we\u0027re at 1200 or 1500m/s doesn\u0027t matter so much as our vertical velocity is as high as we can get it - ideally upwards of 150m/s by 20km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, off the runway; stay low. Hotwings is heavy and rapiers have poor thrust when stationary. She\u0027ll unstick near the end of the runway, not before. Rear and mid flaps deployed, just coast barely gaining altitude, but picking up speed. Use deployment on the tailfin to correct any yaw problems once off the ground; we can\u0027t afford manual inputs because they\u0027re always too strong and the nose will drop.\u00A0 Around 400m/s, cut flaps, use forward canard deployment to begin a smooth ascent; again, no manual input. Aim the nose ~9 degrees above the horizon, which may only need 10 degrees on the canards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom here, the ascent is dead-stick. Honestly, the less those controls are touched, the happier it will be. Around 15-16km, the vertical velocity will stop increasing; add the nervas. Very soon after that, it\u0027ll stop increasing again; add the vector. Hands off that stick. If everything is going well, vertical velocity won\u0027t drop below 120m/s. If it goes below 100, we might not be going to space today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pitch creeps up from 10, to 15, brushing 20; let it. We\u0027ve\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egot\u003C/em\u003E to have altitude in JNSQ. There is no point doing 2500m/s \u0027down\u0027 at 20km and on the level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a payload below 6,000kg, stay hands off until about 50km, at which point gently bring the nose to prograde. We\u0027ll get about 200m/s more out of the vector. It\u0027s not critical, but it is efficient and it gives us more leeway on descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a payload above 6,000kg, just let the vector burn out before touching the controls. Rather than turn prograde with the nervas, we\u0027ll need to keep about a 10 degree pitch above the horizon. That\u0027s how close this ascent is to failing. Hotwings 4 can carry up to 14 tons, but it\u0027s really pushing the fuel budget and we might have to do the descent completely unpowered. It\u0027s possible, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d call it fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe AP might start coming closer when the vector burns out, but that\u0027s ok; by 65km, Hotwings will keep the AP about a minute ahead, as long as the nervas are burning. (Oh, that\u0027s another thing about JNSQ ascent; we pretty much keep the engines on until we hit vacuum.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UPnx11f.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UPnx11f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this profile, a simple 5.3t relay can be lifted to a 90x90 orbit, with about 600m/s still left in the tank, with that cargo still aboard. There\u0027s enough leeway there to rendezvous with something around the 120-150km mark. Heavier cargos really don\u0027t have any orbital options however; although they will go further under their own steam. My standard 5.3t relay carries 3,800m/s and can go to Minmus, Mun, Duna, or Eve (probably an eccentric orbit at this last, but it should be \u003Cem\u003Ean\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not really sure how much range we could pack into the maximum 14 ton mass\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fit it in that cargo bay... maybe I will try to work that out some time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDescent\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could say it was another hands-off experience, but it\u0027s not. The best profile I can come up with requires a high (over 30 degrees, ideally 45 degrees) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, which mandates manual input. Which does tend to make the nose bounce. Once we touch the controls (which we\u0027ll have to eventually), best advice is just pull back on the stick all the way down. It will wobble 30-40 degrees, but that will be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, descent burn; there\u0027s a handy equatorial lake to use as a landmark, west northwest of the desert airfield. Burn until we have an impact point that is about 1/3 of the way between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and the island airfield. If all goes well, we won\u0027t need any fuel at all to land with. Set rear and mid flaps to 30 degrees, canards to max, and deploy them all. The inner air brakes can be used; the outer ones will burn off, so keep them down (set deployment angle to zero).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sJGGeRC.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sJGGeRC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo ahead and slap the atmosphere at a solid 45-50 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

By 43km (probably wrestling the S key all the way), we\u0027ve actually shed about 1km/s, and things are starting to get toasty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there isn\u0027t a big margin of error here. The cockpit will peak around 1430-1440 degrees, and is rated for 1500. Experiments were run with longer descent paths and lower AoAs, but the heat just creeps up for longer and still exceeds the threshold. Best as I can figure, this is actually the safest flight profile. It\u0027s a little tricky and needs to be flown by the numbers, but after three attempts, all three came down smoothly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually by a little over 30km, we should be well under 2km/s, and starting to cool off. Cockpit temperature continues to rise even as other parts are cooling off - not really sure why that happens! But it should stay within its tolerance. Just. By 1400m/s we can pretty much fly as we like, based on our distance to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Using the desert lake as a visual landmark for the descent burn, Hotwings should get to the runway without any input from the engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTouchdown is better now that there are added wheels under the nacelles, rarely swerving or causing any explosions. On the whole, I feel like this is as good as this design can deliver - but I really need to go find out if anyone\u0027s lifting larger cargos in SSTOs, and especially if they didn\u0027t need to slightly patch some parts to do it\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAlso, to the JNSQ team: I apologise.
