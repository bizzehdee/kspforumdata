Using this I can build away from one of the nodes, turn at a right angle, build down, turn a right angle again, and rejoin the bottom node. So long as all of the opposing connectors are of perfectly equal lengths (meaning so long as they\u0027re made of the same parts, really).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to at least build a cube before my computer start to sputter. This part of the station already uses 84 parts, which isn\u0027t too bad... but I\u0027d like to make it much bigger. And yes I realize that in the end the station may well be less stable due to the extra numbers of parts being used, I\u0027m still gonna have fun trying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T05:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, it\u0027s a lot simpler just to use Clamp-o-Tron Sr. docking ports...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T05:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI admire your bravery... but...

With seniors you can ensure a 90 degree connection on the first portion but beyond the first joint it can start to veer off. You can tip-toe your way around it, but I\u0027d rather use connections that just don\u0027t connect until you\u0027re perfectly aligned. Like with the multi-docks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a Sketchup to show you what I mean, with multi-docks this kind of miss-alignment can\u0027t happen.

I think it\u0027s looking good. I should have a proper square done after the next launch. I\u0027ll connect the last corner bit out, then disconnect that whole side and flip it.

I learned something. I had assumed that since the docks connected to their respective components pretty much straight as can be, if the docks connected perfectly you would end up with a perfect square, sadly these two pics will confirm that\u0027s not the case. Essentially, the game will allow a dock even when it\u0027s not perfectly aligned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jsBiZW8.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/jsBiZW8.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gU8UwH7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/gU8UwH7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T04:49:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
