Engines throbbing, she sailed out over the ocean. \u003Cem\u003EVillefranche\u003C/em\u003E was one of the most impressive classes of airship ever to rove the skies of Earth, and the pride of the drilling company that owned her. She was used to carry engineers and equipment to and from the offshore platforms around the globe and, when her busy schedule allowed it, was occasionally chartered for scientific missions such as this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOn this morning she was carrying some kind of submersible slung beneath the main crew compartment. It was a small, round vessel with twin ducted propeller engines at the rear and an appendage at the front that looked like the mechanical equivalent to a flattened crab\u0027s claw on the end of a robotic arm. Forward-facing and lateral view ports allowed the crew to examine the ocean\u0027s depths and operate the arm. The engineers used this type of deep-diving submarine to inspect and repair the submerged components of their rigs, and occasionally to salvage valuables from wrecked craft on the ocean floor. Certain scientists were sometimes foolish enough to want to dive into the waters for reasons other than those of dire necessity. The company\u0027s policy was to let them, as they sometimes made discoveries that were useful to their prospection activities, and the scientists were paying the insurance premiums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EVillefranche\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s destination was not far from the shore and just a few minutes after crossing the coastline, the airship\u0027s Coxswain reversed the pitch of the powerful fans and brought her skillfully to a halt in moments. He spun the wheel to turn the craft slowly into the wind whilst letting the engines idle to keep her spot on the coordinates they had been given. Inside the car, two scientists and the Skipper prepared to climb down the access shaft into the submersible. The Skipper was the last to descend and made sure the hatch was properly sealed behind them. He then dropped into the pilot\u0027s seat and began barking orders at the recovery team in the car above them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAlreet, lads. Away with her!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAye, Skip!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nClamps disengaged with a jolt. A powerful winch began to rotate, letting out cable and allowing the submersible to drop slowly towards the water below. The operation took several minutes, but went flawlessly, as the crew had done all of this a hundred times before and had it down to a fine art. The senior scientist spent the whole time looking anxiously over the Skipper\u0027s shoulder, as if examining the procedure with an intense worried scowl would somehow make things safer. His younger assistant, however, stared out of his lateral port and was transfixed by the ocean rising up to meet them, and by the mesmerizing sight of the swell and spray and the reflection of the low sun scattered by the wave tops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe submersible hit the water with a crash, bobbed for a moment, then settled into a gentle lurch to and fro. More orders were barked, and the cable still attaching them to the airship was released. They were now free to slip beneath the blue waters of the Pacific Ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe submarine was state-of-the-art for its day, and the Skipper was one of the most experienced submariners the company had on its payroll. This close to the coast, they were still on the continental shelf, and the waters were shallow here. The weather was calm, and this dive would be only to a depth of well under a hundred meters, whereas the vessel was capable of depths of thousands of metres without being crushed. The Skipper deftly flicked the switches that filled the ballast tanks and the the submarine disappeared beneath the waves for what everyone expected to be a routine trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nUp on \u003Cem\u003EVillefranche\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s bridge, the Captain received a message from one of their sister ships further out to sea, warning them of stronger winds and rain inbound from the West. He relayed this information to the Coxswain, and then on to the Skipper via the hydrophone attached to the recovery cable still dangling into the ocean. These two scientists had better make their search brief, whatever they were looking for. Higher winds would make recovering the submarine much more precarious. Half an hour passed, as the Captain paced back and forth on the bridge, waiting for further news about the weather.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFurther back in the car, a technician from the drilling company had been entrusted with the task of recording the whole of the dive on tape, via the hydrophone link to the submersible. He idly watched the tape spool slowly from one reel to another, but wasn\u0027t really concentrating on what the voices from below the ocean\u0027s surface were saying. Most of the crew hadn\u0027t even been briefed on the precise objectives of the dive. He\u0027d just heard that they were looking for something on the ocean bed, and hoped to raise it using the sub\u0027s claw if this was possible. He\u0027d didn\u0027t even take any notice when the voices of the two scientists became more excited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat caught his attention and made him grab the headphones to block out the ambient hum of the airship was the familiar sound of the Skipper swearing. On board the airship and surrounded by his crew, the Skipper\u0027s language could be as coarse as that of any ship-mate of the company. He was even well-known for some of his more colourful expressions. But he usually made the effort to hold himself back when in the company of paying customers, especially in the confined space of the sub where his outbursts might be perceived as intimidating for the uninitiated young scientists or stuffy old professors sent by certain academies. Right then, he was clearly resorting to some of the grittiest, less commonly frequented corners of his vocabulary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs the technician listened, the senior scientist seemed to be urging the submariner to get closer to the object they had apparently discovered. Skip was complaining about the amount of silt that the sub had kicked up, and the fact that whatever it was just had to be downstream from them as they made their close approach, didn\u0027t it? But could he do it, the scientist wanted to know, and could they grab the object with the submarine\u0027s mechanical arm?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAye, keep yer shert on ser, I\u0027m doin\u0027 me best \u0027ere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThat was last thing uttered that the technician could make out clearly, as just a few moments later his ears were blasted by a high-pitched electronic sound that warbled through the hydrophone with intense volume, causing him to reflexively clutch his head and then rip off the headphones with a gasp. The small speaker provided with the tape recorder continued to blare this noise out through the airship\u0027s cabin with surprising intensity for its size. And, barely audible above the strident tones and clicks, the occupants of the submersible shouting. This would be the last time the technician would ever hear the Skipper swear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCall the Captain!\u201D he shouted at the recovery team nearby, \u201CSomething\u0027s gone wrong down there.\u201D He rushed over to the nearest viewing port and looked into the waters below, as if staring at the ocean hard enough would give him some clue as to what was going on nearly forty fathoms down. Behind him, the strange sound still pouring from the speaker came to an end, leaving in its wake a wall of static that could only be caused by churning water below the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen a mass of bubbles broke the surface with a mighty bloop, whipping it into a frenzy of foam for a few moments before dying back down. But no submarine, and no Skipper. The technician was dumbstruck. This could only mean one thing: the sub\u0027s hull had been breached. The recovery team started to shout at each other, and a diver got ready to be lowered into the waves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnother ten seconds passed, and then something else was vomited forth from the depths.

This is the first chance I\u0027ve had to write since leaving Drygalski, and you cannot imagine how glad I am to be sitting behind my desk again in one piece. When we got in, I half expected to discover that my colleagues had given me up for dead and taken over my office, and that I would have to pester Froemone to get my favourite slide-rule back and clear a pile of Karanda\u0027s designs off of my desk and into the waste-paper basket where they belong.

The second time round we hit the atmosphere above Africa and screamed right over the Middle East into Asia.

We were still way above the normal altitude for our parachutes to work correctly, and if it hadn\u0027t been for a deep snow drift and the cushioning demise of the remains of our heat-shield, I wouldn\u0027t be here to tell you about it.

One finally buzzed us, just minutes before the capsule\u0027s battery packed in for good, and we managed to make it understood that we had survived, give a detailed enough description of our location, and convince mission control that we weren\u0027t just kidding them when we said we had landed in the Himalayas, like, \u003Cem\u003Efor real.\u003C/em\u003E Then, once the radio lapsed back into terminal silence, we sat back and waited.

The nearest runway was more than a thousand kilometres away in Sriharikota, and there was no chance of landing a plane anywhere near our location. It would have to be a dirigeable, then. But I suspected we were also way above any reasonable operating altitude for an airship, and they might have to drop a land vehicle to drive the last stretch. Hell, we might even end up walking, which was something I was not looking forward to. After spending six weeks between micro-gravity and one sixth of a gee I felt like a ton of bricks, and the last thing we needed was a mountain hike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe\u0027d landed just before sunset, and night came and went, and the cold sank into our bones. At sometime around mid morning, a long-range jet thundered low overhead and air-dropped a hefty looking package of what we assumed were emergency supplies and warm clothing several hundred metres away to the south. After impacting the valley floor it bounced away down the steep slope and, still rolling, disappeared unhelpfully into the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4bF8rc5.png?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00224bF8rc5.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI will spare you the account of two more days of misery, but I will just say that it got to the point where we were mere hours away from drawing straws to decide which one of us would get to eat the other, so that at least one might survive until help arrived. Then we\u0027d heard the sound of the engine of an approaching vehicle making its way up the valley. I\u0027d be spared the conundrum of how to cook my pilot whilst stuck up a frozen mountain side with no matches. What followed was a two day long teeth-rattling journey in the back of a noisy all terrain vehicle, another day by airship (which was slightly more comfortable), and finally a few hours hypersonic across Asia and the Pacific to Omelek.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lCD3OVr.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022lCD3OVr.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThey had all sorts of medical examinations to put us both through the moment we set foot back on the Island. I was barely left alone for another three days. But strangely enough, the one person who I didn\u0027t expect to leave me alone gave me a wide berth during this time. Angun had made just a brief and symbolic appearance at our official reception back at Omelek, before disappearing off back to his lab. He hadn\u0027t attempted to contact me since and I\u0027d just assumed that now he knew I wasn\u0027t going anywhere, he was in no hurry to hear my report for some reason. I certainly wasn\u0027t in any hurry to see him, as I would be spending far too much time in his company during the two years ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JnjS2wH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022JnjS2wH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIn any case, I was far more interested in catching up on the state of the hardware that was being launched for the trip to Mars. This of course was not merely out of professional interest, as my life would once again depend on how well it worked, and before leaving for the Moon I had left instructions for designs that should be fool-proof and enjoy a complete lack of frilly nonsense. This might sound a bit rich coming from the engineer who\u0027d decided that horizontal take-offs on an airless Moon were a Thing, but there would be no backups this time, and no drilling or refueling. We didn\u0027t know enough about our destination to count on anything being usable in situ. The remaining launch capacity we had to spare before the window was not sufficient to go for a complex, heavy mission anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe little detailed knowledge we possessed about the Red Planet and its moons came from a fleet of three probes that had been launched during the same window more than two years ago. After a nine-month cruise, \u003Cem\u003EVers\u003C/em\u003E Eight had been the first to enter orbit over the poles. The \u003Cem\u003EVers\u003C/em\u003E family was our standard interplanetary pioneering probe and this one was quite similar to the first satellites we had sent to orbit the Moon but with a more powerful dish. Once captured, she began mapping the surface and taking pictures that would allow us to select future landing sites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n6io16X.png?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022n6io16X.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnother probe, \u003Cem\u003EBach\u003C/em\u003E, was injected into a higher orbit and made a more detailed radar map of the surface, allowing Margaret and her team to trace out the main geological formations. The question of subsurface water or ice was raised, but we couldn\u0027t be sure if it was there until we had some surface samples to go on, or at least a rover on the ground. This meant the first mission would have to be completely self-sufficient in terms of fuel if we landed, or that we would have to content ourselves with orbiting the planet first to get a better look at what resources would be available to produce fuel. The CO2 atmosphere meant that producing methane was an option, but we\u0027d still need to take the hydrogen with us, or find it locally. Since we hadn\u0027t yet mastered the deceptively tricky art of putting hydrogen into a recipient and keeping it in there for any meaningful length of time, we had decided that our first crewed journey to Mars would not land on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Qdx1CKR.png?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Qdx1CKR.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe most memorable moment of this first journey to Mars was our first landing on an alien world other than our own Moon, a feat accomplished by a plucky little probe called \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E. Aiming for Phobos had been tricky, as it was an absolutely tiny target. Landing on it had been pure guesswork due to its rapid rotation and negligible gravitational field. By the time our probe drifted gently down onto its crazy terrain, our planned landing site inside its largest crater Stickney had long since passed it by and \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E came to ground on a twenty degree slope well outside the crater\u0027s rim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4l06sMm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00224l06sMm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe telemetry showed that the probe had cartwheeled on the spot for a few minutes while its gyroscope tried to figure out which way was down, until we decided that it was probably never going to make up its mind and switched its inertial guidance off. As luck would have it, \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E settled upright and returned the first images of this strange world. It had transmitted data for more than an hour until the landing site had rotated out of reach of our network. It would be the first and only transmission we would get from Phobos, as subsequent attempts to contact the probe had all failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mRROfws.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022mRROfws.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDespite this, we\u0027d determined that Phobos would be a great place to start exploring and that we should include a lander in our mission. With a tiny amount of storeable hypergolic fuel, we would probably be able to bounce around it for ages, and take a significant proportion of it back to Earth with us in our sample canisters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N0xoNIa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022N0xoNIa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMeasurements of Phobos\u0027 gravity also told us that its total density was far lower than that of the dusty and rocky material we\u0027d seen on the surface. This meant that either its subsurface contained much lighter material - such as water ice - or that it was hollow and when we landed on it we would discover that it was in fact an intergalactic alien mothership. This latter hypothesis failed to convince me, as I didn\u0027t believe that any self-respecting advanced civilization would stoop so low as to travel between the stars in something that looks like a potato. Whatever its true nature turned out to be, Froemone couldn\u0027t wait for us to drill holes in it and start looking for fuel. If we could extract it, it would make conquering Mars a hell of a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMy train of thought was interrupted by a brief phone call from Angun\u0027s assistant, requesting that I attend a meeting with the team of Investigators at nine the following morning. I briefly considered inventing an excuse to wriggle out of the appointment \u2013 such as having to interview candidates to look after my potted plant while I was away on an interplanetary trip \u2013 but decided that this was just delaying the inevitable, and I confirmed that I would be present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWho will look after you, then..?\u201D I mused out loud to my office greenery, as I got up from my desk to gaze out of the window at the island and the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean beyond. \u201CNot Froemone, he\u0027ll try and synthesize biofuel out of you, or something.

I was ushered in by his assistant who looked desperately relieved to see that I had in fact chosen to turn up at the appointment, and who consequently would not have to put up with her superior\u0027s displeasure at my absence and scurry round the space centre trying to track me down for another rendez-vous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Investigation Team this morning consisted of Principal Investigator Angun, who was sitting behind his large and rather pretentious marble-topped desk, and Investigator of Planetary Science Margaret who was standing by the bay window that looked eastwards towards the launch pad.

On some days he was full of dry, witty charm, on others he could be as blunt and uncompromising as the back of a shovel. There was no middle ground, and there was no way of telling which way things would go on a given day. He was a master of many scientific disciplines, but above all he had spent many years studying the biology of our planet. Few living Kerbals had traveled around the globe more than he had, studying life from polar microbes to deep-sea plankton, and pointing out that things were not as they should be if the geologists were right and that our planet had been here for more than four and a half billion years. He had been one of the first scholars to be taken seriously when suggesting that maybe we should start looking for answers elsewhere than on our home planet, which is how he\u0027d eventually become the lead scientist at Omelek.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xuYByzW.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xuYByzW.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHis colleague Margaret was a much more predictable character and was generally considered to be the motherly figure of our space programme, well-liked by most of her colleagues. Like Angun, she was also a true explorer and had roamed the surface of the Earth from the Kalahari Craton to the Siberian Traps, trying to unravel its mysteries. Her considerable knowledge of how our planet works had earned her a place as the lead geologist of our team and the second scientist to set foot on the surface of the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022j33pIPc.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j33pIPc.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was Angun who broke the rather weighty silence. \u201CGood morning, Camwise. First of all, allow me to congratulate you for making it home safely despite a few... setbacks. We were all quite impressed by your resourcefulness up there at Drygalski. Will you take some tea?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOh, it was one of his good days, I thought as he poured tea for Margaret and myself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI was expecting to see Bartdon and Steledith here too,\u201D I advanced cautiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CBartdon is extremely busy with preparations for our upcoming mission,\u201D Angun replied. \u201COther projects are scheduled in our absence. As you may know, Bartdon will be in charge of the team while I am away. Steledith was invited to join us but probably forgot about the appointment, you know how she can be. Life will go on here without us, Camwise. Besides, there are a few things I wanted to talk about that are directly related to our journey to Mars. For now, they need only concern the participants in this voyage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOh dear, that sounded a little sinister, I thought. Out loud, I said \u201CI was under the impression that you wanted to hear my account of what happened at Bailly crater.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMargaret spoke gently. \u201CWe have read your report, Camwise. We know you experienced a very traumatic event. We have also spoken to your pilot, Catbeth. Have you recalled any additional details since your return to Earth?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m afraid not,\u201D I admitted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNo matter,\u201D Angun waved a hand and continued. \u201COur team will return to the Moon, most likely before we return from Mars, and a better-prepared mission should bring more answers. Naturally, you must understand that the discovery you made is of the utmost importance and will ensure that our projects continue to be funded by our sponsors. If you were right in guessing that what you saw is a ship of alien origin, then it represents the undeniable proof that life beyond the surface of our planet is possible, and I\u0027m sure that there will be many potential investors. But there is something else I wanted to ask you about.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYour medical report states that you have been experiencing some discomfort since your blackout at Bailly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nUh-oh. So, Angun had access to my medical records now. I was pretty sure there were confidentiality rules covering all things related to health issues that didn\u0027t directly affect mission safety. But I was also pretty sure that people like Angun knew their way around these rules...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYou described your sleep being troubled by unusual tones and rhythmical clicks that may or may not be psychosomatic.

This was getting more sinister by the minute. Margaret nodded almost imperceptibly, then Angun pulled open a draw in his office desk and produced a small tape recorder that he set on the desk in between us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCamwise, I would like you to listen to this recording carefully and tell me if the noise you experience is in any way similar to it,\u201D he said and pressed the play button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autoSizeIframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fmurray-le-minus%2F2016-03-21-215110a\u0022 style=\u0022height:416px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe shrill tones of the signal cut through the tense atmosphere in Angun\u0027s office like a knife. There was no need to voice a reply, as the look on my face certainly betrayed the fact that I recognized it instantly as the same type of noise that had haunted my nights - and sometimes my days - ever since I had approached the ship on the surface of the Moon. It certainly began with the same characteristic pattern of notes, but I couldn\u0027t be sure that the whole sequence was identical. It lasted for nearly two minutes before ending abruptly, leaving a deafening silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhere was that recording made?\u201D I finally asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun hesitated for a moment before he replied. \u201CIn the Pacific Ocean, not far from the coast of South America. Thirty-two years ago.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COn \u003Cem\u003EEarth\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes. I was still a student then and my tutor was a leading expert studying marine biology. He had compiled thousands of underwater sound recordings made around the world and had noticed that a strange background noise was present in some of them. We carried out additional recordings and used triangulation to track down the origin of the sound to a precise spot. We then dived in a submersible to investigate and found... an artifact. We managed to grasp it with the sub\u0027s salvaging claw...\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe paused at this point, and for the first time since I had met him, Angun seemed to show visible emotion. \u201CThen there was an accident, or at least at the time I had assumed it was an accident. The sub\u0027s hatch was equipped with an emergency release system that activated at a depth of eighty metres. I was lucky enough to escape to the surface. My tutor and the submarine\u0027s Captain didn\u0027t make it. We did get the whole dive on tape, however, and the underwater microphone picked up this noise the moment the accident happened.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI was stunned that Angun had never mentioned this incident, nor had any other member of the investigation team. He seemed to guess this and continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CCamwise, you must understand that for many years I had nothing to prove that the death of my tutor and the loss of a drilling company\u0027s submarine was due to anything other than a design flaw or some kind of mechanical failure from the sub itself, except for an unidentified noise on a strip of magnetic tape. The mining companies are powerful and they certainly did not appreciate losing their equipment and their personnel during a scientific research mission entirely unrelated to their usual more profitable activities. For quite a while I suspected some kind of elaborate hoax, or that I had been caught up in a sabotage attempt between rival companies. I certainly did not become Principal Investigator of this project by passing for a crackpot in search of hidden truth, so I kept this to myself until recently. However, I did come to realize that the noise you\u0027ve just heard is some kind of encoded signal, and I attempted to decipher it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAnd it\u0027s some kind of message?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s better than that,\u201D said Angun, pulling a piece of photographic paper out of his desk draw. \u201CIt\u0027s a picture.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iDYe2yJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022iDYe2yJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI stared at the picture for a long while, with its world-shattering implications racing through my mind, before looking back up at Angun. \u201CBut the object you found on the ocean floor, what did it look like?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe gazed back at me thoughtfully, as if he was still considering the matter. \u201CIt was a slab of some sort of black material, perfectly smooth.

CAMWISE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMy meeting with Angun and Margaret had raised as many questions as it had answered, but at least I now knew why they were so desperate to reach Mars. In just a few short weeks we had gone from wondering whether we were alone in this universe, to wondering when we would stumble upon the next piece of memorabilia discarded by careless (but clearly intelligent) aliens in our own cosmic backyard. Angun\u0027s picture of the Martian surface clearly showed some sort of pyramidal structure rising unnaturally from the centre of an otherwise empty plain, and the multi-spectral scans and radar data from our orbiters had allowed us to narrow down the list of candidates to just a couple of possible sites. With this new insight, I got straight back to work in the knowledge that only two months remained before the transfer window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere was certainly no shortage of enthusiasm and progress from the team. A major breakthrough was the fact that Froemone had finally figured out how to get our ship \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E to and back from Mars without needing to stop off at a gas station on the way, which was good news as that was a commodity that clearly seemed to be lacking in that part of the solar system. Our interplanetary cruiser would be boosted out from Low Earth Orbit where she was currently parked by a couple nuclear thermal rockets and their corresponding liquid methane tanks. Once we had corrected our course using any remaining fuel that hadn\u0027t leaked off into the vacuum, and that we were sure that our trajectory would intercept Mars, we would ditch these two tanks in deep space and hope that the Red Planet would be kind enough to kick them into an orbit that never came anywhere near Earth\u0027s. That might sound like we were tempting fate just a little, but hey, the aliens were leaving their stuff all over the place, so why couldn\u0027t we? From what we were seeing, it certainly seemed like a civilisation\u0027s level of technological prowess should be judged by the amount of junk it leaves lying around the solar system...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMars insertion, and the return journey nearly two and a half years from now, would be ensured by a large tank of hypergolic fuel. Experience with some of our probes that had been in space for years now had shown us that the mixture of Aerozine and NTO we used could be relied on to stay put even after very long periods of time. Fully fueled with both the departure and return stage, \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E would weigh in at over two hundred tonnes, about half of which would be burned off to get us to Mars in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe storeable fuel tank had been launched while Catbeth and I were still stuck up in the mountains after returning from the Moon. The two liquid methane tanks would be sent up in quick succession via the two remaining launches we could fit in before the transfer window with our heavy lifter \u003Cem\u003EPrayssac\u003C/em\u003E, and would be topped off by our spaceplane just before \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E broke orbit.

Following the old adage \u201Cif it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it\u201D, they had managed to squeeze our \u003Cem\u003EType G\u003C/em\u003E lunar rover into a fairing and add a hypergolic transfer stage that was compatible with our SSTO payload limit of 15 tonnes. This meant that rovers to Mars were now ten-a-penny, relatively speaking of course, as the launch costs were low and the \u003Cem\u003EType G\u003C/em\u003E was the closest thing we had to mass production. \u003Cem\u003EType G\u003C/em\u003Es Seven through Nine were slated for launch, followed by more if the workshop could churn them out in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226NtaNaO.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6NtaNaO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, there remained only the prickly question of the Phobos lander, and work had started on this design rather late in the day. I knew little about what the team had come up with until this morning when I was invited to the launch pad to witness the first functional tests: only that it would be launched and transfer to Mars separately from \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E (we would rendez-vous with it in high Martian orbit), and that it was compatible with our 50 tonne \u003Cem\u003EDuravel\u003C/em\u003E booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, at ten thirty sharp, Froemone met me at my office and rode with me to the launch pad where the VAB\u0027s latest offering awaited my critical eye. And judging by the fact that Froe was fidgeting, avoiding direct eye contact and uhmming even more than usual, I understood that I should probably expect the worst. While I drove, he was rambling on about the vagueness of the mission requirements on Phobos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CUhm... we had to take into account the fact that the flight profile... uhm... has not yet been specified.

I\u0027d never even heard of such an event until she told me about it, but apparently they were held for most major launches and attended by a mix of reckless young VAB engineers and Air Service pilots and ground crew who would brave the risk of being suspended or fired for the awe-inspiring view of a large rocket lifting off less than a thousand metres away. As Senior Engineer, I suppose I ought to frown on such activities, but Cat knew me well. I wasn\u0027t the sort of guy who gets a bunch of Air Service pilots grounded on his last evening out before a deep space mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe arrived at about T minus twenty after a seemingly endless climb up the service staircase that had me dripping with sweat, but we finally made it out into the warm evening air that baked the roof beneath the airship-pad. Already, a small crowd had gathered near the north end of the building overlooking the launch pad, where \u003Cem\u003EPrayssac\u003C/em\u003E stood fuming hydrogen vapour from her upper stage. Engineers with greasy overalls straight out of the day shift and smart-looking young aircrew turned to see who the newcomers were. Some of them recognised me with obvious apprehension, cutting off their conversations and shuffling nervously, waiting for me to express my inevitable displeasure at their rule-breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNow, do I have to suspend the lot of you, or does someone here have a couple of cold ones for my pilot and myself...?\u201D I grinned.

Omelek is not a large island, so from the top of the one hundred metre tall structure it seemed as if we were floating, completely surrounded by the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean stretching from one horizon to another in all directions. The weather was perfect, and barring any technical issues, it seemed most likely that the launch would go ahead as planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI sat drinking in silence for a while as Catbeth left me to catch up with her fellow aircrew. Gazing into the ocean, my thoughts drifted back to the discovery Angun had made a few thousand kilometers from here over the eastern horizon. Despite having shared this revelation with his fellow scientist Margaret and myself, he had requested that we keep quiet on the matter until we had something better to show than a fuzzy image decoded from some beeping noises recorded on the sea bed three decades ago. Officially, we were still going on a science mission to bring back data from Mars, search for suitable landing sites, and evaluate the possibilities of using local resources for future crewed missions to the surface. We would have three Type G rovers to fling at the Red Planet, and many months in Martian orbit to drive them all over the surface. Once the main scientific objectives were out of the way, Angun would be able to suggest that the rovers should be directed towards the anomalies previously detected by our orbiting probes. If there was a structure on the surface waiting to be found, we would get to it eventually. We would probably have to share our secret secondary objectives with our pilot, Jonnie, but I already knew he would greet this news with the sound of nobody caring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CT minus five minutes.\u201D A small radio someone had brought along and tuned in to mission control announced the rocket\u0027s imminent departure and I stood up and shuffled carefully forward with the others towards the edge of the roof. Little by little, silence fell over the crowd as mission control went through the final checklists, then launch status check, and the \u003Cem\u003EPrayssac\u003C/em\u003E booster was switched over to internal guidance. Then, as the last ten seconds of countdown began, every single pilot and engineer around me raised his or her hands to cover their ears, or pulled well-used earplugs from overall pockets.

From this distance a third of a second passed and then the noise, a noise so loud that it twisted my guts and made it feel like the hands I had clamped over my ears were made of paper, physically shaking me and bringing tears to my eyes. The sound of fifteen meganewtons. Absolutely no-one heard the radio call out \u201Czero\u201D as the clamps were released and \u003Cem\u003EPrayssac\u003C/em\u003E surged upwards on a plume of flame and smoke. With a payload well within her ability, the massive rocket seemed almost spritely as she powered skywards, and in moments the Ratite engine cluster was level with our position on top of the VAB, and the noise got louder still, reaching a crescendo as she started to roll over, almost imperceptibly at first, and head away from us towards the East.

It was a race against time as the hydrolox engine pushed through three, four, five kilometres per second before the upper stage reached the highest point in its ballistic trajectory, already well into space.
