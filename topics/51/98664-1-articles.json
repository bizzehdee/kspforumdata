The largest two celestial transfer is from Moho to Eeloo, its about 5000 dv. Just to get to Moho requires about that much dV from low kerbin orbit. Insertion at Eeloo requires 2000 dV or so. With any decent paylod it requires ion or nuclear technology, or a great mount of time using gravity wells and oberth effects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei choose ION drives and with generous thrust am now stuck in a 5 hour burn to Eeloo. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T15:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what to say, that\u0027s crazy.

IRL probes are programmed to perform their hours/days long burns and ensure they stay on target during it as well. To ensure people still run short burns manually it should take some time to set up an automated burn, otherwise it\u0027d just be autopilot all the way for perfect burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring any long burns it should be possible to either timewarp or switch to other missions until the burn completes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T18:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t really a challenge per se, so it has been moved to Mission Reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T18:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E5 hours long burn...*stares into nothingness*...YIKES!
