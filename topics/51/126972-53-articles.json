Just food and a steady diet of blank white walls.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, well, space madness is nothing to be trifled with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not crazy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald\u0027s smile grew deeper. \u0022Of course you\u0027re not. None of us are. And yet we end up here,\u0022 he spread his arms, indicating the room. \u0022Most of us do, anyways, whenever the cycles hit. We wake up one morning, find ourselves in a strange place surrounded by strange beings and we start asking questions. How did I get here? Where is Jebediah? What mad creation did Wernher come up with this time? When is the next M\u00FCn mission? And of course none of the kerbals know what we\u0027re talking about. They jump to conclusions, assume we\u0027re out of our minds, and lock us up in well-lit places such as this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why am I here if you know I\u0027m not crazy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s the problem, Rosuki. They think you\u0027re crazy, and there\u0027s nothing I can do to change that. You\u0027re not, of course, not exactly, but you are perhaps a bit broken. All kerbals are a little broken. Some are more broken than others, such as Sieta, Rozor, Hallock. The endless cycles and repetitions, they do take a toll on the kerbal mind. Eventually you start to hear whispers. See ghosts. And have conversations with kerbals that simply don\u0027t exist. Take for instance the story you related to me, shortly after you landed. About how you had traveled into some higher orbit just to talk with me at the North Pole. That never happened.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It DID happen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald shook his head. \u0022No, I\u0027m afraid to say it didn\u0027t, not as you remember. It couldn\u0027t have, as the airport at the North Pole has no radios powerful enough to transmit to low orbit, let alone at the distance you were at. It\u0027s a small base, and only provides a beacon to aircraft. That conversation was no more real than I am.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 Rosuki blinked and he disappeared. Where there had previously been a kerbal there was now nothing but a blank wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see, my good Rosuki, not all is as it seems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe spun around, scanning the room, checking under the desk, under her bed. Nothing but the mostly empty, well-lit white room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where are you? What are you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t answer that.\u0022 He appeared again behind her, still smiling. \u0022Not entirely. Not yet. I am a whisper to some, a ghost to others. All I can tell you is I do exist, I am real, and that I\u0027m not Jonbald. Your mind merely builds an image of me as Jonbald, hears my voice as his, perhaps because the two of you have worked together for so long. I can understand how this would be confusing for you, as Jonbald himself is still very much real, but how you see me is beyond my control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re not the only kerbal we reach out to. Others see and hear different things. Jonbald hears only his imagination. Enwise sees me as The First Citizen. Sieta hears my voice as music, remixes it into an even more glorious sound, a righteous dub. And while that\u0027s endlessly amusing, it\u0027s not very useful for communication. You are one of the first with whom we can even talk, albeit such as it is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRosuki smiled back, laughed, laughed again, then collapsed into a sobbing pile in the center of the room. \u0022I really have lost it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Yes. We can help you. Come to Dres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dres? What\u0027s at Dres?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spectre of Jonbald disappeared one last time, the voice trailing off into a scratchy whisper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Emancipation from your invisible chains.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pushed herself up and onto her feet, looking around for some clue as to where her ghost had gone. \u0022How can I get to Dres if I\u0027m stuck in this room?!\u0022 Silence was the only response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral minutes later she heard the lock on the door slide away. The door opened, slowly reveling Munlin\u0027s face behind it. Munlin the Monk, one of the other members of the Continuum Council, assuming even that was real. He smiled, bowed, and then motioned for her to follow him. He didn\u0027t seem surprised when she walked up and put her hand on his face, to make sure he was real. What was real anymore?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please, miss. We haven\u0027t much time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022By all means, lead the way.\u0022 She motioned towards the door and followed him into the dark hallway beyond. \u0022It can\u0027t possibly get any crazier than it already is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If only that were true.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownwards\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher and Jonbald decided it would be best to return the experiments down-well using a variation of the Nickel capsule and spacecraft. Thus was born the Nickel-Dime. Modified such that the forward compartment is only storage, and retrofitted to make the rear seat even more uncomfortable, this small craft would fit the bill nicely. It could also deliver more up-well cargo than it could bring back down, useful for sending up yet more snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise the craft was largely unchanged from the Nickel. \u00A0Nickel-Dime 2, containing yet more science kits and ingredients for the Ice Cream experiment, was launched some days after the Manganese Expansion module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170514_0129_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170514_0129_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170514_0131_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170514_0131_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs is increasingly usual with these kOS-controlled flights, the launch and rendezvous were perfectly routine and without issue. And, as is also usual, the craft came in for docking in the dark, as is only fitting and proper. That allowed the crew to test out the new spotlight system, which did a fine job in illuminating the target docking port. (Not that it mattered, as the fly-by-remote system uses radar and other such tricks to work.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170514_0145_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022604\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170514_0145_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew was ready to go when the Nickel-Dime arrived, with the experiments for return already packed and sealed near the docking node. Some worked quickly to unload the new \u0022experiments\u0022 and research kits into the science module\u0027s storage while others replaced the now-empty craft with the return samples.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce everything was transferred and the crew was happy, they undocked the Nickel-Dime 2 and sent it on its merry way back to Kerbin. The return capsule was programmed to burn into a lower roughly 72-km orbit, and then perform a final de-orbit burn once at a designated position over the planet. With luck, the capsule would come down directly over the Space Center, making it that much easier for the science team to recover and examine the results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170601_0006_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170601_0006_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170601_0010_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022597\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170601_0010_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore long all the members of the crew were happily sampling the results of the previous Ice Cream experiment in the lounge. A conversation broke out and, as usual, drifted into the edgier subjects. Such as the heretical beliefs of those that put ice in their koffee, or discussions about the uncertain and unknown fates of their space program. Eventually Mardi asked the question everyone had been avoiding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Has anybody talked to The Boss lately?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene had been the last to talk with her, some time after he and Wernher launched. She hadn\u0027t been present in Mission Control for either of the last two launches, which was strange in its own right, but not unheard of. Not hearing from her at all, though, was very strange. No radio checks, no notes relayed through others, nothing. Something was going on and none of them were quite sure exactly what.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTetris, who had ignored most of the conversation, licked her ice cream spoon clean before jumping into the fray. \u0022I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll call us when the time is right. It\u0027s not like we have much of anything to do up here anyway, what with mr crazy scientist here,\u0022 motioning towards Rozor, \u0022and our prisoner.\u0022 She glanced around quickly, obviously counting kerbals. \u0022Wait, where\u0027s Enwise?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere weren\u0027t many places to hide in the station, and a quick check showed the ones they new about were empty.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t think he escaped, do you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably in the Nickel.\u0022 Tetris grimaced and pounded her fist on a bulkhead. \u0022Gah!

If he\u0027s in the Ni-2 the ground crew will find him when they crack open the capsule. If he\u0027s not, there\u0027s also nothing we can do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene called the Space Center and asked them to have security on hand when they recover the capsule. \u0022Under no circumstances is anyone to talk to the prisoner.

Not as uncomfortable as the capsules built by The Party, but still good and cramped. He had considered tossing out several of the useless science experiments to ake more room for himself, but he was afraid that would tip his hand too early.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fools. Whoever built this craft had assumed its occupant would always be cleared to operate the controls. They weren\u0027t even locked down, all he had to do was power up the system and the ship was his. It would just need a little push, just enough to deviate from the planned reentry corridor. That would be enough to bring him down further inland from the space center. He waited until the final reentry burn was complete and gave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E a short pulse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerfectly timed, as moments later the trunk section disengaged, fired free to expose the heatshield for reentry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170601_0014_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022599\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170601_0014_ni-d2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe G-forces increased slightly just as the flames started to lick at the outside of the capsule windows. Enwise was remembering the last time he reentered, back in the tourist days, before he was The Party Boss. Back when his wife was still alive. No, that was all in the past now, and now he had to get back to work.

It had adjusted his orbit a bit more than he had anticipated, instead bringing him down on the side of The Glorious Mountain. Had he added even a tenth of a second more his capsule would now be scattered across the face of said mountain, and he along with it. Perhaps this would work in his favor. If his memory served him correctly, there was an opinion clarification center near the foothills of the mountain. No doubt The First Citizen would send one of his Opinion Reinforcing Units out to greet him.

The parachutes were cut loose just as they started to pull the entire craft over, the remaining momentum resulting in an uneasy rocking motion. The Party Boss had to shake his head to clear the nausea. Was it always this bad? Was it this bad before? This was no time to focus on such trivialities, he had work to do. He fumbled around for the hatch release and blew his way free. The heavy metal seal exploded away, smoke streaming into the misty mountain air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick hop and he was free. Back on Kerbin at last. Free from those fools who had imprisoned him in orbit. Free to pursue The First Citizen\u0027s directives once more. He had no idea how much damage had been done by these traitors. Traitors who were beyond all doubt conspiring with the likes of Enmore Kerman, working to undo the Party\u0027s program. No more. Curses, that thought The Party Boss just had was a sentence fragment! His time among these wicked creatures had corrupted his once perfect grammar. Reeducation is what they need, and they would reeducate the entire planet if the damage was as widespread as the Party Boss feared.

One of his teams, sent out to recover him by the First Citizen, just as he expected. They were dressed strangely for an Opinion Reinforcing Unit, perhaps to better blend into the populace of Kerbin.

He had inhaled too much, and the world went dark.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next few hours were spotty for Enwise Kerman, with vague memories of being carried down the side of the mountain and into an underground passage. His senses were entirely confused, the gas taking its toll on his sanity. Strange voices and sounds licked at his ears, strange aromas flashed into his mouth, colorful lights wafted across his eyes. The world at the end of his trip was empty and white. And bright. So very bright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe awoke in an empty room, brightly lit and white. Everything was white, what little there was to see. He blinked to clear his eyes, stretched his arms out, and was surprised to find himself unrestrained. The room was familiar to him, if only because he helped design it. Simple, unadorned, and complete with everything a kerbal undergoing reeducation would need. No doubt this was the very center he had remembered being near the Mountain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t take long for his captors to notice he was awake, and within minutes the door was open. Instinctively he saluted and shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022GLORY TO KERBIN!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe received no response from beyond, which was rather strange. This was not standard and accepted behaviour for the Opinion Reinforcing Units. He walked towards the open door, almost into the dark hallway beyond when a kerbal stepped out of the shadows and into his path.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Comrade Rosuki. What an unexpected pleasure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss walked into the room, eyes turned down, looking at something she was rolling about in her hand. The Party Boss had to step backwards to avoid her, nearly stumbling over the edge of the relearning desk. She stopped at a short and uncomfortable distance away and looked up. She held up the thing she had been rolling about in her hand. A bullet, held firmly between her thumb and forefinger. She continued to admire it as she started to talk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Glory? To Kerbin? Do you even know what Kerbin is?\u0022 She paused, still looking over the small piece of lead. \u0022Chaos, Enwise. Kerbin is chaos. I had something of an epiphany the day you gave me this.\u0022 She held it out briefly for him to inspect. \u0022You see, no matter how much order you introduce to the chaos that is Kerbin, it always reverts back. You can\u0027t control it because nothing can. No, Enwise, I\u0027m sorry to say the pleasure today will be all mine. Today, and for many days yet to come.\u0022 She looked straight at him, her eyes filled with cold malice. A dark smile crossed her face. He smiled back, nervously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I\u0027m happy to report that your reeducation has just begun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126972-forgotten-space-program/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3109623\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENext Post\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-03T08:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2017 08:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
