(As unintentional punishment for my debug menu sins) I plan to go on to a few more islands on laythe and visit vall, bop and pol before coming back to kerbin. The thing about vall though is that i\u0027m not sure I have the TWR to make the planned tail first landing at the anomaly. So I might have to land using a burst of thrust from the rapiers and take off horizontally if RCS cannot push up the nose. It\u0027s going to be fun:cool:. I also have no ladders so to get the kerbals back on the plane I have to lower the gear and do a jetpack assisted jump onto the wing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T16:04:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T03:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I took off from laythe, thinking I had enough fuel to get to vall. However, I totally underestimated the amount of delta-v to take off from laythe with a spaceplane and did not refuel before taking off again. So now I have a ship stuck in vall orbit so I am going to have to send a refueling mission to the ship. which also happens to be in a polar orbit.
