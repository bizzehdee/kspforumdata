recommend Quill18\u0027s Guide to Kerbal Space Program for Complete Beginners.\u00A0 I link Episode 5 below, but you might want to start from the beginning.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EEdit:\u00A0 I\u0027m adding my ground station info here, as asked in the comments.\u00A0 Both Tracking and Mission Control are at level 1 for this mission.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter numerous failures and multiple rocket redesigns I just made my 2nd circularized orbit today, and that\u0027s all I was attempting to do.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EHowever, it came out so perfectly, and with plenty of fuel left over that I decided to attempt a Munar flyby\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d watched Quill18\u0027s beginner\u0027s guide #5 2 or 3 times, and knew generally what I needed to do.\u00A0 I did all my science experiments in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (Low Kerbin Oribt) between 72 and 78 km high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile still not in Map mode I start watching for The Mun to come over the horizon of Kerbin.\u00A0 When I see it I fire my Terrier engine on full throttle and switch to Map mode to watch my apoapsis extend to just over 11,500km (The Mun is just over 11,400km from Kerbin, just in case you\u0027re new here, like I am).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice that the apoapsis of my new orbit is slightly below The Mun\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 I\u0027ve actually tried to do a flyby previously with my apoapsis below The Mun\u0027s orbit, and that didn\u0027t end well.\u00A0 My exit trajectory ended up being angled about 45\u00B0 below the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 There was no way I had enough fuel to make that large a correction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, despite being told that being above/below the plane of The Mun\u0027s orbit would be OK, I decided not to chance it again.\u00A0 I got about 1/3 of the way to Munar orbit and did a course correction by boosting to anti normal with minimal thrust.\u00A0 Apoapsis is now on the plane of The Mun\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all standard stuff so far, but the entertainment is about to begin for poor Jebidiah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I enter The Mun\u0027s sphere of influence I see I\u0027m on the Kerbin-ward side of a hyperbolic orbit passing through The Mun\u0027s center of mass.\u00A0 I decided I wanted to be on the Minmus-ward side of that orbit, and boost accordingly (can\u0027t recall exactly, sorry).\u00A0 I then boost towards the nonexistent apoapsis to raise the periapsis outside of The Mun itself. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s when I realize that, while I have plenty of fuel left, my on board battery is down to about 10.\u00A0 Note to self:\u00A0 Add an external battery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Munar flyby was itself uneventful.\u00A0 However, when I enter Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence again I see that the vector I had leaving The Mun is changed.\u00A0 Periapsis is over 3,000km from Kerbin.\u00A0 I decide that I\u0027m not going to orbit around to apoapsis and boost retrograde to try and drop the periapsis to within 70km of Kerbin.\u00A0 I don\u0027t believe I have the fuel or the electricity to hold the retrograde heading long enough, and I can\u0027t risk a 2nd encounter with The Mun\u0027s gravitational field.\u00A0 (Watch \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/aF-nC_iV8Gs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/aF-nC_iV8Gs\u003C/a\u003E to see what Quill18 does when that happens to him.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears that skewing my orbit is my best option.\u00A0 So I swing the ship around to radial in and commence a maximum throttle burn, knowing that I won\u0027t be able to hold that heading for long.\u00A0 And sure enough I\u0027m out of electricity with periapsis between 2,000km and 2,500km above Kerbin.\u00A0 For some reason my capsule is now rotating, but the nose keeps passing through the radial in heading.\u00A0 So I figure \u0022What the heck\u0022, and start making full throttle burns for about 1 second on either side of that heading as I pass through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it WORKS!!!!\u00A0 I\u0027m excited, I might just get Jeb home yet!\u00A0 I eventually get periapsis down around 60km, but that\u0027s it, I\u0027m out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I approach Kerbin I start to worry about the reentry.\u00A0 There\u0027s nothing I can do about it, but it would be a shame to burn up after all of that.\u00A0 As it turns out, my heatshield is facing prograde.\u00A0 I jetison my now empty engine, and sure as taxes it manages to turn me sideways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t bore you with the mundane details of reentry, suffice to say that the capsule did what it was designed to do.\u00A0 The aerodynamics of the capsule faced the heatshield to prograde, and Jeb landed safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb brought home over 200 science, but this tale was too long already so I didn\u0027t detail every EVA, report, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
