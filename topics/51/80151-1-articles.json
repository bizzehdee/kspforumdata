It took several attempts to design and get the probe into orbit around Kerbin, what with FAR making things a little challenging. I had done a prior test to determine the most efficient orbit for mapping and decided on Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit with a Periapsis of 95km and an Apoapsis of 96km (give or take about 100-800 meters) and my probe, which I have dubbed \u0022Hermes\u0022, is cruising at a luxurious 2250 m/s.

I decided to launch Operation New Horizon today with a slightly modified version of the Hermes Probe. I shed a few items and rearranged parts of the probe to save weight and reduce fuel consumption in order to save as much fuel for the Mun (and maybe Minmus). I took a wild swing at the orbit and put it in a rough inclined lunar orbit at roughly 5 degrees inclination.

I have made my heaviest and most technologically sophisticated probe to date, the Helios Long Endurance Probe. Whats in it? Well, lets say solar power isn\u0027t quite enough to power the engine. Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll see a screenshot of it when I get it in orbit around Eve here in a few minutes. \u0022But Mr.Feather, why are you showing a screen cap now while its still on Kerbin?\u0022 Well, I am so damn proud of it I just want to share the size of this monstrosity to you all. If you have seen the other version of Helios that I have posted in the comments, you\u0027ll note that there is a different launch configuration. I admit I have done some prior testing to ensure that the rocket will make it and well, um, that version didn\u0027t quite make it. This design is untested, but the thrust should be more than enough to get it to Eve (or at least Kerbin orbit.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Helios Long Endurance Probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://oi61.tinypic.com/dzz3ma.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003Ehttp://oi61.tinypic.com/dzz3ma.jpg\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate on Purple Rain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot Helios in orbit and scanning.

Oh silly me, I forgot to mention that this is an Argon fueled Variable Thrust Plasma Engine. At full power it has a default thrust rating of 90. Need more oomph? Just change the level of electricity going into the engine and give yourself a 350 max thrust rating. Running off of argon gas, the whole set up will save you a crazy amount of weight and fuel use. Only two problems. One, its ....ing huge and two, it requires 25MW of continuous power to operate. Yeah, 25 MEGAwatts. Two words though that make it possible, nuclear reactor.

Time to map the Sun. Obviously I will not be able to harvest Kethane on the Sun, but I will be able to map it completely for the lulz. Now way back in the start, I mentioned scanning the sun with a suicide probe. Well I did that and discovered the sun is \u0022DAMNED\u0022 big. So big in fact that I ran the probe for 150 in game days and only managed 3% scanned. So, in light of that fact, I made a carrier ship that will launch 4 smaller probes to tackle the sun. The carrier craft, dubbed Hephaestus, ran into a problem will getting into orbit and ended up losing a crucial middle stage booster en route to a Kerbin orbit. As of now it is sitting at a lopsided, but stable, orbit with enough fuel to do absolutely jack.... (seriously, can\u0027t even retrograde into a crash course with Kerbin) and I have sent a second craft, Aphrodite, to rendezvous with Hephaestus and get it to Kerbol.
