(Sorry for lack of [THE ONES FROM THIS MISSION] pictures, I had a recording but in my excitement I pressed \u0022Don\u0027t Save\u0022. Looks like my viewers only have the return!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch is as usual. Though it was in the evening. It is a bit slow climbing but other than that, pretty normal. Self-destructing first stage a characteristic since the first working incarnation. Oh, how I remember the hard ONLY ROKOMAX as the biggest size of parts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen comes the scary part. The second stage is a BIT underpowered and using the skipper engines. I ditched that one early in favor for the 3rd stage with the Rhino engine. I got into a relatively\u00A0stable orbit then burned for the Mun encounter. Then Insertion burn. That one took quite a CONSIDERABLE amount of fuel. Still enough for home. I hope. Bill (Engineer) and Jeb (Pilot) (See what I did there?) hoped onto the lander and deorbited. Now the trajectory was MORE that REALLY, REALLY BAD. Luckily we landed KINDA safely. I tipped over...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJUST KIDDING!
