The goals of this program are simple: establish a continuous and significant Kerbal presence in the Duna system with a moderate initial investment followed by waves of further development. Fueled by Kethane landers operating from Duna, the infrastructure here will serve as both an experiment for long-term extra-Kerbin habitation and a base for further exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGoals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goals of this program are simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.)

The program is designed to be conducted in waves, groups of infrastructure sent from Kerbin to Duna at each transfer window. Each wave usually has one craft intended for return to Kerbin at the next Duna to Kerbin window, as a way of transporting samples and data gained that cannot be sent over the communications networks. Detailed explanations of each wave are offered in lieu of an extensive writeup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadies and gentlemen, without further adieu, I present to you the Trans-Duna Initiative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3cuwJKBl.png\u0022 alt=\u00223cuwJKBl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWave one contains all the infrastructure needed for immediate operation commencement at Duna. Below is an album containing pictures each ship sent, with explanations of their design and purpose. Wave One was intended to be an almost exclusively orbital operation, with only the lander actually touching down on Duna. In later waves, the surface of Duna will be colonized and explored both robotically and by brave kolonists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/KmUZz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Out of the six vehicles sent to Duna, only the Duna Tender I failed, and that was only because of some timewarp-derived SOI orbit bugs and Ike shenanigans. The crew, still blissfully unaware of their predicament in cryogenic sleep (the lazy jerks), are now stranded in the southern hemisphere of Duna, far out of the intended operation envelope of the Duna lander. We can only hope that they\u0027re able to be rescued before their insufficient survival equipment fails.

A small Ike outpost will be sent with a rebuilt orbital tender to get back and forth from Duna orbit. This allows for Kethane and possibly metal mining operations in the future on both Duna and Ike.
