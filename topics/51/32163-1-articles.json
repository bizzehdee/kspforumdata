Delta-V is looking good so far (although MechJeb has trouble calculating it. 10.000 delta.V? Not a chance... the satellites maybe, but not the cruiser.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruisers are all the same. Basically a lot of tanks strapped to 6 nuclear engines. Payload differs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tanking module that should get 22 X-200-32 tanks around Jool orbit, an exploration carrier with six satellites, two habitats and two tugs and the trustworty Falcon MK II B on the third vessel (should be able to land on two of the moons, possibly a third. No chance on Laythe and Tylo, though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is going the direct route (No LKO.... with those burn times, I\u0027d have to fly THROUGH Kerbin), the others already performed their slingshots around Mun and are waiting for the transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, so good...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
