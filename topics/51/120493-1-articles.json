Perhaps together they could strut together something that could punch through the as-yet theorized Kerman Line and maybe even fall fast enough to miss the ground and hit another celestial body. Perhaps... To that end, they founded IKEA, the International Kerbin Exploration Agency, a multinational public/private partnership between the five states of the USK, the anti-socialist republics of the UASR, and the OU, (as well as number of smaller, vastly less important countries) and several private companies including one J. Kerman\u0027s junkyard and discount rocket parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is their story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*****\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESprout 1a:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite a some pretty impressive construction (and a swimming pool and conference center that screamed \u0027money laundering\u0027), the KSC was practically a ghost town.
