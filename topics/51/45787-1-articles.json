Too low.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn seconds, a huge mountain appeared in the horizon, a probe was let loos but it crashed into one of the 4 nuclear engines, there was no way we could evade now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Main engines retrograde, burn retro rockets!\u0022 screamed Captain Danny, but it was too late, Aldin had jumped in a Lander and crashed landed 100 km away with and Mitwig had stayed in orbit with lander 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 remaining kerbals, prayed and prepared themselves, the engines slowed them down to 89m/s but it was not enough, the crash destroyed a cupola and killed Danny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, Mitwig landed in the crash site to check on his friends, to find the 2 other survivers in the Command module. A grim message was recived at KSC that morning and it was decided that a rescue mission was a go......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading guys and hope you enjoyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDannyG\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odo","CreatedById":69000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T04:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots make all stories better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood job though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
