Sorry about that.\n\n**Part 1**\n\nThe days of space exploration and astronauts venturing into the unknown was over.

The landing was targeted at the large canyon just north of the equator so that the landing site was just to the west of the canyon. The massive chutes on the main module and the hab module were deployed once the atmospheric pressure started registering on the sensors. Only when the spacecraft was a few 100 meters above the ground was the hab module separated and left to descend under chutes, the main module used its RCS to scoot sideways out from over the hab and a short burst of the engines to soften the landing. So the landing was very hectic, but the team pulled it off, here is the result after the automatic inflation of the hab module.\n\n[![303%20screenshot176%202_zpsuhfqdznj.png](http://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg496/forsazh106/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/303%20screenshot176%202_zpsuhfqdznj.png)](http://s1240.photobucket.com/user/forsazh106/media/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/303%20screenshot176%202_zpsuhfqdznj.png.html)\n\nThompbrett Kerman exits the DCT module and steps onto the surface!\n\n[![304%20screenshot177%202_zpsf4ptjfjt.png](http://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg496/forsazh106/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/304%20screenshot177%202_zpsf4ptjfjt.png)](http://s1240.photobucket.com/user/forsazh106/media/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/304%20screenshot177%202_zpsf4ptjfjt.png.html)\n\nHe then heads over to check out the hab module to make sure everything is up and running.\n\n[![305%20screenshot179%202_zpsztlhoxqg.png](http://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg496/forsazh106/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/305%20screenshot179%202_zpsztlhoxqg.png)](http://s1240.photobucket.com/user/forsazh106/media/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/305%20screenshot179%202_zpsztlhoxqg.png.html)\n\nAnd he also flipped the light switches on and planted a flag outside the front door.\n\n[![306%20screenshot180%202_zpsibgd4sw1.png](http://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg496/forsazh106/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/306%20screenshot180%202_zpsibgd4sw1.png)](http://s1240.photobucket.com/user/forsazh106/media/Boostermax%20Duna%20mission/306%20screenshot180%202_zpsibgd4sw1.png.html)\n\nNedcal and Sidgee were next out of the DCT, having paid a premium for the privilege.
