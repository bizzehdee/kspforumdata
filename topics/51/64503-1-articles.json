This initiative will take the form of three orbital stations and a small fleet of support craft built to take on various tasks. Each station will be modular and built from mostly the same components, or modifications there-of, to differing specifications based on role and location. The three stations will include: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELibra Station:\u003C/strong\u003E Built in Minmus orbit, Libra Station is the first station to be constructed and will serve a dual role as an orbital kethane refinery and scientific research outpost, eliminating the need for landers to return to Kerbin after each mission. The station will consist of a core including solar panels, orbital thrusters, and 9 docking ports of 1.25m and 2.5m sizes, a fuel module with storage tanks and kethane refining equipment, at one or two habitat modules with docking nodes supporting .625m and 1.25m sizes, one or two science laboratories, and two solar trusses. The station will also have docking space for up to four 2.5m fuel tanks. Finally, the following craft will be permanently assigned to Libra Station: 1 \u0022Dres K\u0022 kethane lander, 1 \u0022Dres 2\u0022 scientific lander, 1 \u0022Gilly Work-Bee\u0022 material handler.

The station will consist of a core including solar panels, orbital thrusters, and 5 docking ports of 1.25m size, a control module with cupola and attachment points for two to four 2.5m docking ports, four habitat modules two with docking nodes supporting .625m and 1.25m sizes, two permanent fuel tanks of 2.5m size, two gantry docking arms for berthing large spacecraft, and two solar trusses. 1 \u0022Gilly Work-Bee\u0022 material handler will be permanently assigned to Gemini Station, and enough Crew Transfer Vehicles to facilitate evacuation will be present at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapricorn Station:\u003C/strong\u003E The last station to be constructed will be Capricorn Station in Munar orbit. This will primarily be a scientific station with some refueling capabilities, primarily servicing Crew Transfer Vehicles and various landers stationed at the Mun, enabling scientific studies without the need to return to Kerbin. As such, Capricorn Station will be smaller, consisting of one core module of the same type as Gemini\u0027s, two standard habitat modules with docking ports, two science laboratories, two solar trusses, and a 2.5m fuel tank. 1 \u0022Gilly Work-Bee\u0022 material handler and a yet-to-be-designed lander will be permanently assigned to Capricorn Station.
