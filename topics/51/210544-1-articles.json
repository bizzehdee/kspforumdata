(You can technically land on Jool but that\u2019s not traditionally counted). A single launch grand tour is a feat of precision engineering, careful mission planning, and the dedication to actually fly fifteen landings and return safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first mission I\u0027m really proud of was a grand tour mission (which was also my first ever Eve return), and I posted an album of it on this forum. The mothership looked something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lSZ2jX2.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/lSZ2jX2.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this was the entire craft:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XLi7svS.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XLi7svS.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike most grand tours, this is a very large rocket, and I completed this mission mostly through pure brute force. I did use some gravity assists, but this rocket absolutely conforms to the \u0022More Boosters\u0022 philosophy more than anything. This was done in October of 2020, shortly after I started playing the game, and you can see that in the distinct lack of optimized craft design. But that was two years ago, and since then I\u0027ve gotten much better at craft optimization, gravity assists, piloting, and the game in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably the best example of this was the Eve lander of this early mission, which looked like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022b88cSs8.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/b88cSs8.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s a pretty large lander and way overbuilt for Eve, but it got the job done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then a while ago I did a 7.5 ton Eve mission, which I later cut down to just under 7 tons. This is still the record for lowest mass kerballed Eve return without abusing \u201Cmagic wing\u201D type glitches, even without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. It gave me an idea - since this Eve lander was so much smaller than my first one, could I make a grand tour mission, but this time putting a special focus on minimizing mass?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first started thinking about a minimalist grand tour in February of 2022, but exams prevented me from doing much more. I revisited the concept in June, and managed to cobble together something vaguely resembling a craft - but I was occupied with graduating college, and it never flew. Here\u2019s a picture of it anyway - it is similar in concept to my final design:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523739916857901056/988166675482411068/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was only part of the final craft, and was already projected to be much smaller than my previous grand tour - at the time I estimated a final mass of around 20 tons. As far as I\u2019m aware, this would still be the lowest mass grand tour ever, as the lightest I know of is Brad Whistance\u2019s 25 ton craft which made heavy use of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. But this was unsatisfying - I was still leaving a lot of mass on the table. My original grand tour mission used Mammoth engines on the first stage. I wanted to have the mass of my entire craft be less than the fifteen tons of a single one of those engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout a month ago, I finalized the design of the craft:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224uMttju.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4uMttju.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n14.45 tons - well within my mass goal of 15 tons. As you\u2019ll see, I could have pushed this even lower, but I chose not to because I had already met my goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA breakdown of the craft design is below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NPjAvkD.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NPjAvkD.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4648 kg launch stage. The wings at the front aren\u0027t strictly required to lift off but they\u0027re useful for balancing the fuel. Also has a fairing for the less aerodynamic parts of the craft, a landing gear also for balancing, and some clipped fuel tanks. This is actually enough fuel to get all the way into orbit and then some, making this craft a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is the first place where the mission isn\u0027t optimal - it would be better to remove fuel until I need to circularize with xenon instead of liquid fuel and oxidizer, and to launch with slightly less liquid fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vR3e52s.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vR3e52s.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1258 kg Tylo lander. This is a simple two stage Spark powered lander, where the kerbal is expected to finish orbital insertion with an EVA jetpack. This lander could have fuel margins tweaked, or the reaction wheel removed entirely and control achieved purely through gimbal, but that wasn\u0027t necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022M0mHFA1.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/M0mHFA1.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n483 kg Duna/Vall lander. This has an Ant engine and a reaction wheel, which could have been replaced with a Spider engine for extra weight savings. The Kerbal\u0027s personal parachute is used for Duna landing and takeoff because it saves fuel and is lighter than a normal parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FtC37ex.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FtC37ex.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2105 kg Eve lander. For my low mass Eve mission, this went through 13 iterations before arriving at the state it\u0027s in right now. I cannot think of any way to reduce the mass of this without resorting to magic wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first stage is a propeller, used for both landing and ascent. It takes the Eve lander up to 36 kilometers at a very low speed - the basic fins are slower, but are much lighter and have a higher altitude limit than the DLC prop blades. I\u0027ve gotten up to 47 kilometers on a basic fin propeller, but at some point the mass of propeller for the given payload becomes too large. 36 kilometers seemed like a good compromise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second stage is a rocket powered by three Twitch engines. When it burns out, I\u0027m at 56 kilometers altitude with apoapsis above Eve\u0027s atmosphere and about 950 m/s of horizontal speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third stage is a rocket chair with two Ant engines and one Spider engine, which provides all the attitude control. I wait until I reach 90 kilometers to deploy it as it isn\u0027t very aerodynamic. The burn time of this stage is spent skimming the top of Eve\u0027s atmosphere and managing vertical velocity carefully to be near zero, and it takes me to 2650 m/s surface speed. Note that this stage\u0027s engines are also burning during the second stage burn, which decreases specific impulse but increases thrust-to-weight ratio - and on Eve, high thrust is important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final stage is the Kerbal\u0027s EVA pack, about half of which is needed to finish circularizing into a 100x100 km orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EbSVbcZ.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EbSVbcZ.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1518 kg\u00A0 \u0022mothership.\u0022 This module contains all the refills of fuel that I\u0027ll need for the mission - a lot of xenon, a tank of rocket fuel reserved for the Duna segment, and a cargo container with extra jetpacks. I didn\u0027t actually plan to use a third jetpack anywhere in the mission, as I use less than a full jetpack for Eve and then a full jetpack plus a bit of the EVA cylinder for Tylo. The third jetpack was a contingency in case I somehow found myself running out of xenon and needed a landing on one of the lower gravity moons like Minmus or Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Spzl56Z.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Spzl56Z.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4376 kg Laythe lander. Laythe ascent vehicles can get a lot lighter than this, but that wasn\u0027t the goal here. Every single part on this craft is used for some purpose other than Laythe. The Rapier, air intake, wings, and landing gear are all useful for Kerbin ascent, and the wings hold liquid fuel used for Rapier open cycle flight on Kerbin. The upper stage contained in the fairing is an ion tug, which is used for the remainder of the mission. This means that there is zero launch mass penalty with this Laythe lander except for a bit of xenon, which is very light. Contrast this to a dedicated Laythe lander, which may only weigh a bit over one ton, but is only used for Laythe - I would be well over fifteen tons of launch mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea for this is taken from Brad Whistance\u0027s 6 ton Jool-5 mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qdg0v5Y.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qdg0v5Y.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n591 kg ion tug. This single ion engine gets a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of work done. I added just enough battery capacity that it can land on Eeloo without any trouble.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could have used this to land on Vall also, but I decided to simply bring more liquid fuel rather than worrying about staged batteries - I needed the lander for Duna anyway so it wasn\u0027t a big mass penalty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI made a video showcasing this mission, also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nbuMsM8W6fw?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Kerbal Space Program - Grand Tour in 14.4 tons\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve put my comments on it (time stamped) in a spoiler box below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0:07 This is a pretty standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E flight path. I stay at sea level until around 450 m/s and then begin climbing to avoid heat. I actually began the climb pretty late and almost melted the front wings, but survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0:18 The flight path continues with leveling off at somewhere between 19 and 23 km depending on wing load, before switching on the rockets and climbing the rest of the way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0:25 I intended for the single ion engine to do the interplanetary transfer here, but I had spare rocket fuel - why not use it? After it runs out however, I need a lot of kick burns, some of which I didn\u0027t show in the video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0:31 I love gravity assists! But in this case, they\u0027re actually necessary for the mission. My extremely low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E means I will not be able to complete an Eve transfer directly. So I use multiple gravity assists off the Mun and Kerbin to wind up enough energy to get to Eve. This has the additional benefit of requiring 200-250 m/s less delta-v than a standard Eve transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0:45 Now that the Kerbin ascent is done, the Rapier engine is dead weight, and I\u0027ve got two more dedicated landers for the Jool system. Naturally, that\u0027s my first destination. I place the craft into a highly elliptical orbit of Laythe because it takes very little delta-v to escape Laythe\u0027s orbit, and with gravity assists, it takes very little delta-v to obtain an encounter with another planet or moon (single digits is common)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0:54 This Laythe landing took a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of attempts. I basically quickloaded and tried to bounce onto the wheels every time until I ended up succeeding. The spring characteristics on these landing gear were optimized for a much larger craft, leading to a lot of bouncing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1:06 I didn\u0027t intend for parts to burn off here (including my only liquid fuel tanks), but it didn\u0027t really matter as I had more than enough electricity to circularize on the ion engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1:33 Tylo has high gravity and no atmosphere so efficient landings need to be very precise. I tried to start my burn as closely as possible to 0 degrees North, 85 degrees 30 minutes West, and altitude of 9750 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2:10 I landed on a steep slope here so I fired the ion engine immediately to avoid sliding off a cliff - I did come to a stop on the surface with the help of ion thrust however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2:38 Around this time my game\u0027s visuals started breaking. The Ant engine\u0027s plume is barely visible and the night side of planets becomes incredibly dark. You can see that the Ant engine is on by looking for the plume\u0027s outline or the Kerbal Engineer delta-v reading decreasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3:49 I actually hadn\u0027t planned on bringing a Kerbal parachute - this happened by accident when I neglected to check my crew before launching. (I didn\u0027t even plan to bring Jeb!) Fortunately, I was able to use this to my advantage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4:30 I transfer directly from Duna to Dres, which tends to create a larger capture burn, and I cannot capture on a single charge. So I burn at periapsis to both execute a plane change and to set up another Dres encounter later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4:36 I use a technique here called \u0022V\u003Csub\u003Einf\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0leveraging.\u0022 By executing a maneuver in deep space such that my orbit becomes more tangent to that of Dres, my capture burn is reduced. Sometimes, this reduction exceeds the magnitude of my deep space maneuver, so I\u0027m saving delta-v. This also facilitates capture burns on a limited battery charge. (cough cough benjineer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4:53 This is misinformation - Dres doesn\u0027t actually exist. I\u0027m simply landing on an unusually large and detailed asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5:10 Now, the entire craft leaves Laythe orbit because it\u0027s easier to bring everything with me than keep returning to Laythe. Time for more gravity assists!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5:29 The capture is done with ions because basic fins are fragile and burn up easily. They can survive aerobraking but require a lot of babysitting as shown in the subsequent clip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5:45 Spin2Win decoupling probably isn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eneeded\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0here ... but it\u0027s so Kerbal! I couldn\u0027t resist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5:48 Warp rates from 10-100x will massively decrease heating on all parts. I don\u0027t know why but it\u0027s the only way this thing can survive Eve reentry, and it still almost explodes as you can see from the thermal gauges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5:51 This ascent took close to an hour. I wasn\u0027t tabbed into KSP for most of that time, which is why the RPM and mouse look a bit weird (I sped this up 128x)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6:07 I\u0027ve been using a trick called \u0022Magic hand\u0022 where if you pick up an item using EVA construction or a similar mechanic like inventory transfers, the mass of the item disappears. This isn\u0027t ever necessary to complete the mission - I\u0027m just padding my margins by a few tens of m/s, which I could easily fill with more jetpack usage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6:34 The first Gilly landing was not recorded but I didn\u0027t quicksave recently - so I just flew the Gilly landing again. It\u0027s such a low mass body that this really didn\u0027t waste any fuel and it was easier than finding the proper save game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6:47 Again, V\u003Csub\u003Einf\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0leveraging is necessary here because Moho is so close to the sun that relative velocities are very high. I didn\u2019t need the extra delta-v but this makes capturing much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7:44 To get to Eeloo more easily, I encounter Jool first, and then use Laythe to reduce relative velocity. I then use a second Jool gravity assist to do my plane change. This results in a much smaller capture burn than transferring directly from Kerbin.
