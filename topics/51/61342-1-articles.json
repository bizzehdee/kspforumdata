My goal is to get at least 5000 science (that\u0027s about half of the tech tree) but if things go fast I might try for the whole thing. Like in my last career I will avoid landing on the Mun multiple times to harvest science. I want to see how far I can get making only one landing on the Mun and Minmus. I\u0027m also going to try to stay within the spirit of these being probes and not just spaceships with a probe core for a cockpit, so I won\u0027t be making anything heavy enough to warrant Skipper or Mainsail engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you are interested in the manned mission from above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAfter reading a post I wanted to see what science could be done with just probes, to see how \u0027useless\u0027 they are. The Stayputnik is the first probe core you can get, and it\u0027s easy to see that going through Survivability is the cheapest way to get it (5 \u002B 15 \u002B 45). To get exactly 65 science I examined my previous mission logs and as it turns out there are several routes. My choice was exactly one EVA and one crew report from 5 biomes (surface, upper \u0026amp; lower atmosphere, low \u0026amp; high orbit) plus one surface sample and make it a suborbital but not orbital flight to get a total of 65.1 science. There where some alternate combinations by taking low orbit EVAs over more then one biome and skipping high orbit, or by also getting points for a full orbital flight but I decided those where too finicky. Done in the correct sequence I knew the high orbit strategy could be done correctly in one take without luck or guessing or even piloting skills (crew report on pad for surface, eva on ladder for lower atmosphere, then launch and do crew report for lower atmosphere and repeat for upper atmosphere. After engine cutoff and above 40km do safe EVA for upper atmosphere, then coast into low and high orbit doing report and eva for both. Finally land and do eva on ground and collect soil sample. My only variance was I saved some fuel so I could charge up and transmit the last crew report instead of storing it). I did want a more cowardly kerbal but Lanlan was the most cowardly one available for hire.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECareer

I launch it into a high Kerbin orbit (87km x 267km) to get as much Goo science as possible. The circulation burn helped to recharge the internal battery but after the deorbit burn I still needed to charge again at 80 km to keep the core from fizzling out. I chose to use that burn to speed up my descent, since I was still losing charge fast and I depleted more then half my remaining fuel to get the internal battery back up to 100%.

Probes can be used to bring back data, it\u0027s just a matter of if the weight savings are useful. If you are carrying over a certain amount then it makes more sense to do a manned mission instead. This is very true with 0.23 since kerbals can remove data from experiments and store it inside the command pod. That had a big impact on how missions could be structured and what mass was required, since you could pack an unlimited amount of return science into a 0.6t Lander Can. But in some situations a return probe can make sense - it can do a similar mission for a fraction of the mass, so you don\u0027t need a big rocket to launch it or advanced engines like the Mainsails or LV-Ns. Especially for newer players getting things into orbit is usually half of the difficulty and making the payload lighter makes an impossible target become possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBillOne is a sample return mission, but it\u0027s not a good example of a smart one. It\u0027s not by chance that this mission is named after my least favorite kerbal. The goal is simple - grab the material lab science close to Kerbin as quickly as possible so we can move on to other things. The rocket is good and simple, just two stages. We\u0027ll go up, grab the science and come back down. With batteries we don\u0027t have to worry about power for this short mission (there is enough for about 2 hours of operation after the first stage rocket shuts down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VfTRajN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VfTRajN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wlXvyHP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wlXvyHP.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FhtFVaZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FhtFVaZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was one other experiment being done on this mission. I wanted the parachutes to be mostly automated, so that they didn\u0027t open too soon (and snap). I came up with some easy numbers to program in: 300 and 0.3. 300 is the number of meters from the ground before the chutes fully deploy. Unfortunately the next option is 50m which may be a bit too close. 0.3 is the atmospheric density when the chutes first release. That density should release the parachutes at just under 6 km, but which time drag should have slowed us down to under 300 m/s and thus safe for deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d7QfWsH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022d7QfWsH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LFQwbQV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LFQwbQV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the science gained I unlock Space Exploration and get the 2HOT Thermometer, the first instrument that can transmit multiple times.

After another 2 and half hours to get closer to the AP the probe makes a burn to bring it back to Kerbin. It will still take another 13 hours to land but with power almost out the parachute system is armed. From this point on no more power is needed, the ship will right itself with drag when it enters the atmosphere and the parachute system is entirely mechanical and will release when the probe descends below 6000m (real world automatic parachute systems where initially mechanical and the military still uses them since they don\u0027t rely on batteries or computers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/abv696l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022abv696l.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8pbFXFF.png\u0022 alt=\u00228pbFXFF.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i7MjpPk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i7MjpPk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll unlock solar panels and solar arrays with my science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iKXcKKR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iKXcKKR.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wMMAkDh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wMMAkDh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T14:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell . . . you\u0027r doing good.

With solar power available some weight can be stripped off by removing most of the batteries. I could have used solar arrays and still been fine for weight but given how straight forward the flyby was (no landing or other situation where I might need power at a specific orientation and relatively short mission duration) I wanted to try an experiment. I equipped the ship with just 3 flat solar panels. Now normally it is important that probes have good solar coverage - if a probe enters a solar blind spot and time warps you\u0027ll have a dead probe that often can\u0027t be revived. Solar arrays are a good solution because they track the sun, so the only blind spots are if the ship itself blocks the array or array is extended straight toward the sun. 3 arrays typically provide complete coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xvFN1VN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xvFN1VN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TabANWt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TabANWt.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hvn1S1q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hvn1S1q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experiment was to place the 3 flat panels at the 3 compass points (with the ship\u0027s only battery at the 4th for balance), one on the back of the fuel tank and one on the side of each Science Jr. To provide coverage I tilted each panel 10 degrees in a different direction. So the panel on the back is tilted down, one of the side panels is tilted up and the other is tilted forward. In theory this should provide complete coverage so that the probe is kept charged no matter which way it is facing. Testing in Kerbin\u0027s orbit while I waited for the Minmus burn it was a success. The worst case scenario still generated 0.14em/s (8.4em/min) so the arrangement should work for probes right out to Eeloo.

The solar array is slightly larger then normal to support faster recharging (about 7.5 em/s in practical use). Each scan can be repeated a second time to collect about 5% more science if the probe is still over the same position. One area I was looking for was the badlands, I\u0027ve never been able to pick it up. Despite a low and a high orbital pass I couldn\u0027t find it this time either.

The capture is done at low orbit but without bringing the AP down, so that the probe can swing around again complete its orbit at high altitude. In addition to the Midlands and the Highlands the probe measures gravity over 7 large crater formations. When the probe returns to the low altitude PE it circulizes into a low orbit for another pass. Comparisons are made for all the readings made in the high altitude pass, however there where issues when making a comparison scan of the Mun\u0027s East Farside Crater on the dark side of the Mun when the batteries ran out mid transmission.

From it was several days before an inclination change could be made to match Minmus, and then another orbit before a 70 m/s burn that would slowly spiral around the probe to Minmus in 2 weeks. This long path out to Minmus meant that capture would be easy because the probe was in an almost identical orbit - just 3 m/s needed to capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lIXFrQQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lIXFrQQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip in to capture is again used to gather information on Minmus.

The launch system is simple, 2 pairs of boosters strapped to the sides of the probe. You can see (or rather you can\u0027t) why the probe is under 10 tons by the way it hides behind a single T400 tank. The 2 bigger boosters are dropped just as the gravity turn starts.

So I\u0027ve got the Dudvey with the most booster fuel (6L) marked for my attempt to reach Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Huow5nd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Huow5nd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first 2 out are a mission to Duna and it\u0027s moon Ike.

Every body has an area defined as low orbit, for example if you are below 60 km you are in low Mun orbit. On Gilly it is possible to touch down from high orbit without ever reaching low orbit. This is because low orbit starts at 6 km, but some of the terrain reaches 7 km. I was a little concerned as I observed ground scatter (rocks) while still in high orbit, if my landing site was too high I\u0027d need to find another place to take low orbit readings. Fortunately the ground was at 4.5 km so I had enough time to take readings. Landing did pose some other unique challenges - setting down at 4 m/s the springs in the landing legs sent the light probe back into a several minute long suborbital flight. The second time I got my velocity to 0.2 m/s before touch down which resulted in only a tiny bounce before it settled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A8oShwh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022A8oShwh.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SsLcUyP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SsLcUyP.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X362E3o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X362E3o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn to orbit is easy on the thrusters but long on time. It takes so little velocity to get on a suborbital trajectory that it takes 11 minutes of 1x coasting to reach the AP point for a burn. After that it is back to Kerbin. I check my fuel state and decide I can make an immediate return instead of waiting for a better window. I reach Kerbin with 100 m/s left and use the automatic parachutes to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zy8X6kw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zy8X6kw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mlArnm5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mlArnm5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T22:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELemgumOne - 9.962t - 318 science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELemgumTwo - 9.962t - 574 science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I haven\u0027t updated this in a while. My one way lander model Lemgun was sent on two missions to pickup Dres and Eeloo. I\u0027ve been to both planets before so there where no real surprises. Getting LemgumOne to Dres seemed easiest using a mid course correction, once you are out from Kerbin\u0027s orbit it\u0027s a lot easier to adjust the burn to normal and the time to get an encounter then it is to get an encounter from a single ballistic burn in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nnjYNZs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nnjYNZs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Dres isn\u0027t more challenging then the Mun (I would say it is easier as Dres has fewer sharp cliffs and steep inclines).

I\u0027ve got plenty of fuel so I can do a slow landing and touch down at under 2 m/s.

Carrying minimal solar panels LemgumTwo can only charge a bit more then 550 em of excess power each orbit. About 150 em is needed to stay awake when it passes into Eeloo\u0027s shadow so there is only enough charge to transmit one block of data per orbit. I forgot to take a high orbit reading before getting near the capture point so I ended up with an orbit that would let me take higher readings on the dark side.
