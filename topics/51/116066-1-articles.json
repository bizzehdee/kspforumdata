Approximately 42 minutes into the operation, mission control reported critically low power aboard the satellite. Shortly after communication was lost with GeoEye II. Investigations are still ongoing as to the cause of the power loss, initial imaging from ground based telescopes appear to show the full deployment of the solar panels.\n\n![ZoW9jxO.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZoW9jxO.png)\n\nGeoEye II on the launch pad on top of the Pheonix Rocket.\n\n![eNNlLuf.png](http://i.imgur.com/eNNlLuf.png)\n\nFirst stage separation\n\n![pvM0Bl8.png](http://i.imgur.com/pvM0Bl8.png)\n\nFairing ejection\n\n![UX3QLF4.png](http://i.imgur.com/UX3QLF4.png)\n\nSatellite after transfer burn, solar panels are deployed and in full exposure, just not generating any power???\n\nFollowing this failure, the satellites Minmus counterpart, GeoEye III, has been delayed while Chief Engineer looks over the specs."}]}
