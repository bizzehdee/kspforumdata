I also decided to use 100% reentry heat just to be silly (given the broken nature of atmospheres at other planets) and use a few \u0022challenge\u0022 mods like AntennaRange and USI Life Support. If life support ever becomes stock, I\u0027d favor something like USI-LS for several reasons. First, it makes no judgments about Kerbal biology, which IMHO is way better than imposing human metabolisms on alien Kerbals. Second, it allows me to continue regarding Kerbals as a type of fungus able to go into suspended animation in the absence of nutrients. And finally, having 1 generic resource of \u0022Supplies\u0022 fits my headcanon of the Kerbal world being set in an Age of Sail/Discovery/Enlightenment society ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nThis is also a career game, so science works and income must be derived from contracts.

Let\u0027s see... Kerbals have acquired learning disabilities so now you have to lug 3 of them around instead of just 1. The tech tree is wider and longer, there\u0027s more stock stuff on it and everything for a given set of parts is divided up between more nodes even less logically than before, so you need lots more science overall than before. And thanks for aero/heat being things now, you can\u0027t just ignore airplane stuff anymore because you at least need the heatshields and fairings in there. Oh, and science in general has been pretty much deleted from the whole contract thing so now you have to do a bunch of grindy stuff to make money to go fly largely unpaid missions to get science. (Did I mention I am not at all a fan of either Kerbal classes or the 1.x career system?)\n\u003E On top of this, I\u0027ve chosen to play this game with a few other constraints, such as the CustomBarnKit, which significantly increases the cost of upgrading KSC buldings, but OTOH allows you to set a low, fixed rate for pressganging, er I mean hiring-----er, I mean accepting eager volunteers into the space program. And I\u0027m using USI LIfe Support, which is sorta like Snacks! only it\u0027s made by Roverdude so has better support in his other cool mods. Basically, it lets me continue to believe that Kerbals are fungi and can go into suspended animation when they run out of supplies, and they only requires \u0022supplies\u0022 which can be anything. Such as the old-time sailing ship \u0022junk\u0022 I feed my pressganged crews ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). But I absolutely refuse to grind and, planning ahead to spending megabucks on decent flotillas anywhere, I give myself 200% science rewards and 150% cash rewards.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, after making fair progress up the tech tree, including a landing on Mun (postponed until I could land 3 Kerbals reasonably easily)....\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19448383355_ec45fb11b2_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/477/19448383355_ec45fb11b2_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCA3Np)\n\u003E \n\u003E ....it was time to pillage Minmus. From the get-go, without having sent Kerbals there, although there was a SCANsat there by this time. Minmus\u0027 low gravity makes it amenable to hopping biomes relatively easily so I decided to make a major expedition out of it and see how much science I could get. The Mobile Processing Lab can also generate science these days so I decided to give that a try as part of this. Thus, the expedition was composed of 3 ships:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* The MinEx-1 Lab Module\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19452651371_8e0205db49_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/348/19452651371_8e0205db49_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCXVwT)\n\u003E \n\u003E This was essentially just an MPL and a probe core. It had no science instruments of its own, just intended to process data for more science. And the labs work better on the ground than in orbit now, so it was sent out first to land in some big flat area (ended up being the Greater Flats) to be the rally point for the rest of the 1st Minmus Expedition (MinEx-1). It arrived with little fanfare:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19422312326_e57f6cbbfd_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/439/19422312326_e57f6cbbfd_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vAhqMU)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* The MinEx-1 Biome Hopper\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19260823360_762a52d7bb_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3677/19260823360_762a52d7bb_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vm1KKo)\n\u003E \n\u003E This was a lander with every available science instrument for both low space and surface use, stock and DMagic. Otherwise it was mostly 1 big fuel tank so that, upon landing, it would have about 2800m/s for jumping around. The Boffins hoped this would let it hit 4-5 biomes, the OTC at this point in time not even being able to locate Ore, let alone process it. This mission would have been much more effective if this lander could have been refueled But hitting 4-5 biomes in 1 go was still better than grinding each individually, and as the pricetag for the whole expedition was nearly $400K, it would have broken the bank to send out a wad of fuel tanks and a Claw-equipped rover to refuel the lander. But that can be arranged later if necessary.\n\u003E \n\u003E One of the few neat things about 1.0.4\u0027s science stuff is that individual scientists can reset 1-shot experiments (Goo and Materials mostly, plus a few DMagic things). So the plan was for the lander to hit a biome and return to the lab. The resident scientist would then put the data in the MPL for processing and reset the experiments so the lander could go hit another biome. As with the Lab Module, it was sent out crewless and arrived with no excitement.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19448382695_201a31ac8b_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3829/19448382695_201a31ac8b_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCA3B2)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* The MinEx-1 Crew Shuttle\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19442083552_f3decdac5f_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/377/19442083552_f3decdac5f_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vC2L67)\n\u003E \n\u003E Seen here using Space-Y radial decouplers with built-in Sepratrons (which are awesome), this was a 3-seat ship just to take the crew of MinEx-1 there and back, and the 1st 3.75m lifter in this game. The crew was a pilot (Jeb) to fly the Biome Hopper, a scientist (Bob) to reset experiments and process data in the MPL, and an engineer (Bill) to fix any thing that might break.\n\u003E \n\u003E The MinEx-1 Crew Shuttle also had all the science instruments to hit high and low Minmus orbit. The OTC has been saving 2 orbital survey contracts for Minmus to help pay for all this, plus a temperature scan from space above a single high-latitude point, which the Crew Shuttle would do on the way in. After getting this science, it landed beside the other ships without incident.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19260823050_957b9948fe_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/257/19260823050_957b9948fe_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vm1KE3)\n\u003E \n\u003E -------------------\n\u003E \n\u003E So at last, MinEx-1 was all assembled in the middle of the Greater Flats, near the intersection of the equator and the prime meridian. Everybody got out to plant flags for the experience. In the foreground is the Biome Hopper. In the background the Lab Module is to the left and the Crew Shuttle to the right.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19448382455_7ef01d4d5d_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/491/19448382455_7ef01d4d5d_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCA3wT)\n\u003E \n\u003E At this point, Jeb got into the Biome Hopper and fired off its surface science stuff, and Bob went over to grab the data and reset the experiments (plus those the Crew Shuttle had gotten *en route*), while Bill just stayed in the Crew Shuttle because he had nothing to do.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19260828988_fcea28b26a_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3741/19260828988_fcea28b26a_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vm1Mqq)\n\u003E \n\u003E Loading all this into the MPL, Bob discovered that just a single surface sample pretty much filled up the MPL\u0027s data banks so that none of the other dozen or so experiments could even be processed. And the rate of crunching data into extra science was so slow that no more experiments could be processed for over a year. While the MPL had enough junk in the hold to keep Bob fed while doing this and then some, he, being a nob, had better things to do with his time. This looked like more of a job for interns. So the plan was altered to put all the data into the Crew Shuttle to return and just crunch as much as possible of the data from the 1 surface sample.\n\u003E \n\u003E This having been decided, it was time for Jeb to take the Biome Hopper out on a few runs. The SCANsat had by now finished scanning Minmus for low-res radar altimetry and biomes (plus all resources used by OKS/MKS but NOT Ore, the technology for which did not yet exist). The map looked like this:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19442083142_0468f634d8_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3841/19442083142_0468f634d8_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vC2KY3)\n\u003E \n\u003E Besides miniscule gravity, another nice thing about Minmus is that most biomes (other than the poles and some of the \u0022flatter\u0022 flats) are within easy reach of the Greater Flats. In the interests of getting the most science, the idea was to hit was was readily available in the neighborhood. First up was the Slopes biome just west of the landing site, which appeared to have the most benign contours. Besides, the angle of the ground facilitated both landing on it ballistically and heading back to the expedition base.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19262229109_a2e2eeab98_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/481/19262229109_a2e2eeab98_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vm8XCr)\n\u003E \n\u003E Then, after a pit stop to drop off the science and have the experiments reset, it was off to the Lowlands about the same distance to the west.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19452649301_ba304b77de_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/310/19452649301_ba304b77de_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCXUVc)\n\u003E \n\u003E At the slopes, the Boffins had been surprised to see the Biome Hopper jump when the magnetometer was deployed. Here, they could see why. Hmm, a minor desigen flaw. Carry on!\n\u003E \n\u003E Then it was off to a patch of just plain \u0022Flats\u0022 to the NW.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19260827468_2a5774ae13_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/419/19260827468_2a5774ae13_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vm1LYd)\n\u003E \n\u003E After this, another hop west to the Midlands just a bit further away than the Lowlands previously visited. When the Biome Hopper came back from this (1st 5th biome counting the initial landing in the Greater Flats), it only had a bit more than 200m/s left in the tanks. So that was the end of the mission. Jeb took the data over to the Crew Shuttle and climbed in himself. Bob reset the Biome Hopper\u0027s experiments and made sure it was all ready to go should it ever be needed again. He also made sure all the data was cleared out of the Lab Unit.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19442081642_c8fdab5837_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/504/19442081642_c8fdab5837_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vC2Kwb)\n\u003E \n\u003E In the time the 1st Minmus Expedition had been on on the ground, Bob had only managed to create 0.9 additional science. \u0022What a waste of money!\u0022 exclaimed all the Boffins. But as usual, various weirdos amongst the Scientists were already lining up to to go there and finish the job. Anyway, with all Kerbals aboard and 37 experiments in the hold, the Crew Shuttle made ready to depart.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18825885494_cf772bd917_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3683/18825885494_cf772bd917_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/uFzzSE)\n\u003E \n\u003E So off it went, leaving the Lab Module to crunch numbers on autopilot (or maybe not, but that\u0027s what interns are for) and the Biome Hopper nearly out of gas (so any further expedition will need to fix that).\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19442081222_c3948c9cce_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/459/19442081222_c3948c9cce_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vC2KoW)\n\u003E \n\u003E On the way back, Jeb set a Kerbin Pe of 40km and did 4 aerobraking passes to bring the Ap down to a reasonable level of about 500km. The Crew Shuttle, still having beaucoup fuel, then circularized at 85km, ditched everything but the capsule and the remaining 100\u002B days of supplies, and splashed down in the ocean a bit east of KSC.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19260820610_6f0c75b302_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/518/19260820610_6f0c75b302_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vm1JVY)\n\u003E \n\u003E And here\u0027s the payoff:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18825884644_d049b9ab47_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/465/18825884644_d049b9ab47_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/uFzzC1)\n\u003E \n\u003E When MinEx-1 left, there were only 140 science points and $100K in the bank, and the OTC\u0027s rep was at 650. Transmitted data (mostly DMagic stuff that gives 100%) had accounted for abouit 3000 science so, with the 5000 brought home by the Crew Shuttle, the mission turned a profit of over 8000 science (at 200%---4000 or so at 100%). The mission added $1700K to the bank, less $400K to launch it so a profit of $1300K including 3 contracts (at 150% rewards, so nearly $900K at 100%). Rep increased by about 90 somehow (I\u0027m not sure how rep really works). No strategies at all in effect and the OTC\u0027s admin building languishes at level 1.\n\u003E \n\u003E All this science put a nice dent in the remaining nodes of the tech tree, including making it possible to find and use Ore at last. And the Klaw. And rover wheels. And the 2.5m docking port. Yay!\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19422308266_90da93fe45_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3803/19422308266_90da93fe45_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vAhpzU)\n\u003E \n\u003E And, as icing on the cake, the new Asteroid Day contract made its appearance (and was accepted, given I\u0027ve got 35 years to complete it).\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19452647231_50e871bcf9_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/310/19452647231_50e871bcf9_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCXUiv)\n\u003E \n\u003E So, all in all, a fairly productive mission. But the ability of MPLs to generate science seems of little value. It takes forever to get anywhere with it and meanwhle transfer windows are passing by, so you can\u0027t just let it run for the years necessary unless you have some spare Kerbals (which are expensive unless you do a lot of rescues or use pressgangs), and even if you can do that, life support complicates things. In this case, the money spent on the Lab Module would have done better on a 2nd or 3rd Biome Hopper (they only cost $90K, the Lab cost about $150). With multiple Biome Hoppers, I could have hit the other 4 biomes (I only got 5 out of 9) without needing any refueling. Given ground docking sucks (especially if you have zero rover wheels yet), I didn\u0027t yet have the Klaw, and had no way to make my own fuel, multiple Biome Hoppers would have been the cheaper solution.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T03:00:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagani","CreatedById":112067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T02:29:47Z","Content":"good read, really enjoyed it \u002Brep"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T12:06:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E good read, really enjoyed it \u002Brep\n\nThanks! I had fun doing this and learned a lot about some of the new game mechanics. What I learned was that the entire mission above could have been much simplified. I overestimated the utility of the the MPL and designed the mission so that lander had to return to the MPL. This was a HUGE waste of time and fuel because the MPL turns out to be about useless these days.\n\nGiven that even a 0-star scientist can reset Goo and Material experiments in EVA now, there is no absolute requirement for the MPL on a pillaging trip. In fact, all you need is 1 lander with a scientist aboard and enough fuel (either in the lander or in space) to hit the desired number of biomes. Having the scientist aboard removes the requirement for returning to the MPL between biomes, which essentially doubles the number of biomes the lander can hit on 1 tank of fuel. So if I\u0027d just left a (rather smaller and simpler) crew return ship in orbit and sent down only the Biome Hopper and scientist, I probably could have hit every biome with the fuel in the 1 lander."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:25:33Z","Content":"**EPISODE 2: Pillaging Minmus Done Better**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So the Boffins were pretty disappointed with MinEx-1 and decided to go back for the remaining 4 biomes only without the MPL.

All this made the ship about twice as expensive as the older model, at $187K.\n\u003E \n\u003E The MinEx-2 Transfer Vehicle\n\u003E \n\u003E [![18852760463_f3192a2281_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3834/18852760463_f3192a2281_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/uHXjSc)\n\u003E \n\u003E This had a single Mk1 inline cockpit with a heat shield and chutes, the only thing that would return to Kerbin. Below this was a small de-orbit stage, a slightly bigger stage to get home from Minmus, and then a 2.5m transfer stage to push itself and the Biome Hopper Mk 2 out to Minmus. All this on the 2nd 3.75m rocket, this time with bigger tanks that were now available.\n\u003E \n\u003E It cost $166K so the total price for the mission was $353K, nearly as much as MinEx-1.

Maneuverability was assisted not only by lots of torque but also huge Space-Y RCS blocks at strategic points. These things put out about 14x the thrust of regular RCS thrusters but really slurp down the monopropellant.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19285825760_58e5846b03_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/288/19285825760_58e5846b03_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vodU6f)\n\u003E \n\u003E This rather strange plan worked quite well and the MinEx-2 Transfer Vehicle ditched its assent stage once it had met the MinEx-2 Biome Hopper in LKO.

Science doesn\u0027t seem to be able to be pumped from pod to pod so once docked, Bob dragged all the data out of the Biome Hopper Mk2\u0027s can and put it in his pockets, then EVA\u0027d to the Mk1 Inline Cockpit of the Transfer Vehice. But getting into this thing from EVA proved quite a problem due to his orientation relative to the ship. He just could never hit the \u0022magic spot\u0022 to grab or board the cockpit. Finally, the Boffins made some snide remark about \u0022scientists can\u0027t EVA\u0022 and rotated the ship around to make it easier for Bob.

This turned out to be fortunate for several reasons. First, having this fuel and the other stages intended just to come home with meant getting home sooner with fewer aerobrakes. And as it turned out, the 2.5m stage protected the new RTGs on the outside of the Mk1 Inline Cockpit. These burned off during final reentry and if that had happened during an aerobraking pass, Bob would have been up a creek.\n\u003E \n\u003E NOTE TO SELF: Protect RTGs when using 100% reentry heat.

So the 1st order of business for the Boffins was to get the SENTINEL up because it was worth megbucks.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19567562026_a492a768f1_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/427/19567562026_a492a768f1_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vP7St5)[![19407136859_b542404b92_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/511/19407136859_b542404b92_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vyWDDV)\n\u003E \n\u003E It had the new IR Telescope, the new HECS-2 probe core, and the new OX-STAT-XL solar panels. It didn\u0027t have the new HG antenna because that hasn\u0027t yet been integrated into the AntennaRange mod, which is in force in this game. The probe also had way more dV than it turned out to need, but because the Boffins were too drunk to remember to shift the tracking station view to focus on Kerbol instead of Kerbin, they didn\u0027t see the target orbit before launch so felt it better to be safe than sorry.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, the SENTINEL burned on the daylight side of Kerbin just enough to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI, which gave it an Ap a bit beyond Kerbin and a Pe between Kerbin and Eve. This proved to be not far off the mark once the SENTINEL left Kerbin\u0027s SOI and the target orbit appeared. A smple burn about 14 days out from Kerbin served to get the target Ap lined up (which was really the probe\u0027s Pe at this time). Then it was just waiting 57 days to get to the new Pe and finish shaping the orbit. At which point the mission could really begin.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19405745038_fdb487dc77_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/322/19405745038_fdb487dc77_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vyPvV1)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19598052231_61231ac3b1_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/429/19598052231_61231ac3b1_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vRP99g)\n\u003E \n\u003E But long before the SENTINEL got to its 2nd maneuver, lots of stuff happened at KSC. Transfer windows were coming up and things had to be done for them. To start with, it was now past time to start getting a communications network up, so 2 of the usual highly elliptical polar-orbiting commsats with long-range dishes went up over Kerbin. There were also contracts to do magnetic field surveys of both Mun and Minmus, not to get the science but to get M-O-N-E-Y to finance the grandiose schemes of empire.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19567561486_9041c7503f_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/353/19567561486_9041c7503f_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vP7SiL)\n\u003E \n\u003E There was also a window for Jool coming up soon so the Boffins decided to send a pair of polar commsats there just to lay groundwork for the future. The OTC at this point didn\u0027t have enough money to go full-blown empire there yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19405745058_c847640581_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/372/19405745058_c847640581_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vyPvVm)\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: previously had the wrong pic here.\n\u003E \n\u003E This ship tried out a couple new tactics. First, as usual with OTC designs, the single LFO lifter stage got to orbit with a fair amount of fuel left. Rather than just waste this as usual, the Boffins decided to burn it to put the Jool COMMsat Carrier into an elliptical orbit to shorten the burn time (and save fuel in) the transfer stage. Getting this done ahead of time allows doing only the last part of a multiple-pass transfer burn at the time of the node, making the burn more accurate.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19407131479_f397cd22b9_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/510/19407131479_f397cd22b9_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vyWC4a)\n\u003E \n\u003E This seemed to work pretty well so has been adopted as standard when circumstances permit. The technique is to get into a circular orbit to start with and create the transfer node several days in advance. Then burn the lifter\u0027s remaining fuel when the ship is passing the node so its Pe will be there when the time to burn the rest comes. Then scrap the original transfer node and create a new one in the same spot for the same time but using only the remaining dV needed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, the Jool COMMsat Carrier also adjusted its orbit to meet Tylo for a braking gravity assist rather than try to aerocapture (this game has 100% reentry heat, which is stupid I know but I\u0027m doing it just because). With the tools available (not PreciseNode because it\u0027s still stuck on 1.0.2), al lthat could be done was to get the orbit about tanget to Tylos, but no closest approach markers appeared. Fine-turning this encounter will have to wait until the probe is within Jool\u0027s SOI I guess.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19593721935_8ff42d8e20_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/295/19593721935_8ff42d8e20_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vRqWTZ)\n\u003E \n\u003E The OTC also had 3 very lucrative contracts for Duna: building an orbital station at Duna and performing orbital surveys of both Duna and Ike. This required 3 ships: the station, a science return orbiter, and the usual pair of long-range commsats. First up was the station:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19598054731_f8bb72f5b3_z.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3703/19598054731_f8bb72f5b3_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vRP9Tn)\n\u003E \n\u003E This was called the DUMBASS (Duna Ultra-Modern Base And Space Station). Although sent out crewless, it could well serve as the nucleus of a future OTC station so was built accordingly, including a large stash of junk for the future crew to eat. Junk being brined meat of unidentified origin mixed with peas and oatmeal, it would keep indefinitely, just as it had on the old sailing ships of several centuries before.\n\u003E \n\u003E There was nothing special about the commsat carrier, same payload as the one for Jool (and Kerbin), just a smaller lifter. The science orbiter, OTOH, was a bit strange, mostly because it would never touch the DUMBASS. Why waste the supplies there on a worthless scientist how was serving as a guineapig anyway?

It consists of a 1-seat pod, a 2-seat living area converted into a suite of rooms for the 1 occupant, enough junk for well over a year, and a probe core to fly it all. Plus every science instrument known to Kerbals. It also went into an elliptical parking orbit where it will wait a few days before leaving. Mostly so the recently pressganged guineapig can recieve basic training from videos.\n\u003E \n\u003E There was also a window for Eeloo about the same time so the Boffins sent another commsat pair there while they were at it. And that\u0027s all the money they felt like spending prior to getting some return from this 1st Duna Flotilla. Which should hopefully come in just before the Eve window, for which there are other contracts.

After all, Ansen was aboard to take notes ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19444711380_43ddb58a47_z.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3674/19444711380_43ddb58a47_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCgefu)\n\u003E \n\u003E But despite a burn of about 5 minutes, and the engines glowing a lovely cherry red, however, nothing really got hot. Ansen reported his butt did not get any warmer during the burn.\n\u003E \n\u003E Immediately after Ansen DISCO\u0027d out of LKO, it was time to burn the Eeloo Long-Range COMMsat Carrier. This ship had 2 of the stock LV-Ns on it so offers an interesting comparison to the Atomic Age engines after a burn also of about 5 minutes (thanks to being in an elliptical orbit to start with).\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19444674628_9b4d832ce6_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/501/19444674628_9b4d832ce6_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCg3jQ)\n\u003E \n\u003E This ship got considerably hotter than DISCO but not hot enough to be an issue with anything. So the Boffins concluded that for the time being, radiators aren\u0027t necessary on nuke ships, at least if they\u0027re from Kerbin outwards in the solar system. Simulations of operations on Moho, however, have shown that ships (and especially EVA Kerbals) can get hot just sitting there, so radiators will probably be necessary.\n\u003E \n\u003E In a few hous, all these ships left Kerbin\u0027s SOI and set up their mid-course tweaks. In addition, Ansen was told to test all his instruments by getting data from solar orbit, then make sure he could really retrieve all the data.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19637129181_342ff7b322_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/19637129181_342ff7b322_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vVgqmM)\n\u003E \n\u003E Everything worked great and Ansen accomplished his mission without having to let go of the ladders. Remembering the problems Bob (and Scientists) in general had with EVAs, the Boffins had this time installed a \u0022training wheel\u0022 ladder system. 2 normal ladders led from the pod and across the 2.5m adaptor. At the end of the lower ladder, the path forked and then joined a circle of rigid ladder segments all the way around the reaction wheel unit just above the Universal Storage science array. By hitting A or D at the appropriat point while climing on and/or arround these ladders, Ansen could easily switch tracks. So he\u0027d climb down to the fork, then go all the way around the rocket, take the other fork back to the main ladder, and thus regain the pod. It worked like a champ.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Boffins were by now fairly confident that the 1st Duna Expedition would get its paychecks before the Eve transfer window. However, they decided it wouldn\u0027t hurt to get some more money just in case, so they accepted several more jobs within the Kerbin SOI. Besides, this gave them something to do while waiting for 1DF to arrive. To make the time pass more quickly, they only accepted missions with long travel times.\n\u003E \n\u003E The 1st such mission was to build a base on Minmus. The Boffins pointed out that the OTC already had one they didn\u0027t need and were quite willing to sell, but the Scientists threw so many spitwads and shot so many rubber bands across the office that the Boffins relented and agreed to build a new one if the customer was willing to pay. Thus was born the Great Flats Base, which was set up in pretty much the same spot Bob had visited on his 2nd trip to Minmus.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19625664472_3743b91ef1_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/536/19625664472_3743b91ef1_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vUfEio)\n\u003E \n\u003E Another mission was of much more interested both to the Boffins and the Scientists. This job, which paid about $500K, was to get science from near and on a Class C asteroid. There was no need to divert the asteroid, nor even return the ship. This latter requirement suited the Boffins just fine as it allowed a smaller, cheaper rocket and thus maximized profits. The Scientists whined that they wouldn\u0027t get as much data that way, but were eventually beaten into submission. \n\u003E \n\u003E As it happened, a handy Class C asteroid had just been discovered on a path that would impact Kerbin in about 28 days. So the Boffins threw a bone to the Scientists by saying that they were welcome to whatever parts of the probe survived the impact ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19632709525_643b6868d8_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/316/19632709525_643b6868d8_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vUSLxP)\n\u003E \n\u003E As you can see, the Roid-Sniffer Mk 1 duly intercepted the asteroid and got its data. Kaching! But between launch and arrival was quite an adventure. Due to the 2-Body Gravity Glitch, the probe kept falling back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI every few seconds, then popping right back out again. This happened 20 or 30 times in rapid succession, then finally the Roid-Sniffer got stuck in Kerbin\u0027s SOI on a highly elliptical open orbit with a 250km Pe. So the mission seemed doomed at this point and the Boffins wrote it off and went on to do the mid-course burns of the various interplanetary ships.\n\u003E \n\u003E By then, the Roid-Sniffer had gone on around was about to escape Kerbin again so the Boffins decided to give it a look and see what, if anything, could be done about it. And surprisingly, the Roid-Sniffer seemed to have gotten a gravity assist off Kerbin was still heading to meet the asteroid more or less on schedule at more or less the same distance originally planned before all the SOI shenanigans. A slight burn cleaned up the intercept and the Roid-Sniffer accomplished its mission with 2 days to spare before the asteroid entered Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Roid-Sniffer, being merely designed to sniff roids, was utterly incapable of affecting the asteroid\u0027s trajectory or even orientation in the slightest. It was just along for the ride, \u0022But hey, a science-return is a science-return\u0022 as the Boffins reminded the Scientists. The asteroid would hit in the northern hemisphere about 45^ latitude and just on the pre-dawn side of the terminator, so the big question was whether or not it would land in the water. Based on prior experience, the Boffins predicted that the thing would weathervane so the Roid-Sniffer would use the rock as a heat shield, and then parts of it might survive after the rock rolled over on the ground.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19637127211_d55a6db658_z.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3786/19637127211_d55a6db658_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vVgpLP)\n\u003E \n\u003E However, this was not to be thanks to the 100% reentry heat setting.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19637127051_2fff7513d2_z.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3802/19637127051_2fff7513d2_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vVgpJ4)\n\u003E \n\u003E After hitting the atmosphere at about 3200m/s, there was no weathervaning at all. The rock began heating first (#1 above) and totally vaporized at an altitude of 43km (#2 above). The Roid-Sniffer itself was on the verge by that point and began to break up at about 30km (#3 above) with its various parts continuing to burn and explode in tight formation down to about 25km. By then, all that was left of the Roid-Sniffer was its 1.25m service bay, everything inside of which had already exploded (#4 above). The service bay, however, survived until it slammed into the ground at about 40m/s, the only part of the whole assembly to reach the surface.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Boffins thought this was all excellent data on which to plan future missions but the Scientists went into mourning. Especially because they noticed that when the asteroid vaporized, it didn\u0027t explode in flames but popped into a cloud of dust. A cloud of dust that looked disturbingly like the spores released by dying Kerbals. Was the asteroid really alive? Were Kerbals the result of panspermia, descended from the spores of ancient asteroids? Could asteroids bring space plagues or alien invaders to Kerbin? Should asteroids be saved from certain death? Sadly, the data they got from the Roid-Sniffer was inconclusive on all these questions.\n\u003E \n\u003E So here\u0027s the situation as of now, with 1DF about 1/2way to Duna.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19446111199_b888020a19_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/350/19446111199_b888020a19_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vCopni)\n\u003E \n\u003E Tune in next time for whatever happens next.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T22:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Landwalker","CreatedById":92710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T16:07:30Z","Content":"Very much enjoying this!\n\nWhere are those boosters from?

Vacation was actually just this past weekend but I\u0027ve also been quite busy at work. Anyway, I did some kayaking in [Lake Fausse Pointe State Park](http://www.crt.state.la.us/louisiana-state-parks/parks/lake-fausse-pointe-state-park/).\n\n\u003E [![19859621782_be9f24ee09_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/417/19859621782_be9f24ee09_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wfVKE7)\n\u003E Being right next to the Atchafalaya Basin, LFP is naturally full of *les cocodries* (the Cajun bastardization of \u0022crocodiles\u0022 aka alligators).

There\u0027s a town named Cocodrie that was founded in the 1700s, about the time the 1st Cajuns arrived. Anyway, I had an air-conditioned cabin (it\u0027s about 95^F most of the day), the cabin had a pier, and the pier (and all identical piers in the park) had a big red sign about *les cocodries*.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19244370674_261e5251cc_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/457/19244370674_261e5251cc_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vjyqWo)\n\u003E \n\u003E You can also see a little baby gator, only about 5\u0027 long, in the water nearby.

One of these other things was the SENTINEL contract probe and it finally, after going about 1/2way around Kerbol, got into position and started its scan.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19867044485_8da13aa17c_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/334/19867044485_8da13aa17c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wgzNaK)\n\u003E \n\u003E The object of this game is to find 20 Class D asteroids that \u0022threaten Kerbin\u0022. I really have no idea how that\u0027s defined. It\u0027s supposed to happen \u0022passively\u0022 and give me update messages as it finds some but so far I haven\u0027t seen any such thing. I don\u0027t know if I need to track all the asteroids it finds or if this really is passive. Of course, it hasn\u0027t been there very long and the contract has 35 years to run so I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll happen slowly.\n\u003E \n\u003E A necessary consequence of being inside Kerbin\u0027s orbit is that it pulls out ahead of Kerbin over time. Which is good, I guess, because that lets it spot asteroids itself instead of the Tracking Center doing it. But so far, while it\u0027s spotted a couple of Ds and an E, all have been in stable orbits that will never touch Kerbin. The interesting thing, though, is that these orbits are HIGHLY inclined, like 30-45^. Which is kinda cool if I ever want to spend the colossal amount of dV to go visit one. But it does show things the Tracking Center will never see.\n\u003E \n\u003E So time rolled on and eventually the 1st member of the 1st Duna Flotilla arrived. This was the long-range COMMsat carrier. It aerocaptured at about 15km without getting warm at all (Duna\u0027s atmosphere is a doddle) and deployed its COMMsats into up-and-down polar orbits with Aps of 43Mm, 180^ out of phase with each other. Usual stuff.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19679019228_3691476224_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/359/19679019228_3691476224_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vYY7NY)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19871995971_509073a299_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/492/19871995971_509073a299_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wh2b5c)\n\u003E \n\u003E Because the 1st COMMsat had to reach its Ap before the 2nd could burn, which took a week, the 2nd hadn\u0027t burned yet before Ansen arrived in the DISCO. This was the main reason for the whole flotilla, doing contracts for orbital science surveys of both Duna and Ike. Not only did these contracts pay well themselves, but due to a licensing strategy, most of the science data obtained also became cash.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, a probe core was actually flying the ship---Ansen was just there to carry the data that wasn\u0027t transmitted into the pod and reset the experiments so they could be used both high and low at both Duna and Ike. In fact, the Goo and Materials got used twice in each place, once transmitted to get the contract payout, then again to return the remaining data. After grabbing Duna high orbit data as soon as he entered the SOI, Ansen made sure everything was all packed up again and aerocaptured at 16.6km. This cost only 5 out of 800 off the heatshield so there\u0027s still plenty for back at Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19680429789_2e4108039d_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/352/19680429789_2e4108039d_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vZ6m7Z)\n\u003E \n\u003E As soon as the DISCO left Duna\u0027s atmosphere, Ansen grabbed the low-orbit science there and got everything ready again for Ike. Duna contract complete for like $450K. Ka-ching! And as it happened, Ike was in a convenient spot to be hit with a minor burn just above Duna\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19244369104_d627509075_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/275/19244369104_d627509075_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vjyqtj)\n\u003E \n\u003E Then it was time to do science at Ike.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19244368934_3fbb30d5b7_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/261/19244368934_3fbb30d5b7_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vjyqqo)\n\u003E \n\u003E Another $550K in the bank! Then it was right back to Duna where the DISCO put itself into a 250km orbit so that Ansen wouldn\u0027t be tempted to raid the pantry of the DUMBASS when it arrived in the near future. This was done without aerobraking to save the heatshield for Kerbin---DISCO has beaucoup fuel. The probe core then computed the return trip to Kerbin, which wouldn\u0027t start for another 140 days, so Ansen watched Duna go by through the windows a couple times and then went into hibernation. He felt fortunate actually to be coming home eventually. After all, he had accomplished his missions already so the OTC had no real interest in him anymore. They could have just left him there to rot. What he didn\u0027t know was that the Scientists wanted him back so they could dissect him to learn what going to Duna had done to him.\n\u003E \n\u003E All this was accomplished prior to the 2nd COMMsat doing its burn, and right after that happened, in came the DUMBASS. Putting DUMBASS into Duna orbit was worth another $770K to the OTC. Despite being the slow boat to Duna, the DUMBASS turned out to be quite sleek (especially for a station module) so actually had to make the lowest aerocapture pass of the whole flotilla, with a Pe set at 14km and going down to 13.5km in actual use.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19871994001_77a83b62b9_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/556/19871994001_77a83b62b9_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wh2aue)\n\u003E \n\u003E Still, even that low, nothing got at all hot and the DUMBASS captured with an Ap about 2/3 of the way out to Ike. That by itself was enough to cash its check but the Boffins had sent a bigger wad of parts than the contract required because they thought it might be useful in the future. Thus, they had it do 3 burns to raise its Pe to 100km, fix its inclination to 0^, and then circularize without bothering to hit the atmosphere again. At this point, the DUMBASS jettisoned both its transfer stage and its nosecone, both of which then exploded from TAC Self-Destruct charges. This left the DUMBASS with docking ports exposed on both ends.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19840822176_768c6cfaff_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/535/19840822176_768c6cfaff_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wegpbY)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19859619082_2717c5976d_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/343/19859619082_2717c5976d_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wfVJRy)\n\u003E \n\u003E So there it sits. It\u0027s got enough RCS to tweak its orbit rather substantially, it\u0027s got beaucoup electricity (even though solar panels are only 1/2 as good at Duna as at Kerbin), it\u0027s got a large pantry and bunks for 4, and it\u0027s got a science lab that might someday yield a slow trickle of income. But mostly it\u0027s got docking ports. It\u0027ll probably never amount to anything but who knows?\n\u003E \n\u003E And so the Boffins rejoiced in having turned a hefty profit even given the pricetag of the 1st Duna Flotilla. And the checks got cashed about 2 weeks before the Eve transfer window, so the Boffins were able to outfit a respectable Eve flotilla and get it in position with plenty of time to spare. This included:\n\u003E \n\u003E The EF-1 COMMsat Carrier:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19679015238_2123d4c2f1_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/349/19679015238_2123d4c2f1_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vYY6Cb)\n\u003E \n\u003E The EF-1 Eve SCANsat (with full resource-scanning equipment as well):\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19867039395_7feb6d1723_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/304/19867039395_7feb6d1723_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wgzLDZ)\n\u003E \n\u003E And the real reason for going here, the Eve MagSat (another big paycheck):\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19246118103_8f98934eb2_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/403/19246118103_8f98934eb2_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vjHoot)\n\u003E \n\u003E No probe landers for Eve, nothing bothering with Gilly, because the Eve Magsat is paying for everything and it only pays so much. And that includes the Moho SCANsat, an identical payload to the Eve SCANsat but with MOAR dV. This is going with the 1st Eve Flotilla to gravity-brake off Eve to see if that makes it any easier to capture at Moho. This had better work because the Moho SCANsat lacks the dV to do things the hard way, but the Boffins are feeling flush at the moment so are willing to gamble a bit.\n\u003E \n\u003E All of these ships have enouth dV to capture by thrust alone at Eve, but will attempt aerocaptures there relying on their fairings and heatshields. At least the 1st to arrive will, in simulated passes. They\u0027re also, in a new adventure for the OTC, all equipped with radiators. The OTC has not yet in 1.0.4 found any need for radiators (and in fact finds the static variety to be Death incarnate), but going to Eve and especially Moho raises doubts (simulated Moho landings had EVA Kerbals feeling VERY uncomfortable). However, the Boffins were too exhausted from their vacation to remember to put airbrakes on any of these ships.\n\u003E \n\u003E As it happened about this time some VERY luctrative contracts for doing science at Jool came up so the Boffins quickly cobbled together a MagSat for Jool. This will not only (eventually) do its own contract but a couple of other low-hanging fruit, and just the advances on these contracts were worth about $2M. So the Boffins quickly reworked their standard MagSat payload to work without solar panels, stuck a big rocket under it, and shot it off, the next Jool window being only 30-odd days away.

This included a \u0022gamble\u0022 probe for Moho that would gravity brake off Eve in order to save dV. All these ships had previously used the excess fuel in their SSTOATS ascent stages to get into eccentric parking orbits so their transfer burns to Eve were all well less than 1000m/s, the highest being 700. All these ships also had radiators. First off the mark was the Eve SCANsat:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19985535325_343db28861_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/289/19985535325_343db28861_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ws46ng)\n\u003E \n\u003E The radiators unralistically did a great job minimizing the equally unrealistic heat from the LV-Ns.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19985537055_3640d56c40_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/453/19985537055_3640d56c40_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/ws46T6)\n\u003E \n\u003E The rest of EF-1 burned away without incident.

None were eaten by the Blackout Kraken on the way out, Mun not being anywhere near as they left.\n\u003E \n\u003E After leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, each ship plotted a course tweak to finalize its approach. All the ships stopping at Eve arranged to come in fairly polar for the benefit of their probes. The Moho SCANsat, OTOH, aimed to pass Eve on the retrograde side and a bit below the equator to get flung into an orbit approximating Moho\u0027s orbital plane. This maneuver, which would cost about 200m/s, would bring its perhelion down to about Moho\u0027s aphelion. The result was as if the probe had burned straight for Moho to intercept it at its aphelion, but cost just a bit more than going to Eve, a substantial savings on the transfer burn. Of course, it will require some more tweaks and will try to gravity brake off Moho the 1st time by to pull its Ap down from the vicinity of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. But the plan is simply to reduce the dV needed to capture at Moho, and see how long such a flight takes.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19364563533_3b399c6a33_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/372/19364563533_3b399c6a33_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vvbs64)\n\u003E \n\u003E While these ships were en route to their mid-course tweaks, the Boffins decided to make some beer money doing a couple contracts on Mun, one for a surface survey that required a rover, and one for planting a flag.

Because they\u0027d left about 1 day apart, they also arrived about a day apart so there was no hectic juggling act upon arrival. First to arrive was the Eve SCANsat. Once in Eve\u0027s SOI, the Boffins determined it would take about 1700m/s to capture into a 150km orbit. Given that the probe\u0027s carrier (not even considering the probe itself) had about 2500 left in the tank for just this purpose, the Boffins decided to capture into an elliptical orbit with a 2.5Mm Ap and then aerobrake from there. After all, the ship had a heatshield and fairing so might as well use them. In fact, the whole flotilla was that way so this became the plan for all. So SCANsat Eve burned into its parking orbit to wait for the rest of the flotilla to arrive.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![20008046981_c398833199_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/548/20008046981_c398833199_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wu3tig)\n\u003E \n\u003E Next to appear was SCANsat Moho which was just doing a retrograde flyby.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19814735538_6a53dcae6e_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/333/19814735538_6a53dcae6e_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wbXGxm)\n\u003E \n\u003E Once back out of Eve\u0027s SOI, the \u0022not quite aligned\u0022 post-flyby orbital plane would still require nearly 1400m/s to fix after about 3/4 of a solar orbit.

After doing the rquired science in high and low orbits, it then had to remain in position for over a month to complete the contract.\n\u003E \n\u003E It was now time to play with aerobraking, starting with SCANsat Eve. Deciding to be gentle with this, the 1st attempt put the Pe at 85km, just 5km into the atmosphere. This took about 40 units off the heatshield and got the radial RCS tanks rather warm, but absolutely failed to make any noticeable impression on the ship\u0027s Ap, which remained nearly 2.5Mm.

So the Boffins abandoned all hope of aerobraking and did everything else with burns.\n\u003E \n\u003E This meant the fairing was no longer necessary so the Boffins jettisoned it to reduce weight and thus get a bit more dV.

And thus we see why the stock NBS\u0027s GUI has that resource button, tapping which cycles through all those you can see. In this case, the probe could see Ore, Karbonite (even though I don\u0027t have that mod), Karborundum (ditto), MetalOre, Water, Minerals, Uraninite, and Substrate.

The Eve COMMsat Carrier circularized by thrust at 120km first.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![20008045331_bedce2c646_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/421/20008045331_bedce2c646_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wu3sNP)\n\u003E \n\u003E Once the COMMsats were on their ways, the Boffins noticed that the carrier vehicle, which had an OKTO probe core in a service bay, was rather hot. In fact, the probe core and attached RTGs were quite hot and the whole ship, in the thermal display, was glowing orange. This just from the sunshine in low Eve orbit--running the engines didn\u0027t get the ship this hot and it had had time to cool off from that, not to mention having 3 radiators out the whole time. Pointing the heatshield at the sun and opening the service bay doors had no effect on anything. The Boffins found this quite troubling.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19816140039_7d0e88152e_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/479/19816140039_7d0e88152e_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wc5U3T)\n\u003E \n\u003E Even more troubling was that temperatures did not go down when the ship passed around behind Eve. Something was definitely wrong here. It was also annoying because the Boffins intended to crash the carrier vehicle to learn about reentries on Eve. If it was already hot, it might not last as well. But OTOH, if all ships near Eve get hot, then this might provide good data afterall.\n\u003E \n\u003E So the Boffins had the carrier vehicle retroburn for a 30km Pe (starting at 120km) and sat back to await results. The ship entered the air and started heating up. Again, there was no immediate, or even delayed, reduction in speed. So the Boffins started running the engines to help slow down faster. They\u0027d left the radiators out and they finally blew off at 69km.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19380193534_fb11b3311f_b.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/19380193534_fb11b3311f_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vwyykQ)\n\u003E \n\u003E With the radiators gone, the Boffins shut off the engines and let nature take its course from here on. Everything started getting warm and the heatshield started going away but things were still OK. But strangely, one of the 3 radial engines started getting hotter than the others. So the boffins rolled the ship a bit and it cooled off but another started getting hot. Pretty soon, the Boffins had the ship continually rolling, with the engines alternating getting hot as they passed through a position of about 8 o\u0027clock if you viewed the ship from the front. It was a mystery why this one spot got hot when the corresponding 4 o\u0027clock position didn\u0027t.\n\u003E \n\u003E However, despite the rolling, the engines got hotter and hotter with each pass through the \u0022hot zone\u0022 with each revolution. Eventually, at about 35km, all 3 engines exploded simultaneously.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19814830320_5602978fbf_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/529/19814830320_5602978fbf_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wbYbHw)\n\u003E \n\u003E But that was all that blew up. At this point, the remains of the ship started slowing down and the flames started dying. By about 20km, the flames turned to shockwaves and then even that was gone at 18km. Just slightly more than half of the heatshield remained. From there on, the ship just fell slower and slower, parts of it still glowing faintly from the intense heat. It eventually fell into the ocean at 90m/s and was totally destroyed.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19816138709_12fb605fbe_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/524/19816138709_12fb605fbe_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wc5TDX)\n\u003E \n\u003E And the game crashed, so I decided this was a good place to quit.\n\u003E \n\u003E All in all, with 100% heat, things are quite tricky at Eve.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T05:45:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T21:23:56Z","Content":"Great report, really valuable data!

I recommend not using them.\n\u003E \n\u003E On the aerobraking, I didn\u0027t use any airbrakes That might well have made the process effective. But I forgot to put them on these ships, still not even thinking they might now be necessary. It\u0027s just a sign of the generally hosed nature of non-Kerbin air. It\u0027s so thick you can\u0027t touch it any real speed without exploding, but so thin it doesn\u0027t slow you when you\u0027re at survivable altitudes. So you then need engines and/or airbrakes to get any good out of it, even then you still can\u0027t aerocapture without getting ridiculous on heatshields.\n\u003E \n\u003E I was most surprised at the way the radial nukes blew up while the slanty nosecones I used to attach them survived the ordeal. That doesn\u0027t seem right, either.\n\u003E \n\u003E But still, capturing at Eve on thrust alone isn\u0027t that big a hardship, at least for small ships where a couple thousand more dV doesn\u0027t make the thing unwieldy. It becomes more of a problem for anything of substance.\n\u003E \n\u003E Which brings us to the issue of landing. The heatshields are certainly up to the task but nothing else seems to be.

Between them, these contracts all pay about $4 million and at last pay the OTC to do something feasible and useful with Ore and kiickstarting a colony the Boffins wanted to build anyway.\n\u003E \n\u003E So first they designed the ore-extracting lander, simply and unimaginatively called the DUMB (DUna Mining Base).

On Kerbin, it was slow, barely able to reach 90m/s, and had difficulty getting above about 10km. On Duna, however, it was able to reach 1000m/s and suborbital trajectories. If it had a just little bit of rocket on it, it could be an SSTO. Not bad for a prop job, eh? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) And it still retainied nice STOL characteristics for rough-field landings. Plus, the fuel cells are economical enough to allow it to circumnavigate Duna multiple times on a single FL-T400 tank, at least if it can supercruise at 20km and 500m/s.

The DORK wasn\u0027t even getting mach effects, let alone heat, when it was zipping along.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, getting the DORK off the ground proved a bit challenging but the Boffins remembered how they did the Dual FOOL back in \u0027102 and applied a similar solution to the DORK. It worked but I\u0027ll show you that when I launch the real thing, which does need a few tweaks still, besides more testing. But it\u0027s like 60 days before it needs to leave so I\u0027ve got plenty of time.\n\u003E \n\u003E In other news, the SENTINEL has been reporting the occasional asteroid meeting the contract criteria (D-Class \u0022threatening Kerbin\u0022). I think it\u0027s now found 3 such things, about one every 2-3 weeks. This SENTINEL is a bit of a bother because you have to keep it oriented facing away from the sun. It\u0027s unique in the game like that and really highlights how annoying it is there\u0027s no function to maintain facing about the galactic N-S axis. So what I have to do is create alarms for it every week or so and manually correct its facing. Given the slow rate of finding suitable asteroids, I was tempted to launch a few more SENTINELs to speed the process up, but then all I\u0027d be able to do in the game is continually adjust them, so no to that. I looked at the Persistent Rotation mod which solves this problem, but it also does a lot of other stuff I either don\u0027t understand or would rather not have to deal with, so I guess I\u0027m stuck doing this the old-fashioned way.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, tune in next time for something hopefully more exciting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T03:24:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 03:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"B-STRK","CreatedById":126119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:06:28Z","Content":"Very interested to see how the DORK works out!

Do they have a new EC nose-mount prop, and how does it compare?\n\nI use Firespitter, not KAX. I don\u0027t think KAX has electric props but if it does, I might consider switching because Firespitter is a bit questionable at present. Its main dll is required by a lot of other mods (and has some great modules in it that can be applied to stock parts via ModuleManager), so the dll has been updated to 1.0.4 (I think by Roverdude). However, Snjo, the original author, hasn\u0027t had the time to bring all the many parts in the mod up to 1.x standards, although some, like the electric props, apparently have been. So what I do is get Firespitter for the dll and only use a few parts from it: a cockpit, a 2-seat 1.25m crew cabin, a tailwheel, the seaplane pontoons, the electric prop, and an info pop-up part for notes, such as reminding me which action group does what. The latter is especially important for complicated vehicles with lots of action groups but which might go weeks of real time between launching them and using them at their destination.\n\nThe Firespitter electrc props have always produced heat but at the same time have a unique (and rather nifty) air-cooling mechanism built in. Each engine consumes not only EC but also a resource called \u0022FScoolant\u0022. FScoolant is created from the atmosphere via an intake integral to the engine, so the rate of FScoolant production works like IntakeAir for jets--a function of atmospheric density, intake area, and speed. Prior to 1.0, the electric props would just flame out like jets if they got too high and too slow. Now, however, the engine will keep running on EC alone, but without FScoolant it will get very hot. Usually it won\u0027t itself explode, just eventually shut down from overheating, but it can cause whatever it\u0027s mounted on to explode before then ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nAll this works quite well on Kerbin and Eve in terms of limiting the engine\u0027s performance. However, this engine REALLY likes conditions on Duna. The gravity is low, the air is thick enough for a moderate amount of wing to fly in it without much thrust but thin enough not to slow the plane down. Because of this, the electric prop can get moving fast enough to keep itself supplied with FScoolant even above 30km (of course, the air is too thick up there these days, which is a factor). A happy coincidence for Duna explorers ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Looks like you came back recharged and uneaten from vacation, it\u0027s been one great update after another!

However, the Duna transfer window was quite a ways off and there were many other ships going hither and yon that also needed attention. Plus, much confusion was caused by switching from the Traditional (365x 24-hr days) to the New Calendar (426x 6-hr days). This latter was caused by the refusal of the life support systems to work under the Traditional Calendar. So suddenly it was now the middle of Year 3 instead of near the end of Year 1, and all the dates for doing various things now had huge numbers of days, sometimes even years, before they would occur. However, the Boffins eventually managed to deal with this, get on with their work, and tie up a bunch of loose ends. Some of these loose ends were fairly significant, however, so will be described in some detail.\n\u003E \n\u003E First off, though, the Boffins finally declared the DORK ready for service and rolled it out for a press conference.

Thus, total cost to capture was 2000m/s.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![20161241156_f5a5d2ac4a_b.jpg](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3802/20161241156_f5a5d2ac4a_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wHzCA9)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![20161240856_e8f6d15a51_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/429/20161240856_e8f6d15a51_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wHzCuY)\n\u003E \n\u003E So, 1500 to go by Eve, 1400 to match planes, 470 to get an encounter, and 2000 to capture. Total: 5370m/s from LKO to LMO, and a travel time of 1 year, 253 days (426x 6-hr year). The transfer stage still had 520m/s left in the tank. The dV Map shows 4120m/s for this trip which I have never been able to figure out. This 5370 trip is by far my best to date. The Boffins were quite proud of this achievement and immediately began getting seriously drunk ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\u003E \n\u003E But the fuel situation wasn\u0027t the only concern on this mission, the other was the heat from Kerbol just a stone\u0027s throw away.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19564847014_cd5e078abf_z.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/290/19564847014_cd5e078abf_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vNSXow)\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m now using the HotSpot mod which changes the F11 temperature color overlay to make it WAY more useful. With this mod, yellow is about 1/2way to maxTemp instead of just about to explode. Anyway, the 3-minute capture burn got most of the ship warm, besides the intense sunlight. However, after a few minutes, the radiators cooled everything down to a comfortable 700-odd degrees. All the part thermometers went away except for some on the more delicate instruments, but the temperature did stabilize at a survivable level. The Boffins were quite glad they\u0027d put radiators on the ship, and were also glad that the transfer stage was still attached as it had 2 more radiators that the probe alone wouldn\u0027t have.\n\u003E \n\u003E And just as the Boffins were congratulating themselves over the success of their gamble with SCANsat Moho, news arrived that the SENTINEL had completed its task. It only took a little over 2 years.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![20179352312_63bf73c6f7.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/315/20179352312_63bf73c6f7.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wKbsps)\n\u003E \n\u003E As time had been rolling along, the Boffins had noticed that the SENTINEL was finding the odd asteroid and when time had permitted, they\u0027d tracked them. They missed about 1/3 of them, however, which never seem to have appeared on the map, or were there so briefly that they were gone by the time the Boffins got the warp slowed down.\n\u003E \n\u003E Looking at those they did manage to track, the Boffins saw something interesting. They\u0027d found a couple of short-period comets, one with an Ap between Jool and Eeloo and the other slightly beyond Eeloo. There was also a sundiver going from about Kerbin\u0027s orbit down to way inside Moho. But all the others were in more-or-less circular orbits about the size of Kerbin\u0027s, but inclined. And the really interesting thing was that they all, even the comets, crossed Kerbin\u0027s orbit at about the same place.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19999469760_60f94a29ac_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/407/19999469760_60f94a29ac_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wthvA9)\n\u003E \n\u003E While all this had been going on, the 3 shps bound for the outer planets had all done their mid-course tweaks. Here we see the Jool COMMsat Carrier, Jool MagSat, and Eeloo COMMsat Carrier on their way. All still have long trips ahead of them.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![20000884049_bf340f921f_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/342/20000884049_bf340f921f_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/wtpL1r)\n\u003E \n\u003E And then, at long last, it was time to start DISCO from the 1st Duna Flotilla on its way home. Due to the aforementioned problem with the calendar, Ansen had not taken nearly enough supplies with him, and the last transmission received from him, about 80 days before, had been that his last month\u0027s worth had fallen out the airlock. Ansen had thus gone into food-deprived hibernation and had no ability to control the ship (USI-LS, not fatal). But he was, after all, just a science grad student, not a pilot, so DISCO had been equipped with a probe core to do all the flying anyway. The probe core wasn\u0027t at all hungry, thanks to several sources of power, and it duly sent DISCO on its way.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![19564846534_e3983f1c34_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/400/19564846534_e3983f1c34_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vNSXff)\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks to the completion of the SENTINAL contract, the OTC now had over $11M in the bank. That was starting to get into the range for major colonial projects, remembering that they would have continuing expenses until (and if) they could be made self-sufficient. But all that would take a long time. For now, it was time to make the final preparations for the 2nd Duna Expedition.\n\u003E \n\u003E Tune in next time to see that get on its way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T15:35:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"B-STRK","CreatedById":126119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T09:24:02Z","Content":"First, great to see the DORK up close and personal!\n\nSecond, I guess Lagertrix would not be the designated pilot for this craft? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThird, that is a lot of asteroids and comets?
