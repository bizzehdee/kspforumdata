So they proposed we sent a rover mission to Moho to confirm the presence of the gas and discover, among other things, the resources that are* *below* *the surface of the planet.**\u0022*\n\n![G2Y9YwCl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/G2Y9YwCl.jpg)\n\n*The Koulomb spacecraft after an electrical shortage. Might probably work on that later...*\n\nBehold the posibility that led us to create the Project Koulomb,1x, to assure us before sending a manned team of atmosminers in hitchhiker pods to grab the H2 (and get the ore, if any). The rover\u0027s test missions were failed, but for now is not that much we can do. Recent tests indicate the rover can survive quite high falls, which has made us happier. It have one skycrane, I don\u0027t like it specially due to it\u0027s unstability and unability to lift the rover, but later redesign can quite help a better skycrane design to form.\n\nThe current mission spacecraft link is below, for debugger teams:\n\n*missing, why can\u0027t I find the file anywhere in the KSP folder?*"}]}
