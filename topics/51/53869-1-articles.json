It took a while, but I\u0027ve finally gotten to the point where I can get into a nice orbit somewhat regularly. Spurred on by my success, I thought I would try and send up an un-manned rocket/satellite to try and intercept my currently orbiting Kirbin.

I ended up with three flights, none of which got close to each other. The first flight, the one that ran out of fuel in my previous update (the KSS Please Don\u0027t Hit Me) didn\u0027t have a stable orbit that quickly deteriorated once I got the other space craft into space, on it\u0027s second try. Making sure that the KSS Not In the Face\u0027s orbit was stable, I quickly switched to my other manned flight and made sure it was brought down safely. Since the NIF was still in orbit, I thought I would just send up another rocket, however the same thing happened (the rocket running out of fuel and only getting one or two orbits in before falling back to Kerbin). I wonder why I\u0027m running out of fuel so quickly on some, but not on others (though the NIF was really low on fuel once I got it up there, still enough for a burn to get it out of orbit though). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures with little comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/702855500384164679/7D1DD0E34391925E9369928999ADF3C98AF26EEE/\u0022 alt=\u00227D1DD0E34391925E9369928999ADF3C98AF26EEE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSS Not in the Face takes off on it\u0027s first attempt to rendezvous with the KSS Please Don\u0027t Hit Me.
