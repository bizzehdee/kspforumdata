Up until now, no lives had been lost on my watch. The crew was captained by our very own Bob Kerman. It had plenty of fuel, but I had made a mistake during construction and unintentionally allowed the transfer stage to drain the lander of all fuel. By the time I had decoupled and realized my mistake, it was already too late. I foolishly decided to park the transfer stage in a very low orbit; in atmosphere in fact and I couldn\u0027t re-dock with it due to the drag forces. So I sent out a rescue mission captained by Jeb with a crew of two other Kerbals (they really wanted to go and see Laythe) with a completely new ship not meant for landing on planets and therefore did not include parachutes (in reality, I simply forgot the parachutes. I almost always include them whether the ship in question is intended for atmosphere or not) and made a successful rendeszous with the doomed craft. With both ships within the loading range, my orbit started decaying rapidly but we were still high enough to transfer the kerbals manually although with a bit of trouble on the last one. But we fell too low. The drag forced the ship retrograde and I did a poor job of RCS thruster placement, so the ship was forced downward. It had a surface TWR of around 0.5, and happened to be over land. Everyone in the ship perished except Jeb, who was in the very top of the ship in his Cupola module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER.I.P.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDudman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHardin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdlo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand Richwig Kerman.
