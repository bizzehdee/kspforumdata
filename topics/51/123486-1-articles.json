After the first flag was planted and pictures taken Jeb,Bill and Bob left for a northern circumnavigation! I plant flags every 10km. When I stop to plant a flag all I do is turn on the SAS reaction wheels and slam on the breaks. I do a flip and land with RCS. When I was gong to plant the 3rd flag no one could plant it becuause command seats don\u0027t restock flags. So I launch the Claw Pod win RCS engines to claw on the back of the rover. After restocking the flags I put it on and I couldn\u0027t move so I unarmed and drove off. After that I was off on to the hills and 3 flags later I flew the Claw pod to the rover to restock the flags. Then I planted the last flag of the first leg, flag 7. I got about 70km done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RUjeu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I had to bring the Claw pod to restock the flags. I can get 1 more movement before I need to send more. Lost 1 solar panel when I did a flip to stop but that\u0027s why I brought a lot of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/OqzBh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

All the tanks exploded then the main tank exploded. After I stopped I left Jeb for a flag, roved over there got the flags cam back for Jeb. Now I will have to bring another Claw pod. After 1 more flag later I didn\u0027t see a big drop off and flew for a minute and when I landed I broke 4 wheels. I had to do repair stop and then planted the last flag of this Leg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gg9ey\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

After launching it (and flipping) I made to orbit and landed it by the rover. Went around a pretty big crater and up a big hill with a flat top. On top of that hill I had to bring the Flagstaff back and I decoupled 1 stage. When leaving the hill I didn\u0027t see the edge anf flew off. broke a few wheels but ok. Now im a side of a steep hill. Also HALFWAY!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jBMwG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I moved Flagstaff again and 1 flag later I was entering a mountain area. Roved down at 30 m/s , broke a few wheels still fine though. Went in the valley then up the hill and mid way up broke some more wheels , still fine. Then had to bring Flagstaff again. Should be able to last me to the end of the change.. Went to top and kept on roving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kyWIk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It was dark and I was going so fast I ran straight in to exploded in a puff of smoke. F9, slowly moved forward and found it. I F5 and sent Jeb to inspect to inspect it, walked slowly towards it and BOOM gone in smoke. F9ed again almost fell in when leaveing and planted a flag. After that more hills and moving of the flagstaff. 7 flags after there was a big hill I was going down and spun out of control into the air. Broke all wheels on impact and then fixed them. Then up other hill then I stopped for this leg. I may have to send another Flagstaff, maybe. So I\u0027m really close to finishing this! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uVi8u\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Then after 1 more flag I moved on the flats! I was so close and then I toke Jeb, Bill and Bob for a picture shoot. I put Jeb, Bill and Bob back in the lander and then took off. Put Apogee at 32,000M on Kerbin and time warped over. Turns out I close to the KSC but I put Apogee to high and I skipped atmosphere. That put me in a sub-orbital orbit. Reentry ne, at landing the Heat shield exploded but still fine. Got Jeb and friends for some photos and a flag. Then I recovered them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/iEeF3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
