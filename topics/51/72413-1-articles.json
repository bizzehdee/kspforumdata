And as usual, I hit the mid-game grind where it\u0027s still months before I could go to other planets and wanted to snag a few more expensive toys to do them in style. So that meant going to Mun and Minmus many times. To break the monotony of that, I did what I sometimes do and sent a Mobile Lab with a reusable lander. This time, however, I saved my points and jumped a few steps up the tech tree to make sure I had 2.5m docking ports, probe cores, and SAS before going, so I could go in style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was assembled in orbit out of 3 parts. First I designed the lander, then the returnable lab, and finally a hab/fuel/engine module to push the whole thing out there, refuel the lander, and serve as a permanent orbital station. This latter being a bit huge, I launched it first and docked the other, smaller modules to it. So behold!

In fact, the basic design was made to do Mun and has already been to Mun 3 times as a 1-shot deal in this game, and has been there countless other times in other games. And being low and wide, it can land safely on slopes too steep for Kerbals to walk on. But that\u0027s OK because except to plant a flag, the Kerbal never needs to touch the ground. When he lets go of the pod ladder, he stands on the protruding Science! parts below the hatch, and can take surface samples and EVA reports from there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. There\u0027s no ladder to climb back up into the pod; he has to use his jetpack but he should be very good at EVA by now what with carrying all the data to the lab. Still, should the Kerbal fall off a cliff and be unable to get back into the lander, all is not lost thanks to the lander\u0027s probe core. You can fly the lander back up by itself and load it with the spare Kerbal in the Hitchhiker to carry on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing is, you\u0027ll probably need more fuel and mono in the station. You\u0027ll have roughly the same amount to start with because transfers to Mun and Minmus cost about the same. However, a lander sortie at Mun should take between 2000-2500m/s depending on how much inclination changes you have to do both to hit the target biome and get back to the station. That\u0027s 2-3 times what a sortie costs at Minmus. Thus, while you could probably do 12-15 sorties at Minmus with the fuel shown here, you\u0027ll probably only get 4-7 at Mun. Depending on how many biomes you have to do on Mun (or how much tech tree you have left), that might not be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s why the Hab/Fuel/Engine module has such big engines and a docking port at the rear.

This means it can also do that at Moho, Gilly, Mun, Minmus, Ike, Dres, Vall, Bop, Pol, and Eeoloo.

By putting the tanks outboard on the Material Bays, and the legs outboard on the tanks, I achieve these goals. All other arrangements result either in a taller lander, a narrower leg span, or both. So, I end up with 4 widely separated tanks. I suppose a single 909 underneath with fuel lines going to it from each tank would still work, but I never really trust fuel lines so preferred to use the 48-7S engines, 1 under each tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KingPhantom","CreatedById":110881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T08:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat do you think, geschosskopf. is it possible to the the ship-files for every part? so i can try to visit minimus and mun with that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T14:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KingPhantom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KingPhantom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat do you think, geschosskopf. is it possible to the the ship-files for every part? so i can try to visit minimus and mun with that?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour wish is my command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0mxwvlcu9cvqm7e/STOCK%20A-Series%20Moon%20PIllager%20System.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox Link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took MJ, the only non-stock part, off all 3 ships, in case you don\u0027t use that.

Hope it works for you. NOTE: I design most of my lifters to use RCS to turn during the ascent. Look at the top of the ascent stage for RCS tanks and at the bottom for RCS jets. If present, turn RCS on immediately upon launch and only turn it off once the payloads are in space. The big lifter especially needs RCS to get lined up for the circularization burn. Once you drop the last lifter stages, however, turn RCS off. The payloads have enough torque to spin without it and you need to save the RCS fuel for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of docking, I carefully arranged the parts on all 3 modules so their CoMs won\u0027t move as they burn fuel (thanks to RCS Build Aid).
