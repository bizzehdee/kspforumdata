Many of them are mutually unintelligible in their rules of pronounciation, grammar, and sentence structure, and their inclusion of different loan words from many different European, African, and Indian sources, which may or may not have been filtered through some other European language first due to changes in local colonial government back in the day. As I grew up speaking English but still had to communicate with all my neighbors, so my own very limited command of so-called \u0022French\u0022 is an unholy almalgam of all this chaos, more of an inter-patois pidgin than a real dialect.
