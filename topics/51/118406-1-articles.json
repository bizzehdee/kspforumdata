Assuming you have the disk space to do so, you can just copy the lot into another folder and carry on running that whilst upgrading your original install of KSP. \n\nI have multiple instances of KSP 0.23 (with different mods added) , one of KSP 0.9 and multiple of KSP 1.04 (one for the Elcano challenge, one for my Science game which has different mods, and one in which I test mods on my systemm before using them elsewhere), and still revisit one of the games in 0.23 now and then where I had a nice little base set up on Minmus. Having put so many hours into getting it together, no way was I going to abaindon it.
