Now I\u0027ve finally decided to act upon that idea, and so I announce Project Horizon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first mission I\u0027ll do, I haven\u0027t completely decided, but I have narrowed it down to 2 ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Horzions - Pluto Flyby missions - I\u0027ll flyby Jool, and then Eeloo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMAVEN - Mars - I\u0027ll, of course, orbit Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, which do you guys think I should do first?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T01:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should do a Dawn mission to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T01:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, hmmm. I considered that, since it will arrive at Ceres in only a few months, but there\u0027s a few problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Operating an Ion powered spacecraft will take very long and be boring. (Probably)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Using KSPTOT (KSP Trajectory Optimization Tool), to get a Kerbin-Duna-Dres course, it had this weird trajectory and it said at the bottom that there was something wrong in the calculation (Which took a particularly long time), and that this trajectory it showed probably might not be doable. Also, it said it would need 4 km/s of delta-v to do Dres orbit insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T21:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy no more posts?
