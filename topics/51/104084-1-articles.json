Any chance of any video? \n\nim using a java based video recorder I found on sourceforge for my recordings.. it does pump out around 1gb file size.. but things like VLC will convert them to youtube SD format and reduce to around 150mb or so for a good 10\u002B minutes.. \n\nPictures are great.. ive got thousands of the very same subject.. but when your driving a train on kerbin.. pictures dont quite relay the difficulties you face, for better or worse along with the just plain funny bits that you dont seem to get with any other form of vehicle ..\n\neg.. a train coming to the top of one of them mountains.. but the crest is just too sharp.. the locomotive lands on the razors edge of a cliff.. cutting the locomotive in 2 with much swearing from us drivers.. I never managed to record that.. as im past the stage of mountain exploration.. \n\nfor a new driver like yourself.. these moments are gold to capture.. I dare say you\u0027ll enjoy watching your own videos once the dust settles as other people would..\n\n I use Krut for windows \n\n[http://krut.sourceforge.net](http://krut.sourceforge.net)\n\nmy systems an old server running KSP on 2gb of ram with some default assets cut.. old dual core2duo.. it doesnt cause that much more lag with it running.. quite simple to use.. set the screensize.. alt tab.. hit record.. do what you want too.. then hit stop when ready.. the command window will show the progress of the saving..\n\neg..
