But I slog on. The first launch window from Kerbin to Jool that occurred after the guys arrived at Laythe was coming up, and it was obviously time to send along some more equipment. Plus, the Nuclear Tugs that had carried equipment to Laythe in the first armada should be returned to Kerbin for re-use (since reusability is a major theme here). This was going to mean controlling a lot of flights at once again, so I installed the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod to help me track all the flight events. This helped, but it\u0027s still a lot of tedium. Version 0.20 was released as I was doing all this, but I\u0027m still working in version 0.19 here because I have some mods installed that were not yet updated (Alarm Clock and Damned Robotics Hinges) that prevent me from updating this save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided that since Laythe is mostly ocean, I should be making more of an attempt to study the oceans...so I arranged to send out some Ocean Probes to be spread around the planet, and a jet-powered \u0022rover/boat\u0022 to take readings out in the ocean. It would be nice if there were several small islands offshore from the Laythe Base area to make a rover/boat more useful, but there aren\u0027t. So it will primarily be an unmanned probe, but will have a one-kerbal capsule for test drives and for steering torque. I have named it the \u0027DogFish\u0027 and tested a prototype around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Below you can see the prototype in Booster Bay. It\u0027s basically four tanks of jet fuel, a jet engine, a capsule for steering torque, and a probe body for control and RTGs for power. The wheels are primarily for getting it down into the water, but they also allow it to explore the seashore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gLVBlet.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gLVBlet.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DogFish does not travel terribly fast (it gets very difficult to control at speeds over 7 m/s), but I was able to drive it out to the island near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E that has the dirt landing strip...which took over 45 minutes. Be careful to go slow when putting the DogFish into the water or when exiting the water, or damage can result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VjjK27w.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VjjK27w.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I got to the island, I took the DigFish to visit the hanger with the old rocket parts inside. In fact, I left the DogFish prototype there as part of the exhibit, since its testing work was done. It had used less than half of its fuel getting to the island, so it could come back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E if desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i5Zd8Zt.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i5Zd8Zt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s get back to the mission at hand. One of the things the Laythe Base crew needed was a better way to rescue a crew member who gets stranded on a different island (if they wreck a BirdDog on landing or while roving). Currently the only rescue option is to use the 3-kerbal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket, and that would involve hopping up to the station, refueling, then going down to get the stranded kerbal, then back to the station. And since this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is the crew\u0027s only way back to the station to return home, this would probably mean having to bring everyone back up on the initial boost and returning everyone to Kerbin after the rescue...cutting the base mission short. Not at all a desirable option. So mission planners decided to send a compact one-kerbal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket that could be dropped from the station to rescue a stranded kerbal, using much less fuel and not endangering the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E vehicle. In the images below we see the \u0027SSTUBBY\u0027 vehicle (\u0022Single-Stage To Up Barely Beyond Yonder\u0022) being launched on a Reusable Rocket. This payload also includes a set of eight small Ocean Probes (that crown of thorns the SSTUBBY is wearing), and is topped off by a refueler module that will be used to refuel the Nuclear Tug that will carry this payload to Laythe (just because I didn\u0027t want to have to bother with the extra work of more rendezvous and dockings to refuel the tugs...and the Reusable Rocket has plenty of lift capacity to bring the refueler).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kTQOtkM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kTQOtkM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next payload for this armada will carry the DogFish rover/boat. It will also carry a replacement Fido rover for the crew to use in exploring Dansen Island because the Folding Fido turned out to be a bit of a disappointment (it\u0027s too loosy-goosey wobbly because of the hinges, so it can\u0027t be driven safely at high speeds). This replacement rover will be very similar to the Fido KE series of rovers that were used on Eve and for circumnavigating Duna. These rovers will enter Laythe together so that I only need to make one \u0022heat shield\u0022 for them. Also included in this payload are two high-orbit ComSats (mounted on the heat shield either side of the rovers), and a Refueler top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UtKPlBj.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UtKPlBj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third payload in this armada will carry another GasStation for the BirdDog. Also, one of the tanks in the GasStation will be used to carry three-quarters of a ton of supplies for the crew instead of jet fuel (or so I say...I will not use the fuel from that tank, and chalk it up as a cargo container, since we don\u0027t have specific cargo container parts). This payload also contains \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel for the Laythe Station (since the Tugs were using more of that than expected). There are no fuel/oxidizer tanks being sent because each Tug that arrives has more fuel/oxidizer than needed, so it will be stored in the tanks on Laythe Station for future use (the Tugs are essentially little fuel transport ships as well). On top of the GasStation 2 is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-powered Mini-Tug that has proven to be useful in moving stuff around the Space Station in Kerbin orbit, so it should also be useful at Laythe Station. And topping it off is a Refueler Module. Note that the right half of the image shows the separation of the boosters...these and the central core are reusable (in fact, there has been plenty of time since the earlier launches, so all of the rockets used is this part of the mission should be made from parts recycled from earlier launches).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yIeuATq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yIeuATq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, each of the three payloads needs a Nuclear Tug to boost it to Laythe. Since none of the earlier Laythe tugs have returned yet, Laythe Tug 6 being launched below is a new Tug. In fact, it is a modified design that has 18 extra probe bodies on it to provide steering torque. On some of my previous ships, I\u0027ve added unmanned capsules or lander cans just for their torque, but somebody suggested that a lot of probe bodies could provide the same torque for less weight, so I decided to try that out (this will hopefully make it easier for the the Tug to wrestle around payloads while using less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel). It would be nice if the KSP devs just gave us some parts that provide steering torque (and, no, don\u0027t suggest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules...they only provide dampening torque that slow rotations...they do not provide steering torque).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QUNT4YU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QUNT4YU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is Laythe Tug 7 being launched by Reusable Rocket. Remember that the mass of the Nuclear Tug exceeds the capacity of the Reusable Rocket, so the nuclear engines on the Tug are used to help out the sustainer so that both the Tug AND the sustainer can get into orbit (because the sustainer must orbit back around to land at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to be reusable). The Tug uses between 1/4 and 1/2 of its rear fuel tank to assist the sustainer like this (and to give the sustainer enough fuel to land). This is why the Tugs need refueling before heading to Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MZ5M0dh.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MZ5M0dh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see Laythe Tug 8 in orbit after giving the sustainer stage enough fuel so that it can head back to land at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LPcA3HS.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LPcA3HS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext comes rendezvous and docking fun-time! Tug L6 docks with the SSTUBBY/OceanProbe payload. After the Refueler Top Module replenishes the fuel tanks of the Tug (including its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks), the Refueler Module is separated. Any remaining fuel can be taken to the Space Station...but I wasn\u0027t going to do another rendezvous and docking, so I just brought it back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IPQhDdX.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IPQhDdX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot to add MechJeb to the Refueler Top Modules, so I had to guide them in myself (these are also reusable components). One ended up on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E property, and the other two landed several kilometers short of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E property, so the recovery crews will have to drive further to get them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226uOpLCH.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6uOpLCH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext we see Tug L7 docking with the rovers payload. I just love the docking camera mod...it makes my life much easier. Then the Tug was refueled as needed from the Refueler, which was then separated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Uv5QipR.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uv5QipR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it was time for Tug L8 to dock with the GasStation2 payload. After some refueling, the Refueler Module was returned to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IpAJxmf.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IpAJxmf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime to boost the payloads to the Jool system. Again, for better fuel efficiency, I do the Trans-Jool Injection burns in two parts. Below is the typical trajectory plot for getting to Jool. The burns for the three ships each require about 18 to 19 minutes of firing the nukes, so I do the first 9 to 10 minutes to boost the payloads into orbits with apoapses out beyond the Mun, and the rest of the burn when the ships each return to periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lNkplil.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lNkplil.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow are the first burns for the three ships. These payloads were all compact enough that they didn\u0027t wobble a lot, so I could run the burns a 2X physics warp to make things faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kfIGb82.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kfIGb82.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see the three initial high-orbits out beyond the Mun after the first parts of the TJI burns. The ships are spaced out (the third is still close to periapsis here) so they will not all come back at the same time. Also, I start these burns before the optimal time of the Kerbin-Jool launch window so that the ships will be returning for part 2 of their burns close to the optimal launch window time. Below the orbit plots you can see Tug L6 and its payload high above Kerbin, falling back in for part 2 of its TJI burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VQlVi42.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VQlVi42.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is the plot for the trajectory to Jool after the second part of the burn... you can see that about half of the delta-V remains to be done. The reason this two-part burt is more efficient than a single long burn is because more of the fuel is burned when the ship is deeper in Kerbin\u0027s gravity well (the Oberth Effect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fc2tNG9.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fc2tNG9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all three ships escape Kerbin\u0027s S.O.I., we can see the trajectories to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k7iivTK.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7iivTK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime, there were all those Tugs from the first armada sitting at Laythe Station, and the first launch window opportunity for them to return to Kerbin came along at this time (as Kerbal Alarm Clock reminded me). My previous records of how much fuel it took for my Mark Twain ships to return to Kerbin from the outer system indicated that the Tugs should probably be able to make it back to Kerbin with just the fuel in their side-pod tanks. So, all of the fuel remaining in their central tanks was moved to the tanks that would remain attached to Laythe Station, and the four Tugs (L2, L3, L4, and L5) were separated and prepared for return to Kerbin (Laythe Tug 1 is attached to the Crew Return Module, so it is staying).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FMbOVxP.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FMbOVxP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be more efficient to drop the Tugs into orbits around Jool with low periapses to take advantage of the Oberth effect for their Kerbin-return burns, but timing that (with the orbits in the right orientation and the ships getting there at the right time) was more of a headache than I wanted to bother with, so instead I boosted the Tugs out of Laythe orbit into holding orbits between Laythe and Vall, and would boost them to Kerbin from there. Below you can see that the escape from Laythe requires about 580 m/s of delta-V. And don\u0027t let the plot fool you...the ship will not end up inside Laythe\u0027s orbit...as Laythe moves around Jool as the ship is following that escape path, Laythe ends up curving around its orbit so that the exit-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E point is outside Laythe\u0027s orbit when the Tug reaches that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k9vAC6F.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k9vAC6F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the Tugs escaped fro Laythe, additional small burns moved their periapses away from Laythe so they were safe from any Laythe encounters. Then I waited for the optimal time to boost them to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yokiN2H.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yokiN2H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a typical Jool-to-Kerbin trajectory. The 1477 m/s of delta-V required looks scary when the Tugs have so little fuel left, but the masses of the Tugs are quite low at this point, so the the efficient nuclear engines can handle this easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226LbvqMB.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6LbvqMB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first of the returning Tugs heads off for Kerbin!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fEvkiuU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fEvkiuU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the plot below, we see orbits of the four returning Tugs closely spaced (the ellipses coming from Jool at the top). Meanwhile, the outbound second armada is now reaching the ascending node point and it\u0027s time for their plane-shift and fine targeting maneuvers. The typical plane shift is seen below...it will take about 154 m/s of delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TYVxMAG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TYVxMAG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the Maneuver Node Improvement mod. This mod allows me to reopen maneuver nodes that annoyingly snap shut (by pressing the \u0027o\u0027 key), and fiddle with the prograde, radial, and normal values of the maneuver (although it\u0027s UI could stand improvement here), and it allows me to set the Conics Mode value on the fly. I use Mode 0 for targeting my trajectories because that mode plots the incoming orbit relative to the planet, so you can easily see if it\u0027s prograde, retrograde, or whatever angle it is at. The orbit is shown relative to planet at its CURRENT location, which looks weird, but I\u0027m cool with that. You just need to focus on the planet, and then you can easily zoom in and see the orbit exactly as it will occur. Sooooo nice. The only problem I have is focusing on the planet... I already have so much stuff in the Jool system that double-clicking on it is likely to focus on one of my ships in the Jool system. KSP really needs a pop-up menu or something that will allow you to focus on a planet (even Haystack, which solved the problem of focusing on the ship you want {and this may have been fixed in KSP 0.20 as well} does not allow you to choose planets to focus on). Below is a plot of the orbit I\u0027m fine-tuning for a 114 KM aerocapture at Jool done from way out at the ascending node point. You save fuel by targeting from far out...but in truth it\u0027s so sensitive at that distance that it\u0027s hard to get the exact number you want because even the shortest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E burn I can make has a big effect. You may have to just wait until you get closer so the controls are less sensitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TAConXr.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TAConXr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes over three-quarters of a year (Earth year) for a ship to follow the Hohmann orbit from Kerbin to Jool...so as my armada was heading out to Jool, a couple more launch windows for Kerbin-to-Jool came up. Well...we shouldn\u0027t waste those. So mission planners decided to send out another ship in each of the launch windows that came up. For the first subsequent window, another BirdDog rover/plane would be sent out (this could be a replacement if the original gets damaged... and it gives another rescue option, since it can be flown unmanned...by remote control from Laythe Base, I assume). Also, its associated GasStation could be landed on an island far from Dansen Island, and a BirdDog could then fly there from Laythe Base (with double its normal range, since it would refuel there to return), and there would be enough fuel to explore the distant islands before returning. Below we see BirdDog 2 and Laythe Tug 9 being boosted on recycled Reusable Rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WS6qAvc.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WS6qAvc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no way to easily mount a reusable Refueler Module on top of the BirdDog payload, so three small refuelers were connected to the GasStation\u0027s docking arm ports, and after these were used to top off the Tug\u0027s tanks, they were separated with enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel left to deorbit themselves. Note that in order to be sure that the Tug would be full, it did not give the sustainer of its rocket enough fuel to land on its rocket flame (as is normally done) so that sustainer had to land using parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YOnQ2d4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YOnQ2d4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did not bother to add recovery systems to these little refueler pods... they were just deorbited and dropped into the oceans.

Sure, I could just time warp forward and space all this stuff out, but that would be unrealistic... they would not be wasting all these interplanetary transfer windows, so I shouldn\u0027t either. In fact...I should be handling all sorts of other missions to other planets...and be rotating Minmus Base crews...and whatever. But I only have two hands! So, anyway, when the NEXT Kerbin-to-Jool launch window came up, mission planners had a new Base module, packed to the gills with supplies, to send to our intrepid explorers (they won\u0027t get it for another 3/4 of a year or more, of course, but it\u0027s the thought that counts). And this base has rover capabilities so that it can be repositioned after landing. Sure...what I\u0027d really like to be sending these guys is some resource detection and mining equipment...but that\u0027s not ready yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ET6pnWI.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ET6pnWI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd where there\u0027s a payload, there\u0027s another Tug required. Below we see the Base 2 payload docking with Laythe Tug 10, which just came up on a Reusable Rocket. Is anybody counting all these rockets? I guess the accountants are. This should be the last Laythe Tug we need, since the returning Tugs can be refueled and reused for any future payloads that need to be sent to Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qL9krW4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qL9krW4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, after refueling, the Refueler Module is separated and returned to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. And again, I did not include MechJeb on this, so I had to target it manually...but, as you can see below, I did quite well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CmEMXq8.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CmEMXq8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOff to Jool goes Base 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MqrwG2S.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MqrwG2S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t get a good image of the crowded skies when all of these ships were in transit, but the plot below was from after Tugs L6 and L8 were already in the Jool system, but the transfer orbit of Tug L7 is still there. So you can see the orbits of the three returning Tugs (which are getting close to Kerbin), and the outbound orbits of Tug L7, and Tug L9 (with BirdDog 2), and Tug L10 (with Base 2). When this operation is in full swing, with payloads and returning Tugs using all of the available transfer windows, there would be a couple more \u0022petals\u0022 on this flower...and I\u0027d be driven nuts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022L7nA4UP.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L7nA4UP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway...The three-ship armada is finally reaching Jool.

A burn at apoapsis raised the periapsis to 250 km, safely out of Jool\u0027s atmosphere. After a few quick orbits around Jool, an encounter with Laythe came up, and Tug L6 was targeted for a Laythe aerocapture\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PFS4HvI.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PFS4HvI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221ZXVEcG.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1ZXVEcG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Tug L8 with the GasStation2, etc., was coming in toward Jool, Laythe got in the way...so mission controllers decided to go for a direct Laythe aerocapture. What the heck...we won\u0027t get to do fun stuff like this once reentry heat damage is added to the game. Below you see the ship screaming in toward Laythe at interplanetary speeds...and the flaming aerocapture right above the Fido Bay Laythe Base area. I assume Thompbles got some cool pictures. This aerocapture had to be targeted at 16 km to get captured in an orbit with an apoapsis of 1000 km. And remember to do your apoapsis kick!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Wi5n9J7.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wi5n9J7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ETujX9a.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ETujX9a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to make things \u0022interesting\u0022...right in the middle of handling the Jool aerocaptures, the Kerbal Alarm Clock was telling me that the four Tugs returning to Kerbin needed attention as they were entering Kerbin\u0027s S.O.I. and doing aerocaptures. Arrrrggghhh. So I ended up juggling seven ships at once. Below, Laythe Tug L4 heads in to Kerbin, targeted at an altitude of 28.45 kilometers (and adjusted for a near-equatorial orbit). This resulted in an apoapsis of 164 km. After apoapsis kick, the Tug had 26 units of fuel remaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vg6ySBg.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vg6ySBg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uxCLIH0.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uxCLIH0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd right away (things happen much faster around Kerbin than they do out around Jool) in comes Laythe Tug L3 to Kerbin, targeted at 28.9 km, resulting in an apoapsis of 588 km. It had 69 units of fuel left after apoapsis kick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bO2KzJO.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bO2KzJO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was followed almost immediately by Laythe Tug L5 burning in to Kerbin aerocapture at 28.4 km, resulting in an apoapsis of 149 km. It had 36 units of fuel left after apoapsis kick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022voqFhLQ.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/voqFhLQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd somewhere in here I got sloppy. Or there was a program glitch. Because as Laythe Tug L2 was coming in to Kerbin for aerocapture, I THOUGHT it was targeted just fine at 28.5 km...but after the aerobraking fire show, I saw that it was NOT in a stable orbit...it was intersecting the surface of Kerbin. I quickly tried to burn prograde to make orbit, but the nukes\u0027 thrust was too little, too late. So I flipped the Tug and started burning retrograde to ensure an ocean impact, and burned all the way down to slow the Tug as much as possible. Unfortunately, this was NOT one of the Tugs that was equipped with parachutes on its nuke pods. I did manage to slow its speed down to 96 m/s before it hit the water. Arrgh. More environmental impact paperwork to fill out. And two valuable nukes lost to the fishies. Below: Shortly before impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qK9WYE0.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qK9WYE0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibly I fumbled Tug L2 because I was also handling Tug L7 heading in to Jool at the same time. And there was a problem there: Tylo got in the way of the incoming trajectory -- it was a distant encounter, but it was enough to throw off the aerocapture altitude that was targeted, so I had to do a burn to correct this. And immediately after the Jool aerocapture, the Tug got an encounter with Laythe. That aerocapture went fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t3oCZH2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t3oCZH2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd..........stop for a breath. All of the Tugs and payloads coming in to Laythe or Kerbin were in stable orbits (or crashed, in the case of Tug L2), and the other two ships (bringing BirdDog 2 and Base 2) were a long ways out. So it was time to rest.

The initial orbits had apoapses of around 1000 km and periapses (following the adjustments after aerocapture) of a little under 60 km, a little ways above the atmosphere. While the orbits were still big, the small plane adjustment maneuvers were done at the orbital nodes furthest from Laythe (which uses less fuel) to match their inclinations to that of the Laythe Space Station, which orbits the equator at 80 km. Then the periapses were dipped back into the atmosphere to do some aerobraking maneuvers to bring the apoapses of these orbits down below 90 km, and their periapses were raised to 80 km. Once the new ships got into these low orbits, the equipment could be deployed and the ships could each rendezvous with the Space Station as it eventually caught up with each of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: (Entering Command Pod of Laythe Base) \u0022Top of the mornin\u0027 to you, Cap\u0027n Thompbles! What are you up to on this fine day?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Good afternoon, Aldner. Just doing a little orbital ballet.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022That would explain your lovely tutu, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022These are standard issue spacesuit longjohns.

I\u0027ll need help with landing all the Ocean Probes later.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first order of business after getting all of the ships into orbit was to deploy the ComSats. These two satellites were mounted to the top of the rovers-payload heat shield, angled outwards slightly, where they could be protected from entry heating during aerocapture (well...if we actually had entry heating yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hiavAe1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hiavAe1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, one of the ComSats has its two high gain antennas, two low gain antennas, and two solar panel arrays extended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t5YZnl5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t5YZnl5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ComSats each have two 24-77 radial motors and four Oscar-B fuel tanks. This was enough to lift the ComSats to their 1000 km working orbits with plenty of fuel left over for future station-keeping maneuvers. It would have been even more efficient had I remembered to eject them BEFORE the carrier Tug was placed in low-Laythe orbit...but they have so much fuel I was not concerned about it. First one was sent out to 1000 km and circularized, then the other was put into a transfer orbit with an apoapsis at 1000 km...then after a few orbits, the second satellite was reaching apoapsis again 180 degrees away from the first one, and its orbit was circularized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a1ZAKsG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a1ZAKsG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo ComSats is not the optimal number, of course, but all of the Laythe Base operations are being conducted in one hemisphere of Laythe for now, so all the crew needs is for one of the ComSats to be wandering overhead at any given time. I also did not spend lots of time tweaking the orbits to perfection (I\u0027ve seen other players\u0027 comsat constellations that are very impressively laid out), but it\u0027s not as if these satellites actually DO anything for us at the moment in the game. So the satellites will drift around relative to each other over time...but the communications situation will be much improved over having only the Space Station as a comm link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S0JHYUc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S0JHYUc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up are the Ocean Probes. Our brave kerbals, not being aquatic creatures by nature, are primarily exploring the island land masses of Laythe with their rovers and planes. In order that the vast stretches of ocean would not be totally ignored, a set of eight floating ocean probes would be deployed at various places around Laythe. These probes were carried to Laythe as part of the Tug L6 payload. Below we see the eight probes being ejected from the ship to spread out. The bulkhead that they were attached to was later separated from the nose docking port of the SSTUBBY to become space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/agzpml1.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022agzpml1.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Ocean Probe has an Oscar-B fuel tank and an Ant engine, which is plenty of delta-V to deorbit the probe. Five of the probes would be spaced around the equator roughly 72 degrees apart, with one a short way outside Fido Bay. Three more of the probes would be positioned somewat north or south to monitor water conditions in some of the in the major waterways between other islands and the west side of Dansen Island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rv8gE3U.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rv8gE3U.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I designed these probes, I had to study how things float in KSP. In the programs questionable flotation physics, a metal plate will happily float at all sorts of angles in exactly the same way real metal plates don\u0027t. And if you position instruments, battery packs, and whatnot around the circumference of the metal plate, that makes it float nice and stable, flat on the surface. The Ocean Probes are made of a base of two square plates rotated 45 degrees to form an 8-pointed star shape. The Ant engine is on the bottom. Fuel lines are needed to connect the fuel tank to the bottom plate, which then crossfeeds the fuel to the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KuCCjx9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KuCCjx9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, one of the probes parachutes down to the ocean surface with Vall and Tylo in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2r3CAhA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222r3CAhA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESplashdown on Laythe...something I\u0027ve tried hard to avoid up to this point. The probe will sit nice and stable on the surface in this orientation. I can use the probe body\u0027s torque to flip the probe upsidedown, but when SAS is activated, the probe is very resistant to being flipped by any waves that might come along. Solar panels and battery packs keep the probe core alive and happy all though the Laythe day and night cycle. Weirdly, some of the probes were initially floating deeper in the water than the other probes, but when I checked on them later, they were all floating at about the same depth, with the bottom plate at or slightly below the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4eQeOwA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224eQeOwA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloseup of one of the floating ocean probes with its antennas deployed. The thermometers on the probes all read a uniform 004.69 degrees. The other scientific instruments read as expected for Laythe\u0027s surface. The most valuable instruments on the probes would actually be the accelerometers -- these could monitor the up and down motion of a floating probe to keep track of wave heights. This could be vital to anyone making a base on a moon as volcanic as Laythe apparently is. An undersea volcanic erruption or quake could easily spawn a tsunami that would wash your base and its happy kerbals out to sea. The reason several of the probes were positioned in the areas between Dansen and neighboring islands is to better track any incoming tsunami.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VQvZL8f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VQvZL8f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Laythe Base to Fido.

The original plan was to have Kurt and Nelemy circumnavigate all of Dansen Island, but when the hinges on the Folding Fido proved to be rather loose, making driving fast or on steep slopes unsafe, their route was changed to backtrack down the west coast again and then down to Fido Bay, making detailed geological studies along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W0Nqkzb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W0Nqkzb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Thompbles and Aldner were coordinating the landing of the other hardware. Tug L8 was carrying GasStation 2, as well as more RCS fuel for the Space Spation below the GasStation, and an RCS Mini-Tug above the GasStation... so they needed to separate the Mini-Tug, separate and move off the GasStation, and then redock the Mini-Tug to the RCS tanks so that all that part could go to the Space Station. Then the GasStation targeted for a landing at the Fido Bay site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WmHSZpZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WmHSZpZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGasStation 2 passing through entry flames as it heads in to the Laythe Base area, then deploys its chutes for landing a few hundred meters beyond the original GasStation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UGLmRng.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UGLmRng.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/femQgvx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022femQgvx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as GasStation 2 landed, Aldner hopped into the BirdDog to see if the docking ports were at the correct heights for refueling his plane. As you recall, the first GasStation had a bit of a problem in that the refueling arms were mounted a little bit too low. The arms on GasStation 2 were placed higher. But, because GasStation 2 had landed on more of a slope, the first port Aldner tried was a tiny bit too high...but the second port he tried click perfectly into place when he lowered the nose gear of the rover/plane to lift its docking port into place. Good. There won\u0027t be any need for him to bang away on the refueler arms with a big hammer to make things fit. NOTE: I experimented back at KSC with a version of the GasStation that used Damned Robotics hinges to make the refueler arms swing down, allowing lots of adjustment of the arm height. But, whenever I used this to dock with a BirdDog, Weird Physics\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 would cause the opposite landing leg of the GasStation to ram deep into the ground.

Note that the ship is now being controlled from the probe body of the lower Fido rover (it was controlled from an inverted probe body on the retro pack for the retro burn to make that step easier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/711bnc6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022711bnc6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe six chutes on the DogFish rover/boat were deployed first. Then the landing gear of the DogFish was deployed (it\u0027s important to do this before separation because you won\u0027t have control later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/73wUXD4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002273wUXD4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the spacebar is pressed several times in rapid succession. This separates the heat shield (note that there is an RCS tank on the heat shield used as a spacer...the fuel from that tank was moved to the Nuclear Tug prior to separating this payload), and then the stack of small decouplers are fired to separate the Fido rover from the DogFish, then separate the small decouplers from the Fido, and then deploy the Fido rover\u0027s six chutes. The stack of small decouplers plunks down on top of the Fido rover after its chutes deploy, but a little rolling of the rover can drop those free of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/97To9Wl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002297To9Wl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA view upward shows the two rovers descending under reefed chutes. The DogFish is currently higher, but it is heaveier than the Fido rover, so it will reach the ground first. For this reason, it is important do do the separations of the previous step while the ship is still coming in at an angle (not yet vertical) so that these two rovers will be spread out a bit... you don\u0027t want the DogFish coming down on top of the Fido.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QFa5Isr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QFa5Isr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the rovers float down to the dunes about a mile away from Laythe Base.

Because of the heavier weight of the DogFish (since it\u0027s mostly fuel tanks), drop tests at KSC showed that its wheels tended to blow on landing. The lighter Fido has eight wheels to absord the landing force, so they do not tend to blow. To keep the DogFish\u0027s wheels from popping, four of the somewhat crappy medium landing gear were added to take the impact shock. This was lighter than adding more wheels, and if they broke on landing it wouldn\u0027t matter since they will not be used again after being retracted so that the DogFish could rove on its wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W6Ao3Q3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W6Ao3Q3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two rovers were remotely controlled to drive them to Laythe Base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2bsL7Hi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222bsL7Hi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after this, Kurt and Nelemy Kerman arrive back at Laythe Base with the Folding Fido.

As the Space Station caught up with each Tug, the Tug manuevered for rendezvous and docking. Below we see Tug L8 approaching the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2tbJreh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222tbJreh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS-powered Mini-Tug was separated along with the RCS fuel tanks, which it took over and docked to the bottom of the station. Then the remainder of the Nuclear Tug was docked butt-first to the station (on the right in the right half of the image below). When the time comes to send that Tug back to Kerbin, it would leave its rear tank and most of the fuel from its forward central tank behind at the station. After docking, the forward central tank was still 79% full. The newer Tugs proved to be more efficient with their RCS fuel (since the multiple probe bodies provide a good amount of torque to point the ship...which required expending RCS fuel before if the Tug needed to be turned quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i36rPu3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i36rPu3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext came the rendezvous and docking of Tug L7, which was straightforward (or straightbackward, actually) since it had no payload left attached. Its forward tank was over 56% full at this point, and most of that fuel was moved to the rear tank where it would be left behind at the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z4VAnlP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z4VAnlP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, along came Tug L6 with the SSTUBBY rescue craft attached. The Tug docked the SSTUBBY to one of the docking ports on a fuel tank that was left behind by one of the Tugs that had just returned to Kerbin. Then Tug L6 separated and moved over to dock butt-first to the remaining main port of the station. Now there were tanks (each with additional docking ports) or a refueler payload attached to all the main radial ports of the station. And things were getting a bit laggy...but that will clear up when these Tugs are sent back to Kerbin during a future transfer window. Tug L6\u0027s central tank had 77% fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HxyViiC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HxyViiC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe completed Station configuration is shown below. Note that the SSTUBBY rescue ship will stay docked to the station until it is needed (if it is ever needed) to rescue a kerbal from another island. If that happens, it will drop down to the surface of Laythe with nearly a full load of fuel (less what it takes to retro burn and target the landing), land via parachutes, and then take the kerbal back up to the station on its combination of jet engines and rocket engines. Depending on how close that kerbal is to being rotated back to Kerbin (and how much fuel is available on the station), that kerbal will either wait out the mission on the station, or be repatriated with his fellow kerbals on the surface. You will note that the rocket engine of the SSTUBBY is currently still covered with a fairing and docking port...this will need to be jettisoned before the ship is used. Also, in future, the SSTUBBY could be used to drop and return a kerbal to and from a distant island for exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8R2KaZ1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228R2KaZ1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter several days of rest and relaxation, with a little unpacking and a lot of snack consumption thrown in, Kurt requested to test out the DogFish before it gets sent off on its oceanic survey mission.

Because the jet engine is mounted higher than the bulk of the ship (to keep it out of the water), the DogFish tips forward under thrust. In fact, at higher speeds the boat runs faster at a given throttle setting if you also hold pitch down to make it tip even more. This gets Nelemy even wetter, but this aspect only seems to make Kurt smile more. The boat seems to get about the same \u0022mileage\u0022 at different throttle settings... but when you get the throttle up to seven ticks, it will cruise along at about 4 m/s...and if you give it down pitch at that point, it transitions into a mode that moves along at 7 m/s, leaving a big \u0022splashdown effect wake\u0022 behind it. It also becomes harder to control at that speed, tending to veer left or right suddenly. Higher speeds only makes things more unstable. Tests back at KSC showed that speeds in excess of 10 m/s can cause the ship to start coming apart. Sometimes there are splashdown effects at lower speeds. If you shift your view to the front of the ship, you hear a strange \u0022pink pink pink\u0022 sound effect, sort if like plucking the teeth of a plastic comb. Unless that\u0027s just Nelemy whining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PRTVXUp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PRTVXUp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gihRDxn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gihRDxn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a fun time (at least for Kurt) cruising around the bay, Kurt brings the DogFish ashore.

It\u0027s a bulky vehicle with all that jet fuel onboard, so you can\u0027t speed along like a maniac if you want to keep your wheels intact. Also, the DogFish does not have a lot of battery capacity or solar cells, so the only power comes from its two RTGs, and driving it around a full power will drain the batteries faster than they can recharge...so Kurt ended up stopping a few time enroute to allow the batteries to recharge so that he could handle the up-slopes better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fou9BB8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fou9BB8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Nelemey has radioed in the request to have the new Fido rover remotely driven out to his location.

I don\u0027t know if it will be able to make it all the way over to the next big island, but it will head in that direction, pausing often to float a while and study the water conditions and currents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SboO2AJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SboO2AJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a small island 2.5 km offshore, and the DogFish explored that first. It came ashore too fast, and the jet engine ran the rover right over the island and into the sea on the other side before I could stop it. So, again, take care when approaching the shore. If the slope under water is shallow, the DogFish can end up rolling on its wheels sooner than you expect. Second picture below: Coming ashore more carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oo6H3ny.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oo6H3ny.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o3MBKxi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o3MBKxi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DogFish drove around the little island. No rocks. No snacks. Nelemy named the island DogFish Isle. There was a tiny sandbar off shore of the little island... the DogFish was able to drive over to it without its wheels leaving the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uoRBiqE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uoRBiqE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter exploring DogFish island, the rover/boat headed off into the ocean. Below is an animated GIF of the boat zipping along at 7 m/s. This is its most fuel efficient mode of travel...but it takes constant vigilance to keep it from veering off course at this speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SxV2jOJ.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022SxV2jOJ.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 kilometers out to sea, the DogFish arrived at the position of Ocean Probe 1 that monitors the waters outside Fido Bay. After hanging out there for a while, it will continue its journey across the ocean. Note that the DogFish only draws fuel from the rear two tanks. This should make it more nose heavy as time goes on (since it seems to be happier running in a nose-down attitude). Eventually, fuel can be transferred from the front tanks to the rear tanks when needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so ends another adventure on Laythe. There is still another BirdDog enroute to the moon that will allow the crew to explore further afield. And, behind that, a new, bigger mobile base, undoubtedly packed to the gills with snacks and Soylant Mush of all colors. And there are the new Tugs to send back to Kerbin...and anything else to be sent out to Laythe can use the old Tugs after they are refueled in orbit...so the transportation system is set up and running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/notV4GO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022notV4GO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 8 is on page 8 of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mindspring.com/~sportrocketry/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBrotoro\u0027s KSP Mission Web Pages\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-10T19:14:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2013 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tangle","CreatedById":66808,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T04:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to end up having to say this first, but can I/we have the craft file?
