This is my attempt to complete the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-ultimate-Jool-5-challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-misson\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUltimate Jool-5 Challenge\u003C/a\u003E, where I must build a single ship that leaves Kerbin orbit, lands a kerbal on each moon of Jool, and returns. For this, I decided to make a nice big mothership, then deploy landers from it (which is fine under the challenge rules). The other method that works is to go ulta-minimalist, or to make a lander that can go anywhere and then attach a lot of fuel tanks to it. But I like large motherships, so that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be building and flying this tim. This thread is where I\u0027ll keep track of my progress, successes and failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s get this out of the way first. I am \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a fantastic craft builder. My specialty is in aircraft, and I\u0027m darned good at them (although I might not be taking one to Laythe, just to save on mass)....however my spacecraft are merely functional, rather than being genius material. But I\u0027ve mastered docking in the past, and this isn\u0027t my first interplanetary mothership. I\u0027d previously built one to get to Duna. It would have worked, had I not foolishly decided to use the 1.25m docking node for a few modules, causing the thing to snap in half at one point. The mission wasn\u0027t a failure (I got everyone back), but understandably I\u0027ve tended to just use larger docking ports for most things since then. I\u0027m also using a laptop, so there\u0027s no way in heck I wanted to have some massive cluster of orange tanks on my ship driving up the lag. They\u0027re also ugly. As a result of these two principles (\u0022Don\u0027t break in half\u0022 and \u0022No orange tanks\u0022), my design is somewhat....unusual. Still. It might just be crazy enough to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4915761/KSP%20Jool-5/screenshot445.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot445.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial design for my propulsion module came about from a project I had to shift a space station to Duna. Lifting this thing into orbit was quite fun. When I decided to attempt the Jool-5 challenge, I decided to repurpose it. Unfortunately, it had very little thrust for getting out of kerbin\u0027s gravity well with the heavier load that would be required for the challenge. The final nail in the coffin of this design was when I discovered that I\u0027d put the main docking node on backwards, making it useless. Back to the drawing board!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Oh yes, and I\u0027m running the Environmental Enhancement mod.

No idea if that\u0027s enough fuel though. Probably isn\u0027t. I\u0027ve got plans to deal with that later though.........note the SRBs to get it off the pad. The outer set of 6 aren\u0027t actually dropped...they overheat and explode, leaving the other 6 to give a little more power before being dropped.

By the end of this update, the area between 70-100km is going to be absolutely \u003Cem\u003Efull\u003C/em\u003E of space junk. Once it\u0027s in space, this module handles rather well by itself, and could probably have done a grand tour all by itself.

Like the last module, it also features a tug for control, but it also has some probe bodies as backups (I think/hope). It also has 4 docking ports for the Advanced Dockable Science Packages that will be used on the landers (and for orbital stuff as well). The science packages need to come back to Kerbin in order to meet the more difficult versions of the challenge, and I think with some extra modules I can certainly manage that. However, this lab has no parachutes and thus each science package needs to be able to re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and land safely.

I\u0027m replacing these though, since I missed some stuff off them. I\u0027ll show the new ones in a future update. They\u0027re basically a probe body, RTGs, tiny RCS tank, 4 RCS quads (seriously high TWR on these things), a science-junior and all the sensors, plus a size 1 and a size 0 docking port and some parachutes for recovery back at Kerbin.

I just lobbed up my Tylo lander, but this post is getting a bit hefty, and I\u0027m pretty much at the halfway point of the build anyway so this seems a good place to stop for now. The remaining parts are the Reserve Fuel \u0026amp; Command Module, the Tylo \u0026amp; Universal Lander, the Laythe Lander, and the revised ADSP modules. Then I think I\u0027m going to do something inventive and clever to add more fuel capacity to this monster of a ship.

I have never landed on Tylo previously, and couldn\u0027t find any guidelines on how to make a simple lander. So I guessed that if Tylo has gravity similar to Kerbin, then any spacecraft able to take off and get into orbit from Kerbin with fuel to spare \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E have a reasonable chance of doing the Tylo run. If I\u0027m wrong on this, please correct me before I send this thing off on a suicide mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main core of the lander is designed to be re-used for Vall, Bop and Pol, and features 4 LV-909s. Outside this, two skipper-powered boosters (hopefully) give the heft required to slow down for a landing on Tylo. Ejectable ladders and landing gear enable EVA on the surface without using jetpacks (which obviously do not work on Tylo). Just in case, I also added some smaller drop-tanks on the outside of these to give even more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I took the unusual (apparently) step of adding SRBs to these drop tanks. Why SRBs? Because for the initial approach to Tylo, I am going to be coming in fast. Very fast. And since I know that this thing barely has the TWR to get off the ground on Kerbin, having a bit more oomph will hopefully help out. Once they\u0027re burned out, I can eject them with the side-mounted droptanks and continue onwards on internal fuel.

It \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E fly to LKO by itself.....but only by staging. Since I need thos stages for Tylo, I needed to build a medium-heavy lifter underneath it. But once I messed around a bit, it worked quite well.

Half the time the RCS didn\u0027t seem to do anything, and when it \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E, the craft would still randomly jerk around when thrusting (forwards and back. I know about translation balance). This thing was a write-off. Eventually I lost patience and reverted back to the quicksave I took when the Tylo Lander first reached the mothership\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4915761/KSP%20Jool-5/screenshot523.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot523.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I get the confounded thing docked. There is literally no space at all for error when docking the full lander. I lost about 6 docking attempts due to having the RCS quads on the side of the science module deflect the boosters on the lander. No damage, but it\u0027d bounce the damned thing away and I\u0027d have to have another go at getting the angle right without smashing bits of the ship. Still....it\u0027s docked. And assuming I even make it to Tylo, the next time I dock this lander it will be sans the boosters that made this so damned annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem now is that this lander only has a 1.25m docking port on it for the next module. So whatever I send to Laythe is going to be \u003Cem\u003Esmall\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Dockable Science Package Redesign\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve redesigned the ADSP, and I\u0027m working to ship it out now. There\u0027s been a few failures and mistakes, so it\u0027s not up yet. The new version features all the missing sensors, and the final version will also have some extra Science Junior units so I can do orbital work from the mothership as well....since the orbital packages were going to be on the reserve fuel module, which has now been dumped. No pictures though. I de-orbited one of the old modules to see how well it fared for sample recovery. The good news is that it does fine. The bad news is that it\u0027s too big to fit under the Tylo Lander once the boosters are ejected...so I\u0027ve still got some work to do to make sure the new modules will fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4915761/KSP%20Jool-5/screenshot547.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot547.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis version made it all the way to the mothership, before I realised that RCS fuels are useless when you\u0027ve forgotten to put quads on the ADSP units as well.

It has a bunch of fuel, 2 small engines, and multiple options for docking (a standard docking point, and also a claw). it can operate in the Reserve Tank mode using the docking port to stay inline with the center of mass, or it can grapple an uncontrolled payload for recovery with the claw. Refuel-to-empty (where the tug is dscarded) also uses the claw, because it\u0027s quicker to dock with and uses less monopropellant. It\u0027s launched with the standard launcher I\u0027ve used for quite a few of the smaller modules now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4915761/KSP%20Jool-5/screenshot531.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot531.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo try out the idea, I lobbed a prototype up. It seems to work well...I think I\u0027ll use this one to top-off the tanks on the Tylo Lander, then alter it a little. If I add a couple of seats, it can also serve as a lifeboat for lander crews in an emergency. This module will be docked behind the main engines of the propulsion module, so it may be a little radioactive. Hopefully those seats aren\u0027t needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPropulsion Module Stability Test\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that old prototype of the propulsion module that I couldn\u0027t use because the docking port was on backwards? It was sitting in a 200km orbit, and I decided to take advantage of this to see how it went. A full power burn would de-orbit the stage, keeping the orbit clear for future use. It would also give valuable data on the stability of the propulsion module, fuel consumption, and acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4915761/KSP%20Jool-5/screenshot534.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot534.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tests showed that overheating is not a problem with the NERVA engines alone (although the SRBs on the actual stage may cause issues), but that stability and acceleration are critical issues for this module. Hopefully the extra reaction wheels on the mothership can point the ship in the right direction (although thus far it appears to turn pretty awfully), and the SRBs can handle at least the first major burn. However, this brings up the elephant in the room:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Consumption\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, the de-orbit took a lot more fuel than I\u0027d like. Sure, I had plenty of fuel left, but this module is a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E lighter than the Yet To Be Named Mothership. Combined with the slow acceleration that will probably force some inefficient strategies...and I need to find a way to add more fuel to this thing. But here\u0027s the thing: I can\u0027t. The last two docking ports are reserved for the laythe lander (which I still haven\u0027t got a design for yet)and the minitug....and the only other places I could put them are going to be used for the science payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis requires some experimentation..and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do. I\u0027ve got 6 SRBs attached to the side of the ship for boosting away from kerbin. I believe that the bracing on these parts is strong enough that they can be used to mount extra fuel. Unfortunately, they do not have any ports on them. So I\u0027m going to have to use 2 claw units per fuel tank, and line the tank up absolutely perfectly before docking it. I\u0027m planning to use the Mk.1 Minitug to test out the Claw. I\u0027ve used them before for asteroid capture....once....and I broke spacetime with them once. So assuming I can quicksave enough to avoid the more horrible bugs, this idea might just work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if it doesn\u0027t...well....I guess I\u0027ll just go for the mission and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENext time: The Laythe Lander, ADSP Mk.3, and Claw Chaos!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
