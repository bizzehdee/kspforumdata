After a sucsesfull injection into jool and a very intense aerobrake it made it to orbit. First stop was laythe. (Pictures comming up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we went to vall, We dident get as close as laythe but some spectacular images where taken. We then scheduled a transfer to tylo but laythe caught up and deorbitis Kirsinni. I was discouraged because every burn i doo takes an hour to complete. But instead I let Kirsinni Fall to its doom. I recorded date and im currently working Excell to find coralation between Altitude and tempurature, Pressure, gforces, and Gravitational pull. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver all i got some awesome data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPICTURES TO COME SOON.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
