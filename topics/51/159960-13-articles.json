Unfortunately this involves having actual actors in the same place and probably sets. And we would have to deal with zero gravity. The KSP of course would be loaded up on visual mods.

Out of the window loomed a sad, medium grey world, nearly entirely\u00A0covered by thick grey clouds. Through some of the gaps in the clouds I could see what appeared to be grey frozen oceans. In one spot, there was a massive crack, hundreds or thousands of miles long, and in places, glowing orange lava was visible at the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow...

The massive Amulet class starship, the Peace Rose, had served as Kerbin\u0027s command ship over the past several days, in Low Meros Orbit. It also functioned as a de facto\u00A0space station, one of the most important around Meros.\u00A0In addition to the multiple rocket powered landing craft it carried, numerous ships of all kinds frequently docked to it. A much larger station was being constructed at the moment, as the amount of cargo headed to Meros would need to rapidly increase in the following days.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe ship was about 100 meters long and housed Ambassador Jebediah Kerman, several dozen crew members, and precisely thirty-eight Merosians (each in a spacesuit that supplied the gases they breathed), the only ones in space at the moment, and most of the Merosians who had ever been to space.\u00A0There were many prominent leaders on board, several scientists and engineers working with the Kerbals, a few translators, and two of the first Merosian astronaut class. One Merosian country had an early space program which was on the cusp of manned spaceflight. However, their prototype space capsule had only flown once, unmanned, before it was evident that Meros was doomed. Both of the astronauts were ecstatic to be there.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThose thirty-eight Merosians, along with dozens of Kerbals including Jebediah Kerman, were on the observation deck of the Peace Rose, which featured an artificial gravity wheel system. The ship\u00A0had been moved to a medium orbit in order to observe the Cetidra. Cetidra was a word that appeared in the Kersieik language, a prominent language on Meros, and showed up, slightly varied, in many other Merosian languages.\u00A0It has no equivalent English word, but can be loosely translated as the opposite of an apocalypse. Jebediah took his place at the microphone in front of the group of Kerbals and Merosians, known as\u00A0the Cetidra Assembly.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You all know what we are here for, but I shall briefly explain once more, as the events of today will no doubt live on in history for millennia. There will be few Merosians who do not look back at this day.\u0022 There was a murmur from the crowd.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022We currently orbit Meros, a world which has been devastated by incomplete knowledge of global systems,\u00A0shortsighted thinking, and delayed or nonexistent action. Meros suffers from many perils, many small, and many seemingly insurmountably huge. Chief among them is the over-consumption of Meros\u0027s abundant supply of fossil fuels. Due to the pollutants causing a greenhouse effect, the surface temperature of Meros has rapidly risen. The high temperatures have created feedback loops all throughout Meros, on its surface, subsurface, and oceans, releasing more and more warming gases. The temperature of Meros has risen by over twenty degrees centigrade, causing uncountable side effects.\u00A0Most crucially, as we speak the atmosphere is growing more and more toxic to Merosians, and is expected to be completely deadly in a handful of days.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Once more as you all know, recently the Kerbals and the Merosians met by chance in this great cosmic void. We are doing everything in our power to help protect Meros and all\u00A0life on it. As mentioned earlier, there are many problems facing Meros, but in order to fix them, we must first solve the temperature crisis and the atmospheric toxicity crisis. We debated on the best way to do this. Our main options were construction of a massive solar shield and the releasing of cooling gasses into the atmosphere, each followed by cleaning the atmosphere. Unfortunately, we have no idea what side effects these cooling gases will have on the environment, and we don\u0027t want to make the problem worse than it is. A giant sunshade will take too much time to build. We needed a measure to buy us time.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022So here we are today, the day of the Cetidra. A tremendous number of atomic explosives have been buried deep underneath the northern wastelands of Elkirdi. The surrounding area has\u00A0been fully evacuated.\u00A0In just a few minutes from now,\u00A0those explosives will detonate with the force of many gigatons of TNT, propelling billions of tons of dust high into the atmosphere, forming a worldwide cloud layer. We have calculated that this dust will reflect the sunlight away from the planet and will act as a temporary sunshield until the real one can be built. This explosion will provide about 80 percent of the required cooling... As there is a large margin of error in our calculations, we don\u0027t want to risk overcooling the planet. After a few days several follow-up detonations will take place, further tuning the dust levels.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Meros is expected to undergo a massive famine after today\u0027s events. Kerbin is working to produce as much food as possible for all of the species on Meros. Kerbin is also in the process of manufacturing enough protective gear for all Merosians, to protect against the dust, the radiation, and some of the more toxic atmospheric gases. All of this will be shipped to Meros on our rapidly expanding fleet of cargo ships. Initially, existing designs will be used, but in the next few weeks the design of the Meros class will be completed, designed specifically for this job, and in the coming months thousands will be built. We will construct a massive space station, Space Station Hope,\u00A0near Meros where these ships will dock. There we will station several dozen, maybe even several hundred single stage to orbit spacecraft which will distribute the food and supplies all across Meros. It is this station to which the supplies for the massive sunshade will be brought. Construction will begin in the coming months.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Today is not just the day we save the planet.

Many of them were thankful. All of them were hopeful, even those who disagreed with the plan.

Jebediah took a drink from his water bottle and turned around to face the planet Meros. It would be years before this view would be available again, the dust would block it all out. Meros was so beautiful. The views were spectacular, of course, but the planet was many times\u00A0more beautiful because of all of the souls who called it home. Thousands of star systems had been surveyed and yet Kerbin and Meros were the only two worlds so far to bear the gift of intelligent life. Both of those worlds had experienced major events that proved just how fragile and precious that life was, and what measures must be taken in order to protect it.\u00A0Kerbin had been saved, and so\u00A0would Meros.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA tear slid down Jebediah\u0027s cheek.

By some miracle they made it through the atmosphere intact, but there was no safe spot to land, as the surface was still extremely turbulent. While hovering above the surface, the ship was struck by a massive rock which had fallen back down from space.

The layers are separated by a relatively thin layer of fairly inert rock.\u00A0Due to the scale of the detonation, large sections of the two layers were flung up into the air, and in the heat of the explosion, the mixture was set alight, propagating back down into Meros, the explosion crushing the layers\u00A0in between. The explosion continued, radiating rapidly out from the epicenter, completely encircling Meros.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How does a planet go that long without something like that being triggered by an asteroid impact?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Both layers were incredibly deep underground. It would have taken a massive asteroid to trigger it, so massive that it would have ended most life anyways.\u00A0The detonation was incredibly deep in order to kick up as much dust\u00A0as possible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow...\u0022 We stood around for a few seconds, still trying to take it all in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Last Merosian kept a diary. In his last days he wrote for much of each day, about all manner of things. At times, especially near the end, he was barely coherent.\u0022 Gixant, the Curator, gestured towards a glass enclosure. Inside was a stand with a very, very old book on it. It had markings on the front, which were not automatically translated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What does it say?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I do not read that language, but it is known to be a particular year in the Merosian calendar, suggesting that he had more diaries for previous years. Below that was his name, but it was scratched out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What was his name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t know?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He was an engineer who came along with one of the leaders. There wasn\u0027t much visitor documentation for the \u003Cem\u003EPeace Rose\u003C/em\u003E, so he fell\u00A0under the radar... We only know\u00A0some of the names, and the fact that 38 Merosians were on board.\u00A0And, of course, the biggest source of Merosian documentation, Meros itself, was blown up. He wouldn\u0027t tell us his name, in fact went to great lengths to prevent us from ever knowing. To this day, he is known simply as The Last Merosian.\u0022 I leaned in towards the glass surrounding the diary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what about the Deep Heart?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody could\u00A0find it. It could have been completely crushed, and it was almost certainly damaged, probably beyond repair. If there were Merosians down there, they would have had no way of getting back up, not unless they could have tunneled through miles of ash and rock.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What if it wasn\u0027t damaged and they are still down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This was over four hundred years ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022While it is theoretically possible they could still be alive, it is incredibly unlikely. In any event, we have tried time and time again to locate the Deep Heart, but we have had no luck, and now, we never will.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what about - \u0022 His communicator rang. He answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes? Understood. Preparing.\u0022 He pressed the button on the communicator. \u0022Attention all beings in the Tuun system, as of this moment the museum is closed. Place the station into long term hibernation. We leave at the end of the day. Jebediah Kerman will arrive in a few minutes to formally decommission the system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So... That\u0027s it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Species is coming, and is this the end of the story of Meros?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We know not what will become of Meros under Species control, but that is a very likely outcome,\u0022 said the receptionist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The end of Meros, possibly,\u0022 said the curator, \u0022But the end of the story of the Merosians ended a long time ago.\u0022 A communicator beeped again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello. Understood. Attention, there was a miscommunication. Jebediah Kerman is here right now and is heading to the museum wing.\u0022 He put the communicator down again. \u0022Unfortunately we have to ask you to leave, but if it is any consolation, you will have the opportunity to meet Jebediah Kerman himself in just a few minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh... Err... We would love to, but we already met him and - \u0022 Evelina cut me off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And we need to be on our way soon. I would imagine our ship is ready by now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, then. I wish you luck on your journey.\u0022 He was about to say more, but then we heard footsteps from down one of the museum hallways. Evelina and I panicked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bye!\u0022 she said, dragging me further down the hall and around the corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The exit is that - Oh. Greetings, Representative - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Out,\u0022 said Jebediah. \u0022Turn cameras off. I shall not be bothered unless it is a matter of utmost importance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood.\u0022 We heard two sets of footsteps walking rapidly away. Evelina and I stood just around the corner, trying to be as quiet as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022He\u0027s here?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I thought.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Why now?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0We stood there as still as possible for what felt like several minutes before I slowly crept to the edge of the corner and risked a peek around. Jebediah was standing there, facing the journal, his head lowered slightly, his hands held in front of him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe said nothing for several more minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry. I did it again. I swore I wouldn\u0027t. I swore I\u0027d learn. But I pressed the button again. No sorry can undo or make up for that.\u0022 He stood in silence once more. \u0022I... I know nothing can make up for what I did, both recently and all of those centuries ago... I don\u0027t even know if it\u0027s worth it to try.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah hunched over and bawled, sobbing sentence fragments before giving up and curling up on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI turned away from the hall and tried to walk quietly down the hall we were in, trying to find a way out. Shortly into the journey I came across a window with a view of Meros.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought of all that had been lost. The lives, the loves, the stories...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe happiness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe futures of all of the Merosians.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow, in the face of despair, they had been given hope, only to have it torn down in a matter of seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the original despair... Would the futures of the Merosians have contained much happiness at all either way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI turned around, and there was an exhibit before me, the centerpiece of which was a large picture, a grainy, enlarged photograph of a rocket with a space capsule on top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI skimmed the exhibit\u0027s text.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the only remaining photograph of the launch of the Starshot\u00A0I, the culmination of the Merosian space program. It was a space capsule, fairly similar to the Mercury capsule. The Starshot I mission was the unmanned test flight of the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first third of the exhibit\u00A0was dedicated to what little was known about the early Merosian space programs and Starshot I.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the exhibit discussed Starshot\u00A0II, which was drastically accelerated and modified following the realization that most Merosian life would soon die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarshot II was a last ditch attempt at saving the species, which when faced with overwhelming odds stopped being a serious attempt at survival and instead became an attempt at giving the Merosians hope for survival.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan was to launch a heavily modified Starshot capsule that could seat two, connected to a massive service module carrying months worth of life support. This would be docked to a habitation module, pre-positioned in orbit, and then the two spacecraft would\u00A0dock\u00A0to a transfer stage. The three modules would be launched by multi-core versions of the existing single core Starshot lifter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe habitation module would launch first. The crew, one man and one woman, would launch second and dock to it. The transfer stage would launch third, and the crew would rendezvous with\u00A0and dock to it, and then the whole stack would be sent away towards the next planet inward, Etrolah. The crew would re-enter while still on a hyperbolic trajectory, land, plant the many seeds they had brought with them, and attempt to restart Merosian civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Merosians had only ever launched a handful of satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe single core launch vehicle had only flown a few times, and did not have the greatest track record.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no pads for anything beyond the three core version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome plans called for a lifter with eight cores.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarshot was only designed for a short flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo Merosian had flown in space before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo Merosian spacecraft had ever docked with another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo Merosian spacecraft had ever re-entered that fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo Merosian spacecraft had ever flown by another planet, much less landed on one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe life support systems had never been used operationally for a short flight, much less a months long flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy weight, the vast majority of the stuff launched on the mission would have never been tested operationally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could go on and on with all of the things that made this mission nearly hopeless, but here\u0027s the real kickers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody knew what Etrolah was like. All the Merosians knew was its size, distance from Tuun, its color, and that it had an atmosphere. The odds that it was habitable, well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if by some miracle,\u00A0\u00A0if everything went perfectly, well...\u00A0One could not rebuild a healthy population with the genetic diversity of only two people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission was feasible\u00A0on paper, but, in practice, all but impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first launch, carrying the habitation module, launched early on and\u00A0exploded. The plan was changed. The trip would be done without the habitation module.\u00A0Two people crammed into a space capsule for months\u00A0that was already cramped with one person for a day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA secretive country offered their unproven launch vehicle for a smaller version of the living module in exchange for being able to submit an astronaut for training. Not even for selection... Just for the slight chance of being selected. That launch nearly failed, but it placed the smaller version into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the capsule and the transfer stage were due to launch in mere days, almost at the last possible time, but then the Kerbals showed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah... Why do you blame yourself? It\u0027s not your fault!\u00A0The Merosians were already sinking massive amounts of time and resources into a plan with less chance of success than betting on a dime landing on its edge! The best they had to offer was survival bunkers for the ultra rich, and Starshot II, which at best, was false hope, and at worst, was complete fraud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you think that a plan with the potential to save\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that failed was worse?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere wasn\u0027t enough time to fully introduce the species to each other.\u00A0How was there supposed to be enough time to think of every possible outcome,\u00A0let alone\u00A0how the rock layers would chemically\u00A0interact\u00A0with each other, of all things?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if it was wrong to try to help, for some reason, the blame did not rest on one person. It rested partially on Kerbalkind, for the failed Cetidra, partially on the crew of the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPeace Rose\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for allowing most of the remaining Merosians on board the lander, but above all on the Merosian leaders for allowing their planet to get like that in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll Jebediah did was press the button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI heard Jebediah screaming and shouting.\u00A0I only caught snippets, but he was begging the diary for forgiveness \u0022one final time,\u0022 and berating himself as if the diary had responded - about how he did not deserve it and never would, about how he couldn\u0027t ever fix what he had done, about how he could never been forgiven, about how he was a monster, and about how he killed them all, every last one. Nobody deserved to be thought of like that.

In an instant all of the dark thoughts were shoved into a box in the back of his head, as far away from the present as he could get it.\u00A0\u0022I told you that I would prefer to not be disturbed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Representative - \u0022 Jebediah snapped.

There are so, so many Kerbals who could represent the planet better than I can, but for some stupid reason, be it because I was one of the first astronauts, be it because I\u0027m good at flying spaceships, be it because I saved space exploration, be it because I talk cool sometimes, be it because of all of the badassery I used to pull, or be it because I landed a moon, people want me in charge! I never wanted to be a politician! I was just relatable and notable, so they chose me as Ambassador, and next thing I know I have the blood of billions on my hands! This hand! This left hand!

I\u0027ll catch up with you!\u0022 I went back down that hallway. The main lights had gone out, and it was now just the red emergency lights. I made my way back to the exhibit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For what it\u0027s worth,\u0022 I said.\u00A0I pulled my arm back, shouted,\u00A0and punched the glass as hard as I could.\u00A0\u0022OWWW!!!\u0022 I screamed in pain. My fist bounced off, the glass not giving one bit. While clutching my hand in pain, I noticed that the exhibit had a sliding door. It wasn\u0027t even locked. If times were not so dire I would have rolled my eyes. I slid the door open and grabbed the diary of The Last Merosian and ran as fast as I could to the exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran through the museum entrance, and out into the massive glass sphere, where there was no gravity. I pushed myself as fast as I could along the handrails.\u00A0It seemed like it took forever, but I eventually crossed it and entered the hallways that lead to the docking array. I then realized that I forgot where we were docked. My heart sunk. I checked several different areas, but the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAbracadabra!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was nowhere to be found. But then, I rounded a corner and saw Evelina\u00A0 floating there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where were you?\u0022 she demanded. I held up the diary in response, running towards her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You went back for the book?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s more than a book, it\u0027s the last story of a planet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They undoubtedly have it digitized.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh...

I quickly undocked and tried to put as much distance between us and the station as possible. \u0022Where to?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Away from The Species.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t even know which way they are coming from!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Educated guess.

Therefore the\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) Hydrocarbons are only found in nature. There are specific circumstances required for animals and plants to change into (a) fossils, (b) coal, (c) natural gas or (d) oil. Therefore the existence of an entire subsurface layer of hydrocarbons is highly implausible and indicates a mass extinction several Ma ago which caused death of living things, over the entire world, in conditions conducive to fossilisation (for want of a better word).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) The melting points of most rocks is around 1000 deg C, which is the temp. of fires. Even assuming that the two layers meet in one place, they may not produce enough heat to melt the layer between them. If it is a very thin layer, then why did the heat of Meros\u0027 core not melt it, causing this earlier? Even if this does create enough heat to continue the reaction melting all around the world, the depth of this, and the high SHC of most rocks, would have probably prevented the heat to have melted the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(4) The mass extinction hypothesised above, as the only likely explanation for such large hydrocarbon deposits in one place, must have wiped out most life on Meros. This means that it must have taken a very long time to regenerate sufficient life for a flourishing ecosystem containing millions of large and complex creatures such as Merosians, and the fact that they did not know about it indicates that it is very deep. This is supported by the rates of rock formation (i.e. the Deccan Traps, volcanoes which began 66Ma ago (coincidence?) are now 2km thick) and would prevent the rocks from being melted to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(4.1) Also, it literally says \u0022incredibly deep\u0022 in the story. The temperatures generated by the volume of hydrocarbon that would be created if we all died today is not enough to melt through kilometers of rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(5) Vulcanism and plate tectonics means that at certain points around the world, these hydrocarbons will continuously be in contact with the immense heat of plate tectonics, and, due to the fact that magma includes dissolved gases, O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E as well. Why have they not already been set alight? What about previous asteroid impacts or earthquakes, which are actually quite frequent?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(6) The massive SHC of rocks is indicated by the fact that lava flows never melt rock beneath (although they can cause metamorphism, which as you know is due to high heat and temperature), and that it can take hundreds to thousands of years for underground magma to cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(7) In conclusion, that explanation for the destruction of Meros is nearly impossible, and having sorted that out, I can go and believe that they are all alive and lived as happily as we can expect ever after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for going overly scientific on you.

Therefore the existence of an entire subsurface layer of hydrocarbons is highly implausible and indicates a mass extinction several Ma ago which caused death of living things, over the entire world, in conditions conducive to fossilisation (for want of a better word).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 1, reasons why Meros may have a massive hydrocarbon layer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI admit I put very little thought into what would create a uniform worldwide layer.\u00A0As you said, a\u00A0mass extinction around the world in just the right way to make a uniform layer would be incredibly unlikely, especially given that Meros has been said to have both land and oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdge case: Meros could have an underground populated or once populated by microbes living off of heat or minerals\u00A0producing methane or something else as a byproduct, but this also requires a similar rock layer around the world although this is more likely than a worldwide mass extinction. I just thought of this and there are doubtless many problems with this so don\u0027t take this as fact. Especially the heat part, as you mentioned heat is already really problematic in this system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have mostly eliminated life as a source for the layer, so maybe we can turn to chemical means. There is a real world example for a world having a lot of Methane with no known life (although life is possible): Titan, although this is admittedly atmospheric and surface\u00A0methane rather than subsurface deposits of ambiguous \u0022hydrocarbons.\u0022 Titan also doesn\u0027t have oxygen (at least not a lot of it) so that does pose a problem... There are many theories as for where this methane came from, but one theory is that it outgassed from way below the surface, having been made through radioactive processes near the core,\u00A0meaning that some of it was/is below the surface, just not in a uniform layer. If there was a gas-tight layer of rock then during the outgassing it could have gotten trapped below it in a porous rock layer, instead of reaching the atmosphere, I guess... But this would mean that there can\u0027t be a significantly large way up to the surface otherwise it would all leak out, and it would also require worldwide rock layers. Uniform worldwide rock layers are also unlikely, but more likely than a uniform hydrocarbon layer caused by a mass-extinction. Maybe Meros has a mostly uniform rocky body with only small bodies of water breaking up the uniformity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummary: Meros\u0027s hydrocarbon layer is not very realistic, and pretty much impossible when considering a mass extinction. However, the outgassing theory might bring it into the realm of improbability instead of impossibility. There is probably some combination of factors that could make the formation of such a layer possible. Due to the size of the universe, if it is possible at all it will probably happen somewhere.

Why have they not already been set alight?

I don\u0027t want to put a number on the depth because again I am not a geologist, but I think I most likely\u00A0overstated the depth. There is a fairly simple explanation for the Merosians not knowing about the layer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeros in my head is like Titan\u0027s levels of fuel but taken to the extreme. On Meros there\u00A0is a massive amount near (but not on) the surface (not enough to start a world ending explosion), which is the supply that the Merosians used to fuel all of their stuff. The near surface reserves, which would have been sporadic like Earth\u0027s, actually caused by dying stuff, would have held way more fuel than Earth\u0027s do. They had enough fuel near the surface to last for a long time, it was not really beneficial to explore mining deeper, for fuel, at least... Mining for other stuff, maybe... That is something I have no explanation for. Maybe it wouldn\u0027t have been economical to exploit the layer even if they knew of it, because of all the near-surface reserves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we\u0027re going with the Titan-esque, theory, maybe the near surface reserves are mostly oil and coal, and the deeper stuff is methane, and their energy grid is not set up for methane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also part of the reason Climate was such a huge problem, with all of the fuel available they would have ramped up usage early, and would have used it abundantly\u00A0without much care for efficiency, hence why they are having climate problems despite being at somewhere around 40-s to 60-s technology depending on what you\u0027re measuring by. I also consider Meros to be a much more fragile world climate-wise than Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, depending on the depth of the layer and mineral availability at the surface, it is possible that the only holes deep enough to reach the layer would have been the entrance to the Deep Heart and the Cetidra Detonation holes, all of which were focused mostly on speed and payed little to no attention to the geology of the surrounding rock beyond what it would take to get through it, and in the case of the Cetidra, how good it would work at blocking the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFocusing on how long it would have taken the layer to reach that depth, I have no idea how fast new rock is piled on top of old rock,\u00A0but I think\u00A0it happens at different rates on Earth and if we go interplanetary it is probably even more varied. I know nothing on this and there could be a real problem here, but if we don\u0027t go with the mass extinction model then it isn\u0027t a problem at all because the layer could have formed at a different time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: as I type I am starting to like the Titan-esque theory way more than the Extinction theory but I will continue to address both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the layer separating the two layers,\u00A0the Cetidra detonations don\u0027t so much melt it as they do pulverize it and kick debris from the layers into the air, where it mixes and reacts. Once the reaction had started it had enough energy to expand outwards, crushing the layer as it went, allowing for more mixing and reacting, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem now is, as you said, the layer in between melting or getting disturbed allowing for the rocks to mix, or in the Titan theory, allowing for the methane to leak out. As the layer isn\u0027t deep enough to experience high temperatures, melting by the core wouldn\u0027t really be an issue. As for the explosion reaching the surface and killing everything, again, the layer may not be as deep as originally thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTHOUGHT: Another interesting theory is that the Cetidra detonations cracked the surface enough to release the methane, which mixed with the oxygen atmosphere and burned the surface, but this would be a local event that wouldn\u0027t kill everyone, unless it used up all of the oxygen, leaving the Merosians unable to breathe... The atmosphere was already close to toxic and this would have put it over the edge. But this is just a thought experiment and has nothing to do with the other two theories, and it wouldn\u0027t be nearly instant. It would also leave people in shelters like the Deep Heart alive. IDK if I mentioned it in the story\u00A0but on Meros the rich were building shelters, mostly on the surface, and stockpiling energy and oxygen so they could survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n/end thought\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issues left in this part are\u00A0(1) the explosion of the layer not being enough to make it to the surface, and (2) something not causing an early detonation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 is a major issue depending on the depth of the layers, which can\u0027t be too shallow that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. The rock on top of it could have been eroded, exposing it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. An asteroid could have hit early and started the detonation (also plays into 2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC. It was discovered and accidentally mixed and detonated (the explanation also plays into 2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether the explosion will significantly disturb the surface is critical to the entire Cetidra. I am not very well versed in explosives, but I\u0027d imagine we want the layer as shallow as possible while still\u00A0avoiding A B or C to give the explosion the greatest chance of reaching the surface. Also, as with the in-between layer, I tend to imagine that this layer wasn\u0027t melted, but mechanically fractured to the point of destruction by the blast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA, well, maybe Meros doesn\u0027t get a lot of erosion, despite Merosian rhyming with Erosion. It\u0027s another planet, and we really only have one data point as to how geological processes work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB, this also plays into 2 as said before, Jupiter is theorized to, in effect, shield Earth from long period comets and some asteroids with its massive gravity well. It is possible that Meros has a gas giant or gas giants nearby providing the same effect but perhaps at a larger scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC is a bit more difficult to explain, as it is known that the layers were breached at least twice (once for the Deep Heart and at least once for the Cetidra, it could have been one hole that branched out or several holes) without a detonation. The assumption that both layers could have mixed during this and may have been fairly easy to ignite. I mentioned that the rocks in the oxygenated layer require lots of energy to release their oxygen in the first place (didn\u0027t think this one out either, brings up more problems, but in this case it might save me) so it should require a large trigger event to cause a detonation, something like a huge asteroid impact, or the Cetidra. Small fires or maybe smaller earthquakes or volcanic events would not be enough to trigger it. If the setup is right, the layers would kind of be like C4, hard to detonate without the right conditions, but very powerful if detonated correctly. This should also explain the rest of 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBig important part:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as for plate tectonics and volcanoes, those big enough to trigger the Cetidra, it is known that Meros has no supervolcanoes, I believe I mentioned it in the story. Otherwise, the Kerbals would have attempted to blow up a supervolcano to block the sun out.\u00A0Earth has several supervolcanoes, which implies that Meros has a much lower level of volcanic activity than Earth does, and possibly by association a much lower level of tectonic activity. The effects of not being very tectonically active go beyond just eliminating triggers for the Cetidra, they also allow for higher chances of a worldwide rock layer staying together over time and not developing massive gaps which would cause\u00A0mixing, leaking, or detonation. I\u0027m not a geologist, but if I understand correctly, lower tectonic activity allows for a more uniform surface, allowing for higher chances of a worldwide rock layer forming in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessing with tectonic activity could affect how life forms and evolves, given some of the theories that a reliable heat source helps with the formation of life,\u00A0but we have a grand total of one data point on this topic so I\u0027m just going to leave it as \u0022It\u0027s possible it had minimal impact\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummary: I greatly overstated the depth of the layers. They are higher up, meaning that melting of the in-between layer by the planet\u0027s heat shouldn\u0027t be an issue, and also that the explosive energy needed to destroy the surface shouldn\u0027t be *as* much of an issue, although admittedly it is still an issue.\u00A0The in between layer would be pulverized instead of melted, as would the surface layer, although definitely not to the extent that the in between layer would have been.\u00A0How quickly the layers are covered up by new layers and how this plays into timeframes, well, this shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue as Meros\u0027s rock layers could be forming at a wide range of speeds and isn\u0027t too constrained by what we see on Earth. The chances of premature detonation, especially with the rock layers so high up in this revision, can be explained by\u00A0the idea that the detonation would take a high energy event to start (AKA Cetidra or impact) (explained by the energy levels needed to get usable oxygen out of the oxygenated rock) and then minimizing the probabilities of those said high energy events happening. The\u00A0most notable of those fixes are\u00A0gas giants shielding Meros from comets and asteroids, and the low levels of tectonic and volcanic activities preventing volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and hot spots from detonating the planet. The reduced tectonic activity *probably* increases the chances of worldwide rock layers forming and staying\u00A0maintaining a good enough seal between the fuel and oxidizer layers over time.\u00A0With the high energy threshold, the issue of tunneling into the layers causing a detonation is also mostly solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote 1: I should have split this up into two parts, the second one for vulcanism/tectonics and the first for everything else in this part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223726743\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159960\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221578689367\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195204\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fulgur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, fulgur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(6) The massive SHC of rocks is indicated by the fact that lava flows never melt rock beneath (although they can cause metamorphism, which as you know is due to high heat and temperature), and that it can take hundreds to thousands of years for underground magma to cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecific Heat Capacity is an important part of the picture\u00A0when you involve melting stuff.
