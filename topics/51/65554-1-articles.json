You still have to position it first, undock a part and then \u0027catch\u0027 it as it falls (if it\u0027s on the same vehicle), but I find this process more forgiving with a magnet. Also, objects don\u0027t fall that quickly on Minmus (and don\u0027t get easily damaged if they do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crane really is a lot more versatile and practical then I imagined, I even went back to using it after an affair with skycranes and MechJeb, the only problem is the joints and how they deteriorate gradually with game loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KeithStone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KeithStone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInspiring me to finally build a self-assembling base!

I tried to build the same sort of thing and found that you couldn\u0027t dock the object at the end of the crane to the same structure the crane was anchored on; the object would pass through the docking port as if it wasn\u0027t there.

Using tweakable everything allows for much stronger capture strength to help line your parts up perfectly, and reducing the acquire range allows for the parts to connect even when they start right next to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
