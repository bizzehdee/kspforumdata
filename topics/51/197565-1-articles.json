(Although conspiracy theorists believe that it was a ploy by big icecream to discover if Minmus is made of Icecream, and then when they discovered it wasn\u0027t, they sent the probe and declared the crewed missions unsuccessful). It involved a single flight of a crewed mission, which hoped to gather surface samples to see if they could possibly peel back the curtain to the orgins of the incredible feature of Minmus, but with the astronauts strong desires to eat, instead of examine and study the samples gathered, very little of the sample remained unexposed to the inside of a Kerbals mouth. As a result, the decision was made to send an uncrewed seismic probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wBAXWE5BpE?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
