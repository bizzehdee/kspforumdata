The first stage consisted of the Army\u0027s Jupiter IRBM while the second consisted of 11 Sergeant solid rockets arranged in a crown. This bundle boosted a final stage of a single Sergeant rocket mated to the Explorer 1 science payload into orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe political background that led to the launch is a storied event, but can be summarized as the result of Presidential intervention on the inter-service rivalry that erupted between the United States Army, Air Force, and Navy on the development and future of American rocketry. Each service proposed their own vision of the future and asked for the funding to make it\u00A0possible. In the end the Army won the prize of launching the World\u0027s first satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt must be stated that Von Kerman had originally pitched to launch the first satellite as soon as kerbally possible using the less capable, but available Redstone rocket and a three-stage arrangement of Sergeant rockets. He had been denied, as the President sided with the Army on further development of space launch vehicles and wanted it \u0022done right\u0022 using the more powerful Jupiter rocket.\u00A0Readings from the Explorer satellite would show the existence of two separate bands of higher radiation in orbit, now known as the Van Kerman radiation belts. Explorer would provide radiation data until its batteries depleted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/tfeCKFc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tfeCKFc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tfeCKFc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/TsfbHXs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TsfbHXs.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TsfbHXs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch 2: Vanguard 1 / Jupiter LV2\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission: Scientific experiment satellite to medium Kerbin orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrbit Information: 895km x 248km, 33.8 deg inclination.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPayload: Vanguard 1 - Temperature sensor, and radio transmitter.

Vanguard was the first use of the four-stage arrangement of the Jupiter launch vehicle. In this configuration, the 11 Sergeant rocket crown would detach itself from a three Sergeant stage, before terminating with a single Sergeant and the Vanguard 1 payload. Unlike the Explorer, a decoupler was used to detach Vanguard to orbit alone after the rocket was depleted. Vanguard itself took initial orbital temperature readings and had a repeating transmitter which was used to in an effort to correlate the size and shape of Kerbin. Vanguard was the first satellite with small solar panels which allowed it to recharge its batteries.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/CcLbnre\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CcLbnre.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CcLbnre.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/Z9zjzkb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Z9zjzkb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z9zjzkb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch 3: Explorer 2 / Jupiter LV3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission: Scientific experiment satellite to medium Kerbin orbit.

This allowed Explorer 2 to reach a higher orbit than its predecessor. Publicly the satellite was used to reinforce the discovery of the Van Kerman radiation belts and provided a second series of data in which to map the radiation belts. Secretly, Explorer 2 was also used to detect radiation levels in space as part of Operation Argus.

Cross flew the aircraft for about an hour as he tested its capabilities and flying qualities. The plane had trouble in level flight and required its nose raised. This was in spite of the forward winglets that were part of the design to assist with this specific aerodynamic issue. Not surprising, at slow speeds the plane tended to lose altitude due to its narrow wing span.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, Cross found Dyna-Soar to by flyable and relatively nimble.

The resulting aircraft was the Model B, which weighed half a ton less than its more nimble predecessor. Most of this weight savings came at the cost reducing the size and power of the jet engine in order to fit inside an Agena based collar. This vastly reduced Dyna-Soar\u0027s aerial performance. It was also found that the forward winglets of the Model A would not withstand the temperatures of re-entry. This meant that the geometry and aerodynamics of the airframe had to be completely changed as well as the angle and fit of all the aircraft\u0027s wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBridge Kerman was the test pilot for the proving flight of the Model B.

The S-IV would burn several times to perform the rendezvous and close to within 150 meters. After Neil Kerman detached the Adapter and Logistics module from SA1, the rocket drifted away before firing for de-orbit and ending its mission as a total success.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/A7eSqrc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A7eSqrc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A7eSqrc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/BIGG9G5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BIGG9G5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BIGG9G5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch 69: Corona KH-7-9012 / Atlas SLV3 23-Agena D 6\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLocation: Woomerang Space Center\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission: Classified primary mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrbital Information: 92km x 80km, 95.3 deg inclination.

No indication that the Agena was having any trouble was found and the Fuel Cell was generating power as expected. Gordo would conduct a standing EVA from the cockpit and captured images of the southern starfield with an ultra-violet camera.

Mariner 4 was planned as a flyby that would perform its experiments and collect as much data as possible in a short amount of time. The Agena performed a course correction burn before the encounter to ensure the probe passed on the sunlit side. Mariner 4 encountered Moho on Day 247 of Year 2.

It would transmit some data from its position in the lower solar system while ARPA scientists calculated what little, if anything, could be done to extend the probe\u0027s mission. It lacked enough fuel to encounter Moho again and while it was determined that the probe could attempt to pass by the planet Eve years later, it was decided that by then there would be little value from its primitive instruments. Mariner 4 was placed into hibernation with a final course command that if the probe still functioned two years later, it would expend its fuel to make a flyby of Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/s0jTWZW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022s0jTWZW.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s0jTWZW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/alOqo6O\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022alOqo6O.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/alOqo6O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch 80: Dyna-Soar-1 / Titan IIICs-3 (Titan LV11)-Transtage 3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMission: Manned orbiter to low Kerbin orbit and return.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrbital Information: Highest orbit was 99km.

Aboard the \u003Cem\u003ECovered Wagon\u003C/em\u003E was pilot Collins Kerman and EVA-specialist Buzz Kerman. As the name of their spacecraft might hint, the goal of their mission was an extended stay in space. Their flight was the first in a tandem mission with Saturn SA3 that would launch the following day from Kerbal Space Center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n135 days had passed from the time \u003Cem\u003EConstellation\u003C/em\u003E had departed the space station and the arrival of Gemini 10. In all that time, \u003Cem\u003EPegasus\u003C/em\u003E had remained dormant, drifting in orbit in hibernation. After EVA transferring to the airlock, the astronauts\u0027 first duties were to see to the health of the station and bring her systems back on-line. This would take up the majority of their first day.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/WvrWiDw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022WvrWiDw.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WvrWiDw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/m3QFNzv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022m3QFNzv.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m3QFNzv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following day, Saturn SA3 arrived at \u003Cem\u003EPegasus\u003C/em\u003E bringing the right wing of the station. The Habitation section contained a bunkroom for the astronauts as well as a purpose-built space bathroom. Attached was the Greenhouse Bio-Lab to facilitate the experimenting with growing plants in space. At the end of this module was the Docking port, featuring two passive docks designed for crew transfer with\u00A0future spacecraft. The end port was of the same design, but for craft that lacked transfer capability. Namely it was intended for use with Dyna-Soar.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/UaESome\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022UaESome.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UaESome.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of Buzz\u0027s long duration tasks was the inspection of the solar arrays for micrometeoroid damage as part of the \u003Cem\u003EPegasus\u003C/em\u003E experiment. During the station\u0027s long period without habitation, the solar arrays had been left static and deployed. The prevalence of micrometeoroids and the damage they might cause to future stations, moon missions, and interplanetary craft needed to be determined. As the leading trainer of EVA activities at KASA, Buzz was highly qualified for the long and careful task ahead of him. He would also spend some time in the Dorian laboratory, but unlike the previous expedition\u00A0Buzz\u0027s assigned objectives were largely scientific in nature.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/FYlHsLa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022FYlHsLa.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FYlHsLa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring their 29 day stay in space, Collins\u0027 time was split between conducting greenhouse experiments and utilizing various station systems. No spacecraft had ever spent the amount of time in space that \u003Cem\u003EPegasus\u003C/em\u003E had and ARPA engineers were very interested in assessing its condition. Both kerbonauts enjoyed the relative luxury of the Habitation section and the benefit of eating fresh vegetables near the end of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter over three weeks in space, the crew of \u003Cem\u003ECovered Wagon\u003C/em\u003E EVA transferred to their spacecraft and waved goodbye to their home in space. The OAMS thrusters were fired and they entered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. Overall, the mission proved that given proper conditions kerbals could work and live in space for extended periods of time. Their mission ended with a touch down only meters from the runway at Area 42.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/tHpH8Lv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022tHpH8Lv.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tHpH8Lv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBuzz Kerman, left.

Originally intended as a stop-gap for the delayed Centaur stage as well as engineering practice by Von Kerman\u0027s team, the S-IV was due to be replaced by the IV-B, the same stage slated for use with the massive Project Apollo Mun rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a heavy lift vehicle, SA3 was tasked with delivering the MOL 4 payload consisting of the Habitation and Greenhouse module and Docking port to \u003Cem\u003EPegasu\u003C/em\u003Es station. After reaching a 90km parking orbit, the S-IV boosted to 203km to create an encounter with the station.
