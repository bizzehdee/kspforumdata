For me it was during one of manned missions to Mun. It was time to go home, so i folded solar panels and ladders, turned engines on and started gravity turn couple of seconds after lift-off. Terrain in my lander\u0027s flight path was relatively flat so i\u0027ve continued burning horizontally to gain as much velocity as possible. Then i looked up from the navball, and lo and behold - Kerbin was spectacularly rising straight before the nose of the lander in all its blue and green glory. I caught myself smiling broadly, and thinking about photos of Earth seen from the Moon. KSP is just a video game, but it gave me a taste of what guys from Apollo missions felt flying home.
