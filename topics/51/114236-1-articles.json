The kerbals have only launched 1 probe to duna that was useless. So they wanted to launch more probes to duna and formed.

I appreciate how they are well lit, not night time. What happened when it arrived at Duna? Did it accomplish the mission? Also, what fuel tanks are those?\n\nFor your next mission, I voted for Polar Lander. If you land near the edge of a polar region, you can have a rover visit at least three biomes within a close distance."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T11:43:50Z","Content":"I believe those are procedural tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Lime","CreatedById":137978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:22:36Z","Content":"It\u0027s crusing to Duna right now.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nit\u0027s no longer crusing to duna.
