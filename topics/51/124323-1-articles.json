There are docking ports so refuel and rocket refit is an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe road trip is starting tonight.

Just as I am planning this road trip the machine overheats and shuts down. I never thoroughly inspected and maintained the machine. The machine is a laptop that I have had for more than seven years. Never needed to open it up before but now I have had to reassemble it three times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time opening revealed much debris accumulated inside the radiator portion of the heatpipe. It would take more than a vacuum to remove that much debris. Afterwards I manually removed the rest with a swab. With everything clean the laptop restarted and ran for some time (20 minutes) then it again shut down due to overheating. The fan for the heatsink would progressively increase RPM and then the system shuts down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to further disassemble the heatsink assembly and remove it from the CPU/GPU which revealed the thermal pad is dried up. So I cleaned and replaced with some thermal grease I use with the solid state lighting assembly. This resulted in about the same 20 minutes then shut down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI further went through the process and redid the thermal grease application and the same results. The heatsink fan increases RPM and then the system shuts down.
