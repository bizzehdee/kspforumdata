Many people replied with many different answers and none of them were the same! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided to determine this answer. I have an old T-800 heavy lifter that has delta V around the 12,000 mark. That\u0027s a lot yes, but not enough in my opinion. All you need to do really is to get an \u0022Escape trajectory\u0022 out of Kerbol. Even though you are always in its SOI. I can manage this with the T-800, but once I get passed Eeloo the speed is only around 3 or 4km per second. The faster you are going the less time it will take to reach \u0022the end\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo test this out I am going to build a craft that is capable of going around 15-20 km/s once it is passing Eeloo\u0027s orbit. I am not good at doing science math so I have no idea how much Delta V the craft will need. The good this is, I have several mods helping me out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMechjeb\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKW Rocketry \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAEIS\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStretchy tanks\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemote Tech 2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of these mods adds new fuel tanks and engines to better my chances, although RT 2 is there to have a little challenge because this will be an unmanned probe that will be launched into the depths of space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea I had was install Kethane, set up a small base on Eeloo, and build a craft in orbit around the planet. Although that is a pretty good idea, it would take many launches and much trial and error. I want to test this as efficiently as possible. That leaves two other options to pick from... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA. Launch a communication network with RT 2 satellites into orbit around Kerbin and build just one massive vehicle in the VAB and launch it see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. Launch a communication network. Then assemble a interplanetary craft via docking ports in orbit around Kerbin. Fuel the ship and launch it from there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these options leaves me with one question. What is the most fuel effeicient engine to use in a vacuum? I am confident that it is the stock nuclear engine but since it only has a max thrust of 60 it isn\u0027t the best option. I need to find the engine with the best power to effeminacy ratio. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add some pictures once the craft is completed. I would like to see some suggestions on option A or B though! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if anyone would like to see a video of parts of this please show some instrest and I will get it happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow onto the last part of this post! What are your predictions that will happen? The Kracken will attack and eat my craft alive? Or my craft will come to a complete stop once it reaches a certain altitude?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T16:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is C: stick mainsail to a capsule and turn infinite fuel hack on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will happen? Probably nothing. Things that may happen theoretically but I have no idea in how distant future:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when your distance from the Sun becomes too large compared to your speed, adding distance traveled to your position may stop changing the position value. That means your ship will stop advancing although the game will still report it\u0027s traveling at speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if you keep increasing your speed, your position may eventually exceed maximum value of a double precision floating point number. In that case, anything can happen but most probable things to happen are that either the game or your ship crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"costermonger","CreatedById":101902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T16:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod (probably more than one) that offers larger (and smaller) nuclear engines with roughly equal ISP to the stock nuke. Getting off Kerbin and out to Eeloo\u0027s orbit requires slightly less than 7km/s (more than half of that is just to reach LKO) so you\u0027d need to have a reasonably efficient craft with \u0026gt;22km/s as it sits on the pad.

You should build a tiny, tiny probe with an RTG or solar panels, a battery, a couple of xenon tanks and one ion thruster. It will have a tremendous amount of dV and an atrocious TWR, but the low TWR doesn\u0027t really matter for a mission of this nature. Get it into out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI with a chemical booster heading in the prograde direction. Point prograde and burn until the battery is depleted, cut the thruster and recharge.
