We here at U.S.E.C. are thrilled to introduce you to our operations. Chartered in 2019 under the United Kerbin Space Alliance, we specialize in extraplanetary construction \u0026amp; long-term operations in the most extreme, distant, hostile environments known to kerbal. Here at the start of 2021, we are proud to announce the completion of a major milestone in our Phase 1 program: the Mu Gateway space station.

Paired narrow-band transmitters provide low-power, high-bandwidth communications to download scan data from anywhere in Kerbin orbit, and an included boost stage provides roughly 1,670 meters per second of delta-V, in addition to the vehicle\u0027s onboard fuel supplies of 1,220 meters.

A smaller thruster and smaller onboard tanks provide 770 meters per second of delta-V, in addition to the upper stage it launches on. No boost stage is packaged with the vehicle, which resulted in range limitations of initial launches. Both ComStar 1 and 2 failed to insert into acceptable munar orbits and had to be terminated. ComStar 3, in conjunction with relay antennas aboard the Mu Gateway, services the far side of Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you everyone for visiting\u00A0 our facilities.

Its still the same rocket science\u00A0it was before but the distances are bigger, orbits are higher, and speeds are faster. This is KSP without mercy. Without any modification to stock balance, this scale is approaching Realism Overhaul levels of difficulty, just with less complexity. (3.2x I believe is pretty much 1:1 with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in terms of payload fraction to orbit.) The universe-altering mod combination in use can be brutal at times. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thinned out so severely that aerobraking \u0026amp; capture is a razor\u0027s edge between still ejecting from the gravity well or smacking the ground at supersonic speeds. Eve\u0027s sea-level pressure is a crushing 10 atmospheres that will choke out every single rocket engine available, making a return launch genuinely impossible from all but the highest peaks. \u003Cem\u003ETylo now possesses an atmosphere.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I, not being one to know when to stop, have opted to put not just probes, not just flags, not even just stations around all of these worlds, but bases. I won\u0027t\u00A0pretend some of these outposts won\u0027t be rather small, Pol doesn\u0027t deserve much more than that,\u00A0but they will still be larger \u0026amp; heavier than any reasonable lander. Of course, all these worlds will be mine except Eve. I dare not attempt any landing there. I won\u0027t cast away kerbals to be infinitely stranded on that abysmal purple rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not all doom \u0026amp; gloom. Because of the sheer insanity of manned missions to the outer planets in a rescaled environment, we have some tools to assist us: bigger \u0026amp; better nuclear thermal propulsion, plasma electric engines, fission pulse thrusters, and fusion torch engines to take the cake. When a colony mission to Urlum takes 28 km/s of delta-V, you\u0027ve exceeded the capacity of even plasma electric engines. But the infrastructure needed to fuel these monstrosities is monumental. Six thousand kg of helium-3 isn\u0027t going to mine itself! The engineering, architecture, infrastructure, and flight planning necessary is a step above anything I\u0027ve ever done and you, dear reader, get to come along for the ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you enjoy the in-universe corporate-speak style I went for, because its not going away anytime soon.

In the past week U.S.E.C. has successfully conducted two launches from our complex at Shepard Cape, including a vehicle from our new Very Heavy Launch Platform constructed at pad 17A. Able to support upwards of 800 tons, the pad easily handled the launch of our planned expansion modules for the Mu Gateway, which you may remember. Massing just under 445 tons on the pad, with 367 tons of kerosene fuel \u0026amp; liquid oxygen aboard, this launch vehicle is the largest launch vehicle assembled for U.S.E.C. to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i2V8NoG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/i2V8NoG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarried on the launch is empty tank storage and fuel refining equipment to complete the refueling capabilities of the gateway. These two units will be fitted to the underside of the Industrial Extension Truss. Fitting the Mu Gateway with its refueling capability is an important step to the second major milestone of Phase 1: surface resource operations. In further support of this goal has demanded the development of reusable surface to orbit transport around the moon. Mun gravity is 1.63 m/s/s with approximately 850 m/s horizontal velocity required to maintain stable low orbit. A minimum capacity of 6 crew members was requested in the design requirements handed over to our Spacecraft Design Committee. Allow me to hand it over to SDC for the next few minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb\u003ESpacecraft Engineering\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReusability on spacecraft adds extra considerations, as well as rendezvous and docking with a station that\u2019s considerably above low orbit. We opted to use a side saddle tank configuration in later models in order to shorten the vehicle and reduce tip over. Increased stability allowed several other reductions to save mass, all of which saves fuel. Fuel savings are good for a single trip mission but become exponentially more valuable for repeated trips. The product of all these considerations is the Armstrong Munar Surface Vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EY0tyDxh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022118.11\u0022 height=\u00221024\u0022 width=\u0022867\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EY0tyDxh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis vehicle is able to service surface installations with \u002B/- 20 degrees latitude, making the landing and return to orbit without refueling. For higher latitudes, it is not possible to fly round-trip without a refuel on the internal fuel load of 2,314 m/s delta-V. The thrust/mass ratio is rather low, only producing half a g of acceleration, but is sufficient for the low gravity environment. Less engine power allows finer control over the descent and reduces engine mass on the final vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile effective and reliable, this vehicle lacks amenities like autonomous flight control or communications.

The crew is slated for a two-month rotation and will watch much of the construction efforts of Luna Base from up on high. The only remaining milestones for the gateway station is transport of raw materials \u0026amp; fuel supplies. Gateway will likely not maintain its own transports, but several will be operating around Mun at any given time at the completion of Phase 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ecZc0ZTh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ecZc0ZTh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe would like to thank our partners at Kerbodyne Aerospace. Kerbodyne Aerospace produces many of our launch vehicles on-demand to cater to various mission payloads. U.S.E.C. is planning to develop an in-house line of standardized launch vehicles in the near future, but we are currently dedicating all of our resources towards developing a reliable surface construction system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo today was a little light on actual missions. There\u0027s a couple of reasons for that. One is that designing a surface base \u0026amp; infrastructure that\u0027s meant to last is time-consuming. The other is that I just haven\u0027t had a surplus of time to fly missions. The photo editing on those blueprints took a couple hours. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0Kronal Vessel Viewer is great, but there\u0027s a lot of work to do after snapping a green screen image to process into a nice blueprint.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m planning on getting a more standard launch vehicle put together if I\u0027m to keep showing them. Its more realistic that way. I\u0027m never 100% sure on how to balance things, like realism \u0026amp; gameplay, or technical details \u0026amp; pretty screenshots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-11T23:25:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2021 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
