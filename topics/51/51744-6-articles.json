At what stage do you separate the front section? once in orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry I\u0027ve not added to this thread recently, here\u0027s a little update;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft production has slowed down somewhat. The mad rush to reach for space has calmed down and the focus has turned to more refined designs. One evening while wandering around the RnD centre in the dark Jeb blundered into a load of paint cans, clearly left there from by the builders after completing the RnD centre. He was annoyed at first, but the it hit him; why not paint planes!!! (and so the Kerbpaint mod was added).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one to hit the tarmac was a new streamline jet, inspired by a dream that Jeb had about strange war-like beings and their special high-alt jet used for spying missions (a concept that is totally alien to Kerbals). But it looked just too darn cool Jeb and couldn\u0027t resist the urge to the SR-71.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine design was more complex than normal; to get the stream line design and also the power needed, 4 tanks with jet engines where set around a central girder and then rotated slightly so they overlapped each other. Then a rocket engine was mounted onto the central beam so it sat just inside the 4 jets. Inside the engines is a mess of fuel lines to ensure the fuel drains evenly from each tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SR-71 from Jeb\u0027s dream about was able to fly at very high alts and was very fast, but Jeb knew he could improve on it. His SR-71B was able to fly into orbit;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/tK1DG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

But even with that part count it still handles pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(apart from the paint mod, this SR-71 is pure stock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb\u0027s next idea was to make a plane that could fly right around Kerbin without leaving the atmo, so it only required air-breathing engines. This was much lighter and much faster than the SR-71 and with a much lower part count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb is proud to present the SpearHead (stock \u002B paint);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/qtoPtY1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qtoPtY1h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qtoPtY1h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ptWYBCo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ptWYBCol.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ptWYBCol.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ByjusKo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ByjusKol.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ByjusKol.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fJae44cl.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink to unpainted version\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut flying at high altitude is all well and good, but the higher you go the less scary the high speeds seem. What Jeb was really looking for was a white knuckle ride; something that was super fast at sea level and very maneuverable. The DeadBolt (also stock \u002B paint) hits around 210ms at sea level and at those speeds it can weave between the buildings at KSC or thread between jagged mountain passes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/jFBuJ6Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jFBuJ6Yh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jFBuJ6Yh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/keY0jU9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/keY0jU9h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022keY0jU9h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/846SXWh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/846SXWhl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022846SXWhl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/yGm1GtZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yGm1GtZl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yGm1GtZl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebs dream with the DeadBolt is to be able to fly it under the small bridge in the RnD complex.

After escaping the Mun, he ran out of fuel and was stuck in a Kerban orbit. Pe=4Mm Ap=12Mm At the Pe, he had to EVA and push the craft retrograde with his to avoid a re-encounter with the mun, then sat and waited for rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe also cursed the engineers when he realized in the rush to get the project moving, the engineers forgot to install solar panels and parachutes on his lander. Carrying a huge resentment, he sat in his high orbit and waited....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, a probe docked with the lander, carrying a few drops of fuel, a few solar panels, and 6 parachutes that were obviously thrown on at the last minute, and he was able to burn to lower his Pe to the atmosphere. The parachutes deployed and luckily did not decouple the docking port when the craft decelerated at 6G\u0027s He\u0027s now safe at home and refuses to talk to the engineering team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb took a walk over to the management offices with a thick red marker. After stomping around the halls, refusing to talk to anyone or show his security credentials, he found what he was looking for: A cork board with a big blue title posted at the top which proudly proclaimed \u0022Goals and Milestones\u0022. Scanning the many post-it notes and memos, one suck out to him that was titled \u0027kerbal mun mission\u0027. Taking out his marker, he wrote in huge red permanent ink at the bottom of the page \u0022AND RETURN HIM TO KERBAN\u0022. Capping the marker, he realized he still wasn\u0027t smiling. Something was still missing. After careful thought, he uncapped the marker again and started writing on the cork board itself. He drew a large, rocket shaped oval on the board. Then he added two circles on each side of the bottom of the rocket. He added a finishing touch by adding what looked like small debris coming out of the top of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb was now smiling and ready for the next mission. Management got the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be putting pics up of the \u0022Galliper\u0022 Aptly named due to it\u0027s tendancy to occilate up to 15-degrees in yaw and roll during it\u0027s accent above 10km, but remain under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, re-entry landing is very, very hard, and has yet to happen. All re-entries end up with an abort and cockpit landing with chutes.
