This is a thread where I discuss the progress of two different quick saves a.k.a. \u0022Universes\u0022 in a 0.90 career save. There are two to start off, but we can split one into two if you suggest it, and if I have the amount of funds, in game rep, and Science if I pool both Universe\u0027s supplies. Last but not least, you decide what mission I \\*try\\* to do in a cirtan universe, just say the mission, and say what Universe you want it in, and I think the price for a new Universe right now should be 300 science, 200,000 funds, and 150 rep.
