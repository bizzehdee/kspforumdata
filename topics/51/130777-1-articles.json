massive (and still growing) space station around Ike, due to various inscrutable contracts.\u00A0 There was a manned mission to Ike, and three successive rescue missions have gotten them at least to high orbit though not quite to the station yet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCurrently probes are being launched to all remaining major objects in the system.\u00A0 We should get getting good

has a *huge* amount of fuel for some reason.\u00A0 Are they planning to sneakily take off to Laythe at some point, ALA 2010?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJeb was calmly hanging out in a \u0022stable\u0022 parking orbit near Duna (though out of fuel) until he got too close to Ike and got ejected into interplanetary space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re sort

the Ike space station addition lacked sufficient deltaV, trying to use the lander to enter orbit ended up blowing all the RCS and solar panels off, and the ship finally ended up in an orbit inclined 90 degrees to Duna.\u00A0 So we\u0027re going to mark that as a \u0022partial success\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime we went to a Canadian LOTR cosplay convention and hired Kerbalnauts Merrey and Luny.\u00A0 Their only goal was to get some \u0022quick\u0022 funds/science by planting a flag on the Mun.\u00A0 They ended up landing sideways on a crater rim and rolling a very long way to the bottom (but from the looks on their faces they were having a great time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Jool probes were more successful, now have a small probe in orbit of all the smaller moons in the Joolvian system.\u00A0 We forgot to include batteries on them though so trying to return science is a very slow process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile waiting for the Eelo and Dres probes to get anywhere we\u0027ve designed a Duna super-booster with excessive delta-V and we\u0027ve sent Merrey out to see if he can clean up the giant mess on Ike, though I

unwisely took a turn at 20m/s which didn\u0027t end well.\u00A0 However when loading the quicksave all four tires exploded and shot the rover in the air.\u00A0 Some quick thinking and we activated the rocket and then flew most of the way to the base under rocket power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the base we dropped off engineer Madchell to help with drilling, then topped off on fuel to see if we could somehow figure out how to get the base and expansion joined up (they are 1.6km apart).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGhost Daphty was a little too eager trying to dock with the original base and knocked it over.\u00A0 *sigh*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough in the end that might have worked well.\u00A0 We attached the rover to the original base, and with a little rocket power managed to push it 1.6km across the surface and dock it with the expansion.\u00A0 Contract Complete!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a bit jealous of everyone who posts their awesome looking

eventually. \u00A0The various bits always shift slightly relative to each other every time you go back to a base or go in and out of warp while focused on it, not to mention from Kerbals walking into them, docking things to them, etc. \u00A0All this\u00A0results\u00A0in an accumulation of forces in the\u00A0joints, like grasshopper legs tensing\u00A0to spring. \u00A0This is accompanied by more or less clipping of base parts into each other and/or the ground, which puts more pressure on the connections and the ground contact. \u00A0At some point, this\u00A0built-up Kraken energy exceeds some limit and spectacular destruction results. \u00A0Various parts suddenly explode, the rest of the base leaps off the ground, and usually several components come loose and go flying off over the horizon. \u00A0So pretty bases are ephemeral \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022
