It was a horror movie/ drama / epic / i don\u0027t know. You would imagined pretty scary things, almost crashing, and I accidentally launched kerbals into intakes. The mission starts off like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, Val, Bill, and Bob drive to a plane in this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S70Twjm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S70Twjm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe board the airliner (There was seats so Bill and Bob sat right behind Jeb and Val!) and they take off in the Boeing 787\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xqEtrQN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xqEtrQN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see here where they would be sucked in...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAYS, they take off. Bob had the perfect expression for what happened next. The plane started rolling, and the pilots could not control it! One of the crew members leaned against the door to see what happened. When then he fell out! Another fell out, trying to see where he was, and HE got sucked into the intake! He fell out shredded to pieces (yes he somehow survived). The passenger roof door BURST open and passengers started falling out. Even Jeb and Val were scared. The two pilots checked out what was going on and got sucked out too. One got stuck in the intake until I reverted the whole thing. One passenger that got sucked out hit the tail and died! Mean while the plane starts diving towards the ocean only to fid that it lifts out that it lifts up again, preparing to spin off into space. Then engine problems occur and they explode ( Whak a Kerbal) the plane burst into a radical roll then the main cabin explodes! And that\u0027s the mission. It really is a trailer, but it could be a movie with scenes inbetween.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final product!\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/TT0FK_6uD_8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/TT0FK_6uD_8\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
