Yeah, I know, everyone has a moon base. I wanted mine to be modular, so I came up with a way of being able to dock hab module together on the surface. Here\u0027s my base so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y9p8mdh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y9p8mdh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve no doubt noticed that thing on its end. It\u0027s a module transporter, Mark I version. It has had a hard life. It\u0027s amazing how easy it is to flip things over on the Mun. It was wrecked even before it was flipped in a bizarre refuel experiment gone wrong. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have any photos, but it was very strange. I had used KAS hoses to connect two ships in an attempt to refuel one of them. I had a lot of trouble getting a connector to place on one, but once it had connected, I concentrated on trying to get fuel to flow between them. I happened to move my point of view to where the rover was, and I saw it was cartwheeling in extreme show motion over the surface of the Mun. The winches were mounted on the end of the lift platforms on some small girders and they were slowly being bent into pretzels while the winches twisted on the ends of the hoses. I was eventually able to disconnect the thing before anything worse happened, but the damage had been done. I built another transporter and sent it to the Mun. When this one accidentally flipped on its end, it was just left that way until I could find a way to remove it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeside it is my crane, made with Infernal Robotics and KAS parts. I did try to right the transporter with the crane, but it\u0027s too heavy. The crane has its own problems. The next one I send will have a full fuel tank mounted on one side of the turntable as a counterweight. You would think at 1/6 gravity, weight wouldn\u0027t be a big concern, but the crane is also that much lighter, so it likes to tip over. This operation is \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps some other time I\u0027ll relate what befell the first transporter to be delivered (which is now in several pieces beside a crater about 4 km north of the base) or the first exploration rover which is dead in the water several kilometers to the east. Let\u0027s just say that things have been going better lately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s a little album showing how I built my base. Maybe someone will benefit from my experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/UCzNk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question throughout the exercise has always been: what are we going to use it for? I\u0027m tempted to get the Kethane mod so that planetary bases would have a purpose. Perhaps resources will be added to the game sometime and then our bases of operation will have more of a function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJK\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-26T02:31:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2013 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by JayKay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazlem","CreatedById":57206,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T14:41:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure everybody has a Mun base, but it\u0027s fun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T14:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat is soooo cool!

My way of thinking of this was that putting wheels under everything would be pretty unrealistic and a big weight penalty, so a real space program would not go that route. It was a matter of finding something fairly efficient and logical, and a transporter to move the modules seemed like the way to go. I have mixed feelings about adding a lot of mods to the game, but in terms of Infernal Robotics, those parts are something I think is really missing in stock parts, so I don\u0027t feel too bad about using that add-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, that docking port on the transporter has a bit of a story behind it. I wanted to be able to raise the legs on single modules without needing to add power and control to each of them. At first I thought I would just add a port on an arm similar to the one on the pictured transporter. I moved under a module and then docked with it; I then had control of its legs, and thought, no problem, I just have to raise them. Unfortunately, the module proceeded to drop through the deck of the transporter like it wasn\u0027t there--it just was hanging on a terribly over-stressed docking arm which was bending at a 45 degree angle. When you dock with something, you can no longer collide with it, so the transporter became physically invisible to the module. So much for that idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo plan B was to make a portable control unit sandwiched between two docking ports. Using it turned out to be disastrous, because in the moment when the transporter, the portable unit and the base modules are connected, some bizarre bugs are exposed. I found my moonbase catapulting itself off the surface of the Mun, whipping the hapless transporter around by the aforementioned docking arm. I figured it didn\u0027t like control modules mounted in different planes connected to the same object, and tried to bend them all into the same plane. Fortunately, I did a quicksave before doing the docking, or it would have been start-over for the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it turned out that the transporter could pick up the whole ship easily, so I just used the ship\u0027s control of the legs to raise them before it took off again. It\u0027s pretty much a routine task now. I\u0027m thinking about stacking some of the modules 2 high to make things more interesting, and that\u0027s what the crane is mainly for. It just needs some redesign to make it less tippy, and there will be some 2-storey modules in my base. Some kind of communication gear on top of the tower would be a good addition, too, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWork continues...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJK\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
