I couldn\u0027t quite see why the torque problems, but maybe that\u0027s just my eyes not focusing so early this morning.\n\nWell, KERBAL ENGINEER REDUX never mentioned an off-balance when I constructed the craft, but when using the Duna-system-mobility egines, after an initial wobble they would induce a hefty torque and send the craft on a ca. 10 second rotation spin. This happened with SAS on, as without it. With RCS on, as without it. With a Reaction wheel running, as without it. To counter this I only used the engines in intervals, when the attitude of the craft was near my maneuver node marker. Later (with only ca 2-3 tanks) everything would behave nicely and balanced again."}]}
