Capable of transporting 6 kerbals to High-Kerbin Orbit, each Titanium launch was estimated to cost 82k funds, 71k of which were anticipated to be recovered. Or, roughly 86% recovery value.

This included the drive section, Potassium 3, an adapter to mount the K-3 to the Si-8/9, a probe for testing jet engines at Laythe, and one more commsat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Potassium 3 was first up. This launch was exactly like the previous K-2 launch, a giant building-sized object being lofted into orbit atop another even larger building-sized object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0007_k3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0007_k3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0013_k3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0013_k3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce there it met up with the two orbiting fuel tanks that would serve as its payload to Jool. As somebody had forgotten to install a large-to-standard docking adapter on any other pieces of payload, the K-3 instead had to provisionally dock to the payload using the read docking port of its own orbital stage. That was an operation that apparently happened in the dark, as is only right and proper, and thus transpired without and cameras capturing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo next up was Silicon 10, a launch that carried an adapter to allow the K-3 to properly dock with the two fuel tanks. Also included was a new engineering probe for Laythe to test the Juno jet engine (as previously mentioned) that would become the Calcium 7. The intent behind this probe was for it to enter Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, spool up the jet engines once safely through the muck, then discard the heat shield and its lower stage in favor of flying around using the probe\u0027s two Juno jet pods. This will undoubtedly fail for reasons I haven\u0027t anticipated, but that\u0027s half the fun, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso on this launch was another communications satellite for Jool. This was included more because the tug itself will need to be able to communicate with the network so it can perform any course corrections while still out in the void. (The lack of long-range communications on these tugs will need to be addressed in a future design.) This commsat will become the Scandium 3 once deployed, and will likely enter into a very high polar orbit of Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this was launched atop an LV-07, a bit of overkill for the launch but the only real option as the LV-06 (and the revised version of it the LV-06A) have increasingly proven unreliable. Even this flight had a small issue, as the upper stage tumbled end over end twice after the burn reaching its desired apoapsis. The confetti fairing deploy was thus a bit... different.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0015_si10.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0015_si10.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was yet another launch where the docking occurred in the dark.

Dock the big end of this Silicon 10 to the tug, move the payload of the Si-10 (Ca-7/Sc-3) to the opposite end to dock at one of the standard-sized ports on the fuel tankers, then undock the K-3, spin it around to dock up with the payload, and then discard its orbital stage.

Originally intended to be launched over 6 Silicon flights, the crews designing the refuel payload quickly realized they could save money by launching two tanks worth of fuel in one launch. This was pushing the limits of the LV-08 Fortissimo, but a few Solid Rocket Boosters would solve that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Solid rocket boosters? Huh? I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve used anything beyond simple kick SRBs since the very beginning of this playthrough.) Yes, solid rocket boosters were a newly discovered \u0022thing.\u0022 The crew that is presently on the M\u00FCn sent down some science data, those most magic of science points, which Wernher and the R\u0026amp;D interns used to develop a new, longer version of the old barrel of fleas. A regular old flea thumper, you might say. They conducted a few test firings and test launches and then declared the booster ready for use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0038_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0038_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the Fortissimo was outfitted with a collection of SRBs strapped on the end of the core stage\u0027s fins... because wings obviously look lke hardpoints and a better place to mount such things. This\u00A0gave it just enough oomph to push the 808.3 tonne Silicon 11 \u0022Potassium Refueler\u0022 off of the pad. Operating at the very limits of the LV-08 system, the Silicon 11 just barely made it above the thicker parts of the atmosphere before the boost stage burned out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that it was a struggle to get the craft out of the atmosphere, and the kOS script had to be abandoned mid-launch. Had it been allowed to continue the apoapsis of the combined craft would\u0027ve still been inside the atmosphere when the fourth stage burned out, and it was highly unlikely the Si-11 would make it out of the atmosphere on its own. Future launches will require a slightly different, perhaps slightly less efficient, launch profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0053_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0053_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0060_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0060_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet it still made orbit. This first refueler was meant for the most important item in the Jool expedition - the LDAV and crew compartments. And so it rendezvoused with the Potassium 1 after less than half an orbit. Yes, once again in the dark. This time, due to the difficulty expected with the operation, the actual docking was held off until both craft were in the sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0069_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022608\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0069_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0075_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022599\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0075_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet another docking viewed from the maw of the craft. Thankfully the K-1\u0027s orbital stage (Chlorine 4) was still attached, otherwise this docking would\u0027ve felt a bit like running a camera up the wrong end of a spacecraft. It still felt like that. It\u0027s a bit unnerving to docking a craft to the engine-end of a spacecraft, especially when those engines are four large Mainsails. One slight outgassing and the show\u0027s over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, after what seemed like an eternity the docking was over, the cameras turned off and the fuel started flowing. There was one last piece of business to attend to before the K-1 stack was ready to head to Jool, aside form sending the crew up obviously. When originally docked, the LDAV and the crew hab were docked facing the K-1, which is backwards. A quick redocking was performed once the K-1 had been refueled to properly orient the two.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe refueler and the K-1\u0027s orbital stage both undocked and pulled away from the mass. The Silicon 11 was then redesignated as the Chlorine 9, and is expected to serve for many years bringing fuel down-well from the not yet conceived mining and refining operations that might one day be built at Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0078_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022441\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0078_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160513_ksp0085_si11.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160513_ksp0085_si11.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe K-1 stack is all but ready, with a final on-orbit mass of 250.6 tonnes. (If you do the math to see how long it will take to complete the transfer burn to Jool using 8 LV-Ns, you\u0027ll probably cringe a bit. Yes, I intend to split the burn up over several passes.) The crew will perform a few alignment redockings to get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E anchors/tie-downs lined up, after which one of them will attach struts. they will then perform a quick full-throttle burn test after which the K-1/Silicon-6 will be declared fit for duty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ve still got two more Potassiums to refuel first, so the stitching together\u00A0won\u0027t be until the next update at the earliest.
