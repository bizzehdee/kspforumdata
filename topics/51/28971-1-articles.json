I\u0027m going with Newming, Geofkin, and Bill.

I\u0027ve been looking for it for several minutes, and none of the others have come up here so where is it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w9JFKnK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w9JFKnK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEntry Three:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAww, yea! We landed on the Mun! Unfortunantily, the decouplers fired early, and the rockets attached to them took out our solar panels. It sucks that we will have to live without exterior lighting, but our internal generators should power everything else. Some of the engineers claim sabatoge, but who would sabatoge such a momentus event for all of Kerbalkind?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L5YU2TD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L5YU2TD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEntry Four:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI planted the flag on the Mun!

For unknown reasons, all of the soil around here actually absorbs all non-solar light. None of our EVA helmets illuminates the terrain!

They\u0027ve sent us a rover to check out the place. It finally arrived. Thank goodness, with all of the wierd stuff happening lately. I am scared to death of The Silhouette. Anyway, Newming and Geofkin went out to investigate a rock about 2.5km away, it turned out to be unrelated to the Dark Soil. Trying to keep up a lively mood, they played around a bit with the rover as they returned home.

Bob had gone completely insane from the events. Bob and Newman are the only original Kerbals to survive. All surviving Kerbals from this base have gone totally insane, or suffer from acute amnesia, or PTSD that blocks their memories. Thus this journal is our only means of learning what happened there due to antenna failure during the night of Entry Fifeteen. Mission Control has forbid any landings anywhere 200km from that site.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dictator Dan","CreatedById":62863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T08:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it!
