I\u0027ve often wondered about a COMPLETELY preposterous scene from the television comedy show; \u0022Futurama\u0022 In which Mars is sent on a collision course with the sun. However, quite nicely, it passes close enough to Earth for the doomed citizen of mars to simply jump, do a flip and land unharmed on the streets of New York,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Mars passes within meters of the street and shears the New York Skyline, our heros reach out for each other and wind up haveing thier arms ripped off. How dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sheer absurdity of this scene gave me an idea; and so the mission was started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur Kerbals for the MArs side of this mission, Bill And Jeb, purposely were stranded on mars by Kouston. Bill, as normal, lost control of his bowels immediately but Jeb seemed quite content. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then, back on Kerbin, using the power of WITCHCRAFT (hyperedit) the planetary alignment for Duna and Kerbin were aligned precisely; and so the clock was set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnbeknownst to Bill And Jeb, who were quite out of the loop because no radio or long range communications were sent with them, Mars was now hurtling uncontrolled towards the earth; But, unlike the scene from Jebs favorite show, the little blue speck growing in the sky was ultimately, going to be nothing like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the earth was still quite far out, the moment Duna entered it\u0027s sphere of influence Kerbins gravity instantly took over, Bill and Job and everything else on mars were ripped into the sky violently, objects on the other side of the planet were obliterated and debris spread wide, wide arcs as it launched uncontrolled into space. Total mission failure, completely planetary devastation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, that\u0027s where Bill And Jeb and every other mission currently on mars wound up, screaming through the void on a oneway trip back to Kerbin at 4000 Ms, eventually they hit atmo and made a beautiful fireworks display, but not as beautiful as the giant red planet swallowing up Kerbins sky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, Kerbin and Duna became Kerbuna, the KSP Program divided by zero and then CTD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s1.bild.me/bilder/260513/6126588screenshot3.png\u0022 alt=\u00226126588screenshot3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(More comeing right now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMARS.
