I tested it out on Uniform 3 after unlocking it with the science from my Mun mission. It must be attached directly to the pod it will work with and it will extend life support by recycling consumables (ie water, oxygen). When it is operating it consumes an extra 3.3em/min but it also reduces the life support being consumed by the pod by 80%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example my Mk1-2 pod consumes 18 life support per hour for each kerbal (it also consumes 12.5 em/min to operate the life support, regardless of the number of kerbals). With the 1300 life support on board it can support 3 kerbals for about 24 hours. 3 kerbals x 18/hour x 24 hours = 1296. If you reduce the number of kerbals in the pod you extend life support, a single kerbal could survive for 3 days but that\u0027s not really long enough for a practical Minmus mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe recycler reduces the consumption rate by 80% when it is turn on.

I\u0027ve already tested the new sensor nose cone in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and I\u0027ve unlocked bigger and better heatshields for high velocity reentry along with an improved probe core. This one reduces power usage down to 2em/min (which turned out to be very helpful in the circumstances I encountered in this mission) but it also includes it\u0027s own SAS processor which was important in being able to design the Apple lander the way I did. Apple 1 (and an expected Apple 2) both use the same design and are intended to perform exploration of Eve/Duna\u0027s atmosphere and surface. Since it\u0027s one design fits all some of the systems may be a bit redundent - Duna may have worked with a smaller heatshield and different layout, while Eve would have definitely worked with fewer parachutes and had no need for the shock absorbing legs. The whole thing will be carried into orbit by the standard 30 ton lifter which performs perfectly on its first real mission (the 60 ton lifter seemed to have some issues its first true mission in Zulu 1). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J23H8cx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J23H8cx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vVVKy9n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vVVKy9n.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pZLSym5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pZLSym5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is currently a very bad time for a transfer to Duna but an Eve transfer is viable though not ideal. After seperating from the booster the probes interplanetary transit module tales over for the injection burn. It has the engine, fuel and solar power that will be needed for the trip to Eve. Orientation and control is left to the lander itself. A plus of this probe being designed for both Eve and Duna is that it carries enough solar power to work at Duna\u0027s orbit. That is critical for this non-optimal transfer to Eve which will take us farther then Kerbin\u0027s orbit in order to swing around hard and catch Eve without spending massive amounts of delta-v to take the shortcut below Moho\u0027s orbit or attempt to plan and time a multiple orbit transit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZAqOxJq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZAqOxJq.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2vJRYqn.png\u0022 alt=\u00222vJRYqn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the PE point above the Sun (far left) the probe is nudged with the RCS thrusters to drop the expected Eve PE down to about 150 km, ready to be finalized once we enter Eve\u0027s SOI. I\u0027ve always thought that Eve was the best looking of the planets. Unfortunately I won\u0027t get to see as much because my course will take me into the night side (some screenshots may be too dark and require some brightness enhancement which will wash out details).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4x6qm75.png\u0022 alt=\u00224x6qm75.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8VayPuT.png\u0022 alt=\u00228VayPuT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ks52tZs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ks52tZs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I descend below 175 km and prepare to enter the upper atmosphere I begin burning all the remaining fuel I have to help slow down before the face melting aerobraking starts. I\u0027m not burning directly retro-grade, instead I\u0027m adjusting slightly upward and switching back and forth with map view to maintain my projected PE while reducing my overall surface speed. Orbital speed is reduced by about 300 m/s but that doesn\u0027t take into account the fact that I was accelerating at the time, so I probably managed to shave off closer to 500 m/s or about 10% of my velocity. The transit module is ejected and the lander aligns for aerobraking. While I have weight balanced the lander I choose to use active stabilization (RCS \u0026amp; SAS with manual input) given the speeds and temperatures involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9g66lus.png\u0022 alt=\u00229g66lus.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VxYzK2q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VxYzK2q.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nSXz54N.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nSXz54N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the probe hits the heavy atmosphere the extra large heatshield warms up to a maximum of 1522 C. I\u0027m actively maintaining stabilization to make sure everything stays neatly tucked behind it. Several design choices where made to minimize the vertical height of the probe to keep it well within the cone of the heatshield (the built in SAS helped with this). Things don\u0027t go entirely according to plan. While the probe avoids breaking up it also doesn\u0027t bleed off enough speed to maintain the descent. The probe begins rising again with a projected orbit of 2000 km and requiring about 90 minutes before it will come back around for another pass. That will put a strain on the batteries since I calculated how much would be needed to transmit and then added time for descent. A quick recalculation shows that with a conservative estimation of how long it will take to land the batteries should have about 30 minutes of power to spare after all the readings are transmitted. In the meantime the probe is in the upper atmosphere so readings are taken with the sensor nose cone, 2Hot and PresMat and immediately transmitted (the smaller instruments are transmitted using the 2nd dish). The probe has 2 communications dishes, not just for weight balance but because during a single descent it would have allowed the lower atmosphere nose cone readings to begin transmitting while the high atmosphere ones where still going out on the the first band. The good news is that Eve\u0027s atmosphere has a 6x multiplier so I\u0027m getting some good science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PPrDeL4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PPrDeL4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bpf27KX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bpf27KX.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cTc11Q5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cTc11Q5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next pass isn\u0027t as hard as the first, the heatshield only briefly goes up to 1200 C. The lander slows down to 350 m/s at 25 km. Looking ahead in the twilight I can see a large lake ahead and I don\u0027t want to land there since I can\u0027t use my best surface instrument, the Double-C, on the water. With my velocity low enough I decide to deploy the parachutes now (they won\u0027t fully deploy until 500m) to slow my horizontal speed and keep me over land. Deploying the parachutes involves the heavy heatshield being discarded. I\u0027ve used a seperator for this instead of a decoupler because of the vertical size advantage (a decoupler would make the probe 50% taller, raising the center of mass and putting critical components that much closer to edge of the heatshields protective zone). The number of parachutes is overboard for Eve but is estimated to be barely enough for Duna. That\u0027s why there are also landing legs that deploy to help absorb the shock instead of taking the hit on the batteries (far fewer parachutes are needed to slow down to 9.5 m/s for the legs then are needed to slow down to 5.5 m/s for the batteries). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2fECWhO.png\u0022 alt=\u00222fECWhO.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5LyjSD1.png\u0022 alt=\u00225LyjSD1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e6CI14Z.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022e6CI14Z.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafely descending to the surface the lander transmits data on the lower atmosphere. The legs are descended for a soft landing (under 4 m/s on Eve) and then the ground sensors take over. Eve has a 15x surface multiplier, so my best instrument the Double-C collects 1500 science alone. With everything transmitted the lander has 288 of an original 6400 em left after which it will die since the solar panels where discarded and burned up on entry. In total the probe has transmitted 3108 science which combined with my existing store gives 4035 (enough to unlock 2 items plus Miniaturization if I wanted it). For now I\u0027m going to leave it unspent at least until I complete the Duna mission. Then I\u0027ll decide how to move forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i1ZXvcA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i1ZXvcA.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w5PSehH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w5PSehH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nBZOlQG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nBZOlQG.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZYGyaR8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZYGyaR8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T01:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EApple 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the same design but going to Duna this time. I\u0027ve waited 60 days from the end of the last mission to line up a good transfer window to Duna. It\u0027s not the best transfer burn but it works. Half way to Duna a course correction brings the PE to under 500 km. Arriving in Duna\u0027s SOI another burn is made to lower that to 60 km in preparation for a powered capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J32UBeT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J32UBeT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kkQxK4R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kkQxK4R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t be aerobraking. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so low and thin I\u0027d need to come in really close to slow down enough and I don\u0027t see the need to test how well that works with deadly reentry when it isn\u0027t too expensive to just capture like any other planet or moon without an atmosphere. After capturing I almost immediately begin burning to lower my new orbits PE for a landing (10km). The reason for this is that in low Duna orbit I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be making a net gain on electricity - each time the probe passes behind Duna it will lose charge and it won\u0027t receive enough excess charge during the daylight period to recover. Since I braked on the dark side my intention is to land as soon as possible on the light side rather then risk reducing my battery stores below the amount required to complete the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gM1ma6A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gM1ma6A.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dgaNzVP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dgaNzVP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy velocity in orbit is less then 900 m/s so it\u0027s not a big surprise that there was very little heating on entry. Upper atmosphere transmissions start after I\u0027ve passed 40 km and are finished before there is any real drag. It appears the Duna atmosphere has a multiplier of 4x which is not the same as Eve, dispelling my theory that the inner planets would have the same multipliers and confirming that there is no relationship between orbit/atmosphere/surface multipliers other then the fact they go up the further you go down (with the exception of Kerbin itself). My main concern is how fast I\u0027ll be going when I reach the surface, so one thing I do is try to bleed off as much of my remaining monopropellent as possible by making an upward lateral burn which both depletes the fuel and slows the drop of my PE even as I lose altitude (essentially flattening out my approach so I\u0027ll travel through as much air as possible before landing). As the sun comes up I\u0027m entering the lower atmosphere at 10 km, still traveling at almost 800 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BiyTQC6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BiyTQC6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AUtVUN9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AUtVUN9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RulYykT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RulYykT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 6 km the ground is getting close enough to see ground scatter (very little of Duna is actually at sea level, the rest is mostly at 2-4km). I\u0027m still transmitting lower atmosphere data and moving at 550 m/s but I need to slow down now and the atmosphere has done most of what it\u0027s going to do. With the parachutes semi-deployed and landing gear deployed my speed drops to 330 m/s and I see if I can slow it down further with RCS thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0GtxlMZ.gif\u0022 alt=\u00220GtxlMZ.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Ffft8N.png\u0022 alt=\u00222Ffft8N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachutes fully deploy 19 seconds later underscoring how close I was to the surface. I heard a bad sound when they deployed but a check revealed nothing was broken on the lander (I thought one of the cords might have ripped). The violent stop has brought it down to 15 m/s almost instantly and that settles down to 11 m/s as it settles into a soft vertical descent. I apply some RCS at the last moment to help cushion the landing as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VcxWxOu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VcxWxOu.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xHOiymE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xHOiymE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing damages 2 of the legs but that\u0027s ok, absorbing shock is what they where there for.

The 4 working legs are retracted so it can be buried by the sand. The probe has transmitted 1948 science. At this point I thinking about what priority I should place on manned flight vs. probes. Based on the larger then expected but uneven returns it might be better to put off manned flight until I can explore further with one way missions. I\u0027m right at a good transfer window for Eve so I will be designing and launching a probe to Gilly next. I\u0027ll have to see how much science I get from that mission and crunch some numbers for what a manned Duna or Gilly mission would bring (with the Science Jr being a big unknown) before I decide.

With fuel lines it can carry a pair of drop tanks to extend range without adding stages. This probe does have a new feature, a reaction wheel. It\u0027s not a lot but it will let me orient the probe for solar collection / fine course adjustments without throwing off my course with RCS thrusters, something that\u0027s become a bit of a bother while transiting to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KXmsq1t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KXmsq1t.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cnu7AMz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cnu7AMz.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4OgdYSC.png\u0022 alt=\u00224OgdYSC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at Eve I\u0027m not going to do an aerocapture. Instead I\u0027ll be braking with thrust and coming into an orbit with an AP close to the path of Gilly (this costs about 1240 m/s from my current transfer angle). Of course Gilly\u0027s orbit is heavily inclined and elliptical so I won\u0027t be able to do anything precise from an interplanetary transfer. I do make a mistake with my capture (which I\u0027ve done before, see Dust 1 from my .23 career), I come into a retograde orbit of Eve after braking on the wrong side of Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1wSOtrc.png\u0022 alt=\u00221wSOtrc.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G5ayjIP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G5ayjIP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reach Gilly I first correct my inclination - I\u0027ll need to set it to 180 degrees since I\u0027m actually orbiting in the opposite direction of Gilly. Next I need to wait for a couple of orbits of Eve for an encounter opportunity. It\u0027s only a 4 minute encounter but that will be enough. These two burns have cost about 160 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uOjbZZ7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uOjbZZ7.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JkZp77k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JkZp77k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I reach my encounter with Gilly I apply the same principle as docking. I want to match Gilly\u0027s orbit so I turn around and point at the retro-grade indicator (with Gilly as my \u0027target\u0027) and just burn. My orbit around Eve begins to change, reversing and morphing into a copy of Gilly\u0027s orbit without any additional input. When I stop I have a nearly exact copy of Gilly\u0027s orbit and from here I now have plenty of time to burn at the new PE with Gilly to easily capture. This has cost about 550 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3mo7EOD.png\u0022 alt=\u00223mo7EOD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2XqxWlE.gif\u0022 alt=\u00222XqxWlE.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h1ePB5e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h1ePB5e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom high orbit things are not promising. Gilly only seems to have a 2x multiplier much like Ike. I was hoping it was a bit more since I think that even experienced players will have a slightly harder time reaching Gilly then they would Ike. In my opinion less experienced players would have a lot harder time reaching Gilly because of the orbit and then the low gravity making the landing a completely new experience. From a science perspective Gilly would also seem more important - Ike is much like the Mun but Gilly is a captured asteroid so it\u0027s development and composition would be different especially at the surface (heavy elements wouldn\u0027t have sunk to the center). I lower one part of my orbit to 5700m, enough to reach low orbit (but also a bit dangerous because Gilly is the only body where you can hit a mountain in high orbit). Things go really slow from this point because as soon as I get under 8km (close to where some of those mountains are) I am reduced to 1x time warp. It\u0027s very slow going to reach low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9oA2LZu.png\u0022 alt=\u00229oA2LZu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn low orbit mapping data and other readings are collected and transmitted. My plan was to wait and recharge but at this point I really don\u0027t want to wait through a whole orbit so I start moving toward the surface with 1700em in my batteries (I\u0027ll need about 1900 for operation and transmission). My worst case plan is I\u0027ll land on the surface, store data and then take off into orbit to recharge and transmit. Upon landing I\u0027m still getting power so I settle in to recharge enough for the Double-C to transmit. Unfortunately the surface of Gilly is only worth 3x just like Ike. I don\u0027t think there will be much reason to make a return (ie manned mission) to the Eve/Gilly system given the cost/return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Itr2uRc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Itr2uRc.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zxusfc1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zxusfc1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m waiting the sun comes up and I transmit. At the moment the only thing preventing the probe from basically launching off Gilly thanks to the incline is a small amount of RCS correction. Rather then keep using that until the probe runs out and falls down the hill I launch it back into space on an escape from Gilly (I want to get it moving fast so I don\u0027t have to sit around long). Once outside Gilly\u0027s SOI I make a small normal and then a pro-grade burn to alter it\u0027s orbit so that it hopefully won\u0027t come into an accidental encounter with Gilly. I turn the probe around to what I believe will be an optimal position to hopefully collect sunlight year round. Since the probe still has a good amount of fuel left I\u0027m leaving it in Eve orbit ready for future use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VlfPBeV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VlfPBeV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eIbBQXo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eIbBQXo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission brought in just under 800 science, not enough to unlock Meta-Materials but I still have the surface of Moho to visit (in the worst case scenario Moho will still provide enough to get me to 1800 science).

If I had to I could skip this mission and instead return to Minmus or the Mun for more soil samples but I want the data from Moho (which will almost certainly be much more then one of those missions) and I want to know Moho\u0027s multipliers since it could be a target for a manned mission. In stock play Moho isn\u0027t such a great manned target because of the delta-v required (in fact I\u0027ve never sent a manned mission there before), but here it might become a more viable target due to the short travel time (less life support required), distance to the sun (cheap solar power) and potentially high science reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe weighs in at 53 tons so it will be going on the 60t launcher. The specs tell me I need 4600 m/s to reach Moho, my own margins told me to use 5300 m/s and the rocket has almost 5800 m/s (all of these are in addition to the landing stage). While some initial napkin estimates suggest I can reach Dres and even Eeloo with the 60t launcher, for Jool\u0027s moons I will either need to figure out an aerobraking stategy or build a heavy (120t) launcher. This mission to Moho is testing one system I intend to use in exploring the outer planets which is a seperate battery operated landing stage. The probe will enter orbit and performs science (in which at least 6000em battery capacity is required to transmit from the mapping instrument) and then uses a power generator on the transit stage to recharge. From there the transit stage, along with its power generator, extended battery system and the mapping sensor are discarded. The lander itself should only need about 2000em from batteries to descend and transmit from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster doesn\u0027t give me any issues this time. I\u0027m not using the big cargo tie downs in part because the cargo isn\u0027t very big. Launching into orbit I belatedly decided to go to 100 km instead of 75 or 80 km (I was coasting toward the AP so I just burned to raise it a bit before the circulization burn) which became a very fortunate descision when my long injection burn required me to basically burn toward the ground, taking me down to 75 km before my course started peeling away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LezGafp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LezGafp.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4917UL9.png\u0022 alt=\u00224917UL9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0K0GtM5.png\u0022 alt=\u00220K0GtM5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter burning 2700 m/s for injection I\u0027ll need 250 m/s for correction (when planning I never actually had an encounter, just close enough that I felt I could correct). Preparing for the correction burn I get rid of the extra fuel tanks which should have been ejected during the first burn; that will have cost me some delta-v. As I get close to Moho I mde another 30 m/s in corrections to lower my PE to 40 km. With the angle I\u0027m coming in it will cost me to capture, I\u0027m not 100% sure I\u0027ll have enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gk9YpAX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gk9YpAX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Moho it will cost 2500 m/s to capture into low orbit, I\u0027m not entirely sure I have that much. I start burning anyway and once I enter low orbit I start transmitting from all the small instruments. With the solar panels recieving lots of power and the engine alternator running at full the batteries recharge quickly from those little transmissions (effectively making them free). I hold off on transmitting from the mapping sensor. If I don\u0027t have enough fuel to capture I\u0027ll eject the sensor and transit stage and instead use the lander (which has spare delta-v) to capture and land. That way I\u0027ll get most of the science (the double-c is the most important experiment) and I can redo the mapping sensor scan using another probe in a low orbit flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FW4VYNC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FW4VYNC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capture succeeds and I shutdown the engine with 16 L in the tank. I transmit the mapping data and line up to try and circularize. I\u0027m 10 m/s, resulting in a 30 x 50 km orbit but that\u0027s just fine (I could have landed from the original 30 x 190 km orbit too). I\u0027m keeping the transit stage for several orbits in order to recharge. I confirmed for myself that turning off a battery doesn\u0027t just stop it from being drained it will also stop it from being charged. I transfer all power from the large battery in the transit stage to the lander and then turn it off. I only need to recharge the landers batteries. At my AP on the dark side I eject the mapping instrument (getting rid of it here helps slightly lower my orbit without having to turn the ship). Once fully charged the lander seperates and immediately starts to land, there is a limited supply of power for probe operations at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9VL7f4D.png\u0022 alt=\u00229VL7f4D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dHnMd4Z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dHnMd4Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4QrnhqF.png\u0022 alt=\u00224QrnhqF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding isn\u0027t hard though I am challenged by a lack of any real debris on the ground (ground scatter).

I get about 2000 science, enough to unlock Meta-Materials and almost enough for another. With Experimental Rocketry also unlocked I can confirm the contents of another tier 9 tech (the nuclear symbol was a bit of a give away) that provides the LV-N. I have learned some things in this mission. One is that the Poodle, while powerful, isn\u0027t really powerful enough to move the kind of weight I will be moving. With the move to nuclear power I have a plan for a different kind of transfer stage built around a nuclear reactor and multiple LV-909s. My lander concept also works, though I may lower the amount of fuel since most missions don\u0027t require that much to land (and landing is all it\u0027s good for, I can\u0027t use that fuel seperate from the transfer stage without a pump and that\u0027s just wasteful to store it that way). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XCMR8Tv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XCMR8Tv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RC9KDZC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RC9KDZC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T21:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDavid, I\u0027m really liking your playthrough and it\u0027s helping me a lot.

On paper the ship was designed to be capable of reaching Eeloo too but I have some doubts and may have been too optimistic about the transfer delta-v. It will probably undergo an upgrade before any Donut 2 mission is launched to the farthest planet. Like my napkin calculations showed a Dres probe mission can be done on the 60t launcher, trading fuel for power generation and growing to 53 tons. The design takes several of the ideas tested and lessons learned from Carrot 1. The transit\u002Blander\u002Bmapping nose configuration is used again to good effect. This means the lander doesn\u0027t need to take the power generation or storage systems required for transit and usage of the mapping sensor down to the surface. The lack of thrust in the transit stage has been handled by converting from a single Poodle to a cluster of LV909s producing 400 kN. This cluster is built around a nuclear reaction which takes over for the solar cells used previously. A drop tank is built into the lower stage of the ship, an upgrade could increase range by dividing the engine cluster into pairs that can be dropped asparagus style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VoXlQBa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VoXlQBa.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DGQxMCM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DGQxMCM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t entirely sure how wise it was to have all those engines with the drop tank only a few feet away.

The burn is to a flat orbit below Dres, I\u0027ll be making a mid course correction to take me down to Dres\u0027s inclination and make contact. For visual flow (because of the tiny decoupler) I moved the reaction wheel up to just below the mapping scranner but I found it was a bit more sluggish then on Carrot and may move it back to its original position to give it more leverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pxBTT57.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022pxBTT57.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7g6Gt24.png\u0022 alt=\u00227g6Gt24.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrival and capture at Dres is uneventful, there is plenty of fuel and once you get experienced with the initial Kerbin orbit burn into the empty space above/below Dres I find the rest of the trip is relatively easy to plan and execute.

After unlocking the Science Jr I want to see what it can do. From the description it only works on the surface of a body and will require a kerbal to operate. After that the module will need to be returned to Kerbin intact to receive science. Egg 1 will deliver a Science Jr to Minmus where it will be operated by a crew member from Zulu 2. After that it will return itself to Kerbin. The ship is designed to be able to complete a journey to the surface of the Mun as well (so I can do a follow up Egg 2 mission without a redesign) and even with that the weight is low compared to many previous missions. For this reason it easily fits on the old Quebec launcher and even then the booster is able to provide the entire injection to Minmus. Egg 1 uses a flower pedal solar panel arrangement that I haven\u0027t used in BTSM. The reason is that to get full power from the array it must be kept precisely aligned while the wing arrangement can track the sun across long distances. With the reduced power requirements of the probe core the output of 4 flower pedal panels is enough even when not at optimal alignment and more importantly the flower pedal arrangement can continue to provide near optimal power after landing, something that is difficult for the wing arrangement. Egg 1 enters orbit around Minmus and then goes into standby mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9qojaea.png\u0022 alt=\u00229qojaea.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n5BhPNh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n5BhPNh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZulu 2 launches with a 2 man crew that includes greenest recruit, Johncan Kerman.

The suit seems to be using it up at a rate of about 1 unit every 20 seconds which is 3/min. By the time he reaches the probe he\u0027s already used the equivalent of 20 minutes of lander life support. Right now this EVA looks like it will deplete nearly an hour from the landers reserves so I need to keep it moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerforming experiments in the lab produces a whole lot of science. Working from my baseline the Science Jr has a value of 400, more then double the next best experiment. This will go a long way to making my manned mission calculations work for getting tier 9 techs.

It will be flying the same upgraded Zulu craft as Zulu 3 so that biometric readings can be taken (the main purpose of this mission). Since I also want to get a soil sample I\u0027m going to aim for a polar landing this time. Previously my missions have all stayed around the equator where interception for docking is safe and straight forward. Inclining my orbit introduces risk over the lander not having enough time or delta-v to meet up with the command module. For a perfect polar orbit and landing the challenge becomes figuring out what direction to burn in (compass doesn\u0027t work so well at the north or south pole).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting into polar orbit isn\u0027t too hard, when making course corrections it\u0027s simply a matter of setting the PE to 0 and then burning up (normal) a bit until the PE comes back. A few more corrections inside Minmus SOI gets it right and then capture is done the same as any other orbit. Biometric readings are taken in orbit and a crew report is made over the poles region. My polar orbit is not quite exact, it drifts a bit toward the day side on the north pole and a bit to the night side on the south pole. That\u0027s just fine, I\u0027ll land at the north pole where I\u0027ll have more light.

Jorster sets down and takes a soil sample (150 science) and then lets the Biometric Sensor Array record information about his health and condition (another 300 science, very useful instrument). This is probably the last time we\u0027ll be visiting Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TXFVEQP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TXFVEQP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to rendezvous with the command module Jorster targets it and then waits until it is overhead. This provides some indication on the navball as to what direction the command module is moving relative to the lander. Jorster is able to get his heading figured out though it requires burning in a few directions to get the orbital path to line up where he wants it. Because the command module isn\u0027t in a perfect polar orbit it has moved a bit from the landing site. Jorster will need to make several burns in succession. The first burn will semi-circulize his orbit, then only a few seconds later as his orbit intersects the command modules he\u0027ll make a second burn to line them both up. A third burn comes later to setup an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C6zhHbN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C6zhHbN.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SAU68xm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SAU68xm.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/efzbX9G.png\u0022 alt=\u0022efzbX9G.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the first two burns are done the 3rd isn\u0027t as hard.

I had some concerns about fuel earlier in the mission due to the correction burns to enter polar orbit but the tank seems to have a good supply (481 / 1800). With the orbit more or less parallel to Kerbin there doesn\u0027t seem like any great need to burn at a specific time to exit Minmus SOI. The estimated time to leave is a bit high at 22 hours so I burned a bit more fuel to lower that to 8 hours. Once I\u0027m out of Minmus SOI things return to normal with the ship in an orbit almost identical to Minmus but on a slightly different inclination. With only 2 crew members and a solar array there is plenty of life support so any overrun in time wouldn\u0027t be a fatal disaster. Reentry has become such a normal procedure (and I\u0027ve got everything after seperation automated) that I leave the computer and take a break while the capsule enters the atmosphere for it\u0027s 5 minute return to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tHi24Vg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tHi24Vg.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i0B4B7X.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i0B4B7X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the science I can unlock the last (well 2nd last) 1800pt item, Advanced Field Science, which gives me the life support supply pods.

I don\u0027t need to level 9 aerospace tech at all but the other 3 each have one crucial item that essentially solves a particular problem. The nuclear engine handles the delta-v issue, the RTG solves the power issue and the SOLONG habitat thing solves the life support issue. Of the three the RTG is definitely the first I need to unlock. I can\u0027t do a manned mission past Duna without it and it would help with probes too (I could make a manned mission with NUK NUK reactors, but the reactors alone would weigh over 50 tons making it unfeasable). The choice for a second tech is a bit harder. The habitat is certainly a juicy target for making an Eeloo mission possible, but getting a manned mission to Eeloo without the LV-N seems like it would push the weight up pretty high. Without doing a more detailed numerical analysis I can\u0027t be sure but I think it might be easier (mass wise) to use an LV-N to get to Eeloo carrying lots of life support consumables then it would be to get a SOLONG habitat to Eeloo with LV909s. Because of that I might put the nuclear engine as my second goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to send a probe to Eeloo and then explore Jool\u0027s moons.
