The first one I found was a class A midget rock, so I built a nice little unmanned probe to capture it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust after launching and getting ready to rendezvous with lil\u0027 rocky, a class E caught my eye, a 3000 tonne beauty. So plans changed, and I figured, if I can get that thing home, I can do anything, and its way bigger than the measly pebble I found before. Lets get this fat B*****d. So off I went to catch fat-rocky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2CPwD7lbyVQ/UzxSCIs5NaI/AAAAAAAADWw/e5VNPyHgivU/s1600/2014-04-02_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b5RRu9B_zcI/UzxSCPxYVEI/AAAAAAAADW4/T--DYluZegE/s1600/2014-04-02_00002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon after getting close to the rock, I realised the first problems. The main one being that nuclear engines dont do much to 3000 tonnes, and definately dont do enough to park in Kerbin orbit. Secondly, the claw is wobbly. It wobbles worse than docking ports. In the end, all I ended up doing here was slowly spinning the rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I had a plan. Realising that the rock would pass betwixt the Mun and Minmus, I figured it wouldnt be too difficult to catch in in Kerbins SOI, so I made a biger, better, manned grabby rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ME3lkWLjbnM/UzxSCUsqtRI/AAAAAAAADW0/9wLece-RrAM/s1600/2014-04-02_00003.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PF1El4BVwhg/UzxSERBDvDI/AAAAAAAADXI/zXgm4_1VdQ8/s1600/2014-04-02_00006.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00006.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome time later, the rock was caught, and the wobbly claw struck again. (Getting the center of mass on these things is also a challenge, and controlling the rotation of these rocks is also quite the challenge). After much controlled-bursting of the engines, I managed to park this beauty in LKO. This is my first asteroid capture, and I love that rock. My next plan is to get this in LKO (about 100km or so) and use it to test new asteroid grabbers, or turn it into a space-base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEtT-zYLZxM/UzxSHHv__KI/AAAAAAAADXg/tGuf5QER-6g/s1600/2014-04-02_00009.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00009.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d8HW6yPY7tQ/UzxSK4O08SI/AAAAAAAADYE/avnekVLI6io/s1600/2014-04-02_00010.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00010.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NMxBLWkP7aA/UzxSKQbXSHI/AAAAAAAADYA/Gzc6x4JCYog/s1600/2014-04-02_00012.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-04-02_00012.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T18:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis report of a mission moved to Mission Reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T18:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice catch!
