If you set something as your target (I.e minmus) and then look at your current orbit you will see ascending and decending nodes, hovering over these will show you the inclination shift you need to do. Create a manoeuvre node at one of these points and adjust the normal/anti-normal parameters to correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
