I will be playing with some new restrictions and removing some old ones. To nail down some of the difficulty this new save file will have several of the hidden options enabled: Kerbals won\u0027t respawn, the revert menu will be disabled, quick save won\u0027t work and it won\u0027t be possible to delete ships in flight or access the stock craft files. At the same time I\u0027ll be relaxing a few rules: With the .23 improvements I won\u0027t have any special rules for transmissions. I will also allow nuclear engines with Kerbals since it caused a lot of extra busy work, this time I will be using a mission structure to make it challenging by having interplanetary missions before nuclear engines are even available. I will also be dropping the rules about habitat. As long as there is a pod and not just a chair it is ok. Kerbals must return home, no one gets left behind. I\u0027ll also be removing Jeb, Bill and Bob from the save file before starting, it will be all kerbals you haven\u0027t met before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I\u0027ll be playing with all the save/revert options removed it means I will be at the mercy of glitches and bugs. These will be treated as \u0027equipment failures\u0027 to be worked around, Apollo 13 style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile last time I tried to challenge myself with special rules for interplanetary travel this time I want to try to challenge myself by forcing myself to get out there sooner instead of sending half a dozen missions to the Mun. So the kongressional kommittee in charge of the space program\u0027s budget has forwarded a list of specific projects it wants to see completed. While some testing of equipment is allowed the kommittee will not support the funding of missions that don\u0027t pursue the stated goals. Once a project\u0027s goals are completed the kommittee will expect the KSC to move on to the next project. Ships will be named after their project and numbered - for example the first launch would be Reach I and if that failed to complete Project Reach\u0027s goals then Reach II would be launched and so on. In some cases a project may need to be put on hold until the required technology is developed. In that case it can be skipped until the required parts become available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the project list.

One thing that is new with this career is that with revert disabled entirely I can\u0027t just put a rocket on the pad to check weight or spacing or anything like that. I had to be really careful and hope that I wasn\u0027t blocking the hatch and that I\u0027d gotten all my calculations right, because when I put the rocket on the pad that\u0027s the launch for real. Leap 1 is also going to use some tweakables - I\u0027ve calculated my burn rates so that I can put the throttle at 100% the whole way and not worry about terminal velocity or TWR. I did mess up with my center engine, setting it to 94% when my calculations said 95% but this results in less then 3 seconds where my acceleration stalled before fuel use leveled things out. I also removed the monopropellent from the command pod.

The calculations appear to be correct and we smoothly lift off the pad.

We also have one new instrument to test, the materials labs (Science Jr) and we have batteries now. Part of the planning that goes into these missions is determining what experiments will be run during the mission. In Leap the goo experiment was a bit of a stab in the dark and I ended up with a lot more canisters then I needed. On this mission my failed estimate was crew reports, I thought I might be able to file crew reports about various possible landing sites on the Mun. Without solar panels that meant I would need a power reserve to send them all. I initially determined that 4 batteries would be enough, and then because they where so light I doubled that to 8.

Bigger fuel tanks like the T800 would also help since right now I\u0027ve got engines dangling off a stack of 4x T400s attached by a single radial decoupler. The staging is a bit strange for this one starting with the first \u0027stage\u0027 which consists of a materials bay which is exposed on the launchpad as our control sample. Since there is no point in bringing it into space it is dropped onto the launchpad for later recovery before we even ignite the engines. I used landing gear to cushion the short fall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bQIyZAD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bQIyZAD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Eelqh1K.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Eelqh1K.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JXgFIoo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JXgFIoo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage consists mainly of the four T45 engines, but since I was a bit concerned about overall delta-v and some too-close to call TWR figures I added a small center LV909 engine with a single T400 tank to provide extra thrust. I calculated the fuel consumption based on thrust and set it so that the center engine would run out with a little time to spare before the outer 4 engines where exhausted. The reason for this was that the center engine wouldn\u0027t be able to support the mass of the ship at all, and without being able to predict the exact fuel consumption ascending through the atmosphere I didn\u0027t want to try matching their burn times exactly. My launch checklist indicates that if the center engine cuts out before the gravity turn I can drop it immediately. Since I had to start my gravity turn before it ran out I kept it on. The radial stacks did sway a bit but the thrust vectoring kept everything flying straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lk4WosA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lk4WosA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately the center engine had a tiny bit of fuel left so I just cut the throttle and ejected it with the stage key, then throttled up and ejected the radial keys by tapping the stage key again. This resulted in an explosion as the exhaust plume seemed to ignite the discarded center fuel tank and the debris ripped apart most of the radial tanks. I thought something would be damaged on the main rocket but a full check showed the upper stage had cleared the explosion and an abort wasn\u0027t required. The center engine has two T400 tanks to burn before it gives way to the orbital stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gqEnUq1.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022gqEnUq1.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HFUkW11.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HFUkW11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we\u0027ve been ascending I\u0027ve also been taking observations with the material bays.

We\u0027ve got a tiny amount of fuel in the booster stage so we\u0027ll be burning that before the main orbit stage comes online to complete our orbit. In orbit an EVA is performed to collect the data from all 3 bays, since the orbit stage they are attached to will be discarded shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lve8TbT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lve8TbT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wYua4Hq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wYua4Hq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit stage still has about 30% fuel left - this was planned since we didn\u0027t want to run out of fuel and eject that stage before reaching stable orbit (losing our material bays before we could collect the results).

As we reach high orbit around Kerbin on the way to the Mun we use one of the radially attached material bays and the other one is used once we\u0027ve entered the Mun\u0027s SOI in high orbit. An EVA collects the results and then both of these bays are discarded to reduce weight before our capture burn. In hindsight I should have also attached the two lower goo containers to the material bays as well, since they are used in the same manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tdA35CW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tdA35CW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/32TLmf0.png\u0022 alt=\u002232TLmf0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L1DTTn7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L1DTTn7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe capture into a deliberately inclined Mun orbit.

Apart from my mistake with the power requirement for crew reports I also overlooked the way the Mun is tidally locked to Kerbin, which if my observations and understanding of orbits are correct meant that my inclined orbit didn\u0027t seem to help me at all in covering more of the Mun\u0027s surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G0ehC3e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G0ehC3e.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/umt1wqZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022umt1wqZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn to Kerbin was straight forward, I successfully aimed for a water landing so the last goo container could be exposed there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FsYNp3j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FsYNp3j.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uhf8Zye.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Uhf8Zye.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovery of everything yielded 594 science in total.

One area I was concerned about was using solid boosters, I have this idea in my head of the little reaction wheel in the Mk1 pod being too little to keep the ship from tipping over in flight. To get around that I reused the center LV909 engine that worked on Gander 1, only this time it won\u0027t be carrying much fuel because I will be using it for stabilization instead of added thrust. So instead of figuring out the delta-v I just added its wet weight as payload for the solid booster portion of the flight and its dry weight as payload on the main liquid booster. The stablizer carries a T200 fuel tank (90L) for operation and I can throttle it as needed to maintain control during the solid boost phase before the throttle is turned up to 100% for the liquid booster stage (which should quickly use up its fuel and leave it as dead weight until the orbital stage takes over).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FfTiFaX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FfTiFaX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this is his first mission Gregfield does have a mission checklist to follow so he should be ok. Unlike previous flights Gregfield will be an active pilot during the first part of the launch since he will need to figure out how much throttle is needed to get the stabilizer engine running strong enough to counter any imbalance from the solid boosters, and if needed adjust his pitch and yaw to bring it back to center. He also has two brand new instruments that he will be testing on this mission, the 2HOT Thermometer and Double-C Seismic Accelerometer. Both of these instruments are calibrated before launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xu9bcCV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Xu9bcCV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift off goes smoothly, meaning there where no explosions, but the solid boosters do flex the body work a bit, causing the top of the liquid stacks to angle inward and the bottom to stick out. The more pressing concern is that there is quite a bit of spin. Gregfield is getting dizzy and the ship is starting to list to the side. Incrementing the throttle slowing doesn\u0027t seem to be correcting so while Gregfield can still see straight he jams the throttle to 100% which regains control of the ships attitude. 32 seconds into the flight at an altitude of 2km the solid boosters are ejected and the liquid boosters take over.

The center stabilizer tank is kept on and will only be released after the radial tanks. The 6 engines running at full throttle put out a huge cone of fire that must be visible for a hundred kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wck5zgK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wck5zgK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Gregfield passes 50km on his gravity turn the booster stage fuel is almost exhausted and he is getting ready to cut it loose and coast toward his final burn. There is still some spin but since attitude is functioning correctly no correction attempt is made. This time there is no third stage center booster, only an orbital engine that we don\u0027t need to figure up for a few minutes. The radial stacks are ejected first, then when it is confirmed they are clear the stabilizer is kicked off to clear the orbital engine. This time the problem with Gander\u0027s seperation is more apparent, as the radial tanks flip end over end, coming dangerously close to hitting the center section. These observations by Gregfield will be important in designing future missions. The orbital burn and the munar insertion are done using the orbital engine and are pretty straight forward by this point. The orbital engine has one last official use, which is to perform the capture burn at the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TEvpOt6.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022TEvpOt6.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NLs5JVO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NLs5JVO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGregfield arrives and establishes a 30km orbit above the Mun with about 90L of fuel left in the orbital stage. He begins searching the surface for a good landing site for this mission which will involve two landings - one landing in a crater and one landing outside for a sample comparison. On the side of the Mun facing the sun there is one rather prominent crater and he begins descending into it. Gregfield is trying to land close to that dark gash thing in the center right. From this angle it seems he will miss it but from a different perspective it is clear his descent path is a fraction north of the gash rather then a big miss south.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5XsAf9r.png\u0022 alt=\u00225XsAf9r.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w4ztGnN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w4ztGnN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital section has done most of the work in slowing down the lander, it is nearly a straight drop from here.

The regular landing gear provide some cushioning, but the goo containers provide a secondary set of landing gear to protect the engine. In the event that the science modules couldn\u0027t easily be accessed there was a procedure for folding up the landing legs to bring the ship closer to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGregfield gets out to explore the crater. His EVA includes the classic flag planting and taking of surface samples. It also involves using one of the access ladders to collect samples from the science bays. Something that is learned is that the small science instruments can be reset for free (Gregfield can take the data and the instrument can be used again), so we didn\u0027t need to carry as many as we did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k3HqMCF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k3HqMCF.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bpWp3Sc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bpWp3Sc.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LT3DM3T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LT3DM3T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next phase of the mission involves a suborbital hop to the outside of the crater. I\u0027ve never done this before (except for on Gilly where the gravity makes any thrust nearly orbital) but I have a good idea of what forces will be involved and what Gregfield should watch for. It begins with a regular lift off and a turn 45 degrees east, but once the AP hits 5km Gregfield follows his instructions to turns all the way horizontal and puts on speed until his suborbital trajectory puts him outside of the crater. As we coast along we get a good look at what that gash was - a narrow mountain about 3.5-4km high. Fortunately Gregfield is flying parallel to it so he doesn\u0027t need to gain altitude to avoid the cliff face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/luO50ny.png\u0022 alt=\u0022luO50ny.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AV8Q6ia.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AV8Q6ia.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nxD76Ci.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nxD76Ci.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is the landing. Gregfield is already aware that most of his velocity is horizontal and he needs to kill that before touching down. However he also needs to avoid losing too much altitude while he does it. Passing the final lip of the crater (after the main cliff face there are 2 smaller depressions to avoid) thrust is put on. We are traveling 200m/s and above 500m from the surface, the crater was almost 2km deep so we are coming up on the ground much faster then we left it. Gregfield is following the procedure and trying to angle his braking maneuver to keep his vertical speed dial at zero. Gregfield manages to zero out his velocity a short distance from the next crater (the cliff edge is a little difficult to see but it is a steep drop off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ccs5iNH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ccs5iNH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sXBaDE5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sXBaDE5.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N2d9bci.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N2d9bci.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is another smooth landing but with one small problem. On landing Gregfield discovers he has just 10L of liquid fuel left in the tank (the hop burned 42L). He\u0027s not in danger of being unable to get home, but that landing was very risky with that much fuel, if the orbiter hadn\u0027t done so much of the work during the first landing he would have run out of fuel while traveling 720 km/h just a short distance over the Munar surface. The problem was the checklist which accidently omitted a crucial step after the first landing, transfering the 90L of fuel stored in the side tanks to the center tank (the engineers haven\u0027t invented fuel lines yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FZ8Fypb.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022FZ8Fypb.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SJiUHdT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SJiUHdT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5AKGgYm.png\u0022 alt=\u00225AKGgYm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel is transfered and similar science and EVA operations are done as the first landing.

Gregfield is following the mission plan to enter a polar orbit around the Mun, with the intention of coming back into polar orbit around Kerbin and landing on the ice.

I made the mistake of only thinking in terms of the Mun\u0027s frame of reference. In that frame I was moving north to south which I assumed I could use to get into the same orbit around Kerbin. But the Mun is also moving in relation to Kerbin, east to west, and moving much faster then my little Mun orbit. As a result the only way I could manage a polar Kerbin orbit would be with an enormous amount of delta-v (almost the entire velocity needed to maintain such an orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c264Ugk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c264Ugk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a straight forward return to Kerbin is made resulting in a landing in some boring grassland (object in the upper right is the discard service module) east of some mountains and west of the big crater gulf.

At this point the first real change in the mission plan is performed where instead of immediately plotting the required burn to the Mun/Minmus Gregfield instead begins performing a survey of the planet with the negative gravioli detector. It is immediately apparent that the easiest way to do this is to measure using the instrument on the command pod so that Gregfield can simply open the hatch, grab the results and hop right back in.

With the cost to launch just 1kg of cargo into low Kerbal orbit they see this as a massive waste on the part of the kerbal space program.

Furthermore the kommittee has caught word of the \u0027nuclear engines\u0027 now in development. These sound very expensive, especially with the rising cost of refined kranium and klutonium. They have decreed that a limited number of nuclear engines will be purchased for the program and will be dependent on the successful completion of each phase. For the next phase of the program, Great Journeys, they will provide the budget to purchase exactly one nuclear engine.

One small issue is transmitting science - if we don\u0027t have enough power then the transmission speed slows down while it waits to recharge between each packet. However after the first one we stop getting science. If we check the missing science seems to be available to be transmitted on a second try, but it will transmit 0 science instead. The only way around this seems to be by time warping, which slows down the transmission rate relative to the actual in game clock (transmissions still take the same amount of real world time, but the in game clock is moving faster) while the solar panels recharge using the game clock (so more power is recharged between packets, preventing the battery from reaching zero and causing the bug/\u0027feature\u0027). It\u0027s far from an ideal solution and I will be unable to fully transmit some of my major findings (I won\u0027t be able to use time warp for the sensor nose cone in the atmosphere, which means despite planning on plenty of time I\u0027ll get about 10% science instead of 35%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fzCa8oJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fzCa8oJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SnyCxnD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SnyCxnD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we reach Eve the PE is lowered to 59km for aerobraking.

This meant it was practical to tie in the launch boosters fuel supply and use the probe engine to assist in lift off.

Scoring was based on a value for the planet, engines used and final mass of the ship. The way the scoring system worked the Mainsail was the obvious choice - in order to land you need a TWR \u0026gt; 1 so you can easily determine the maximum starting mass of a lander. Dividing by score the Mainsail was had a better ratio then the other engines by a large margin (large enough to ignore any differences in ISP). Planet wise Kerbin had an atmosphere and that meant you really didn\u0027t to burn as much fuel to land, since drag would remove everything but terminal velocity. Score wise Eve was better (scores seemed to be based on gravity) but Kerbin was obviously much closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic strategy I assumed is that you want to burn as little fuel as possible (to keep the weight up) which meant you wanted to counter the minimal amount of velocity. Every second that you are falling gravity is adding to your velocity, so you want to burn for the shortest period possible. If you \u0027hover\u0027 you are just providing gravity with more time to add velocity that you\u0027ll need to kill later. So my calculation was determining when I should turn on the engine so that under a continous burn I would be at landing velocity (\u0026lt;12m/s) just before I touched the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I got some numbers. My ship would be just under 153 tons (1500 kN / 9.8m/s) in order to have the minimum TWR. From the wiki it would consume fuel at a rate of 109.11 l/s at sea level. Since I would be near that I decided to just take that as a constant value (I figured that the human factor would add a much larger margin of error then the fuel consumption difference). Finally I needed my terminal velocity, which I figured by tossing my ship up 5km and letting it fall down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a rough recreation of my spreadsheet, some of the initial values are approximate but the final values seem to be close enough to match. My method won\u0027t make the higher math folks happy, I\u0027ve forgotten most of my calculus which could have probably boiled this down to one nice equation without all the errors I\u0027ve introduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tJ7sZUv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tJ7sZUv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first column A you have how much time has passed. The second column is how big of a time step I\u0027m going to use which is where the calculus folks will cringe. The smaller a value I use here the more accurate the results. KSP experiences the same thing, since it calculates everything in descrete steps. When you use physical timewarp (2x-4x) you are increasing the size of those steps so that fewer have to be done to cover the same amount of time at the cost of accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColumn C has my initial mass and every row following is carrying over the value from the New Mass column (L). D, E, F and G are constants for the engines thrust, fuel use, gravity and a calculation of how many tons of fuel are burned for each time step. Column H is my current velocity, which is initially terminal velocity and then carries over from the last rows New Velocity value (K). Column I has my calculation for the ships current thrust, which is just engine thrust divided by current mass. The acceleration (J) is the difference between thrust and gravity and new velocity (K) is the old velocity plus acceleration. New Mass (L) is the difference between the old mass and the fuel burned and finally distance is a running total based on the velocity multiplied by the time passed - this is how much vertical distance the ship has fallen since the burn at terminal velocity started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing range copy and paste I can duplicate this to hundreds of rows in a single step which is the brute force math part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nQqpTlJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nQqpTlJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrolling down I find that in just over 15 seconds I should reach landing velocity. The important figures are that by that time my mass will be around 130 tons and most importantly I will have fallen 1400m. Armed with that figure I now have a close approximation of what distance above the ground I should start burning if I want to be at the right velocity when I reach it. Conveniently the radar altimeter has a notch for 1500m which provides enough breathing room to account for human reflex time and the margin of error inherent in my calculations (time steps, fuel usage assumptions, terminal velocity assumption, perfect pitch, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my low altitude tests these numbers worked correctly. I started a burn at 1500m and I typically stopped just before I hit the ground, letting me adjust the thrust a bit and land with 120 tons of mass. For my real orbital drop I was a fraction late which put me even closer to the ideal numbers, hitting the ground at practically the exact speed (I had no chance to lower thrust, just cut it when the landing gear hit) and landing with 125 tons of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T00:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith phase 2 complete I\u0027ll be starting on phase 3 soon.
