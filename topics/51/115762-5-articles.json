I use them fairing deployment on every flight, and usually to time the launch clamp release. They can activate action groups based on fuel remaining, altitude, proximity, or simply time. Just before touchdown, a pair of timers activate that deflate the landing bags then deploy the dish \u0026 panels. Need to have the dish targeted BEFORE loss of signal, tho."},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T22:25:51Z","Content":"Ohh, 200days? so its \u0027that\u0027 meaning of Soon^(TM)^![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\nAhh ...

Would be V useful for atmospheric landing of probes.\n\nTiming launch clamps? fairing separation? why do these things need automation? Other than KW motors having a spool up time so get themselves a stage 0 ignition everything else goes in 1 launch stage. I just watch the thrust output till it nearly matches max before releasing the rocket. Fairings again get a stage to themselves which I fire at 91km, its not like I have anything else to do while I wait for the rocket to empty its tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T23:26:24Z","Content":"I\u0027m a fan of \u0022push the button then pray\u0022 type launches, I like it when I have everything perfectly dialed in so I can just hit engage \u0026 space and watch the rocket go to space. Little things like having the launch clamps \u0026 umbilicals release in a cascade amuse me. I have the build formula in KCT cranked way up to something ridiculous, a typical KI booster takes around 20 days to build. I\u0027ll need three of them plus a huge cryo transfer stage and a bunch of never-before-build hardware. The initial payload to LKO is around 17 tonnes right now, it\u0027s a framerate-killing monster.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried other porkchop plotters but the MJ one can figure earlier departures for a little extra DV. It\u0027s amazing what a few hundred extra m/s will get for a transfer. Trying to go interplanetary from a 50\\* inclination, that will pretty much require it."}]}
