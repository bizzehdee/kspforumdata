Upon returning to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Val demonstrated her continued mastery of the Civvie by flying another glide approach, which meant she reduced throttle to idle at the start of her descent (this time from 4.5km) and then did not touch it all the way down to landing. Even with a steep 5km final approach sometimes reaching pitch down of 12-13\u00B0 and speeds of 65m/s, after leveling out over the runway she slowed to landing speed before traveling halfway down.

The 45min tours consist of a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zBA9Kut.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eguided bus ride\u003C/a\u003E that departs from the nearby Support Village and travels throughout the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E campus. Initial interest was extremely high and the first few weeks of tours were completely sold out within days, however it has since been realized that many bought tickets just so they could visit the Monolith. Although it is not officially part of the tour, it is still easily visible from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and this is a draw to the various religious groups that worship it. One group tried to break away and make a run for the Monolith but were quickly apprehended and escorted off the premises thanks to our \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z7U2QYJ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enew fleet of security vehicles\u003C/a\u003E. Since then no further attempts have been made but also many have requested ticket refunds or simply not shown up to claim their seats on tours. It\u2019s a bit disappointing to know that for some kerbs seeing the Monolith would be the only reason to want to visit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMonolith Dome Construction \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBegins \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter failing to breach the surface of the Monolith last weekend using several methods from normal cutting tools to high-powered lasers to large impact objects, scientists working on the project have decided their next course of action will be to begin excavating the ground around it. The object has always appeared to be buried deep into the ground, although to what extent remains to be seen. In order to keep the excavated pit dry, a dome will be built over the Monolith \u2013 much to the outcry of those who consider the object to be a part of their religious beliefs. The Presider has remained steadfast in the wake of multiple protests in keeping the details of the Monolith research project secret, including work being done at Kravass and Umbarg regarding the strange mineral formations. Given that there\u2019s no way to hide a huge dome, we can at least reveal what will be going on under it (of course, many conspiracy kerbs take this admission with a grain of salt).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EATN Database \u0026amp; KSA Finances Update\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weekly update for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/timelines/806163555804479489\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAsteroid Tracking Network\u003C/a\u003E database is available \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHRNo_p_tzOZa4OW7vk6PFs9xJHG72lFEEm57RnHm_Q/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, containing 937 asteroids, 13 updates and 1 new alerts issued.

So much fun. I was pretty much directly under the moon\u2019s shadow and near the point of greatest eclipse, weather was mostly sunny and when I got there cumulus clouds were in abundance and one was blocking the sun but by the time totality arrived it was perfectly clear and I saw everything. The one thing I don\u2019t recall is noticing any real temperature drop. My main takeaway from the event was how impossibly terrifying this must have been for early humans. I always thought that they\u2019d become gradually freaked out as the sun grew dimmer over time but you really can\u2019t tell anything is happening to the sun until totality. You\u2019ll notice the lighting is a bit\u00A0 \u2013 \u201Coff\u201D \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t really say dimmer but just noticeably different. Shadows are a bit fuzzier, but if you were to look up at the sun it would still be a blindingly bright speck of light up in the sky and you\u2019d be like \u201Cok, nothing wrong there\u201D and then BAM!! darkness descends over the course of a few seconds and you look back up and now the sun is a giant black orb with ghostly filaments surrounding it and OMG THAT IS SOME APOCALYPTIC excrements if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming or what it is. Anyways, it\u2019s definitely an experience everyone should witness \u2013 2024!

I\u2019ve decided then to use random numbers each time the game is started (have to do this manually for now, but whatever) for the x,y,z offset values and whichever way the clouds are moving is the direction the wind is heading. Very simplistic, in reality there are multiple wind layers with varying directions and speeds but it at least gives me a starting point that I can use for the majority of the lower atmosphere. Of course this still affects absolutely nothing in the game itself but for things like deciding which direction a balloon will end up going or which direction an aircraft should be taking off from, it means I no longer have to decide myself these things but can leave it up to chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EATN GeoGebra figure?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now that I know I can dynamically add orbits to a 3D figure in the Flight Tracker the question of course arises as to whether I could load all 900\u002B asteroid orbits.

Doing these 5 launches in two weeks is not only to pick up the pacing a little bit for those who hate all the time between launches but also as a test of whether I can handle the intense workload (33 images were posted this week, my average is 14. Images take a good deal of time for me to setup, capture \u0026amp; edit so are a good metric for my workload). So far so good, we\u2019ll see how the three launches next week turn out. Given that I went into this whole thing with only 1 week of lead time it\u2019s definitely a good thing I\u2019ve been able to keep up\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECivvie accident\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided beforehand Jeb was going to crash, but it turned out I also ended up flying a much poorer glide approach than I did with Val anyways. He was actually going to glide in too steeply and when pulling up before the runway not do so in time and strike his main gear, pitch forward and bury the prop. So I had to write it a bit differently with a stall instead thanks to my low glide approach, but the end result was still the same. I\u2019ve been making Val out to be the better pilot, but I will say that Jeb fans have nothing to worry about. He\u2019ll have his moments too. I see him as more of a clutch performer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk5 launch sims\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u2019t really make sense for me to truly try out code for the first time during an actual rocket launch, because besides the fact that kOS doesn\u2019t have a true IDE which can tell me if I have errors when I run the code, there are things I can\u2019t test unless the program is running in a situation where it has to handle things. Of course I do still want the actual flight to be \u201Ciffy\u201D so I\u2019ve built a Mk5 replica that can do all the real Mk5 can do but the fins spin it up faster, I don\u2019t use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and I launch it straight up off the pad. So the entire flight is different but the various states such as boosting, coasting, re-entry, etc are all still happening. Even though they let me test the code under simple scenarios, there\u2019s still always the possibility of problems during the actual flight that imposes different constraints and flies a different trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk5 flight 1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew I would maybe run out of disk space but I decided to let it happen if it did, however I was planning on using a bigger hard drive and my first attempt at the launch I forgot that although I edited the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E file to increase the disk space the part I had already included in the rocket still had the old values, so I ran out of space during ascent. I had to revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and replace that part so it would have the larger disk space. This was good because I also decided to hook up my X55 throttle for the second try so I could have a much smoother throttle response when pulling back on thrust to maintain 2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.

RRRGGHHH!!! But also, I forgot to change the code from testing to shred the fins at 60km instead of 30km. So when I redid the launch I decided it would be a few minutes from the end of the window since that would be suspenseful, but when I actually wrote out the tweets later on I realized it made more sense to just say well ahead of time we\u2019re shooting for the very end of the window, so I had to adjust the log times ahead two minutes. This is a similar thing to the one Civvie mission I had to re-write logs for and drives the point home that I should always write the tweets first leading up to the launch, \u003Cem\u003Ethen \u003C/em\u003Efly the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGithub update considerations\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I want to use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/AFCS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAFCS github repository\u003C/a\u003E properly to store various versions of the code but the problem is I can\u2019t schedule updates, so I\u2019m storing versions locally and pushing them to the repository manually at the proper times, which is why all the tweets about github updates have been ambiguous as to when the updates will happen.

This failed to work properly during the 4th launch but this time the code worked and the rocket did as it was supposed to. There was a small spike in dynamic pressure after throttle up as shown in the graph below, so if done again in the future we may want the rocket to wait until dynamic pressure falls about 1-2kPa before throttling up to full thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Untitled333.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022278\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Untitled333.png\u0022 width=\u0022381\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003EDynamic pressure in kPa over the duration of the 3rd stage boost (in seconds) \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to full throttle rather than maintaining a set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E throughout the burn did not seem to provide any benefit, as our apokee only ended up being 87km whereas we had hoped this ascent would allow the rocket to surpass the 135km record of the Mk4. However there are several other factors that need to be considered such as how well the rocket pitched over during ascent, precession during coasts triggering early boosts, altitude comparisons, etc. This will all be covered in the full review. Still, even if it did not set a new altitude record this fifth flight of the Mk5 has earned its place in history as being the first successful fully-automated rocket flight \u2013 to space and back no less!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe full review of the Mk5 will allow us to decide how to proceed with the program, but based on this initial launch series we feel confident in allowing agencies to begin applying for sub-orbital science flights with their choice of payload instruments for any data they wish to collect. These contracts will take 2 weeks to construct and launch from the day they are signed so the launch cadence will be much slower moving forward but fear not, we are still developing new rocket designs \u2013 engineers have not forgotten about \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/WC3pPS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce Preliminary Crash Report\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a successful \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=5267\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eground trial\u003C/a\u003E the Deuce was slated to fly earlier this week but the return to flight mission was pushed back numerous times thanks to Progeny launch delays and weather. Captain Jebediah finally was able to take the aircraft up on Thursday although the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=5328\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einitial attempt\u003C/a\u003E was foiled by not having enough pitch authority to bring up the nose during the takeoff run. Engineers dampened the pitch controls during the rebuild but with the changes that were also made to better balance the aircraft the lowered pitch settings were not really needed. After a quick adjustment in the Horizontal Assembly Building to return the control settings back to where they were during the earlier flight trials, the Deuce was able to lift off on its \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=5332\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esecond attempt\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately while the pitch instability seemed to be fixed, the Deuce still exhibited a strong left-roll tendency that seems a bit too much for engineers to attribute to a yaw problem. Applying opposite rudder worked but it took about 50% of travel and caused a 5\u00B0 sideslip that noticeably increased the drag on the aircraft. Even more unfortunately, Jeb had trouble again on his final approach, coming in too slow and nearly stalling the aircraft in a similar manner to his \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=4295\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elast accident\u003C/a\u003E. He did manage to recover well, but as he was fast approaching the runway he did not give the aircraft enough time to gain some more speed before dropping the landing gear, which increased the drag and immediately threw the plane over into a leftward spiral down into the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully proper restraints and the nose cone being designed to crumple led to Jeb being knocked unconscious but only with a minor concussion. Although rescuers had to blow the emergency cockpit hatch to extricate Jeb, the Deuce did not take on enough water to sink before we could get back to it and tow it ashore. Also by design the engine pods broke off the wings on impact, and we will be calling in a salvage vessel next week to haul them up off the ocean floor. Flight recorders in the tail section survived without damage and will be studied thoroughly.

Yea I\u2019m cutting things pretty tight, closing out a Friday on a Tuesday. Still, when I started this 5-launch series I only had 1 week of lead time and now I have 4 days, so that\u2019s not too bad of a loss considering all the stuff I had to do (31 images this past week). There was a day of sickness and some IRL stress making my focus go away completely at some points and robbing me of a lot of sleep, but I still managed to hop onto GTA:O for some sessions, watch some movies and keep up with news, forums and twitter timelines.

Besides that though they do grant me a bit of free time since I have to suspend operations for them, although in this case it was over a weekend and I wanted to show what it looked like so it probably took up more time than it saved. Still, I had it setup so that I could use it to delay launches this past week if I felt I needed to in order to not run out of lead time.

There\u2019s no reason for me to actually toggle the comms on \u0026amp; off in the game because when comms are lost the log data is written internally, and then after recovery it would be combined with the ground-based log data before being displayed publicly so there\u2019s no point in me doing the extra work to actually combine it. If the rocket didn\u2019t get recovered, I could also manually just remove any data that would have only been on the rocket from the full telemetry log.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should also comment that the code for the science instruments is pretty lame, just toggling an action ground that holds the instruments.

I really did want to do some more Deuce flights but in retrospect I suppose this is for the best as I really do want a lighter workload moving forward for a bit so I can build my lead time back up, and moreso than rocket flights aircraft flights are very time consuming. I honestly have no idea why the hell the plane wants to roll to the left so much, but I\u2019m suspecting it is some inherent build problem from how I put it all together in the editor. While the \u201D crash investigation\u201D continues I\u2019ll be busy trying to figure this all out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk5 launch #3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was fun, because it let me start to introduce some repercussions for the Monolith Incident and all the talk I\u2019ve been dropping about protests over the government decision to block religious access to the Monolith. So it wasn\u2019t put in there just to delay the launch and buy me time. Reactions to the event were pretty much what I expected them to be, and I am glad so many people were around to provide some interaction. I originally wanted the ship to have a huge banner with kerbs on the deck, but I realized that was rather impractical because I would spend a lot of time working up things to be able to get a screenshot of it in the game. Doing the launch itself I got stupid and tried to launch at the wrong time, which of course triggered the launch script as soon as I loaded it into the rocket\u2019s probe core. A special consideration for this launch I almost forgot about as well was taking into account the extra drain on the batteries due to progressing through almost an entire terminal count before scrubbing the launch \u0026amp; resetting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk5 launch #4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this launch was planned in advance to go kablooie, I have been wanting to introduce wind shear for a while now. Prior to this it\u2019s good enough to say the rockets weren\u2019t really large enough to be affected by shear, weren\u2019t traveling fast enough or just were lucky not to have any shear when they launched. The third stage throttling up immediately was a code bug I discovered in testing but decided to leave it in as a bug to be discovered in flight for once, and also it lent itself well to the accident by increasing the rocket\u2019s speed to make it more susceptible to breaking up when slammed with vertical shear. I was also planning on using this event as another buffer for an excuse to delay the 5th launch if I felt I was not going to be able to get things done ahead of time. Again as with the storm, thankfully I did not have to. Also, when launching manually \u0026amp; resetting to get around a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E bug, the upper launch rail tends to get destroyed. I don\u2019t know why pressing spacebar leads to a different result when calling \u003Ccode\u003Estage\u003C/code\u003E from kOS code but it does.

I think this is because I knew ahead of time I planned to let this launch fail. I realized this on the day of the launch as I was reviewing tweets, after I had written tweets for the 5th launch.

As expected, results showed that the instrument is not sensitive enough to changes in gravity so deep in the field of a large planet and will continue to only be deployed in space or upper-atmospheric missions.

Although we had missions roughly plotted as early as late 2016, several advances in our understanding of orbital mechanics have been applied to our planning software and the team decided to re-run possibilities two months ago. The major hurdle being cited since then is processing time in looking for good flyby routes being much longer than anticipated. The team is now spending this upcoming month focusing solely on our 2018-2019 launch window for the first mission, as we would like an idea of the deltaV requirements needed to get the probe on its way so our orbital program has a rocket that is powerful enough. This means that although we hoped to announce our orbital program in October, it will now have to wait until early November.

I decided to bring back the pollen health issue from earlier this year just because my own allergies were acting up. After I wrote that the game handed me a mission for air sampling right in the middle of the Grasslands so I immediately thought \u201Chey they wanted to sample the air for pollen counts!\u201D Then I decided to delay it for another contract the game offered me and realized the scientists would be liquided so that was some more content I could tweet. Finally flying the mission I forgot I wanted to step-climb the air samples by making a complete 7km orbit at 1km, then do two more complete circles while holding 2km and 3km ASL. So I wrote in the storm as an excuse to have Val fly in a continuous climb (after trying to hold a level 1km at the start) to save time and land before the bad weather.

This review was so I could determine how well the overall plot and progression have held up over time. The result: really damn good. I did uncover a few very minor plots that needed a bit of resolution, most of which I addressed this past week, and I also added a section to my text document of all the tweets that could be considered ongoing plot points so I don\u2019t lose track of them and make sure to bring them back up every now and again. Overall though reading from start to finish I did not find anything extremely contradictory or divergent and the steady pace of progress is strongly evident. I did find two minor inconsistencies \u2013 the first was the Civvie originally being able to communicate over the horizon like I do with airships and maritime vessels, whereas now I make a point of saying the Civvie will be out of touch when it drops below the horizon. Over-horizon comms can take a good deal of power though so my explanation if anyone were to notice and ask about it would be that after the Civvie got its advanced instruments it no longer had the available power output to transmit over the horizon, only line of sight. The second minor nag would be that I specified the daylight launch window for the Progeny rockets originally as 45min after sunrise 1hr before sunset and later on it was written as 30min after sunrise 45min before sunset.

DAMMIT.

Then some days would be a complete washout in terms of being able to do any KSA work. But I\u2019ve been able to at least keep a day ahead at the worst of times, although barely. In one instance this past weekend if I hadn\u2019t happened to wake up at 6am there would have been no 7am sunrise/sunset tweet. Oy. Lack of lead time also sucks because I like to be very flexible in how I plan things out \u2013 for example there was a tweet earlier this week about the KerBalloon missions that made it seem like they would be done the same day, which I originally intended to do. But then as I was actually doing them I decided spreading them out over two days would be better, but my lead time was non-existent so when I made this decision it was already too late to go back and edit that tweet before publishing to reflect the missions occurring over two days. So yea, going to try harder to double-down this coming week. Also sucks I\u2019ve had almost no time to work on the Ops Tracker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECivvie Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe circle step-climb was a great challenge. I don\u2019t re-fly Genesis missions unless my computer crashes, and even then I set things up to restart from where I left off, so anytime you see the results of an aircraft flight that\u2019s the real deal. There was a lot of concentration involved to maintain my distance from the\u00A0 target, maintain my altitude, and trim the aircraft level while also watching my speed, as I\u2019ve made clear on multiple instances that going faster than 100m/s will damage the instrument, and I am held accountable by making the flight data publicly available. Looking at the flight path linked above you can see the wobble where I started to trim out level during the climbs, but I never exceeded 100m/s and never went further than 10.1km or closer than 9.6km.

I pointed this out to the author and he made the change, I think it was with the KSP v1.2.2 compatible release, but somehow when I upgraded from KSP v1.1 or whatever I brought along the old configs with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E values all the same, and have been using them like that unknown until I realized it during the Mk3 or sometime around then.

A good question! Our response was in a different tweet and the answer is: no, that\u2019s not a lot and we have no idea yet. There are actually 109 different flyby combinations we are looking at and they all have to be plotted for each of the three year-long launch windows and for each window we are constraining them in three different ways. So that\u2019s nearly a thousand trajectories that need to be computed!

Given that we have no means of forcibly removing that many kerbs from the property, we simply let them be. As long as they did not seek to interfere with any KSA operations we saw no reason to restrict them. The government was notified by the Monolith project scientists and passed along a warning that the kerbs would be picked up and brought back to Umbarg if they did not leave on their own by Saturday. They\u2019re still out there, but again no attempts have been made to interfere with operations either here at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or at the Monolith site itself.

I know from my flight sim experience that dropping gear does induce drag, but this seemed excessive. I watched previous videos to see how much drag increased on gear drop and it was nowhere near as much as in the latest crash. Then I looked again and saw the prograde marker on the navball still off-center when the gear dropped and that would put the gear bay doors a bit broadside into the airstream. So yea, the crash was a real deal and a learning experience. I also do plan to rebuild the aircraft in the editor from the ground up \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E carefully because I\u2019m almost positive that roll issue is due to some way the craft is put together.

It\u2019s too bad kOS can\u2019t open a file properly so it throws the access errors, it was legit cool to just paste or type some code in an open text file, hit Save and watch it be executed by the rocket. Now I have to go back to just copying in files and renaming them. Lame. Still, I\u2019m really happy overall with the new boot architecture and it makes designing ascent scripts much easier now that I can just encapsulate various states in their own functions. In the future I hope to be able to code even more generic functions that can just be plugged in via separate files to create various ascent profiles and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to be careful this launch to remember to 1) reload the older booster specs and 2) re-pitch the launch base back to 85\u00B0. I got both and the first try the launch went off perfect. I still did a bunch of \u201Csims\u201D with my stand-up Mk5 slightly-altered version to ensure there were no syntax errors or obvious logical flaws that shouldn\u2019t have made it through what I would consider to be normal quality control for rocket code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also let the RNG have full control of the weather and was going to go with whatever it spat out. I use a RNG to determine values for cloud position, height and size. The weather the day cycle prior to launch and the day cycle of launch was determined by the RNG and that\u2019s the way it went. Even though the game doesn\u2019t actually simulate weather I do make sure to use real weather science when I talk about it. For instance mentioning the wind being out of the NNE the previous day would be from a high pressure area off the coast circulating the air clockwise while it is drawn south to the low-pressure storm system over Umbarg. Later the next day when that low-pressure storm system moved past \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E wind was from the SW as low-pressure systems move air counter-clockwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, yes the Civvie flight delay was due to me not feeling like I had the time to put it in. Also, I couldn\u2019t see how it would be worth the effort given a Mk5 launch looks the same as a Mk4 launch and I have plenty of videos of those already, even if they are only from the ground. The Block I burns longer in its first stage \u2013 not much of a difference but I guess it\u2019s enough for me to try to get some aerial footage of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EExtremis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ll talk more about the whole trajectories thing after I make the post about it in a few weeks.

The Civvie carries a nose camera as well but Flight Director Lanalye is not thrilled about flying an aircraft directly towards the launch zone.

The Minmus transit at the bottom was only a little over an hour so there is a 30 minute position included for that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2 style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-transits-complete-composite_23816461548_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00222017-transits-complete-composite_23816461548_o-1024x1024.png\u0022 height=\u0022520\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-transits-complete-composite_23816461548_o-1024x1024.png\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022520\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFrom the Desk of Drew Kerman \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003EOut of Character Behind the Scenes stuff)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWritten on 10/19/17\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was so ready to get this done on Tuesday just as I had predicted last week buuuut - meh.

Ok so I still haven\u0027t been able to launch off the Block I and see what it\u0027s capable of (other than a straight-upwards code check flight) so enough moping around and let\u0027s get a move on here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk5 Block I scrub\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI let the RNG take control of the weather again so what you saw was what I got - low clouds with lots of coverage the first day cycle attempt followed by low clouds but sparse coverage for the second. So yea things could have easily ended up clouded over again but the random numbers that rotate/pan/skew the cloud texture managed to put some mostly clear skies over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Again winds were taken by cloud movement, which changes depending on the x,y,z values for the cloud texture. I have justifiable wiggle room here though - even if no one would know other than me, I could make the surface winds a different direction than the winds aloft moving the clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kOS code switch from using staging events and action groups over to part actions was done so that I could be flying the Civvie past the pad while the rocket\u0027s kOS code was running for it to launch. When it\u0027s not the active vessel the stage and action group commands do not function, which makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was a bit on the fence about actually flying Jeb\u0027s mission - I mean it\u0027s not like I actually drive the UTVs around for KerBalloon missions. However in the end I decided they needed to be flown because, especially in this case where Jeb went into a holding pattern, the distances involved would otherwise be too arbitrary to properly calculate the way I can with UTV movements across the ground. Also I did want to challenge myself to try and hit the mark for launch. Still, it adds time and effort to the launch which is why I won\u0027t be doing it often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe booster anomaly was not how I originally wanted things to go. I did plan for the first stage booster to fail to ignite but the whole second stage thing was actually some emergent gameplay I felt I needed to follow. I will have a full explanation of what went \u0022wrong\u0022 in next week\u0027s Desk Notes so I don\u0027t spoil anything from over this weekend.

Why does this agency want a crew report from there? If it just looks like random nonsense (which, frankly, it is) then I will change the location and try to find interesting places to go. Either way I\u0027ve been putting more effort into coming up with good reasons for these missions, like the trip out to survey the extinct volcano and Val looking for \u0022whales\u0022 and the most recent mission seeking to determine if backcountry Civvie flying is feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThumbs up\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/Yn5gqG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elatest Jeb pose\u003C/a\u003E was pretty good, considering it was a composite of two poses:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Untitled-2.png\u0022 height=\u0022153\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Untitled-2.png\u0022 width=\u0022308\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPose 1 on left, Pose 2 in middle, composite pose right\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe angle of the camera was also purposely positioned so that his glove would contrast well with the wheel cover otherwise the thumbs up is hard to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP v1.3.1 revisit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I realized recently that I actually do need to install the new KSP version sooner rather than later since in order to plan my orbital program I need to have a look at all the parts I have to choose from, and I want to make sure I\u0027m doing it in an environment in which I\u0027ll actually be using them. This won\u0027t be so bad since part packs generally are version agnostic, at least the ones that have been updated to KSP v1.0, and those that do come with plugins generally don\u0027t affect the performance characteristics as viewed statically in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. In case anyone is wondering, this is where I use the tech tree. I don\u0027t unlock nodes with science, I convert science points into funds, but I do take note of how technologies are structured in the tree and proceed progressively. So looking for orbital engines I\u0027ll be mainly comparing various offerings out of one of the earlier rocketry tech tree nodes. I\u0027ll be honest that I haven\u0027t had much time to plan out the orbital program - it doesn\u0027t even have a name yet - one of the downsides to being so short on lead time.

As I explained last week I had intended for the booster to fail, but what I didn\u2019t intend was how the kOS code would handle the \u201Cfailure\u201D. To get the log output I ran the code and I just removed all the fuel from the first stage booster, which is why it actually activated but then read as \u201Cflamed-out!\u201D because there was no fuel. Originally I had written that the booster would fail, the count would be reset and tried again, still failed and the rocket would get rolled back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the ignitor replaced over the weekend and the launch re-tried on Monday. However I ended up liking the idea of the software failure much better because for one thing the problem was actually evident in the actual code I had uploaded to Github, plus it allowed me to expend the rocket and not have to do another launch so soon, which was great as I\u2019ve been so tight on time lately. Unfortunately I had already done some extra work in writing out the events that I had planned to follow the ignition failure plus I had to go back and edit down Jeb\u2019s Civvie mission because he wouldn\u2019t have been in the air nearly as long as if there had been a recycle of the countdown and a second try. I actually flew within sight of the pad for the first pass, but I just didn\u2019t have time to include any extra video \u2013 I was literally making these changes early on the day of the launch!!

First, I noticed the program pages were not actually directing you to the proper sub-section when a tab was clicked. Now, when I first built the site I noticed the twitter widget I embedded in each tab was not being re-sized to the width of the table column it was in except for the first one that was loaded with the page. The tab plugin I was using loaded all the tabs and let you switch quickly between them, but I forced it to reload the page everytime you clicked a tab so the twitter embed would size properly. Well, I figured out how to use my injected script to size all the embeds so I was able to switch the tab plugin back to being fully responsive and now if you visit, say the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?page_id=1839\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProgenitor page\u003C/a\u003E, you can click through tabs without having to reload the page. Yay!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother change I made was to reformat the timestamps in the smaller twitter embed widgets so they too would also show the tweet time, but because space was less than the collection embed shown on a full page I had to go with a different date format.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally I made it so every time the page loads each tweet has a random number of seconds assigned to it so they all don\u2019t show as being posted at :00 or :01 seconds after the minute. Thinking ahead to times I want to use the Flight Tracker\u2019s automated tweet ability to send out scheduled tweets to the second during launches, I made it so certain minutes are ignored when the random seconds are generated so these events will remain accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOps Tracker work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHead on over to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Tracker/tracker.asp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOps Tracker\u003C/a\u003E and click through things in the menu. You can now select a vessel, crew member or body and the interface will adjust itself accordingly to display that information. You can still currently only view bodies but the groundwork is now laid for me to begin working on loading and displaying vessel and crew information as well. I think it\u2019s pretty slick how things re-organize themselves (oops, crew view is actually a bit broke right now). Also the GeoGebra 3D model is fully functional now \u2013 I refactored how it was managing the various orbital elements on display and you can do things like click on a planet, select to show its nodes and then if you check the Show Nodes option at the bottom of the figure all the nodes will show and if you uncheck it all the nodes will hide but the ones you explicitly set to show through the planet info box. Head over to Kerbin to see a dynamic orbit display for the one currently captured asteroid. Click on the orbit itself to show its name and nodes \u2013 again doing this will keep them visible regardless of the global display options at the bottom. You can also hide the whole orbit using the filters on the bottom right. Clicking on the dot for the vessel\u2019s position will switch you over to view its vessel page.

Not to mention I had to make some weather changes which required a restart of the game to take effect. I have a pretty beefy machine but I still jack the game graphics way up to a higher level of terrain detail and ground scatter distance rendering so that loading into the flight scene takes a good while and FPS while in the flight scene is very low. It was doubly-time-consuming for the two photos of KGA because the terrain scatter spawns in and around the airport statics, so I have to take a photo without ground scatter, restart the game and take another with ground scatter, then layer them and edit out the trees on the airport and on the approach paths.

Everyone was very happy with how this recent flight went despite introducing two new issues that affected the ascent. First we had the second stage fins explode at the same time the stage was decoupled rather than one second afterwards and then during the third stage throttle-up it refused to go past 76%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first issue could have numerous origins and all are currently being looked into but the second issue was fairly straightforward to figure out once we got a good look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17ngtEv4kFBLV8C3zhTbiQ55hqNX_ZK3Ufx-nv3YVdao/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etelemetry data\u003C/a\u003E from the flight. The throttle stopped increasing the moment the rocket reached the edge of the atmosphere, which led engineers to look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/AFCS/blob/5093acb985da493ff0de2e17e6dc0541e26305e1/Progeny%20Mk5%20Ops/ascent.ks#L249\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe code\u003C/a\u003E for this stage of the flight and there is where the issue was: once space was reached pressure was 0 and it could never be more or less than that so the code stopped increasing the throttle. We had not anticipated the throttle-up occurring while the rocket was outside of the atmosphere \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t have if the second stage decoupling issue hadn\u2019t put enough precession into the third stage to trigger the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E constraint and allow the launch team to wait so long before triggering the final booster. The throttle eventually reached 100% as the rocket fell through the atmosphere during re-entry which is why the third stage boost termination message came so late in the operations log (included with telemetry data).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem solved, one to go \u2013 but further investigation has been hampered by an issue with our High Data-Rate Logger, which is a separate dedicated monitoring instrument that stores vessel parameters at 0.25s intervals, 4x faster than the normal logger that runs with the AFCS (so that more attention can be dedicated to operating the rocket). It seems the data storage disk was formatted improperly so reading the data has become a tedious recovery task (this is why you don\u2019t see the high-resolution graph atop the telemetry data).

The Civvie had been modified to allow the computer to actuate the various control surfaces, fitted with extra sensors and C7 engineers programmed a series of very basic tests to ensure the computer could make the aircraft roll, yaw and change its pitch to all extents. Jeb said it was definitely weird to be sitting in the cockpit watching the control yoke move and the aircraft bank and have to resist the urge to grab it and bring the wings back level. The tests were all successful and C7 hoped to have a simple PID controller ready to attempt to hold wings and pitch level on the next flight but difficulties with the program forced them to remain in the lab working on the code. The ultimate goal of course if a full autopilot capable of flying the aircraft on a preset course but for now both Jeb and Val agree they would love to just have a means of keeping the wings and nose level without constant minor control inputs and attentiveness from them.

Thankfully it turned out that I still had the thrust in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E set to like 48% whereas the thrust curve was set to like 46% so the actual thrust output was like 2% \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize the thrust curve obeyed the thrust setting in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I thought it always assumed 100% thrust.

Fortunately in this case I the problem wasn\u2019t a game crasher and I could react to the flight issues the first time and then just do it again that way for subsequent tries.

I think it may be because I\u2019m using too many data points to give enough charting time for a mission that can last as long as 20 minutes.

I don\u2019t run \u201Csimulations\u201D in the game where I throw things out to the pad and see whether they behave the way I want them to for things like this. So yea, the launch could have had a MaxQ greater than 80kPa I had no idea for sure until I actually launched the rocket. See, a lot of people may think that the things that happen to cause my rocket development to meander about is done on purpose for the sake of \u201Cstory\u201D but the reality is that I really could have better rockets by now if I actually knew better what the hell I was doing \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But that\u2019s something I purposely want, because as time goes on my rocket programs will naturally begin to improve.

I like that, because I\u2019m actually doing investigations using the data I\u2019ve collected to help me determine what went wrong and why.

Thankfully due to the operations shut down last week not many kerbs remained at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the center was cleared within 15 minutes although no large waves ended up appearing. In the days since we\u2019ve learned that a merchant vessel has been reported missing and could have been in the vicinity of the asteroid explosion, which must have happened higher up than originally feared but could have still produced a deadly shock-wave for anything in the immediate area.

I\u2019ve already made or plan to make the changes necessary so that compiling end of year data for 2018 will be even quicker. Now that this last week of operations is over I can blaze through the next week, which will manly consist of keeping tabs on asteroids and still watching for any cool celestial happenings to photograph for when ops resume in 2018. I really, really \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E want my 3-week lead time back so that is going to be priority over the Ops Tracker but I still also hope to have that ready to deploy with real-time telemetry streaming for the first launch of 2018.

It didn\u2019t help also that there was two bad plots in there I hadn\u2019t ever realized were formatted wrong causing the entire group to not load. Regardless, I couldn\u2019t just put them all on the map at once I had to do it in batches, so I had to be smart about it and use one of the URL parameters to center the map on a set of coordinates so that as I changed out the plots the map position would always be the same. Fortunately at the time I was doing this the map service was down, leaving me with just plots on a gray background. Perfect!! I took screenshots of 3 separate groups of plots then removed the gray to leave only the lines. About this time the map tiles began loading again so I just overlaid them all on a bare map in Paint.NET. et viola!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESeeking accurate orbital propagation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe troubles with long-term predictions of Kerbin\u2019s moonlets isn\u2019t some plot device I have devised, it\u2019s a real problem I\u2019m having when using KSPTOT. Something about the way KSPTOT handles precision or the game handles precision or the way the game loads in orbital data for vessels or the way KSPTOT loads data for vessels or the way the game integrates the orbits or the way KSPTOT integrates the orbits \u2013 \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E is off and I\u2019m still not sure what it is but the experiments continue and I\u2019m working closely with the KSPTOT author to figure it all out.
