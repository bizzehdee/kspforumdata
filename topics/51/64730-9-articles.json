If you look closely you\u0027ll see that the burn happens to occur almost directly over the KSC, making it one complete orbit before leaving for the Mun. With 7 powerful engines the burn will only take 53 seconds despite the fuel being carried. Coasting out to the Mun is uneventful and upon arriving in high Mun space a crew report can be taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TFg8Nj6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TFg8Nj6.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/flf3E5a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022flf3E5a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the ship enters low space and prepares to make a capture burn some more science is done. Passing over the Midlands, Highlands and Highland Craters the 3 kerbals record Crew Reports and take gravity readings. There are 2 GravMax instruments mounted to the big transit stage. Each one is keyed to a different action group that also triggers a crew report. This way two different biomes can be captured in quick succession before having to go through the process of transfering data from the instrument into the command pod to make it ready for another reading. The capture burn provides about 600em from the engine\u0027s alternator, it\u0027s not very useful since I am running well within my safety margin and the batteries being charged will be discarded soon. Capture occurs just slightly north of the twin craters, the orbit missing them so I couldn\u0027t take readings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Tmz75Os.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Tmz75Os.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship begins an orbit of the Mun, collecting information on all the biomes along the equator.

An action group brings all the batteries on the lander stage online and then power is pulled from some of the transit batteries to top up the capsules own power supply. With all preparation complete the transit stage is used to brake from orbit. It was planned that the transit stage would provide at least 200-300 m/s for the descent (though the lander was designed with just enough dV to make the descent, ascent and return on its own) in order to ensure that its batteries would be attached up until that point (if any of the landers fuel was required for the Mun capture it would mean discarding the transit batteries at that point). With fuel saved up to this point the transit stage is able to completely brake from orbit with 50L of fuel left, so the lander only need to concern itself with a soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1NcvHNX.png\u0022 alt=\u00221NcvHNX.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DZ2Uggu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DZ2Uggu.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LT95AA5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LT95AA5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk1-2 lacks landing radar (well there is an indicator in the cockpit I think) but I used to landing by sight anyway.

With PreciseNode allowing me to discreetly set the maneuver node time and magnitude I wanted to try something I haven\u0027t done before, doing a Mun return with a single burn instead of two. Normally I\u0027d perform two burns, the first one would be to exit Mun orbit and enter a Kerbin orbit with a relatively low PE (ideally one of several hundred km but before PreciseNode it might be in the 1-2 million km range). The second burn would be carried out after leaving the Mun\u0027s SOI to immediately lower the PE to the precise altitude I want for reentry. However in this case I plotted for a direct return with a single burn. I\u0027m going to see if I can get home without any additional burns or RCS adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ON2NLjQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ON2NLjQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Md1sPGd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Md1sPGd.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GIz7jFQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GIz7jFQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis goes well. I slow down time warp until I hit 1x as the ship is passing out of the Mun\u0027s SOI. This is to keep my reentry PE on track since passing between areas of influnce at high warp can through off orbits. This is because at high warp you are performing calculations for a longer time steps - if my velocity is x and position is y and acceleration due to gravity is z, where will I be in 10 minutes. If you are just about to cross into another SOI (where acceleration due to gravity will suddenly change) then some of that 10 minutes will have been calculated with the wrong value. As it is my PE stays within 78m of it\u0027s original value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproaching Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere with plenty of power and life support (and 680 m/s of delta-v in the tanks) the pods battery is filled up again from external batteries in preparation for seperation. The lander is oriented around to face tail first and at 60km the pod seperates and uses RCS to push away, first upward and then laterally to put the return pod on a different return vector to the lander stage. RCS and SAS are then used to keep the pod oriented (it should orient properly due to weight but using RCS prevents it from swaying which could expose parts to deadly reentry forces).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1XmU60l.png\u0022 alt=\u00221XmU60l.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x5xILw5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022x5xILw5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hpWKajN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hpWKajN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pod safely splashes down at 12:49:56 off the coast of the westward continent, the crew and their cargo is quickly recovered.

His route involves performing an Kerbin escape velocity burn that intersects Minmus and then braking before you are flung out into deep space. That part adds about 400 m/s to my budget (yes he did it for less but I\u0027ve never flown that path before and I\u0027m using some other screenshots to determine a min/max requirement to reach and capture at Minmus using that approach). For that I need a 13 hour budget of power, plus a budget for orbit, landing and asscent/orbit (1-2 hours). Getting back Poddster is using a big burn (budget 600 m/s) that uses a radial push to encounter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere on a direct line from the return instead of a more gentle pass around the back of Kerbin. Time budget of about 18-22 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transit stage would be stripped of the older batteries and replaced with a single 360 battery to top off each engine assembly (7 in total) just below the decoupler. The lander would require more extensive modifications. After stripping the old batteries the center fuel tank would be halfed - the center T400 tank would be replaced with a T200 tank and 4 \u0027360\u0027 batteries. All 7 engine stacks would then receive 3 more batteries (7 total in the center now) and the outer 6 stacks would recieve one of the tiny 360 Core batteries. These modifications would ensure that the launch weight remains within a margin of error for the boosters and transit stage. The lander itself is heavier and carries less fuel, losing 20% of its delta-v, but the requirements are less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I would rerun all of those calculations before actually flying the mission, but it would have enough fuel to make at least one landing (a second hop should be possible if it was short, but the fuel requirements for the return dictate that it would be safer to do a single landing only).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T21:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGamow 2\u003C/strong\u003E (part 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGamow has been modified for the run to Minmus I described. The principle changes are upgrading the battery technology and moving some of the battery capacity to the lander segment. The reason for this is the inverse for why it was on the transit portion in the first place. For the Mun I fully intended the transit stage to remain with the ship right up to descent. Fuel was budgeted to ensure this (resulting in most of Gamow 1\u0027s descent being powered by the transit engines) and the batteries placed on that segment where designed to cover all the power needed (including budgeted safety margins) up until descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGamow 2 needs to work in the opposite manner. First I need every drop of power I can get, so throwing away any power with the transit stage is unacceptable. Second is that I\u0027m not 100% sure about the delta-v requirements - I\u0027ve been forced to consider the outcome of several scenarios where I am short on fuel and how to deal with them. The first scenario is if I get into Kerbin orbit and find out the injection burn maneuver exceeds the delta-v in the transit stage. In that event I can simply abort the mission without doing the burn, returning safely to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second and third scenario are closely linked. After safely passing the first hurdle I should be on my way to a Minmus intercept with the transist stage attached. Executing the capture burn I might run out of fuel in the transit stage, forcing me to use the lander engines to capture (and avoid flying off into deep space or on a long orbit that exceeds the life support limit). This is the main reason the transit batteries are engineered to run out before actually reaching Minmus. If I\u0027m forced to use the lander to capture I\u0027ll still have the power I need to return safely to Kerbin - I would simply skip the landing which should be enough to cancel out whatever delta-v was lost in the capture. The last scenario would be if I landed but didn\u0027t have enough fuel to return all the way to Kerbin (or couldn\u0027t return fast enough since getting there fast involves burning much more fuel). I want to avoid that scenario entirely by knowing the go/no go point. The lander alone slightly exceeds the delta-v requirements (including safety margins) to land, ascend and return. So if I can enter Minmus orbit with the transit stage still attached I am definitely a go. If I capture but have wasted more then a token amount of the landers fuel then I\u0027m a no go and need to abort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of construction I did underestimate the height of the upgraded batteries a bit. I had estimated that 4 batteries would be about the height of a T200 tank but with was more like 3. To keep the shape I wanted I moved one center battery from below the capsule on the lander stage to the top of the capture near the parachute. Otherwise the changes where stretching the ladder and adding some science instruments. I did perform a pad test to verify that I could move the camera around enough to select the center battery of the transit stage - this was combined with some calculations of how the batteries would drain since I wasn\u0027t using the deactivated battery method I used in the first flight. Instead I checked to ensure that enough power would have drained from the landers outer batteries that I could transfer the remainder from the transit stage up there when the time was right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I need to stretch the life support consumables I can\u0027t carry 3 kerbals. With the mission risks involved I decide to carry just one, Barrigh. It should even out the number of missions everyone has done (1 solo, 1 group) and he\u0027s really the only one to trust to take a ship out alone so I put him in the pilot\u0027s chair with the other seats empty. The launch goes fairly well - I did have some minor issues with RCS attitude control that wasted a little fuel since I wasn\u0027t burn a bit up when I should have been burning purely sideways for orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LwTizAF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LwTizAF.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mgG07Am.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mgG07Am.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4XRmpmu.png\u0022 alt=\u00224XRmpmu.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eU58K8a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eU58K8a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a 1050 m/s burn to Minmus.

I start by shifting some power around in the lander to leave a single nearly empty battery. This way I only need to perform the camera gymnastics needed to reach the center transit battery once - I transfer all remaining charge from that center battery to the one I emptied out. The other 6 cells are then then drained into sequence, their charge distributed between the 3\u002B1 batteries above them on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Esbxri9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Esbxri9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AQi079V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AQi079V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at Minmus some high orbit data is taken; in addition to the crew report I have a 2Hot to take readings with. I didn\u0027t bring along Goo containers since I didn\u0027t have the weight budget for them. However I do have an issue, the capture burn will cost just over 800 m/s, more then I had budgeted for. Now at this point I had extra fuel by burning under budget for the injection but I had some small unknowns from the launch. Without calculating my exact fuel cost the burn time and fuel left in the tank made it look close. It was good that this was one of the scenarios I had planned for so I was still confident I could bring Barrigh home safely even if the mission couldn\u0027t complete its objectives. I started the burn with a very close eye on my fuel supply. My estimate based on the burn time seemed to be panning out, fuel and delta-v markers where draining at about the same rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZzwfxC2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZzwfxC2.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G7R7omi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G7R7omi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately it wasn\u0027t enough though - the transit stage was exhausted with 58 m/s left to burn. Since this was planned with the battery strategy it was safe to stage and use the lander engines to complete the burn. The lander safely made orbit with 95.6% of it\u0027s fuel reserves. The transit stage (well really 7 seperate engine assemblies) where now on an escape trajectory from Minmus. Since I was close to the end of the burn I have a feeling they where put into Kerbin orbit albeit a high one. Kerbin astronomers will need to track them down. This does end my streak of leaving no junk around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tyQbOZQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tyQbOZQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xtyDKfH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xtyDKfH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T02:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGamow 2\u003C/strong\u003E (Part 2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in orbit (it\u0027s a bit inclined and it\u0027s retrograde since that\u0027s how we came in, but there is no docking so it\u0027s not a problem) we can take some readings, though I actually have to wait until the ship passes below 30km into \u0022low orbit\u0022.

During the pass around the dark side I collect crew reports on a number of places, in particular the Great Flats, Lesser Flats and thanks to the inclination the Flats are also found right beside the Lesser Flats. Getting good shots is another matter. A long while back I switched to XVID encoding to improve the capture quality of darker scenes over MJPEG. However it was really dark and apparently dark green doesn\u0027t compress very well. Even before I adjusted the contrast the images where filled with obvious compression artifacts.

That\u0027s close to my safety margin, if I go over on the return burn I could really use that fuel to get home safely. I look around to get an idea of how far away those slopes are (the darker portion near the bottom, the little object is the lander). If I had jets for my space suits it might be just within range for an EVA to run over there and take a sample. Walking it\u0027s too far to risk. I could fly the lander over there but I can\u0027t reasonably land on the slope so it would be a matter of landing close and hoping I could reach the part that registers as \u0027slope\u0027 biome by foot. Ultimately I decide it\u0027s not worth the risk - I haven\u0027t used this return path before so I\u0027m very iffy on the fuel use. This mission was planned for a single landing (I\u0027ve already exceeded my science objectives by cover 2 more biomes from low orbit then scheduled) so I\u0027ll stick with that even if it loses 150 science. The science I have in the lander is already past the amount estimated as the requirement to do the next mission. So we launch back into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6yQuXOg.png\u0022 alt=\u00226yQuXOg.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U0YDSxm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022U0YDSxm.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Orr9CA9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Orr9CA9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in orbit (this time a normal equatorial one thanks to a lander close to the equator and a easterly launch) the return burn is calculated. To get one that appears right I need to apply a lot of prograde thrust, 500 m/s, combined with radial and normal adjustments to place me on a return to Kerbin. The final result is a 527 m/s burn that will return me to Kerbin in 18.5 hours on a retro-grade approach (I\u0027ll fine tune the PE enroute). This will leave me with a healthy supply of fuel - in hind sight I could have flown to another biome but I had no way of knowing for sure I\u0027d have that fuel so I stuck with the safety margin. In future I\u0027ll have a better idea of the fuel requirements for this kind of run. The return burn will take me close to the surface, 7 km over a large ridge. However the burn time is low, estimate is 46 seconds, so I\u0027m not worried about a collision. Because the center fuel tank has less fuel I need to factor that into the burn time though it\u0027s not very hard - a 1/7th loss of thrust midway through a 46 second burn will throw off the burn time by an amount almost too small to correct for. I start the burn 3 seconds early (T-26s) to account for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8VUU8IW.png\u0022 alt=\u00228VUU8IW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F1DoruT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F1DoruT.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i5Og3x1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i5Og3x1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dV2Z6U5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dV2Z6U5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn is successful and the lander safely passes well above the ridge and back toward Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7tLJmsC.png\u0022 alt=\u00227tLJmsC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return brings the ship on a retrograde encounter with Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.

Assuming I keep the same launch weight this platform should provide all the delta-v needed to reach and brake at Eve. Including the heatshield and any other addons I make I have a healthy budget of 20 tons. The probe is mostly batteries. With Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere I won\u0027t need many parachutes (my previous Eve lander had many parachutes because it was a design intended to land on Duna too). The old \u0027lander\u0027 portion is now a second orbital stage.

One was that I was already very close to it in my orbit and so I really started burn far too late. I also didn\u0027t really have enough fuel to completely stop over the target, I misjudged my orbital velocity (going much faster over Eve compared to the Mun or Minmus) and really should have been aiming for a longer approach. Realizing this I stopped my burn before my descent path came too close to one of Eve\u0027s smaller seas. You can see the dimple to the left of the sea and my descent which is going to be to the right of it.

There are some parts which I don\u0027t have unlocked however: in addition to the ion engines I don\u0027t have fuel lines, advanced batteries or inflatable heatshield. I also don\u0027t have the final set of probe cores, the retractable solar panels or cubic struts for mounting things in odd places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BcSKPB0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BcSKPB0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YwbNnYv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YwbNnYv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince my best probe core consumes 2 em/min I\u0027ll need to carry 2 reactors with me to Laythe orbit and back to Kerbin. No fuel lines means that staging will need to be simple. Design a lander/return craft that can reach Laythe orbit is also challenging due to the parts - the extra large heatshield is still not as big as the inflatable heatshield and that greatly limits how wide a ship I can land. I may need to try an orbital drop test to see if small diameter parts can be radially mounted to other small parts and still be considered inside the shield. Visually it looks like they are a bit over the edge but I\u0027ve found the heatshield mechanics might not be based on that.

There is a small issue of it being in a retrograde orbit so I need to launch in the opposite direction. All of the landing equipment is dropped as soon as the probe takes off. I had considered several engine configurations for the probe but using the large tank I found only two real options, the Poodle or the 8 radial rockomax engines.

It\u0027s draining really fast. I\u0027m basing my ascent profile on how I launch from Kerbin but referencing the atmosphere scale instead of the altitude reading since the atmosphere on Laythe is lower. As I reach the start of the gravity turn the fuel tank is almost half empty which is not good. I thought I had a good idea for the delta-v requirements - 2800 m/s min and 3200 m/s for safety. While the atmosphere makes it hard to determine my average ISP during the ascent I was expecting about 3000 m/s (worst case burning at the surface the ship would have over 2750 m/s unless Laythe ISP is even lower then Kerbin). Maybe it was my ascent profile (it didn\u0027t look good at the circulization point where I had to spend 782 m/s) and maybe it was because I was going into a retrograde orbit where I was losing out on the free velocity from the moon\u0027s rotation but I barely made it into orbit. I entered a 55 x 71km orbit and when I looked I had 0.67 L of fuel left in the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V6kHRlv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022V6kHRlv.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wYUQHN8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wYUQHN8.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z8rrQTP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z8rrQTP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only two things going for me. The first is that for the moment I have plenty of power which means I have some time (about 5 hours in the current configuration). And second I made it into orbit with very little RCS used, I relied on the excessive amount of thrust vectoring I had at my disposal for everything but lining up the circulization burn. You see the original flight plan was to enter orbit and rendezvous with the transit section. That section would be dead in space since it doesn\u0027t have a probe core which means that any little bump will send it into an uncontrolled spin. To dock when in RCS range the little top part of the probe would detach and move in. It\u0027s light weight would make docking easy and it carries it\u0027s own 40 minute power supply in addition to all the RCS gear, science instruments and probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the probe almost out of fuel the plan changes. I\u0027ll need to seperate much earlier so I can use the RCS thrusters as my primary engine. With just the docking segment I\u0027ll have almost 300 m/s of delta-v to work with which I\u0027ll need in order to cover the inclination difference. KSP .23.5 introduced a feature with manuever nodes that lets you place them one or more orbits into the future. I used that to peek ahead and find that if I waited 2 orbits I would have an opportunity to setup a close encounter of about 8 km right at the point where the 2 orbits crossed each other (descending node). It\u0027s a cheap maneuver at just 4.6 m/s so it\u0027s ideal for my purposes. Prior to executing it I charged up the batteries on the docking segment so that I could seperate - at this point I was assuming that I\u0027d need RCS to complete some of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rsmn1TP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Rsmn1TP.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PME81NR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PME81NR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately I got really lucky. The fuel was enough to complete the course change with 0.08 L now remaining in the tank, about 0.5 m/s based on the previous performance. At this point the liquid engine is useless but by completing the entire burn with it I still have the battery (in hind sight I should have really planned to complete the entire burn with the full probe attached even if it would have wasted RCS, as battery power was the more essential resource at that specific point). Approaching the closest encounter point I charged the docking batteries again, this time locking down both of them so that only the probes battery was being drained. This way I could keep that battery charged right up until the moment of seperation. The docking section seperates leaving the ascent body behind and executing a 129 m/s burn with RCS thrusters to zero out the relative velocity (roughly matching orbit and inclination) and bringing me down to 30 L of monopropellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hFRHE7p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hFRHE7p.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bGyRzxE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bGyRzxE.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YpWd3Hu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YpWd3Hu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here I start a series of burns to try and quickly bring the docking section to the transit section. I don\u0027t want to burn too hard as any speed I add (change of orbit) will have to be undone to dock. Instead each small burn puts me about 2-3 minutes away from my next close encounter where I roughly half the distance each time. 15 minutes after seperating I am within 150m of the transit section. I\u0027m approaching from behind (in relation to its docking port) so I\u0027m going to need to pass it and turn around to dock - the transit stage is inert so it can\u0027t turn to face the probe.

However I\u0027m not sure it would work and from my low orbit I was concerned I could hit the atmosphere so I made a simple burn to exit Laythe\u0027s orbit and make the return to Kerbin from around Jool. With so much weight shed the ship can now turn easily on RCS, speaking of which I transfered the remaining RCS from the 6 tanks hidden in the center (visible in part 1 in the rear shots) to the probe\u0027s own tank to refill it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rUIaHn1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rUIaHn1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut in Jool orbit I found that I couldn\u0027t burn directly to Kerbin either, as my orbit was going to reencounter Laythe around the time I needed to burn.

Once it reaches an acceptable height ground control commands it to start turning toward the mountains but the turn stalls part way through, it\u0027s still climbing but not turning. It seems the fins only work when there is enough air around and as Bester 1 climbed the air became too thin. Since we don\u0027t have control over its direction anymore the engines are throttled down and the probe is left to coast. As it travels westward information about gravity is recorded as it passes over the grasslands and into the highlands, then the mountains. Here it reaches the highest point yet reached by a probe and checks the temperature to see if it keeps getting colder the higher you go. After that the probe begins descending down toward and past the western shore. As the air thickens it seems to heat up and the probe begins to crack at the strain, breaking up over the water before it can make any determinations about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/myAa1QI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022myAa1QI.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xsk7IMY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xsk7IMY.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WM1iYRZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WM1iYRZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q5lMqxL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q5lMqxL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBester 1 earns 108 science and unlocks Survivability, Flight Control and General Construction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBester 2 attempts to correct the issues of Bester 1. First a new tiny engine using a fuel that can be ignited in small bursts is added in a set of clusters called a reaction control system that will allow the ship to turn or rotate even without air. The second improvement is an inovation to counter the ballooning mass of the probes (Bester 1 is fifteen times the mass of Asimov 1) - rather then send the whole probe up an explosive charge can seperate a small part of it. After lifting off the RCS system assists in turning the ship even when the fins become useless and when fuel runs out on the first stage the second stage seperates into its own ship to carry on the journey on a course that traces the curve of Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NH8CXcE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NH8CXcE.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iD0AmnY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iD0AmnY.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rp0IeIt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rp0IeIt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second burn in space to keep following the terrain has the effect of putting the ship into \u0027orbit\u0027.

This will be very useful and the ship can now coast without any additional thrust, passing over the north pole\u0027s ice caps and surrounding tundra before coming out above the ocean on the other side of the planet and continuing down toward the south pole. The planet is also rotating beneath the ship, so by the time Bester 2 gets back to the point where it launched it is now above a desert on the western continent instead. With lots of interesting data collected the probe is commanded to try and stop.
