No kerbal has attempted this before. No Kerbal has even dared speak of the heavens out of fear that the space Kracken might swoop down and send you flying off at the speed of light. But no folklore could stop these three men. They are considered the manliest of men with there manly names, Bill Bob and Jedediah. Like Most manly men, they strap them selves to ton upon ton of explosive power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The rocket, named the Ground Hog, was a prototype rocket designed in less than 5 seconds and strapped together with duct tape. Don\u0027t let the Name fool ya because this thing is not afraid of its shadow. With three aerospike boosters and a mainsail engine this thing can pack power. enough power to get to Low Kerbin Orbit (LKO). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3...2...1...ROAR the Ground Hog roars to life blasting metric tone by metric tone of propellent into sizzling fire, sauteing anything unfortunate enough to be placed under the engines. \u0022T\u002B1...2...3...Cleared the tower\u0022 said the Capcom. A sigh of relief floods Bill and Bob with the thought that they are moving in the right direction. Jeb however is always happy and lacks self preservation so there is no need for relief from a non existent stress. \u0022One Minute\u0022 calls out a controller at KSC. Jeb starts preparing for the staging of the Aerospike rocket boosters (ARB\u0027s). He has to jettison them just right. If he ejects them improperly, one of the boosters could swing back and destroy the still operating Mainsail Engine. \u0022Booster separation in 3...2...1\u0022. Bill and Bob close their eyes and cross their fingers inside of their gloves, praying that Jeb knows what he is doing. (their \u0022gloves\u0022 are actually mittens attached to the rest of their suit so that makes crossing fingers a lot harder). \u0022JETTISON\u0022,shouted a KSC Capcom controller. almost immediately Jeb Ejected the boosters and a resulting roar from the ejection charge and the separation motors momentarily dwarf the sound of the Main engine. Yet another sigh of releif comes from Bill and Bob. Even though the couldn\u0027t see Jeb they knew he was still smiling in that way he always does. Suddenly, Bill and Bob\u0027s joyus sence of fearlessness was broken by the words of the capcom. \u0022Stage 1 ejection in 3...2...1\u0022. Another Big jolt shock the vehicle as a massive ejection charge ignighted. Simutainiously, the second stage engine ignighted throwing all 3 explorers back into their seats. Bob looked at the altimeter in front of him. He had a hard time reading it due to the massive vibrations due to the major acoustic output of the rocket engine but he could just make out a 69. \u002269 kilometers up\u0022 thought Bob\u0022. \u0022we are in space\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Once again in the midst of their joy, stress came in the form of a fuel level indicator. \u0022Uhh KSC\u0022 said Bob \u0022we uhh have a LFL (low fuel light)\u0022. THe only have 30 seconds of fuel left. 5 seconds less than the ship needed to get to orbit. The radio came with the emotionless Capcom,\u0022it could be a faulty reading\u0022. \u0022Lets hope so\u0022 said Bob said with a bit of relief. The computer still was giving a count down. But 25 seconds later the engine stopped running. \u0022Darnit\u0022 said Bill and Bob. \u0022If we don\u0027t fix this problem by the Apoapsis we must abort\u0022said Bob. Mean while the very calm and happy voice of Jeb suggested \u0022Let me try tapping into the reserves for the extra fuel to circularize our orbit\u0022. \u0022How long will you think it will take to do that?\u0022 said Bob. \u0022about 40 seconds\u0022 replied Jeb. \u0022you gotta do it in thirty or I will have to abort\u0022. said Bill. Sounds of clicking on the ship computer was al that you could hear between the starving engine and the nervous silence of Bill and Bob. This silence was broken when Bill called out \u00225 seconds to APP) Jeb was still typing at the computer trying to tap into the reserve de-orbiting fuel. 3...2...1... right at zero jeb hit one final button and the engine roared to life. the burn was done and they where in an orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After a couple Hours orbiting they de-orbited and landed at KSC, thus proving the Kracken is dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis was a dramatacizesd account of a mission I actually did in KSP \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECHAPTER2 A lander to Duna.
