Waiting gave time for certain mods I need to have been updated. Some of these mods I need because I use them a lot (such as Kerbal Alarm Clock). Other mods I need even though I don\u0027t use them much (such as Protractor) just because I have parts from those mods on various ships, and the save file won\u0027t open with all the ships intact if I don\u0027t have that mod installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, the much-loved-by-me Maneuver Node Improvement mod is apparently not being developed any more, so I have installed the PreciseNode mod, which has similar functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI experimented with the new version of the tweakable heavy-duty landing legs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 It appears that they will work fine in the \u0022suspension locked\u0022 setting for keeping my GasStations, etc., at the proper height. There is a problem with their damage resistance, however. The old heavy-duty legs could take landing speeds of 10 m/s, so many of my ships were designed with the appropriate number of parachutes, etc., to land them at 7 to 8 m/s or so, but that will break the newer legs. Simply having girders or I-beams extended downward as landing legs works fine for taking up a high impact shock, but the disadvantage there is that they can\u0027t be folded away\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 so you either have to live with permanently extended landing structures sticking out and being in the way, or permanently extended landing structures that don\u0027t stick out so far (so as not to be in the way) but which are less stable because of narrower leg span.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought a compromise solution where girders stick straight back far enough to protect engine nozzles from hard landings, and foldable landing legs mounted on those girders at a height such that they will not fully compress before the girders take up the remaining shock (and still be there to give a wider stability base), would work well\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but it does not. This configuration still results in the landing legs breaking at high landing speeds. Apparently the program just looks at how hard the parts hit the ground, and not the actual forces involved (so that the legs break even if they only have to compress a little way before the girders take up the impact force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 landing more slowly is in order. More parachutes, and some engine breaking, will be required on some of the landing bases, etc., designs that I\u0027ve used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI updated the save game file to use the new version of the landing legs, but that means that my various bases and GasStations on Laythe would appear with their landing legs folded (since KSP does not check to see what the previous state of the landing legs was when it replaces the old legs with the new modules), resulting in the ships crashing to the ground and (in many cases) either breaking parts or falling over. This required using HyperEdit to move some of those ships into orbit before the upgrade, and then using it to place them back into their original locations on the ground. Tedious tweaking, but now done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I experimented with the RAPIER engine (because who can resist playing with new toys) to make a RAPIER version of the spaceplane to send to Laythe. The test results look very promising, and they certainly seem to make spaceplanes easier. But I have read some people saying that other changes to the program have made SSTO spaceplanes easier, and it\u0027s not really the RAPIERs that are responsible. So I\u0027ll be able to test this by doing comparison flights of the two versions on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I ran into a problem with MechJeb, which I\u0027m currently stuck trying to figure out. I hadn\u0027t noticed any problems at first, since I was doing things like landing leg tests and spaceplane tests that I don\u0027t use MechJeb for, but when I got to doing some more tedious things (like sending more stuff into orbit on Reusable Rockets) I ran into a problem where MechJeb no longer seems to be able to keep the rocket pointed correctly. On boost, the Reusable Rocket will start spinning, and then wander off course (even though I can control it manually there just fine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6so it has plenty of control authority). And when I\u0027m maneuvering a ship in orbit and tell MechJeb to point to a maneuver node I\u0027ve set up, it will randomly flail around trying to aim the ship as if it was feeling for the proper direction with a blind man\u0027s white cane. So I have to work this out, or die of tedium handling routine things manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also running into the problem where right-clicking on a part of ship will not bring up the menu of things you can do with that part (such as changing the landing leg settings or setting control to a certain part). I often have to click multiple times to get the menu to appear. I don\u0027t know if this is a KSP problem, or some problem with the combination of mods I have installed. So I guess I\u0027m going to have to run that down as well (starting with a clean install and adding mods one at a time to see where the problem is). It\u0027s a problem I could get by with, but it makes playing the game more frustrating, and could result in the loss of a ship if I get into a situation where I have to quickly activate parts with right-clicks and can\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the GasStation on Aldner Island stands tall on the new version landing legs. This one was easy to fix because it\u0027s by itself (with only a flag near it), so a little use of Hack Gravity allowed it to stand up again when deploying its legs in the new version (just trying to deploy the legs would result on one of them spearing into the ground and getting stuck).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JnK23Vy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JnK23Vy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T18:55:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AppleDavidJeans","CreatedById":84275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T20:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom Part 22\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe spaceplane went through the entry flames as it approached Dansen island (no radio control was possible when it was enveloped in plasma...it was on autopilot for that stretch).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a way around that, or so I\u0027d imagine because of irl aerodynamics and stuff. Back in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo days, the crew went through a radio blackout due to the ionization effects.

So, I conclude that the program simply looks at how FAST the legs are hitting to determine if they break, and not looking at how much impact force they are actually being asked to absorb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway...back to launching payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T19:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy tests with the RAPIER had it running in air breathing mode while the intake air in the Resources read zero...for a long time.
