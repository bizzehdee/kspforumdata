It\u0027s been nearly a month into the mission report/save game, and I have already learned sooo much about KSP and doing things that I personally used to believe were incredibly hard. It\u0027s just been wonderful.\n\nI know I haven\u0027t received a lot of feedback on this, but even the small amounts of support I\u0027ve gotten (including becoming *Thread of the Month!* Wow!) kept me inspired and just made this thing snowball. Over 1,600 views and counting. It\u0027s been awesome, thank you.\n\nPlease enjoy! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n**Table of Contents** \n\n**Space

acquire enough science to get to the real nitty-gritty of doing some Munar missions, primarily.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/aP4MY)\n\n**Vckolivi-1**\n\nThis mission was the most basic of basic missions. Simple capsule-on-SRB to get some contract funds under my belt for future missions.\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Jebediah Kerman\n\n**Total Mission Time:**  00:05:43\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 17,371m\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 712 m/s\n\n**Highest Speed Over Land:** 175 m/s\n\n**Ground Distance Covered:** 8,486m\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 40,365m\n\n**Total Science Earned:**  16.5\n\n**Funds Recovered:** 1,061 (8.1km away from KSC at 97.6% recovery rate)\n\n**Vckolivi-2**\n\nThis mission was more of a fund-gathering mission, and also knocked out the \u0022altitude record\u0022 contracts by making it to space. A good amount of science I gathered on this one allowed me to unlock that first little section of 3 techs on the tree. This mission is also notable for the first instance of a Kerbal reaching outer space - Jebediah \u0022Jeb\u0022 Kerman reached an apoapse of 87.5km on a suborbital trajectory. Hooray!\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Jebediah Kerman\n\n**Total Mission Time:** 00:07:22\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 87,627m\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 751 m/s\n\n**Highest Speed Over Land:** 94 m/s\n\n**Ground Distance Covered:** 19,842m\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 83,758m\n\n**Total Science Earned:** 30 \n\n**Funds Recovered:** 2,839 (18km away from KSC at 97.2% recovery rate)\n\n**Vckolivi-3**\n\nThis mission was notable for being the first orbital mission of the Space Program, and a definite milestone of the Vckolivi Program. Jeb Kerman flew a capsule into high Kerbin orbit (HKO) simply because I had the fuel to spare and needed to get a good Science return for the mission. Job well done! Knocked out the \u0022Achieve Orbit\u0022 contract, and thereby completed the first four major contracts! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Jebediah Kerman\n\n**Total Mission Time:**  01:14:46\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 884,475m (884.5km)\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 2,502 m/s\n\n**Highest Speed Over Land:** 2,509 m/s\n\n**Ground Distance Covered:** 7,124,325m (7,124.3km)\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 73,110m\n\n**Total Science Earned:**  36\n\n**Funds Recovered:** 2487 (276.1km away from KSC at 85.1% recovery rate)\n\n**Vckolivi-4**\n\nThis mission is quite unique- It is the first flight that wasn\u0027t flown by Jebediah, true, but it also did not reach space. It was a simple mission to gather Science from the Mystery Goo containers splashed down in the Ocean. I need to unlock the Electrics tech so I can get the battery power for a Munar mission!\n\nUnfortunately, upon reviewing the data, I gathered only enough for a grand total of... 37 points. Not enough to unlock the tech. ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\nDue to this, I have enacted the \u0022Outsourced RnD\u0022 strategy from the Administration facility. Maybe that can help my Science deficiency!\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Jedemone Kerman\n\n**Total Mission Time:** 00:01:10\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 488m\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 128 m/s\n\n**Highest Speed Over Land:** 175 m/s\n\n**Ground Distance Covered:** 2,868m\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 3,346m\n\n**Total Science Earned:**  7.8\n\n**Funds Recovered:** 2,859 (3.1km away from KSC at 97.9% recovery rate)\n\n**Vckolivi-5**\n\nWhew. Luckily for me, there was a contract that involved performing a single crew report in a location just a few klicks off the coast of the KSC. I was able to get the science I needed to unlock the tech. In fact, I was able to complete the entire next section of the tech tree from this mission. Wow! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n*Next stop: The Mun!*\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Tedsel Kerman\n\n**Total Mission Time:**  00:03:12\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 4,827m\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 192 m/s\n\n**Highest Speed Over Land:** 175 m/s\n\n**Ground Distance Covered:** 10,379m\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 16,195m\n\n**Total Science Earned:**  2.1 (plus, like, 88 from completing the contract)\n\n**Funds Recovered:** 2,850 (10.2km away from KSC at 97.5% recovery rate)\n\n**Vckolivi-6**\n\nThis mission was a bit out of order, coming after the Muna-2 failure mission. This one was a bit of a program-booster, and I\u0027m sure glad it popped up- It gave me some extra funds, for sure, but it also resulted in collecting quite a bit of Science, Science that was neccesary so I could explore some more efficient rocket designs and make the Muna program actually do something besides launching expensive equipment up and cluttering Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Maybe, just maybe.\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Chadsted Kerman\n\n**Total Mission Time:**  00:42:55\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 625,255m\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 2,407 m/s\n\n**Highest Speed Over Land:** 2,395 m/s\n\n**Ground Distance Covered:** 3,705,206m (3,705.2km)\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 63,204m\n\n**Total Science Earned:**  51.8 (and whatever other amount I got from the contract)\n\n**Funds Recovered:** 1,057 (1663.9km away from KSC at 20.3% recovery rate)\n\n**Muna Program** [**Back to Top**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)\n\nThe Muna Program is designated for probes with the express purpose of collecting Science on and around the Mun.\n\n**Muna-1** **[Failed Mission]**\n\nWell, this mission was a frank failure. It turns out that I\u0027m addicted to patched conics- without maneuver nodes, I\u0027m useless at figuring out how best to enter the Mun\u0027s SoI. Quite a bit of funds wasted on the useless probe... Gonna have to try again.\n\n**Total Mission Time:**  1d, 04:03:05\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 13,253,855m (13,253.8km)\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 1,657 m/s\n\n**Muna-2** **[Failed Mission]**\n\nGrrrrrrrr. This mission was quite dissapointing as well. I still cant figure out where the Mun\u0027s moving to worth a [REDACTED], so I ended up first missing, then scrambling to correct the effing thing, and then running out of battery. Again. After putting two extra batteries on. At the very least, I managed to nearly halve the cost of my Muna missions, and can launch one on just over 13,000 funds. So that\u0027s one bright side. And I do suppose that I could burn a tad later to get the apoapse in the rough area I need it to. As they say, even a negative result is important. Even if it keeps swallowing my cash.\n\n**Total Mission Time:**  1d, 04:44:51\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** 12,375,615m (12,375.6km)\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 2,017 m/s\n\n**Muna-3**\n\nVICTORY SCREEEEEEEECH *\\*wolololololololololololololololo\\**\n\nAhem.\n\nThe mission was a success, successfully completing the \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract with great amounts of successful success. Now that that is out of the way, I can successfully continue upgrading my successful space program of success. Success. \n\n**Total Mission Time:**  1d, 00:37:56\n\n**Highest Altitude Achieved:** Munar Landing\n\n**Highest Speed Achieved:** 2,031 m/s\n\n**Muna-4**\n\n**Mission Date: 27/2/15**\n\nThe Muna-4 mission was a complete success. Originally designed as a budget mission to collect funding for future missions by collecting temperature data around the Mun for our friends at ***Vac-Co Advanced Suction Systems***, our other friends at ***StrutCo.*** allotted us the sum of roughly 173,000 funds in order to finance a Dunar mission! While this certainly paves the way for Dunar missions, the mission was a major boon to the other programs as well. We began this mission with just over 30,000 funds left in the bank, and ended up with over 275,000 at mission\u0027s end. That is a victory in its own right.\n\n**MET:** 2d, 01:36:24\n\n**Temperature data collected from the following areas:** Provan\u0027s Turf, Kendon\u0027s Escape, Site GAO0F9\n\n**Muna-5**\n\n**Mission Date: 3/1/15-3/2/15** \n\nThe Muna-5 mission, still in progress at this time, is going quite well. For the most part. It is the first mission that I have designed that uses two seperate rovers and have them in a system to where they can both deploy smoothly. The contract I am tackling with this mission will give a large amount of funds, and would be best completed with rovers, and so I am using them! Unfortunately, one of the two rovers was destroyed while going down a large crater, but at least there\u0027s a backup. Aiming high!\n\n-Update: 2/3/15-\n\nMuna-5 was a success! Though one of the rovers was destroyed, the other one was able to complete the mission objectives and score a hefty payout from a contract.

That\u0027s all I can say is wow. The Hxslozi Program was off to a rough, rough start. What with Jedemone first being stranded on the Mun, and then what happened on this mission... Wow. Here\u0027s a breakdown: After sending an unmanned Hxslozi capsule to the mun, the staging problem was encountered for the second time. Not the staging error itself, which detatched the lander too early, but a design flaw caused the lander portion to become stuck to the stage that was used for maneuvers and transmunar injection. This time, however, I was able to successfully seperate the portions with some quick thinking and vigorous tumbling of the stages to let centripetal force take care of the separation. HOWEVER, after I had successfully gotten Jedemone safely inside the capsule (his EVA fuel had been used up, so he literally had to jump and grab the pod ladder), I ran out of fuel on the deorbit burn. I was forced to use up the rest of the monopropellant to safely lower my periapse, and barely had enough to make it.\n\nSo apart from being a great story of near-catastrophe, the flight produced some good data. I need to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, and get my program back on course. Back to the drawing board, folks! Let\u0027s get this thing fixed for good!\n\n**Crew Member(s):** Jedemone Kerman\n\n**Elapsed Time:** 4d, 03:21:57\n\n**Total Distance Traveled:** 293,824,384m (293,824.4km)\n\n**Highest Speed Attained:** 4,600 m/s (Mach 13.5)\n\n**Total Science Earned (Not counting contracts):** 182.2\n\n**Funds Recovered:** 6,910 (531.1km from the KSC at 82.5% recovery rate)\n\n**Hxslozi-3**\n\n**Mission Date: 27/2/15** \n\nA wonderful, wonderful mission!

You may remember that this capsule was recently attached to station KSSSI MS-1, as a part of the station. Today, that lander was put to the test, completing two contracts in one go- One about planting a flag, and another about retrieving surface samples and a crew report, which ultimately determined the Munar escape burn\u0027s strange trajectory. This mission in particular served as a rough test of the capabilities of the Hxslozi capsule, as it required large amounts of hovering to get to good landing sites.

Because my interplanetary lifter had so much spare delta-v that would\u0027ve gone to waste, I removed the liquid-fuel boosters on either side to save cost (actually trimming off almost 100,000 funds in the process!), but neglected to refine my gravity turn. This turned out to be a mistake as the rocket keeled over and would never have attained orbit with its crippled trajectory. I was forced to ditch in the ocean and attempted to recover as much of it as I could, but it was destroyed on splashdown when it tipped over. \\*sigh\\* Oh well.\n\n**Duna-Ike-2** **[Failed Mission]**\n\n**Mission Date: 20/3/15** \n\nIn a strange turn of events, Duna-Ike-2 Also failed, this time due to the collision of some extra SRBs that were installed to give the vessel an extra kick on launch. I\u0027m starting to think that I might be better off going with the full size design of my interplanetary launcher... Thankfully I was able to recover the topmost portion of the vessel, the LV-Ns and the lander itself. Hopefully the next launch will go better.\n\n**Duna-Ike-3** **[Ongoing Mission]**\n\n**Mission Date: 20/3/15 - 22/3/15** \n\nAhhhh. Duna-Ike-3 is a success, up to this point. At the moment, calculations are being made as to the optimal launch time for Duna-Ike-3 to actually travel to the Reddish Planet\u0027s SoI, and in the meantime the mission will remain in a parking orbit approximately 112km above the surface of Kerbin. Stay tuned for the results of the mission.\n\n[uPDATE]\n\nDuna-Ike-3 has successfully touched down on Ike!

The station is now in a circular, equatorial orbit around the Mun! This station will certainly help in the procurement of more Science, and I plan to do at least a couple of extensions on the mission. The one major part left to the station is to send up a Hxslozi lander to dock with the station, and that will then complete the contract and the station can begin its purpose.\n\n**-Update-**\n\nThe Hxslozi capsule has been attached to the station! The contract was successfully completed and the station is now Munar-capable. The whole thing was pretty fun, even though I had to do a major course correction when the capsule came in at a prograde orbit rather than a standard retrograde one. That could\u0027ve ended badly...

Oh, I\u0027m so excited! The most notable event that occurred was that this time, I actually managed to keep on the escape stage on my interplanetary lifter- But it turns out that the escape stage has more than enough delta-v to be the insertion AND deorbit stage as well! My interplanetary design seems to have virtually no limits- So there\u0027s no need to redesign for things!

From the time of our earliest ancestors, which many experts believe were particularly mobile plants, the cosmos have been the object of which the Kerbal mind has been trained on ever since. Many of the great developments over the (frankly short) Kerbal history have revolved around space and its properties.\n\nThe universe\u0027s properties were first properly described by perhaps the first great Kerbal physicist: Newsaac Kerman, who before even coming up with the notion of the field of study that is physics, was hard at work studying how things worked.\n\nIt was he who first began our journey, and we have never looked back since. To properly understand how things work in the present time, we must look at the basics.\n\nNewsaac Kerman\u0027s greatest contribution to physics was the introduction of the Three Laws of Moving Objects. These laws define how objects in the universe move, and form the basic idea of how things work. \n\n**Law 1:** *Every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.*\n\nTo explain: If you were to throw a ball in a place and time where there were absolutely no forces at all interacting with each other, the ball would continue going in a straight line forever, with no change to speed or direction from when it left your hand. In order to get it to change paths, you must add in an external force. Let\u0027s try gravity: If you were to throw a ball at an angle into the sky here on Kerbin, the ball would begin traveling in the straight line from your hand to the sky. However, Kerbin\u0027s gravity will attract the ball to the planet, curving its path and causing it to hit the ground. Simple!\n\n![newton1.png](http://organizationalphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newton1.png)\n\n**Law 2:** *Force = Mass x Acceleration*\n\nThis law is the only one that is summed up with an equation. The force acting on an object is a product of the mass of the object multiplied against its acceleration. For example, a ball with a mass of 50g, moving at 10 m/s, would have a net force of 500 Newtons, a unit that Newsaac Kerman invented, named thusly presumably to fit in line with \u0022tons\u0022 even though a single Newton would have hardly any affect on a ton. Newsaac was a strange specimen.\n\n![Newton2.png](http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/images/Newton2.png)\n\n**Law 3:** *For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.*\n\nThere is nary a greater Law of Moving Objects that has more impact on rocket science than the third law. The law describes a scenario in which every force that acts on an object is met with a rebounding force of equal magnitude. Punch a wall, and because the wall interacts with your hand, your hand will stop and likely hurt from the sudden negative acceleration. If the third law didn\u0027t apply, you\u0027d punch straight through the wall with no resistance at all.\n\n![newton3.png](http://organizationalphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newton3.png)\n\nThe third law is also the same law that makes rockets work. Aha, about time I mentioned rockets, isn\u0027t it? A rocket works when the fuel, channeled through the engine, is combusted in the combustion chamber of the engine. As the fuel is burned, it expands, and the expanding gasses resulting from the violent reaction speeding through the only opening: the nozzle of the rocket. The nozzle serves to channel the gasses, compressing them, and expels them through the very bottom of the engine. It is the exhaust being expelled out of the engine, pushing back against the engine itself, that propels the rocket upward (or wherever the rocket happens to be heading). \n\n![index_clip_image002.jpg](http://web.eng.fiu.edu/~mathmatters/NEWTON)\n\nDue to this, rocket engines can even work in a vacuum because the sole propelling force is the pushing of gasses away from the rocket. The same principle applies if you were alone in space, again holding a ball. If you throw the ball away from you, first of all you aren\u0027t going to be seeing the ball again. Secondly, the force of the ball leaving your hand will push back against you, and you will begin moving in the opposite direction of the ball. Remember, however, that you are (presumably) much more massive than the ball, and therefore you will move at a much lower velocity than the ball will. You will move away from the ball, but slowly. \n\nThese three laws form the basic ideas, the fundamentals of physics. There is so much more to learn, however, so I shall be serially updating this with more information regarding such concepts, adding and correcting content where necessary.

To understand what\u0027s going on, one must remember his Three Laws of Moving Objects, the first one of which comes into play here. \n\nNewsaac\u0027s cannon is a thought experiment that encompasses the following scenario: A cannon on a high mountaintop. If you fire a cannonball (or other projectile) with a certain velocity, the projectile will leave the cannon in a straight line. However, almost immediately, gravity will pull the object down, curving its path and eventually causing the projectile to impact the ground. (Point A in the illustration below)\n\nHowever, if you shoot that projectile with a larger velocity, you begin to notice that the curving becomes seemingly shallower (Points B or C), and the ball travels a further distance. Do this with a sufficiently large velocity, and the cannonball will continue to curve downwards due to gravity, but is now going fast enough that it keeps missing the ground! (Point D) That\u0027s all that an orbit is: Falling and missing.\n\n![OrbitingCannonBalls.png](http://astro.unl.edu/naap/atmosphere/graphics/OrbitingCannonBalls.png)\n\nPlease note that the larger the velocity, the higher the apogee of the orbit on the other side. The projectile will always come right back to where it was fired due to inertia, the First Law, so be sure to duck when it comes back.\n\nAs for changing orbits while *in* orbit, that simply requires shooting a cannon into space, and then firing the cannon *IN* space. That will affect the orbit in much the same way. And that\u0027s all a rocket is!
