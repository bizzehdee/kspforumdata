So any rescue would need to be made by the SSTUBBY rocket...and as far north as Aldner was going, that would be very expensive in fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the general plan: Follow the northern arc of the giant impact feature, and use the fact that the islands there are very long, so jet fuel can be conserved by covering a lot of the distance by roving. Once Aldner gets to the ring-shaped island, his options for returning will depend on how much fuel he has. If he doesn\u0027t have much fuel then, he will have to retrace his route and drive back along the islands again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nvSfNHh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nvSfNHh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Aldner takes the BirdDog north-northeast from his base on Manley Island.

(In fact, I had been driving along at high speed over the better terrain as I approached it...and it was lucky I decided to stop for a quicksave, because just beyond that point the ground fell away precipitously, and I hadn\u0027t been paying close attention to what was ahead. It probably wouldn\u0027t have caused a problem because the drop was so precipitous that the plane would have become airborne and there would have been plenty of time to adjust and bring it in for a gliding landing, or even fire up the engine if the landing area looked bad. A rover that is also a plane has certain advantages.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PqTB9hW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PqTB9hW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe caldera/crater as seen from high view below, followed by a time-lapse image of the changing lighting conditions over a period of one Laythe day.

The north rim was lower, so he drove around that side...but rather than drive down, he just pointed the BirdDog downhill and let it roll until it picked up sufficient speed to glide as the land dropped away. He glided down about half of a kilometer vertically to a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NP0EzTz.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022NP0EzTz.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lowest spot in this half of the caldera/crater was at about 230 meters.

You haven\u0027t called in for a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yeah. I\u0027ve been driving along the north slope of the island, and I\u0027ve been encountering areas that are steep enough that they appear to never get any sunlight on them at all here at 75 degrees North latitude.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022You should watch out for ice.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yes, Mom. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing...so I\u0027ve been kind of distracted. Strangely enough, there doesn\u0027t seem to be any ice in the permanently shaded areas. Ah, crap.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s wrong?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hm. Well, it seems that while I was busy watching the road, I didn\u0027t notice the batteries have run down. I\u0027m getting almost no power to the wheels now, and I\u0027m sitting in shadow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Um.....I suppose you could use the jet engine on minimum to move the plane...or maybe take off? What angle are you at now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hold on. OK... I can see Jool on the horizon behind me, with some clear sky to the left of it... so this spot will get some sunshine before Kerbol goes behind Jool. I can wait until then for the batteries to recharge. Then I\u0027ll see if I can drive ahead to a more open area. But screw it for now...I\u0027m taking a nap.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Roger. Be sure your brake is set.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Yes, my damn brake is set. Er...sorry, Commander. I\u0027m just a bit grumpy...don\u0027t mind me. Thanks for checking in.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Sure. No problem , Aldner.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022OK...I\u0027m going to shut some stuff down and be off for a while.

I guess light scattered from the clear sky is enough to give some power to the solar cells? Anyway, Aldner was able to eventually move the BirdDog forward beyond the hill to an area that had a clearer view of the southern sky, then parked for the night. The next day, when the sun was well up (well...as well up as it gets this far north), Aldner noticed that Tylo was passing in front of Bop while both were close to the sun (see below). It wasn\u0027t until the event was mostly over before I noticed that if I moved the center of Kerbol just outside the frame of my view, its glare went away and I could get a better picture of the three objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UJXDIo4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UJXDIo4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022BirdDog to Base.

Can I take a message, Dude?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Nothing urgent. I\u0027m at 77 degrees North, and I can see the small island that\u0027s just off the north shore of Greenland. It\u0027s not an island after all, but an ice floe. The start of the ice cap must be just over my horizon here. I\u0027m going to head south now, and head around mountain ridge.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Roger. Be careful, Dude! Those ridge lines can be killers!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Don\u0027t I know it, little buddy.

A short roll down the steep hillside, and he was airborne after topping the first ridge dropoff. After 1,500 meters of vertical drop gliding, Aldner set the BirdDog down safely. The landing area had low ridges running the \u0027wrong\u0027 way, but by gliding along slowly and carefully, he was able to land on a slight upslope between dips in the terrain. The third picture below is the view back towards the direction he came from of the steep and ridged mountainside Aldner had glided over. Nasty looking terrain. Yes, indeed... a rover that can fly is a very handy thing at times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b6LCz4W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b6LCz4W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U0GX0dX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U0GX0dX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SDv7xvq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SDv7xvq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond the bay, the terrain got better. The east end of Greenland is a wide, rounded ridge that flattens out as shown below. Aldner took off from a moderate slope there to get to the next island. The distance to the next island wasn\u0027t too far...he got the BirdDog up to 9,000 meters, then mostly glided the rest of the way. The western-most end of the island proved to be a steep ridge, so Aldner had to glide beyond that do a sharp bank down to a beach area on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZBtnI4r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZBtnI4r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jpg3lkx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jpg3lkx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022BirdDog to base.

I was getting pretty tired of rovering around by this point, and I considered just punting the mission here. There was more than enough fuel to allow Aldner to fly back to Manley Base after grabbing some samples...two big islands visited...no shame it cutting out early.

How\u0027s your fuel?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Fuel is at 174 out of 300. I\u0027ve been moving fuel to the forward tank before each flight, and I\u0027ve been able to fly higher than 10,000 meters without any sign of pitch instability. I think I\u0027ll be able to fly at 11,000 or even 12,000 meters to get even better performance. So I will not need to do Plan A...which I must say makes me happy, because I do not fancy having to drive all the way back along Ryan and Greenland. All that dreary low-sun-angle lighting was getting to me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022So you think you have enough fuel for Plan B, flying directly back to Manley Base?

If only the Big Brain squad at the KSC could figure out how to equip planes with a simple hose system to siphon fuel from one plane to another, then Aldner could have zipped on over and had loads of fuel available. But, alas...still no hoses. I keep asking....but still no hoses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DfMhiWB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DfMhiWB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Aldner flies on, at altitudes of up to 12,000 meters, where the BirdDog cruises along at almost 420 m/s at 1/3 throttle. And his target comes into sight: the equatorial island that was supposed to be the final stop of Nelemy\u0027s last exploration mission (before it ended abruptly at Milski Island when he ripped the jet engine off of BirdDog2). Exploring this island was of high priority because it is probably where a second base will be set up on Laythe. And now Aldner will check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oHuZkMR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oHuZkMR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he approached the island, Aldner didn\u0027t see any nice beach-front landing sites on this side of the island. There were some possibilities on the far side, but he could not afford to waste fuel looking around...so he brought the BirdDog straight in for a high-elevation landing at an elevation of 1,800 meters where the slope appeared smooth and shallow. Happily, he glided in perfectly. Looking back the way he came, it appeared that the lower lying areas on that side of the island may have slopes that were gentle enough for a landing...but the highland landing worked out well, so no complaints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eY7r6b1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eY7r6b1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2yfJyzo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222yfJyzo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Aldner to Base.

I appreciate it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK, I copy the name. I guess you should start exploring Aldner, Aldner.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner Island will be useful as a future base location because it lies along the equator, so it would be easily accessible from Laythe Space Station. The equator passes through the southeast part of the island, so Aldner headed there. The image below shows the peninsula that juts off the southeast corner of the island and the sloping land behind it. It all slopes downward, but there are stretches that are moderately level. Afterwards, Aldner drove to the northeast corner of the island to a larger peninsula (located about 4 degrees north) since this was the farthest east point of the island. Aldner\u0027s BirdDog no longer had enough fuel to return west to his Manley Base...but it should have enough fuel to go EAST to the main Laythe Base at Fido Bay on Dansen Island. Assuming I had calculated correctly. And assuming that Aldner flies high and fast for efficient fuel use. And, if he DOES come up short and has to ditch the BirdDog in the ocean somewhere off Fido Bay...there IS a rescue option available there: The DogFish rover/boat is stationed offshore with half of its fuel remaining. So, if needed, it could be used to recover Aldner from the ocean and return him to Dansen Island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/olrdK0d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022olrdK0d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pGoE6c5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pGoE6c5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with the fuel moved to the forward tank for better pitch stability, Aldner took off from the east point of Aldner Island and quickly climbed to 12,000 meters.

Let\u0027s see the ships that the crew at KSC have been putting together for the next Jool launch window. I really wasn\u0027t looking forward to juggling half a dozen ships on the way to Jool again, so I had the brilliant idea to lump the ships together into just two large ships. Much easier to handle, right? What could possibly go wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the first launch in the big construction project. The payload consists of two triple tug adapters. One will be used for the Laythe resupply vehicle. The other will be used for the Vall Expedition vehicle. The launch vehicle is, of course, my standard Reusable Rocket...undoubtedly using boosters and sustainer stage recycled from previous missions. There have been a few minor changes to the Reusable Rocket for version 0.21.1: The RCS system has been removed from the sustainer stage and an SAS unit has been installed to handle torquing the rocket around. This seems to work great. I did leave the RCS quads down at the bottom of the rocket just in case I decide to use RCS (and assuming the payload has RCS fuel to provide). The payload for this flight carries a reusable Refueler Topper, and it needed to provide some extra fuel to the sustainer stage so that the sustainer had enough fuel to deorbit and land on its rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aIjhkM7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aIjhkM7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LKtlmTO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LKtlmTO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is the new, improved Nuclear Tug. I keep upgrading this design in each version of KSP. You may recall that the previous upgraded design featured lots and lots of probe cores to provide extra control torque. But now that Squad has given us SAS units that provide torque, the new tug design just uses one of those. It also uses the Senior docking port for extra structural strength when pushing big payloads...but there is a standard docking port underneath the Senior just in case the tug is needed to haul around something with a standard port (in which case the Senior port must be discarded).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cVaaQWs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cVaaQWs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the mass of the tug exceeds the usual payload capacity of the Reusable Rocket, the nuclear engines of the tug must assist the sustainer in reaching orbit (because the sustainer has to get into orbit as well, so it can come around and land back at KSC). Don\u0027t be overly concerned about the nuclear exhaust washing down the side of the sustainer...these are two fresh nuclear engines that have not yet built up any neutron-activated radioisotopes in the fuel pipes that run through the reactor, so what little radioactivity that comes out of a Nerva-style engine is at its minimum at this point. And we\u0027ll have Jeb hose the sustainer down after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iN7ordV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iN7ordV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tug gets left in orbit with its rear drop tank over 64% full, and it uses a little of that fuel to rendezvous and dock with the triple adapters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LRgC0lT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LRgC0lT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, this tug will be the core of the drive section for the Vall Expedition ship, so it grabs one of the two triple adapters (the one with the slightly longer arms) and backs away with it.

I keep forgetting to add a MecJeb unit to these Toppers (which I just grab from my collection using subassembly manager), so I targeted this one to KSC manually using only RCS power (it was empty of regular fuel).

This GasStation has twice the fuel capacity of the standard ones. It does, however, only have two refueling arms instead of the usual three, but I haven\u0027t been having difficulty in getting the BirdDogs to dock with at least two ports on the standard station, so I\u0027m hoping two will be sufficient. The station does have double the number of 24-77 engines, so it will be able to \u0022hop\u0022 if needed to shift the positions of the refueling arms if there is a problem. The main reason there are only two arms is because I couldn\u0027t get three to fit in the limited space the payload will fill on the big ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/faybx7A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022faybx7A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the drive section is rather large, the Refueler Topper acts as the tug for getting the Double GasStation into place on the drive section. I gave the Topper an SAS unit to help wrestle around the payload. I performed the rendezvous in the dark, but I waited for sunlight to do the docking (I didn\u0027t want to add docking-assist lights to the payloads to keep down the part count of this big ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lKVDD5j.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lKVDD5j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext comes a standard BirdDog payload with standard GasStation. I\u0027ll be able to drop these GasStations in a few select spots on Laythe, making exploration much easier. This new BirdDog is slightly modified...it no longer has an avionics package, since those are useless parts now, and I\u0027ve shifted the position of the air intakes down a bit to decrease the tendency of the plane to pitch up. But the basic framework was left untouched to make sure all BirdDogs will fit all GasStations. There is no room for a reusable Refueler Topper on a BirdDog payload, so I added three fuel/RCS pods on the refueler arms. The orbital maneuvers were done using the GasStation\u0027s six 24-77 engines, which draw fuel/oxidizer from its torroidal gold tanks...and that fuel had to be replaced a couple times with fuel from the three fuel/RCS pods during and after the maneuvers. But the BirdDog was slid very carefully into place, only slightly crooked. But OH NOOOO, the lag. Arrrrgh. OK...so maybe building a big ship is not the way to go. But I didn\u0027t think a triple-tug/payload ship would tax my system as badly as it did. Maybe 0.21.1 is laggier than previous versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A1Jw1cE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A1Jw1cE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/snOz6My.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022snOz6My.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the docking, all the remaining fuel in the three pods was transferred to the still hungry Tugs in the drive section, and then the pods were popped off.

With the last Tug, the sustainer landed on the raised part of crawlway and almost tipped over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oDKyGlM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oDKyGlM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UteKAUa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UteKAUa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith those two Tugs docked on, mostly straight, the drive section for the Vall ship is done. The connections between the Tugs may not look strong, but all three payloads that will go on top have nearly the same mass, so its like three Tugs/payloads that happen to be flying along in the same direction, so there is not a lot of stress on the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VLNCilm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VLNCilm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the Vall payloads. First: Two Fido rovers. These rovers are based upon my Fido KE design, and they each use eight of the older-style medium wheels. I know there are a lot of people who say the ruggedized medium wheels are better than the older ones in every way...but I disagree. I did a lot of \u0022simulation\u0022 testing of rovers under Vall conditions with older wheels, newer wheels, and aircraft landing gear in various combinations. It\u0027s true that the ruggedized wheels can run up hills like champs, but they also are prone to mysteriously \u0027snagging\u0027 the ground and causing the rover to flip at high speeds. The older wheels do slip and slide more, and take longer to accelerate and slow up, but I did not experience the flipping out problem with them. So, old wheels it is, for me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oy85ZeP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oy85ZeP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrgh! Already, with just the center payload, the lag was getting terrible with this ship. I guess it\u0027s all those struts and girders and whatnot for two complete rovers and their skycranes. After docking the Fidos in place, the Topper gave some fuel and monopropellant to the Tugs, then headed back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f6wUUUZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f6wUUUZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next piece of the puzzle is the Vall Expedition Lander. This lander basically serves as a base for the crew of two on Vall, so it has a two-kerbal lander cabin AND a Hitchhiker module to serve as living quarters and laboratory. I\u0027ve wrapped the living quarters with six fuel tanks to serve as radiation protection. Unlike our happy campers on Laythe who have a substantial atmosphere to protect them from Jool\u0027s radiation belts (however strong they may be), the Vall crew will be spending their time on an airless moon with no such protection. Those four long stacks of Oscar tanks are the four communications satellites that will be placed into high Vall orbit before the lander descends to the surface. They have waaay more fuel than they need, but that was to get the mass of this payload up to the same mass as the main habitat module which will be on the opposite Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tp1XaIV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tp1XaIV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last to go up is the Vall ex. main habitat module that the crew rides in to get to Jool and for the return trip to Kerbin. I figured a 2-kerbal lander pod for the command pod, plus a Hitchhiker module for extra living space would be plenty of room for the two-kerbal crew. And wrapping the habitat module with fuel tanks for shielding against cosmic rays during the trip also seemed like a good idea. And...hey...this is almost exactly like the Lander. So, what the heck... I added some legs and engines and made it into another lander that could be used for some emergency, but which will not be used for that if all goes according to plan. Plus, I added a couple one-kerbal capsules with retro engines in case mission directors decide to send the Vall crew to visit our boys on Laythe after their Vall mission is done (they would need to use the Laythe SSTUBBY SSTO to return to orbit in that situation). It always helps to have contingency plans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nvH780u.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nvH780u.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, the perfect record of returning the sustainer stage from all twelve Reusable Rockets used for this project came to an end when the sustainer of this rocket returned to KSC. It landed on the crawlerway tracks and tipped over, exploding its two orange tanks. But the Mainsail and the complete bottom structure, plus most of the top parts such as the probe core and RTG and stage separator survived for re-use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uiuOxYI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uiuOxYI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh. So far everything that has been launched has been un-kerballed. The crew will come up later via SSTO rocket when the launch window to Jool approaches. But every time I launched one of the rockets for this construction project that included a capsule, Jebediah tried to sneak on board. Every. damn. time. Annoying as hell. Look, if I wanted a crew on the rocket, I would have ASKED for it. Grrr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the removal of the last Refueler Topper, this amazing lag-fest, the Vall Expedition ship, is fully assembled, fully fueled, and just needs its crew and a launch window to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k06DIRs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k06DIRs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back on Laythe, the boys are having a discussion over supper...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Hey, did you hear that they finally chose the crew for the Vall expedition?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Who did they choose?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022The Mission Scientist is going to be Hellou Kerman.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Really?

As usual, I did the transfer burn in two parts for better efficiency. Below is the initial trajectory plot. Delta-V required was 1904.6 m/s, and after firing up the engines, the burn time showed up as 20 minutes. The ship was stable a 2x physical time acceleration, but too wobbly at 3x. And with the lag rate, the two-part burn took me over 30 minutes. Maybe there is something to be said for sending out multiple smaller ships. All those other trajectories on the plot (from right-to-left) are for a Tug returning from Jool, the new larger mobile base (soon to arrive at Jool), and a second Base/rover pair that I sent out when I had nothing better to send.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ls22W1p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ls22W1p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started the burn about 6 minutes from the node, then cut it off after 10 minutes.

When the Hawk and her Chickadee came around, I sent them off as well. The orbits of the ships had started at 110 km, but the periapses got as low as 87 km during the second part of the burn. If you try to do a long burn like this in one go, you might end up with your periapsis dropping down into the atmosphere...and you\u0027d certainly be doing a lot of your burn far from Kerbin where you lose the advantage of the Oberth effect.
