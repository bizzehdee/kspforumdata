Didn\u0027t think this was going to be possible and tried many times. Discovering (Jeb\u0027s rocket veered off course and by sheer luck and kerbal) that surface samples can be taken at the VAB makes me wonder that it might be possible after all to get out of this damned dirty hole. Contracts are the only thing that keeps this rickety boat afloat and science seems to drive them. It looked grim because the funds were dissappearing and without any new contracts it seemed improbable. Now there is a glimmer of hope for these krazy kerbals.

Right from the start I was looking straight at failure, because the TT-38K would not have fired off, needed to switch the staging to before decoupling from the TT18-A. Even though there were no major problems the more concerning failure was using the staging button instead of using action group binding to toggle the engines on and then using the staging to complete the contract for the LV-T45 engines.

Contract should be completed once the telemetry is sent but doesnt and is completed right at the begining of transmission (upsetting inner kerbal).
