I had no choice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbro\u0027s stories and exposition had been going on for hours, or what felt like hours. Or was it munths? Maybe just one munth. Maybe two.\u00A0The further Albro got into the tales of flooded hallways and cryptic computers, the sleepier Thomlock got. He\u0027d been interrupted from his nap by Gletrix anyway, and as the excitement of the portal slipped away his eyelids became heavy. He had obviously dozed off, awaking only when Albro started talking forcefully about some unknown threat. Thomlock still had no idea why his old \u0022friend\u0022 had brought him here, what Albro wanted, or why he was still here. The more time passed the less he wanted to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat isn\u0027t to say the stories weren\u0027t interesting. Albro had arrived to find the facility powered-down, dark, and mostly flooded. He found a working computer terminal only after several days of swimming, wading, and exploring. A computer that was not only still working, but for some reason recognized him as an administrator. He got the water pumped out of the facility, made sure everything was dry and safe, and then set up a shelter for himself. He didn\u0027t need much more than a bed and a source of food, both of which were apparently easy to produce. Afterwards he set about testing the limits of The Park, the control center, and his own ability to control kerbals and shape their future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of his first major discoveries was how The Park was built and who built it. Their \u0022creators\u0022 had not directly assembled the Kerbol System; no planets had been dragged from distant reaches, no stars were ignited by advanced physics. Instead they had built a vast and complex artificial assistant capable of creating anything they desired: The Machine. Powered by what was initially a simple AI and existing alongside the creators, The Machine carried them to the stars on its back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had set no limits for The Machine except to ensure its actions would not harm them. When they asked it for something, it was free to use any and all means available to it to meet their desires. They asked for a mighty space station; The Machine delivered a large barrel-shaped city in space. It mass had been pulled in from some distant star system, but that did not concern the creators. They inquired into a means of faster-than-light travel; The Machine delivered the portal system. It pierced through all of reality, pinching many parallel universes into a single point, yet it delivered them to the distant stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey begged for an amusement park filled with rockets and tiny planets; The Machine delivered Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy its necessity to fulfill the creator\u0027s requests, The Machine had moved far beyond their level of technology and their ability to comprehend. Unbeknownst to the creators, The Machine had slowly been upgrading and expanding itself. What they saw as a simple system of tools was actually a vast artificial civilization living outside of this universe\u0027s time and space. It was impossible to say exactly what or where The Machine was, only that its terminals and tendrils were still latched firmly into the creator\u0027s worlds, sleeping and seemingly dormant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tool had outlived its creators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother of Albro\u0027s discoveries also explained the cycles of Kerbin. The Park was designed to reset itself periodically. Many different story lines and adventures could play out from the Null State at the beginning of a cycle, and each cycle could randomly work its way into a given story autonomously. The Park was designed to provide a new experience to each of the creators as they visited, so that no single creator would have the same experience twice. This required returning everything back to the beginning, including the Kerbals and their memories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe creators had anticipated (correctly) that other starfarers might stumble into the Kerbin System, and wanted to prevent the mechanisms used for resetting kerbals from affecting these unknown visitors. Therefore, any creature or creation that landed on Kerbin\u0027s surface from beyond the atmosphere was flagged as \u0022protected\u0022, and would not be reset. The flaw in that design was quickly discovered, and as a workaround those kerbals who had been beyond the atmosphere were manually flagged for reset or disposal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bug was never patched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose returning to Kerbin and marked for disposal would be rounded up by the planet\u0027s janitors, those in space would be cleared out by the void\u0027s cleaners. Both were systems The Machine had built, and neither was well understood by the creators. It was this system of cleaning Albro was now calling a menace.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock blinked away his weariness, scratched at the side of his face, then looked up to see Albro was staring at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you even paying attention?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. Maybe. No, not really. What\u0027s this menace you\u0027re going on about now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbro sighed. \u0022The Kraken. Our creator\u0027s machines twisted them, mutated them, turned them into some terrifying and dark keepers for the park. And they kept going, destroying everything I tried to build. Everything _WE_ tried to build. They left me no choice, I had to lock them away.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did it occur to you that messing with The Park might be a bad idea?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What could it hurt? Besides, the kraken have controls built into them just like us kerbals. So I set a trap, I baited them all to Dres, and then locked them away in the asteroids. It worked, for the most part.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is this why I\u0027m here? You want me to solve your Kraken problem once and for all?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hardly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then what do you want? Why am I here?!\u0022 He was starting to lose his patience with this old \u0022friend\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbro smiled at Thomlock\u0027s outburst and looked to his right. The display that had been showing his capsule jumped forward in time rapidly, and was now showing his reentry. \u0022You have an important part to play, otherwise I wouldn\u0027t have freed you from your dark grave. You\u0027re the only kerbal left who\u0027s like me, who the machines will listen to. Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t have put so much effort into building your legend, into making you so famous. Oh yes, that was me. They named an asteroid after you: The famously dead Thomlock Kerman. Otherwise you would\u0027ve been just like any other kerbal, crazy and ranting about space, and just as quickly discarded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0117_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0117_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks? I guess? Look, if it\u0027s all the same to you, I\u0027m hungry and past due for a really long nap. It\u0027s good to see you again, I\u0027m not really interested in your magic chair, and, well, I guess that\u0027s it. Am I a prisoner or not? Can I go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, to both questions.\u0022 The screens behind Albro blinked to life. \u0022You see, had I not seeded your legend in the memories of kerbals you would have been their prisoner, locked away in a reeducation center. Had I not brought you back to Kerbin as a famous kerbal, you would have never gone to the M\u00FCn. You would have never found Pioneer Base. Never inspired Hallock to leave his bananas. And you would have never visited Hudwin\u0027s landing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re dead set on getting the rest of this exposition in, aren\u0027t you?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0113_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022567\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0113_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore images flashed to his right.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jool. Had I not intervened you would have never become one of the first four kerbals to land on Laythe. Would have never witnessed an alien sunset nor seen the volcanic destruction that plagues that small moon. Would have never encountered The Forgotten. They would have never decided to go back to Kerbin. And more importantly, you would have never found the portal on Vall. All this I gained by whispering a few memories and by changing your capsule\u0027s orbit, many, many years ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170701_0112_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022570\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170701_0112_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock shrugged. \u0022Ok, fine. Why? Why go to all that effort when you could just as easily have left me frozen out there in the black? What do you \u0027gain\u0027 from all this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There are forces at work and plans in motion that seek to destroy not just us, but The Park and everything in it. I can\u0027t leave this place unattended, and there are limits to what I can do from here.\u0022 Albro stood, turned off the chair controls, and made his way down to the floor. \u0022Walk with me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey made their way out of the control room and back up to the main hallway. Albro moved very slowly compared to Thomlock, his rather incredible age showing despite being in otherwise good health. At the junction of the two hallways Albro pointed to the left, and they continued back towards the portal room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When I first arrived, this was mostly underwater. I\u0027m still not sure how most of the lights work in this place, and I\u0027ve always been too ashamed to ask The Machine. It\u0027s bright enough for me, at least for now.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Master of whispers, skulking about in the dark.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Think what you want, Thomlock, but I\u0027m not your enemy. Yes, I\u0027ve done some terrible things, but I\u0027ve changed. Age has a way of doing that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock had his doubts, given his kerbal who was not his enemy had basically forced him to jump into the portal through whispers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There are also limits to what The Machine will do for me. Cheating mass, for instance. When I set out to build Edge of Infinity, The Machine was willing to help me assemble it, but required me to provide them with the raw materials.\u0022 He waved towards the wall of darkened glass at the end of the hallway. \u0022So I had them dig, there, beyond the portal rooms. They moved the rocks and minerals and their raw matter to Vall orbit and transformed it into the station you are now familiar with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why? Couldn\u0027t you just use asteroids? Or Pol? Why dig here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, both of those were options. As were Bop and Tylo. Maybe even Laythe.\u0022 Albro waved at the glass wall again as they drew near, this time doors opened into the darkness. Slowly, steadily, distant lights came to life, a vast cavern opened before them. \u0022I had another plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShapes formed in the void. A large and empty room, circular, almost spherical at the edges. Stairs, ramps, both leading up and down, twisting around a central point. A vast dark void in the center extended upwards and down, a long spire of bare stone stabbed through its center. Tunnels led off from the central chamber into what Thomlock could only assume were other such excavations. A vast city carved out of rock, empty and void. Void. Lots and lots of void. The amount of rock removed from the central chamber had to be more than enough to build the Edge of Infinity. Edge of Infinity would almost fit in the room as it was. If the other tunnels really did open into similarly sized chambers.... Where did the rest of it go?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What else have you been building?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbro chuckled. \u0022You see, my old friend, these new caverns will prove far more useful than that simple space station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spirals disappeared into the darkness above and below. Thomlock tiptoed to the edge of the void, peering hesitantly over the unprotected ledge. \u0022How big is this place?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Large enough to house three times the population of Kerbin, once we build it out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re going to evacuate Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now you\u0027re getting it. Yes. I can\u0027t stop these cycles, but I can at least free all of our kind from them.\u0022 Albro raised his hands, motioning around at the empty chamber. \u0022You, the famously dead Thomlock Kerman, now returned from the grave, will lead all of kerbalkind here. Here, far away from their chains and away from their most certain destruction. Into this promised land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock inched carefully back from the edge and turned to face Albro. \u0022But why? What kind of life is this, buried in a cavern deep below the ice of Vall?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vall? Tsk, tsk, Thomlock. And here I thought you understood. A messiah must be smarter than that.\u0022 He turned and made his way out of the caverns. \u0022Perhaps I had best show you myself. Come along, you\u0027ll need your helmet for this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For what? If we\u0027re not... not on Vall....\u0022 The portal system. He remembered Albro saying something about the portals earlier in the day. \u0027The creators asked for the stars, The Machine delivered the portals.\u0027 He stumbled after Albro, lost in the realization of what was really going on. \u0022We\u0027re not on Vall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, we\u0027re not.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re not in the Kerbol system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, we\u0027re not. Come on now, best you see it with your own eyes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe portal room was just as he\u0027d left it. Albro opened a hidden closet and pulled out an EVA suit, no doubt the same suit he had worn on his first space flight, all those many years ago. He put it on while Thomlock recovered his helmet. Once suited up Albro looked at Thomlock, touched something on his wrist, and suddenly they were somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flash of light, or at least his eyes thought it was a flash of light. The jolt caused Thomlock to lose his footing, or perhaps it was the sand. He stumbled to his knees, paused to catch his breath. Sand. His mittens and knees were resting in sand. Coarse, heavy sand, not unlike the sands of Laythe. It was dark where they were, a hint of orange on the horizon. He pushed his way back to his feet and looked up at oddly familiar stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was a shock to me the first time too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What was that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve never found a definitive answer to that question. It\u0027s somehow related to the portal system, but only works on a planetary scale. I think of a place, activate the system, and there I am. I spent years digging into it and it never even so much as started to make sense. Our creators did the same thing, tried for thousands of years to understand. Not just this technology, but everything The Machine gave them. They could never break its secrets, and eventually went mad trying. That\u0027s where their records end.\u0022 Albro sounded different, more like his old friend and less like his overlord. \u0022Hey, you should check this out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sky was reddening, or perhaps rusting. He looked around for the Sun, but it was rising behind distant clouds. He looked back to where Albro was pointing and froze. Only then did he realize just how very far from home he was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170702_0055_espadarte.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022567\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170702_0055_espadarte.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where?\u0022 He dropped to his knees again as he tried to catch his breath. \u0022Where are we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Espadarte. Second satellite of the third planet of the star Anzol, that planet being the gas giant Calamar.\u0022 He pointed behind the great orange ball of gas on the horizon. \u0022The tiny dot above Calamar is, I think, Alga, the only satellite of any notable size below our orbit. Somewhere above us are Linguado, Gaiado, Corvina, and a bevy of other tiny rocks our creators didn\u0027t bother to name. There are two other giant planets orbiting Anzol beyond Calamar, Polvo and Choco, and many more blobs of rock and ice around and beyond those. Two rocky planets orbit below us. Our creators came from the second of those, a rock named Cavala.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They went to a great deal of effort to give this moon a breathable atmosphere, and they succeeded. Succeeded on their own, long before they built The Machine. Quite the accomplishment given their limited technology. Unfortunately for us that was hundreds of thousands of years ago. They are long dead, their works returned to nature. Luckily this moon still has oceans and an atmosphere. Their atmosphere machines are still serviceable, just buried in the sands far below us. I can restart them. In time this moon will have an atmosphere like that of Kerbin. It may take years, decades, or even generations, but...\u0022 His voice trailed off as he looked towards Calamar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thomlock, my old friend, we can live here. All of us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe distant star of Anzol clawed its way free of the horizon, free of the clouds, and the waters of the moon shone as blue as Laythe. They both spent a few minutes enjoying the sunrise. It was a dead moon, no visible signs of life beyond themselves. Endless sand and grit. The horizon was much further away than Laythe\u0027s, suggesting to Thomlock this \u0027small\u0027 moon was much larger than anything he had yet to set his boots on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis boots. He could feel something under his right toe as he pushed himself back to his feet. He kicked at it, a lump of some volcanic rock worked its way free of the sands. Just like Laythe. Just like the beaches near the space center. Just like home. This was a living world, living yet devoid of life, waiting for its children to return home.

So much has changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve also used the much older Home Grown Rockets Vostok capsules from time to time, but that was many years ago. I actually was using the IVA from the HGR Vostok as the IVA for the Tantares one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, thanks. Shame about the ballistic capsules. Also, are you going to do more Realism Overhaul?
