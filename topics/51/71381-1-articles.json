I added some RCS fuel and thrusters, and jetted off to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon landing, a horrifying reality: My final stage rockets did not work. At all. I was falling toward Minmus at about 10 m/s with no ability to slow down and no ability to return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sometimes cheat, I admit this, but in this save, I had decided I would never cheat, not even a little. So I first started to think about ways to recover my Kerbonaut -- the famous Jebediah Kerman - because there was no way to land like this. Once I discarded my transfer stage, I would have no rocket power. There was no option to land - or was there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So don\u0027t discard your transfer stage,\u0022 some idiotic voice in my head said. \u0022Land on it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on it! Land a top-heavy vehicle on uneven terrain, with nothing to support it but the thrust chamber from your transfer stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gave it a try. And it worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo from the sheer stupidity of designing a lander that could not possibly return to orbit, to landing on a little rocket thruster, with my landing gear 30 feet off the ground, here is how it went down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI somehow managed to land on my transfer engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9ss9ht5.png\u0022 alt=\u00229ss9ht5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon returning to orbit, I transferred the fuel out of the lander into the transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6iC5k5w.png\u0022 alt=\u00226iC5k5w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I landed back at Kerbin, chastised, yes.
