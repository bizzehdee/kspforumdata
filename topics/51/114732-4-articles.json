To start with, two rovers are required (one for Gilly, and one for Eve). The rovers were slightly modified to lower the suspension a bit more (to account for the extra gravity on Eve), but for the most part, the rovers were pretty much unmodified from the Moho variant. The engineers decided that the Geep has proven itself time and time again, so it\u2019s obviously a fully robust design...Right!? (Hint: This will turn out to be a poor decision later in the mission.)\n\nTo deliver the rovers, the engineers had been using an inline rocket delivery system. After looking at intra-Eve transfer requirements for Gilly, they went with a semi-brute force method to get to Gilly and back (rather than trying to optimize the Eve arrival). So the engineers stripped off the Eeloo/Moho rover landing system and, instead, elected to recycle the Tin Poppy (Jool tug ship) as the rover delivery system for Gilly. The Tin Poppy was unmodified from its original design, and included more than enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to deliver the crew and Geep to Gilly, then return to Eve orbit. The plan was to also use the Tin Poppy to drop the Eve rover into the atmosphere in much the same way as it was used to deliver the Laythe boat.\n\n![ShdrtdL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ShdrtdL.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, the Tin Poppy doubled as the crew compartment for the interplanetary journey, eliminating the need for an additional capsule/crew compartment. This configuration, however, didn\u2019t leave space for Marissa. The Mission Director approved this decision and came up with an alternative plan for her.\n\n![DMg6nD7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DMg6nD7.jpg)\n\nThe Eve rover was a bit of a new challenge for the engineers. For the most part, rovers (and the Laythe boat) were all delivered without the need for a thermal protection system. The engineers weren\u2019t sure about the rover and all its components surviving an Eve reentry, so they set about devising a protection system. Ultimately, they encapsulated the rover inside an aeroshell, and mounted a heat shield to the bottom. (The crew manages to mount the rover seats through FM.)\n\n![nZ009Gd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nZ009Gd.jpg)\n\nWith all the major mission elements designed, the entire system was assembled.
