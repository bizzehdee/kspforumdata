If here I had transferred fuel out of the escape system and into the main tanks, perhaps... well, it would have been another 30 units of fuel that could have made a crucial difference. Quicksaving before dropping the system-lander pair was a good decision. Later quicksaves, not so much. Took a bunch of readings, took the EVA reports and surface samples, planted the flag, transferred everything to the landing cans and went for a drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/1p3m13.png\u0022 alt=\u00221p3m13.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drive went well, four RTGs providing the power to the rover wheels. Had to use the brakes to prevent the rover from rolling down the crater. Then went a kilometer or so away. Did a twist in a jump, like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/5yvsqf.png\u0022 alt=\u00225yvsqf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/EVQOux.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EVQOux.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBegan the drive back, nice and steady.

The Russian Judge didn\u0027t even bother to give it a score, instead walking out in disgust (though that may have been at his own navigation skills - how do you get lost enough to end up on another celestial body, anyway?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/wrPSWE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wrPSWE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmashed off an RTG and a headlight. Mere twisting was insufficient to return to upright. Fortunately, I had installed a SRiMech (been rewatching the old BBC Robot Wars on YouTube recently. It\u0027s a Self-Righting Mechanism.) in the form of an LT5 landing leg at the back. It was intended to put the rover onto its wheels from the back on which it is dropped, but the Pegasus ladder on the battery had proven enough when dropped onto a flat surface. I had not removed it because it balanced the front and back of the rover, and perhaps a little foresight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/crUwB4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022crUwB4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took some twisting, some pitching, and a well-timed \u0022lowering\u0022 of the leg, but I returned the rover to its wheels, and drove my way back a touch more carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/xFuaX2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xFuaX2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/LlysWX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LlysWX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook off, then went to the Poles. As you can perhaps see, fuel was low. It was coming to the point that I was unsure whether I would have the fuel to land safely, let alone take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/KDmZHX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KDmZHX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, once I emptied the escape system\u0027s fuel tanks and the balancing ballast monopropellant tanks into the main body, a safe landing was just about in reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/7jCfH1.png\u0022 alt=\u00227jCfH1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/aOR1Ky.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aOR1Ky.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I dropped the remaining rover and escape system - which is empty as you can see - took the readings and planted the flag. Then all readings and samples were transferred to a single lander can, Dozer and Harbus got back in, and I made the biggest mistake of the entire mission. F5. Yeah. So, reverting to the crater landing was no longer possible. I made several attempts at orbit, which was a no-go. Also, tried a suborbital rendezvous - very difficult and presently beyond my skill. Then tried getting out and going for it with the thruster pack at apoapse - no go, though I know it to be technically possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo small docking port on the lander, so bringing the full MES over to get a little fuel is also not an option. And the rovers are one-seat (clinging to the ladders might be okay for a slow drive, I guess), where the MES needs two or four for balance, not to mention it\u0027s a bit of a way and it was late at night. Could just go to the MES on thruster packs and hope it can do it... but really a refuel/rescue mission seems to be what is called for here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe service module has no chance of landing and refueling the lander, but it has over 300 units of monopropellant and quite a bit of fuel to power its twin nuclear engines, so I don\u0027t doubt its ability to catch orbiting Kerbonauts, just to get at suborbital ones in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lesson learned, then. Even nuclear engines need fuel, and don\u0027t quicksave too often - specifically, don\u0027t quicksave if there\u0027s any chance of wanting to return to an earlier point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-07T15:50:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2014 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Concentric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMissed a picture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Concentric","CreatedById":103320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T20:26:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERefuel/Rescue/Return\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast time, Commander Dozer was stuck in the AEGIS nuclear lander with Harbus without the fuel to take off from Mun\u0027s north pole and dock with Patny in the orbital service module. I came up with a variety of plans and \u0022plans\u0022 to get those Kerbals home, including tipping the lander on its side, then hanging onto the boarding ladders of the rover, jumping into full-power nuclear engine exhaust, then hoping to get orbit and rendezvous with thrusterpacks. Unfortunately, the lander lacked probe cores and could not operate in this fashion without leaving a Kerbal behind. (There wasn\u0027t enough fuel to run the engines while getting out, onto the rover and getting a run-up for the jump. You can see why this was a \u0022plan\u0022 - Harbus\u0027s suggestion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I looked into the long (82km directly) drive over the mountains to the remaining full escape module in the Polar Crater. I began the drive, deciding to quickload back to being in the lander should something go seriously wrong. Four RTGs provided the power, which was almost enough to just go full acceleration all the way. I drove more carefully than that, Dozer and Harbus clinging to the ladders, but evidently not carefully enough. Several rolls eventually ended up knocking off the all the RTGs and the headlights, so I reverted and began planning a rescue/refuel/return mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/F1WfGA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F1WfGA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/sfZCd5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sfZCd5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilt a quick probe with lights, power generation, RCS, reaction wheels, a docking port and a Rockomax X200-16, which should be almost twice the necessary fuel to fill the lander entirely. Then I stuck it onto a copy of Station Aleph\u0027s Fuel Tank launcher, from before I got the Mainsail. Plenty of power to get such a small thing to Mun orbit/precision-collision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/0n8GM7.png\u0022 alt=\u00220n8GM7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 8-fold symmetry can cause problems when asparagus staging with this launcher, for example a Skipper getting knocked off by the first asparagus stage going. Decided not to revert, staged again to rebalance thrust - dropping two fuel tanks and an engine - then twisted and continued the burn.

Undocked and twisted, spun back, reactivated the engines and burnt back up to orbit, leaving the lander on a firey collision course with the ground.
