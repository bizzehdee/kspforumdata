But later, I found it Time consuming,\u00A0Costly\u00A0and very InEfficient\u00A0so i Later Droped the Idea and Used the originally Abonded Plans, which was Effective and Less Costly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mission Starts with First Munar Probe, Muna-1, a Sputnik with 4 panels and 4 HG-5. Send to mun flyby on A experimental NERV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2nd mission (Some are not Included, as Probes)\u00A0Include A Direct Descent Lander, with experimental Spark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is first Manned Kerbin Orbital Mission, After a Failed orbital try, which re-enter after a few mins. This is first time a planned launcher, JOOL-I, Launcher was planned To be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but reached only 200 M/sec Delta-V of 100\u00D7100 KM circular Orbit. It was to send to Mun Cis-Lunar Orbit but, It had 10% fuel left to be later, used to Rendezvous and Docking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is First Space Station, Kalyut-1, This was used to Practice Rendezvous and Docking, JOOL-I, docked Kalyut-1 in two mission and the Whole monolithic Station was \u00A0docked, Reentered and\u00A0Recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Expansion of JOOL-I,\u00A0with Additional Boosters and A Transfer stage, JOOL-II, made it possible for Manned munar mission, Crew Capsule however was not ejected but it needed to get in. It had first EVA, Orbit and Returned after gaining A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. JOOL-II launched three times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a Mockup Test of Delta-II (Vidhyoot-II) with Lander Probe my Second launch send MUN LAB-1 Station (Monolithic), in 50\u00D750 KM mun Orbit, its temporarily Turned OFF\u00A0due to operational Cost. JOOL-II launched twice, Docked and Transferred Crew, Jeb alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVidhyoot-II launches the Kalyut-II as a Power House for Landers, Docking at Kerbin, stages fill the EC, MonoProp and A Bit Fuel. Transfer crew, Gergich/Valentina (Pilots) and Bill/Bob (Enginner at 1st and Scientist on Second), Transfer and docks Mun Lab I. Where Jeb enters and Gergich Takes us as Mun Lab-I Lead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun Lab-I Mun Lander-1 lands somewhere on 1 year, 5 Day, 4 Hrs, I did use time carefully, It took no Science but Crew Report, EVA Report, and Surfce sample, Its Ascent Stage docked Mun Lab-I, Lander was Destroyed by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E Explosives.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVidhyoot-II launches another\u00A0Kerbin Station, which is first time a Modular, later launches Mun Lab-II, which docked Mun Lab-I and renamed whole station as Mun Lab. Originally not to be modular but time makes us to rush. Mun Lab-II Mun Lander-II was heavy, Science Lander near Dark, Cratered South temperate, with all science, no Seismic sensor. It was Solar Power, All before were Fuel celled, Stations were Solar and optional Fuel Celled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResearch started, JOOL-II ferred till, i consumed almost all funds on Station and Probe\u00A0Exploration of Kerbin System. Now, Research is stopped, Stations Turned OFF, And planned 3rd Landing Cancelled. I will recover this soon, as i accumulated enough funds for lots of landings, stations, ferries and Exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJOOL-I, Vidhyoot-II are still operational, while JOOL-II is holded for MUN LAB Activation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how to put images directly to Forums, it dont work and My Imgur is Lost, I\u0027m trying to reconnect and put some pics and expand the mission further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlz help me putting some Images here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-21T12:18:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2017 12:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by PrathamK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
