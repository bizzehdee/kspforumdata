They are very exciting, and best done on fairly flat planets. The first one I made was called the \u0022Eviel Knievel\u0022 and literally got so close that the fuel tank broke off while leaving the probe unscathed. It got really close to a mun arch too. I was trying to fly through it, actually. Obviously, this orbit was not safe and would require upkeep during flight to avoid mountains. Also, this was done before the Mun changed to have the new interesting terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TYRT","CreatedById":72285,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T16:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spanier\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spanier\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis orbit will let you crash into the mountains surrounding the equatorial canyon sooner or later\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight!

I had a low flyer around Dres that just wasn\u0027t there anymore one day. I had a nice EQ orbit and I baby sat the probe for a few orbits. All seemed well. I wonder though if I was even 0.1 degrees off an EQ orbit. And over awhile the terrain shift might have been what did it in. But Idk how the game processes low flying probes that aren\u0027t active. So it might just be a code thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
