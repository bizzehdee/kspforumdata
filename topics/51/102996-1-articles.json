It takes a bit of effort, and some rockets that are not as efficient as they could be, but I try to make sure that spent rocket stages and debris in general always falls back down to the ground. Sometimes, however, it is just not reasonable to do so. So, how do we remove debris from orbit? Well, we need to build a dedicated debris removal space ship. (Which may or may not have been inspired in some part by Planetes.)\n\nUsing no mods of any kind, I quickly discovered how difficult is is to balance thrust on a non-symmetrical craft. Even with action groups for activating and deactivating trim thrusters, there were problems from the very start.\n\n![ds-14_launchfailure.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_launchfailure.png)\n\nI finally managed to get my first attempt into orbit, after many aborted launch attempts. But once there, I found that it was still a challenge to properly balance the thrust. I might get the thrust balanced, but within seconds of burning, the balance would shift against me again.\n\n![ds-14_orbit.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_orbit.png)\n\nThe solution, of course, was obvious. If the space craft wasn\u0027t going to work properly, it was an excellent opportunity to test the emergency abort system!\n\n![ds-14_abort.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_abort.png)\n\nI may have generated some extra debris to clean up in the process, but the emergency de-orbiting system worked like a charm at least. I\u0027m pleased to report that the escape pod saved the lives of the daring kerbonauts. All I had to do is make sure the boosters were pointed retrograde and it had more than enough delta-v to intersect my orbit with the atmosphere.\n\n![ds-14_deorbiting.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-14_deorbiting.png)\n\nI had to go back to the drawing board and stop worrying so much about making a cool looking ship, and worry about making a functional ship instead. Sure, it will mean a smaller budget of cool-points for the program, but having a ship that doesn\u0027t crash and burn on a regular basis is a must.\n\n![ds-15_orbit.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-15_orbit.png)\n\nThe new ship worked like a charm though. Here\u0027s a picture of the first successful capture of orbital debris in the history of my own space program. You can see that everyone on-board is super excited about it.\n\n![ds-15_capture.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-15_capture.png)\n\nTanzor Kerman goes EIVA (Extra-Inter-Vehicular-Activity) through a pressure hatch in the cargo bay to inspect the piece of debris and ensure that it is, in fact, debris. Mission control was a little bit worried that it was a coffee spill on their radar display.\n\n![ds-15_interior.png](http://knhauber.phpwebhosting.com/games/kerbal/ds-15_interior.png)\n\nDe-orbiting the debris turned out to be really simple. I just burned retrograde a few seconds, opened the cargo bay and used the RCS thrusters to push the debris out of the cargo bay, then I turned around and burned prograde for a few seconds. It didn\u0027t take much fuel, and I barely lost any altitude. Now all I need to do is establish some kind of orbital refueling infrastructure..."},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:33:21Z","Content":"What\u0027s the craft in the 4th picture?"},{"CreatedByName":"icekatze","CreatedById":78860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T05:49:35Z","Content":"hi hi\n\nThe craft in the 4th picture is the debris collector\u0027s command pod, which doubles as an emergency re-entry pod. It is based around the *Mk1-2 Command Pod*. Once the command pod is decoupled from its housing, the Kerbonauts can trigger four *Sepratron I\u0027s* that have been attached radially to the hull. After entering the atmosphere, a pair of *Mark2-R Radial-Mount Parachutes* can be deployed for a soft landing. \n\nThe four *RV-105 RCS Thruster Blocks* are leftovers from the debris craft\u0027s main RCS system, but they can potentially use some of the command pod\u0027s 30 units of monopropellant to quickly reach a retrograde orientation, but on the second debris collector model, the front RCS thrusters were moved onto the pod\u0027s housing instead of the pod itself."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T16:31:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E De-orbiting the debris turned out to be really simple.

I wasn\u0027t sure if I\u0027d have enough delta v for the mission, so used the orbiter for the initial de-orbit burn.\n\nTex\\_NL: That does sound impressive.
