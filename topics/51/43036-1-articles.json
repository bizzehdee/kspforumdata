I think this is a very cool idea. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t remember who that guy was, and the thread was lost in the Great April Derp anyways. So, I have decided to take up the idea. Not only will I be taking it up, but I will also be expanding it! Here\u0027s how this is going to work:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1)You--yes, YOU, the reader--will come up with a mission. It can be commercial, government or military, ambitious or simple, whatever. Just make sure it\u0027s achievable--there will be a basic tech tree, and a budget! (details later in the rules)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2)I will try to complete these missions within a budget. The kerbal currency is Kerbits. Each part will cost Kerbits, and of course larger craft will be more expensive. I get a Kerbit reward for completing the mission, chosen by you (max of $K150,000 for a really big mission). My current balance will be listed in this post.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E3)There will be a tech tree. This tech tree limits what parts I can use. For example, starting out I\u0027ll just have solid fuel ballistic missiles. As I move on, I will invent liquid fuel, solar power, docking, nuclear engines, etc.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4)How do I move up in the tree? I can either buy the new tech directly (for a huge cost, of course), I can spend money over time to invent it (for less money), or you can assign me a mission (within reason, of course) that will immediately invent the technology when I complete the mission (a la Gemini).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E5)If you so wish, you can hit me with a random event that complicates the race into space.

Liftoff went smoothly, and the rocket climbed to 26,000 meters. Unfortunately, the main booster then ran out of fuel, and the eight Sepratrons were not enough to lift the rocket much higher. It fell back to Kerbin and was recovered.

The new RT-12 rocket was far less flashy, with a smaller probe body and no sepratrons. However, it was well sufficient enough to launch the probe high enough to become the first confirmed kerbalmade object in space. The probe gathered data on the upper atmosphere, determining that that the atmosphere ends and space begins at approximately 50,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen asked how it felt to make history, Gene Kerman stated:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It feels wonderful to be a part of such a world-shaking event. With this success, we will be aiming even higher from here on out--orbit, kerbals in space, maybe even one day kerbals on the Mun and Minmus!
