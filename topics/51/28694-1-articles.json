Not entirely successful... Fortunately this was early in my testing of the design, all I needed was some practice with the actual landing procedure. (I have no Mechjeb or anything, the only plugins I have are the Subassembly Loader and Hyperedit; Hyperedit is only for simulations, mind you)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design seemed stable enough, so I switched out the probe cores (which I got the the same mass as the command pods to be used) for the actual crew pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext was the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2o03Zrh.png\u0022 alt=\u00222o03Zrh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fairly simple design, but nonetheless effective. It turns on a dime and has a low center of mass, so it\u0027ll be perfect for the mission. I did some simulations to see how it would handle on Mun, but Jeb crashed the VR rover, so we won\u0027t know until the final crew gets it deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher and trans-Munar parts required a little tweaking of the lander design (specifically adding fairings and some RCS blocks) but the design is primarily the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bToK3Sm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bToK3Sm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/orKGAek.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022orKGAek.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally came the crew. Since I don\u0027t have much of a choice without Crew Manifest, it was random. The game tried to give me Ellan and two other wimps, so I said \u0022No!\u0022 and loaded a new ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GOvLCTW.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022GOvLCTW.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese three seemed much more promising, despite Hanbert\u0027s low level of intellect, so I stuck with them as the final crew. The original three are now test pilots and administrators (a lot\u0027s happened since 0.18) so they won\u0027t be joining us on this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Impact;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Actual Mission\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time had come to launch the rocket only known as \u0022Mun Lander\u0022 (suggestions please!).

It might be a little beat-up, but this at least worked as a drop-test for it. ~500 meters and surviving is good... for a rover. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, the bottom center fuel tank on the launcher underwent too much stress for its pitiful structure, so it buckled and caused a chain reaction of explosions. The design team is taking this into account as they elimate that point of failure; these are the last engineers on Kerbin that haven\u0027t been fired by Puffin Technologies, so they have to get it right or else this space program will end!
