Stated the next:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a mission, like an Expedition died, and no rescue mission was launched, and successfully got the mission back, then the next Expedition that will have a mission involving docking, or landing, with the same name, code-name, or with close objectives in the next 30 years,\u00A0will have the same fate\u00A0as the previous one. For example, After loss of the crew of Extractor-5, Enirmo and his crew of Extractor-6 Died by colliding with a class C asteroid which was travelling at escape velocity of the sun. Three days after the crash, Extractor-5 crew was found dead on a Class C asteroid roaming around near Jool. Interesting enough, the Extractor-6 mission was launched 25 years after Extractor-5, and it does fall under the 30 year deadly-span. Also, if the previous Expedition is not dead, the next Expedition will not have any way of transmitting data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, due to this being only a singular situation, and has not been proven manually, the paradox was withdrawn from the scientific community, but yesterday (Duna\u0027s time), we proved it correct. Sadly, Mission control do not believe in Enirmo paradox, so guess that\u0027s what happened...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the \u0022successful\u0022 landing on Duna.

So fast that the Minister of Finance banned selling sand to Korinograd, which is probably the number one reason the crime rates there are high, and my family moved to Kerbinenko, near the Woomerang launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked at the sun, which the nerds call Kerbol, looked around, and it reminded me of a TV-Reality-show Dunival, at which the main characters survive\u00A0on Duna, but this time we are the characters, not fake actors, whom\u00A0get paid more than me in my whole lifetime. I thought that probably somewhere\u00A0there is a Extractor mission, which is now numbers over 400 missions! Yet i have not seen any smoke coming out from the extractor. While I was walking, I was keeping track of my compass. I saw the first Duna rover, Cornmaker, which supposed to bring corn on Duna to terraform\u00A0it, but terraformation\u00A0got withdrawn after Oil companies found tons of oil on Duna, maybe it\u0027s for the best. Walking another kilometer, I saw the first flag on Duna, maybe we will use it as a small defense\u00A0from Radiation and newly discovered Ooltraviolet, not Ultraviolate, the difference is that Ooltraviolet only appears after Omega-type radiation hit photons, and easily blocked by atoms which has more then 2 electrons. After a while i saw a capsule with light, and there was the Expedition 3 symbol, i thought that it was\u00A0funny, because this is the expedition that has been lost for over 5 days ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hold up... Expedition 3... 5 Days ago...\u0022 I said... No, it has nothing related to what happened.\u00A0Then, I saw the light turn on and off.\u00A0Thankfully i was on of the Elite 100, which knew Horse Kerman\u0027s code,\u00A0\u00A0and I began read the next message: \u0022S.O.S.!\u00A0W.E H.A.V.E S.N.A.C.K.S ,. J.K.E.R.M.A.N\u0022 No way! Expedition 3! Expedition 3 is found! And it\u0027s alive! I rushed back to the capsule while recording the coordinates of Expedition 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002233 East 11 North.\u0022 I wrote down while rushing to the capsule, with the max speed that Duna\u0027s gravity could possibly allow me. I was so happy! Finally our power will increase! I was so excited and happy that i even disobeyed the law of not using EVA Jetpack on bodies that are size of, or bigger than Duna! I rushed into the capsule forgot to disable the airlock, and said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022GUYS! I FOUND THEM!\u0022 I was saying with a tired, yet happy voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Found who?\u0022 Asked Marine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022YOU KNOW... UM... THEM!

That mean... WE FOUND FOOD!\u0022 The last part, her\u00A0scream knocked me off to the switches, and I pulled on, but that did not matter anymore, the lander capsule was dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022AND AT 27 EAST AND 9 NORTH THERE IS \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E EXPEDITION ONE\u0027S FARM!\u0022 Marine screamed out of happiness .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut she did not see the benefit of community strength, only of self benefits...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah... ain\u0027t that grea---\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022THAT IS AMAZING ABRAHAM! YOU ARE THE BEST!\u0022 She said, got into the space suit, and just before opening the airlock, she looked at Kerman, who was appearing to be looking sad. She came to his cage, took out a screwdriver, and opened the cage. Kerman\u0027s eyes expanded out of happiness, He shot out of the cage, and with his hug and tears, or almost drowned Marine, Or almost broke her bones. I took my spacesuit, and got out with Marine. We headed to the coordinates where I saw the lights, and it was harder now, due to the fact that it\u0027s started to be night-time. We found the newly places flag, and then, when i prepared to knock nicely on the capsule\u0027s door, Marine power punched it open with here leg, and then when we saw something that we were not expecting... something that made me almost cry out of joy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-21T23:35:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2019 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by JERONIMO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-24T01:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like in \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/188491-jeronimo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022188491\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/188491-jeronimo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@JERONIMO\u003C/a\u003E, also, can you send me a PM every time an new chapter is released?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JERONIMO","CreatedById":188491,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-24T02:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223624165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185625\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561341446\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196142\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mikenike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Mikenike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like in \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/188491-jeronimo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022188491\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/188491-jeronimo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@JERONIMO\u003C/a\u003E, also, can you send me a PM every time an new chapter is released?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, i\u0027m just now making a new one, but I try to make it as smooth as possible.

Thankfully, Bob did not cut himself open.\u00A0Sadly, Bob did cut the tube which was transferring dioxin, which has caused a huge leak of dioxin. Panic has started all over the station, I tried to open the toxic gas and Minmus-Mint storage, so the gas would get there and away from the\u00A0Soury-Mun snacks. Yet failed to do so, Valentina got to the escape pod and rushed back to Kerbin, leaving me, Bob and Jeb on the station, we had no idea what to do. We hopped into a capsule with an engine and closed the docking nodes as fast as possible. We rushed to pull away from the station, due to the fact that it started to become reddish. After getting away we started to put ourselves\u00A0on an Ike\u00A0trajectory, and hoped to land near the living zone of Ike,\u00A0but for some reason there was Koka-soda all over the control panel, and the system messed up the retrograde and\u00A0\u00A0prograde, so, on our last fuel, we got straight to Duna\u0027s surface.

I took mostly Oxygen masks, Marine took water containers and Kerman took well, surprise... snacks. We did not see most, if not all of our way, why? There was lots of dust in the air, and clouds. After making some stops to refile water for temperature control, we got there, Bill and Jebediah were waiting, and once we got there, Bill asked:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(250,250,250);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022So... where are we going to search?\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(250,250,250);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Well, i think we should start somewhere south west of here.\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(250,250,250);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Makes sense...\u0022 said Bill, before we all were following my compass south west. The roads were filled with interesting thing, an Extractor-30 petroleum extractor, which had no petroleum\u00A0in it, which made me ask, was there life on Duna?\u00A0Some scientific equipment, which was full of dust. Someone\u0027s Duna-20 EVA spacesuit, which was interesting and terrifying at the same time. After a while we saw an interesting structure, it did not look like any structure on Duna.\u00A0It\u0027s looked like the habitation module of Eve colonists, but unlike Eve\u0027s, it was made out of aluminium, not titanium... we decided to go to the structure. When we got close, we heard sounds. We couldn\u0027t recognize most of the sounds, but we did know that one of these sounds is of a working electric motor... we decided to knock on the what-looked-like a door. After we knocked on the door, we heard some groans, we waited, for a long time... what looked like an hour later, we decided that he is not here, but to be sure, we knocked on the door again. After five whole minutes, when we finally were about to leave, we saw a metal tube moving... We came back and started to watch. We heard airlock sounds sucking the air out of the lock, more metal tubes moving, and then, like in every movie, dust moved out, and himself, Bob Kerman was standing. Jebediah jumped on-to Bob, but Bob dodged him and Jebediah crashed into the what looked like a steel-carbon reinforced\u00A0airlock. Bob started to rush back to the habitation module, but Jebediahs held the door. Bob probably though that we are space pirates, for those who don\u0027t know, space pirates capture a ship, or if a big collection a station or a small colony, and steal everything. I screamed out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:rgb(250,250,250);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022HOLD UP BOB!

He had everything, from a light-bulb to an electric emergency motor. He even had an artificial snack creator (ASC)! When Kerman saw the ASC, he rushed to the snack generator and started to make his favorite Kerbal-Soda and Dunitos.\u00A0I saw a 8K pixel TV, tons of offline single-multiplayer games, tons of Konster\u00A0energy drinks, and surprisingly PK4.5, Kbox and a very powerful KC (Kerbal Computer)! If i could i would play all these games and forget about that escape from Duna plan. Marine was searching for any network transmitter, Jebediah was searching for medicine from his hurting head. I was standing and looking around, but Bill did not look happy about all of this, he was looking like disappointed\u00A0by all of this. I asked him what\u0027s wrong, but he just said that if he found this, he would bring his whole squad here, not only himself. He did have a point, but just think, you find a place in which you can literally live in this place! For almost free! Why would you want to share this palace (even though made out of literally waste metals) with other? After a while we all got really tired, Bob said that he has some spare beds if we want to stay here. Sure we want! It\u0027s not cold like in the capsule, and you actually can stretch your legs! We all agreed, but Bill, he said that he goes to back to the capsule.

Then I started to search for something that remotely looked like an oil leak or gold ore. After five minutes of riding, I\u00A0found some titanium, and started to mine it. A couple of minutes went\u00A0by before I started to see some red flashlight.\u00A0I though that the drill is overheating or the rover is to cold, so I aborted the mining after 10 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen returned back\u00A0\u00A0Bill told me that I did a nice job. While my crew was freezing to death, I decided that i\u0027ll keep the spacesuit on myself for comfort. The problem is that I really wanted to help them with getting spacesuits, but on the other hand, I wanted to get revenge on Marine for eating MY last koreo from MY lunch-box... when we were in school. Soon I think Bob realized that I\u0027m sitting with a spacesuit with a reason. So he got his spacesuit and gave everyone else\u00A0spacesuits. Well, before i\u0027m going to get beaten up for being such annoying and not helping anyone and whatever, i\u0027m just going to say that stage one for getting from Duna is complete. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I need to run from everyone as fast as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
