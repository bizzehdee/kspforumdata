It was simple; send three Kerbals to the Mun and bring them back. I built the largest inefficient rocket and named it FRED (********** Ridiculous Environmental Disaster) after the real life Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made it to the Mun with little to no fuel left on landing. I throttled a bit too much and sent the lander upwards. It ran out of fuel just as I did too, so all I could do was try not to let the thing flip as it skidded across the terrain. I didn\u0027t succeed. Upon it landing on it\u0027s side, the capsule got ejected from the base. Everything I needed to do well was on the, now labeled, debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule has two retractable solar panels and four parachutes. Meanwhile, the \u0027debris\u0027 has all of my RCS fuel, two of two batteries, and two thermal generators. And all of it was kept unexploded on impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I get to launch a rescue mission. On top of sending an empty three man capsule, I probably will come nowhere close to the crash site. I did not have a choice of where to land my first one. My ineficient rocket was put on course to literally crash into the Mun. I \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Elanded\u003C/span\u003E crashed on a hill inside a crater. So not only do I not know how far off the site I will land my rescue ship, I don\u0027t know if I need to build a rover for the Kerbals to ride to and from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T23:27:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, now you have motivation to build large, \u003Cem\u003Eefficient\u003C/em\u003E rocket.

I had to start firing it halfway into the ejection burn. And it got me to the Mun. If I made the first two stages more efficient, and hadn\u0027t crashed, I could have made a return trip easily. I might\u0027ve even had a small amount of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I might do is, after making it more efficient, add a remote guidance unit to it. Send it as a probe and transfer the Kerbalnauts. Then it\u0027s as simple as making the return trip. But in the end, I can say this didn\u0027t turn into a complete failure. I planned on having them spend a night on the Mun. I mean, I technically have no choice but to perform the mission now, right?
