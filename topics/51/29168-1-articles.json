It sounded like there were dolphins, but in space? Something was up. Explorer 2, which was planned to go into a low solar orbit, was launched. It now had a second objective, which was to find the space dolphins. Upon getting a high apoapsis, while burning to enter orbit, the noise was experienced again. The second objective was considered complete. During the Kerbin escape burn, it ended up having a Mun flyby. Sadly, it didn\u0027t enter Mun orbit. It is now in Kerbin orbit, and will soon prepare to have a Kerbin escape burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShachonianX","CreatedById":62805,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T02:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBIG NEWS: Explorer 2 has reached Kerbin escape!
