So I searched around the internet for a tutorial until I found\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULPN9LuhgK0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E. I followed it. I decided only to complete the first segment for the sake of convenience, so I followed the instructions and managed a suborbital space plane.\u003Cp\u003EI am quite pleased. Unfortunately, the tutorial does not show how to land the thing, so I had to land it myself. It was actually going well until I reactivated the rocket engine close to the ground. It crashed and exploded, and a control surface was sent on an infiniglide flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERIP, Jebediah Kerman. At least I got into space...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
