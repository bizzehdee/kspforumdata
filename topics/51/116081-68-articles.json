While Bill and Jeb didn\u0027t get thrown out of Kerbfleet for their actions, they didn\u0027t get off scot-free either. So that\u0027s one reason--the second is that right now the Fleet doesn\u0027t have a job for engineer of Comder rank or for an Air Service (full) Kernel. Note that Lt. Commander Montgomery Scott of Starfleet stayed at that rank for the entire five year mission despite repeated heroics; a promotion to Commander would have put him in charge of training engineers somewhere, or as first officer on a ship other than Enterprise.   \n\nRight now actually the ranks are all where I need them to be for the Big Darn Mission I\u0027ve always dreamed of. Val is the senior officer (excepting Adm. Shirley, of course, who no longer goes on missions). Jeb and Dilsby are of equivalent rank in different services, which gives them complementary roles supporting Val. Then we have Bill and Bob one rank further down from those two, and you can imagine that they would be in charge of the engineering and science sections of the BDM respectively with a team of looties, junior looties and enzins under them as needed.   \n\nAll is occuring as I have foreseen it!  \n\nSo, I\u0027m doing a few things now. One is taking a little break. This last bit took a lot of time, and got me a little burned out. I\u0027m putting some things together for the Postlude to E:O0 (no predicted date, sorry) and also testing ships for the BDM. The SuperPogo X1 was one of those ships. I can say so far that I\u0027ve made some really \u0027good\u0027 landings with it. We are on the X4 now :) I may open a thread to show the development progress towards BDM, and I may do that in comic form. We\u0027ll see how it goes and whether following the progress of a bunch of failed launches, emergency ejections, and not-quite-orbits tells the story I want to tell.  \n\nAs for where Kerbfleet goes next--that\u0027s already decided. Actually it\u0027s been decided for a while. So if you want to spam for a particular location or another, I think there are other threads for that. Or just go there yourselves, I\u0027m not a \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* charter service. :)"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T13:29:44Z","Content":"Well, \u0022postlude\u0022 is \u0022epilogue\u0022.
