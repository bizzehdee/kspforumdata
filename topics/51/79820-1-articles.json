The new rocket parts introduced in 0.23.5 have made me lazy and in contrast to the meticulously engineered mothership, the launcher was thrown together adding MOAH BOOSTERS until everything got up into orbit.

The burn time for this though - even taking into account the ~400dv provided by the powerful remnants of the launch stage, would be around 17 minutes. Had to split the ejection burn into two: an initial 6 minute burn, lapping around to the periapsis once more before initiating an 11 minute burn.

Unfortunately I was travelling far far faster than anticipated and hit Jool\u0027s upper atmosphere at over 9,800 metres per second. Not a complete disaster the resultant aerobrake left me with in Jool orbit with an apoapsis perfect for setting up a Vall intercept instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHastily re-writing mission plans, I figured I could probably park the mothership at Vall \u0026amp; ion tug the Laythe lander to Laythe and back. Yet the kraken was smiling, and the mere act of spending 2.4 delta-v to lift the Joolian periapsis out of the atmosphere left me with a Laythe intercept! Back to plan A. A 71dv inclination correction burn followed to put me on course for a Laythe aerobrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaythe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe, it turns out, is very particular about her aerobrake heights. Like a giant blue Goldilocks, not too much and not too little, altitude must be \u003Cem\u003Ejust right\u003C/em\u003E. First quickload of the mission was needed to learn this lesson. But after a further 70dv correction burn it turned out a 23km periapsis put the mothership in a nicely elliptical orbit around Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb undocked the lander in it\u0027s Laythe configuration, dipped his craft\u0027s orbit into the atmosphere and let gravity, air, wings, and a little assistance from the rapier engine bring him to land on one of Laythe\u0027s islands. The Laythe lander performed *flawlessly* (\u003Cem\u003Ethis would prove to be the first and last time such a statement could be made\u003C/em\u003E). Perfectly controllable at slow speeds a gentle landing was easily possible and some of the prettiest screenshots in my library were added. Laythe is soooo pretty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake-off was again flawless, and whilst atmosphere drop-off is sharper than Kerbin, orbit was achieved. Not quite enough orbit to reach the mothership, only attaining a 60km/200km elliptical, but that\u0027s an excuse to give the ion tug it\u0027s first outing. Wings and engines were blown off the core lander module into an eternal orbit around Laythe. There are no prettier graveyards in the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ion Tug arrived quickly enough, but getting the ~2 ton lander core back to the mothership was.... slow. In total 750 units of xenon gas were burnt by the single ion engine - ~26 minutes spent burning. Still, not too bad, the little tug did everything asked of it, and whilst not rapid, it was at least efficient. \u003Cem\u003EI would later learn the difference between tugging a two ton lander core and a forty seven ton Tylo lander.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything redocked and re-arranged at the mothership, the core lander is now docked onto the main lander module and the complete configuration docked at the fore of the ship.

It all went downhill from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing that dv would be tight, the ion tug was launched to ferry the lander down into a lower circular orbit. After over half an hour of burning, the lander\u0027s orbit was still highly elliptical. In the form of 47 tons of Tylo lander the little ion tug had finally met it\u0027s match. So that plan was scratched, instead of reducing the apoapsis down into a low circular orbit, we\u0027d shave the periapsis down to around 20km, come in very fast and very low, and perform a full thrust horizontal suicide burn to land. On the night side. Without landing lights. With razor thin fuel margins.

Fire both the ascent nukes and descent skipper at full thrust at 1 minute prior to 20km periapsis. This timing turned out to be bang on *perfect*, bringing me down to about 100m/s at 1000m from the surface. Slight gravity misjudgement led to my final descent accelerating far quicker than thought. Bob died.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSecond attempt: Going ok! 7m/s descent just 300m to go - and then the skipper ran out of fuel; nukes were insufficient to hold aloft the full mass \u0026amp; I wasn\u0027t quick enough to undock the descent stage before we hit the ground at 40m/s. Bob survived. The ship didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThird attempt: Disabled docking port crossfeed midway through the burn to ensure skipper had enough fuel.

Toppled over.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFifth attempt: As per the fourth. Being on the night side was really hurting. Toyed with idea of orbiting till periapsis is in daylight. Got increasingly worried about lander design - SAS is insufficiently strong to keep the lander upright if some rather shallow angles or lateral forces are present on contact.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSixth \u0026amp; seventh attempt: As per the fourth and fifth.

I\u0027d transmitted some earlier crew/eva reports during the mission so total recovered might not be maximum, but 17,291 science points recovered - of those, 525 points were incidentally gathered high over the sun on the outbound journey, so 16,766 science recovered from the Joolian system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this mission also started in KSP version 0.24 (and finished in version 0.24.2) we also had contracts! I\u0027d not paid a great deal of attention to these, but had managed to pick up exploration contracts for Bop, Pol, and Jool, bringing in a total of 1,267,330.18 funds and 3,049.565 reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost of the complete vessel on the launchpad, including LKO lifter is 840,243.1 funds (in 0.24.1\u002B prices - 0.24.0 prices were fractionally different) - so I can even say this mission paid for itself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMothership delta-v breakdown\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin - Jool: 2012dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool - Laythe: 143dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe - Vall: 827dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVall - Tylo: 240dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo - Pol: 582dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol - Bop: 550dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBop - Jool: 16dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool - Kerbin: 1363dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Mothership dv expended: 5,733dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow obviously, for future missions, I\u0027ll add at least 10% wiggle room to that total, plus at least another 700 to account for my seemingly lucky Kerbin return.

I burnt a total of 214 units. At least 100 of those were spent trying to supplement the ion tug\u0027s woeful thrust at Tylo, and in addition, thanks to the modular design (and a slight design oversight) I had to perform an above average number of docking manoeuvres.
