I wanted to be able to finish it before it was out, otherwise I\u0027m just another \u0022hey I\u0027ll do the movie\u0022 rather than \u0022hey I\u0027ll do the book\u0022 guy.

Everyone will see the movie though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally understand your concerns. However you could preface the series with a warning that your infrastructure is based on your interpretation or imagining of the book. Honestly it would be fantastic to see your replicas from the movie AND it would be fantastic to see what you could do with your imagination. Also an RSS version would be different from anything else that might exist or will exist. Let\u0027s be honest people are gonna make stock kerbal versions of the Martian. No one does RSS series like you. So maybe do a poll and put out feelers because I guarantee KSP fans that have read the Martian want to see YOUR interpretation. Of course it\u0027s all up to you. You have to want to do it. But if you think that people won\u0027t watch because of the movie coming out.....trust me people will watch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T05:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now optimistic about Odyssey #47 for this Monday.
