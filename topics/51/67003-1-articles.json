Playing all-vanilla atm. I\u0027m building my first Mun Base and looking for feedback on designs and also just to show off a bit too. I\u0027m playing in career mode and have not unlocked the entire tree yet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FfCyDLn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FfCyDLn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve landed Jeb on the surface and he is holding down the fort. So far I\u0027ve sent him a rover and a science lab. The lab is unmanned, waiting for the next kerbal to join him (I also missed the landing by ~2km lol) as well as a rover with a better seat design that I have ready to be sent up next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next steps past what I have already built will be developing some sort of science rover that can dock to the lab to be able to reuse experiments. (Ideas on designs would be greatly appreciated) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be posting pics with some updates on progress as I expand the base!

After 3 attempts at sending up a rover, I realized 2 things. First: Always test the height of your docking equipment on the launchpad or somewhere at the space center before you send them to the Mun.. Second: Driving in low-G is not easy (i blew up the Rover once and had to quickload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ETHIS IS THE UN-MANNED VERSION.

I need a whole new design.. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t think to grab some screens building and launching. I will try remember to get some screens of the whole delivery system in the Hangar and post them, it is a very odd design but it worked. I do have some action shots though! It was a 2 rocket design and was actually kind of difficult to keep flying straight under thrust of more than about .75G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new \u0022Mun Car\u0022 in low-Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UbOZykd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UbOZykd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jfP8TrD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jfP8TrD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun Car was a terrible design for fuel efficiency, but I have trouble with the builder still (I hope it\u0027s not just me, the builder is so awkward sometimes) so I really didn\u0027t want to re-design it. It took several f5/f9 presses before I got it to the Mun\u0027s surface. I ran out of fuel during descent several times. I got it to the surface, but about 20km away from base.. so.. I took the rover delivery lander, which still had a small amount of fuel left) It got me to about 5km away and the rest was up to Steve.. I first attempted the journey at night.. and after realizing you should never travel at night on the lunar surface w/o lights, I time warped to the day side of our orbit and went to retrieve my new Mun Car. The trip there took maybe 5 minutes, using the RCS thrusters to glide over the surface from the lander to the rover. The trip back took about an hour. The Mun car is much more stable than the other rovers and built waaay better. The problem now is going too fast and launching off bumps and small hills. I blew the rover up once and had to f9. I did manage to eventually get it back to the lab, AND DOCK IT!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to get the Mun Car, at night.

Lesson learned, practice docking your stuff before using it! I thought about this ahead, after landing the lab and first rover and the rover wouldn\u0027t line up perfect to dock. I decided to put small engines on all 4 corners of the new car and use them to lift it up to the highest docking port (the other 2 were too low)..

Once I had the approach down, I sent a lander.. The Mun\u0027s gravity makes it a lot easier to land on that you would think. It took a couple of quicksave/loads to get my first landing (which i don\u0027t have here, it\u0027s not part of the base). Once I i figured out how to land I decided to just make the jump to a Mun Base.
