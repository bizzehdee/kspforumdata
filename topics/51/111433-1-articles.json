In this career mode, I will post pictures and reports of my missions, from the shortest one at the start to (hopefully) long ones to the Mun, and beyond, all the way to Eeloo! I will probably post the first update in a few days, as right now I am a little busy, and I will perhaps post 1-2 missions each day after that! I am sorry for any mistakes I make along the way, as I am pretty new to KSP, about a week old.

Proving to be the agency\u0027s best kerbonaut with his outstanding piloting skills on some supersonic experimental aircraft, Jebediah Kerman has been selected to complete yet another first.

As for the heatshield being covered, (there was one!) it was because I needed to recover the science from the Science Jr, and I am not sure how the shield would be if placed on the Jr. Anyways, more adventures will follow soon! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T22:05:31Z","Content":"Another update, this time a rather basic flight, but it was my first spaceplane, and Valentina got the honor of flying it!
