will be powered by nine upgraded engines, The Chorus 1C.\u00A0 The engine will power the rocket from lift off to stage separation, the stage will also include elements of the Space Transportation System, such as the parachute to attempt to splashdown the first stage in the ocean after lift off if possible.\u00A0 The second stage of the Melodia 9 Rocket will be powered by 1 vacuum optimised

currently being integrated with MS2C.2 and would be moved to the launch site once M9S2PFT-1 (Melodia 9 Stage 2 Prototype Fuel Tank 1) had completed its testing.\u00A0 This testing includes

stage of the rocket, which will be attempting a splashdown in the ocean after lift off through parachute.\u00A0 The first stage is powered by 9 Chorus 1C engines, these are expected to run out of fuel approximately 3 and a half minutes into flight.\u00A0 By this point the Melodia 9 launch vehicle will have used 30% of its take off weight in fuel.\u00A0 Just prior to the separation of the two stages, the parachute systems will be armed and the 2 Stage 1 retro propulsion rockets will be activated, these pull the first stage away from the second stage.\u00A0 At this point the entire vehicle weighs just under 20,000kg.\u00A0 Stage 2 is powered by a vacuum optimised Chorus 1C Engine (C1CV).\u00A0 This will power the payload and the second stage into a trajectory intersecting the target orbit, at which point the vehicle will shut off its engine and coast to the highest point in its trajectory.

9.\u00A0 This satellite will be orbiting at geostationary altitude, meaning that the Melodia 9 will need to perform two burns during this mission, consequently the software handling this will be tested during the last flight of Melodia 1.\u00A0 The countdown of the booster went smoothly, with the rocket lifting off as normal, during launch it became apparent that the payload had broken free from its separation device, upon the occurrence of SECO-1, the payload drifted away from the vehicle.\u00A0 Yet all eyes were glued to the orbital insertion burn, hoping that it would succeed.\u00A0
