Upon closer inspection it turned out to be a extremely large asteroid. After calculating its orbit, the best calculations show that the people of Kerbin have a mere 5 years before this asteroid rains down destruction upon their green, lush planet. Gene Kerman, and the crew at KSC, don\u0027t believe their is a chance that they will be able to redirect it. So begins a top secret project to insure the survival of the Kerbal race.* \n\n**Scenario:**\n\nThe main goal of this mission log is to ensure the survival of the Kerbal race by colonizing other planets withing the Kerbol system within the allotted time frame. Once year 5 (time from is flexible but im pretty sure i can accomplish in that amount of time) has been reached, no more rockets or kerbals can be launched form Kerbin (as it will be devastated) However they can continue launching from any colonies that have been established already (I.E. a Mun Base etc) With the end goal being a large colony on Laythe it being the only semi-habitat planet in the Kerbol System other than Kerbin, and as many other colonies as possible. \n\nWe are currently set to Career mode with the tech tree unlocked to the limit of the Tier 1 Science Center (Also using Community Tech Tree, for a more in depth Tree \n\n\u003E ![SFkXB2e.png](http://i.imgur.com/SFkXB2e.png)\n\nTo help facilitate realism the following mods are used to help add challenge and fun: (will post a more complete list later) \n\n- **MKS/OKS** - The basis on which to build colonies on other planets\n- **Kerbal Construction Time(KCT)**- So that rockets actually take time to build, adding to the challenge of the deadline.\n- **TAC Life Support** - Because whats a Colony without life support.\n- [**Extra Planetary Launchpads**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-0-90-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-1-2)- Ability to build rockets and ships off world.\n- [**Civilian Population**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112142-90-Civilian-Population-1-2?highlight=reproduction) **-** To simulate the civilian population we hope to bring along and survive (also allows for recruitable kerbals!)\n- **Deadly Reentry** - For reentry heat\n- **Ferram Aerospace Research** - For better spaceplanes!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  To be added later (real soon!)\n\n**Chapters**\n\n- [Prologue -\u0022The Story Begins](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113403-Project-Phoenix-%28Image-Heavy-Soon%29?p=1792489\u0026viewfull=1#post1792489)\u0022\n\n-\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T04:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T04:07:27Z","Content":"*A cheer went up in the Kerbal Mission Control as the new \u0022Kentaur I\u0022 rocket lifted off the pad carrying the long awaited Kubbel Space Telescope.

We should be receiving the first images shortly!\u0022*\n\n***2 Weeks Later:***\n\n*Gene Kerman looks up from his paperwork as a sharp insistant knock sounds on the door. Without waiting for a response, Bob Kerman walks into the office carrying a thick stack of papers and what appear to be rolled up photographs.* \n\n*\u0022What is it Bob? Im sort of a busy here.\u0022 Gene says, motioning to all the papers stacked up on this desk.* \n\n*\u0022That can wait Gene, you have the see this.\u0022 Bob replies, swiping all of the piled paperwork to the floor, much to Gene\u0027s dismay.* \n\n*Bob unrolls the large photographs across the program directors desk, and lays one finger on a large dark spot on what appears to be a photo of Duna.* \n\n*\u0022These are some great images Bob, from our new Space Telescope yes?\u0022 Gene asks, \u0022But whats the big deal, ive seen several pictures already, the program appears to be a great success thus far.*\n\n*Bob taps the dark spot on the image again, insistantly. \u0022This Gene. This is the big deal.\u0022* \n\n*Gene squints down at the spot \u0022What is it? Is our new telescope developing problems already?\u0022*\n\n*\u0022That was our first thought, sir. But after running every test possible, everything is nominal\u0022 Bob frowns and sighs heavly.* \n\n*\u0022Well then... what is it?\u0022 Gene asks, somewhat impatiently.* \n\n*\u0022That sir , is a object, a very large object, by our best estimates, a very... very large asteroid, you could even call it a planitoid, approximately 80% the size of Gilly sir. And the bad news sir, it\u0027s on an intercept couse with Kerbin.\u0022*\n\n*Gene looks up, flabbergasted \u0022Are you sure Bob? How long do we have?\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Absolutely sure, sir. We\u0027ve rechecked its position using our most powerful ground telescopes. Though without confirmation from the Space telescopes, the anomaly might have just be chalked up to a piece of dust on the lens. If our calculations are correct, the object will be in our path in approximately 4 and a half years.\u0022*"}]}
