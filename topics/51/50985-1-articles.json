The goal: Visit the Jool system, and have a Kerbal on all of its moons simultanously, with one mission. It sounds krazy, but this Werner kerbalguy is convinced it is the cheapest mission to do the job. So after he disappeared from our basic training some month back, he came to me with this idea. After my successful Dona landing and probing of Eve, he asked me to send a probe to Jool. Unfortunately, the mission was unsuccessful because our batteries went flat and the thick atmosphere didnt let enough light through to refill our batteries. So we have a second try, \u0022And this time do it right!\u0022 he said. Of course, I couldn\u0027t say \u0027no\u0027 so here I am. There is one complication though, Werner is very impatient, so he decides that we have to go to Jool at once, he has no time to wait for an other launch window to emerge in one year, so we have to go in one piece. Also there is only a limited supply of 6 atomic rocket motors. Better bring them all back!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mission details are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend one shipto the Jool system, and return in one ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave 8 kerbonauts on the trip. They need to be comfortable, give them room to live and perform experiments during their travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteer a robotic probe into Jool and have it stripped of all of its science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on all of its moons with at least one Kerbal each simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBring a surface probe from all of the moons back to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep a science probe on the surface of all of the moons, for long term study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse at maximum 6 Atomic Rocket Motors. Bring them all back safely to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the plan is, to build the spaceship in Kerbin orbit before heading out to Jool. In Jool, aerobreaking is used to get into an orbit. After that, detach the landers and recombine them with some cruising stages to get them to the moons and back to the ship. Use the 6 Atomic rocket motors for that, so make them detachable as well and use them with some transport fuel to do the taxiing. After all Kerbels are back, use the return vessel to get back to Kerbin. Leave the used lander modules and empty fuel tanks behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will keep you posted of our progress. Its not going to be easy though. Maybe impossible. But Werner demanded that I shall not ask for help from other space programs (no mods that alter game-play). Do it the Kerbal way: Failure is always and option!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe and Jebedia have already done some tests. The Laythe lander for example is able to get into an 80km Kerbin orbit. That should be ok.

Does anybody know how much fuel Tylo requires compared to Laythe? Maybe it requires an extra fuel tank below the batteries? I dont know. Maybe the 4 engines are not strong enough to ensure a safe landing? But I dare take more powerful ones, because they might be too heavy or thirsty to do the job! This ship can launch on Kerbin, so it (in theory) can land on Tylo.

But Werner just shook his head (almost shook it off looked like it). It was too unstable dangling all behind the connecting stage, so I had to redo my design. I came up with this solution: Connect the tanks with additional docking ports to make them more stable. They have to be aligned perfectly though. So maybe Ill connect them in orbit first before putting them on the connector. Lets see when we are there. If they are all together and connected, it should look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HWdivQz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HWdivQz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sideways docking ports that stick out are for the rocket engines. They need to be detachable because they should be used to cruise the landers around in the Jool system. Jebedaia likes my design a lot, he is somehow fan of huge spacecraft that fall apart and reassemble again. Only Wernher Von Kerman seems to be a little conservative and said, the engines need to be more stable as well. So I made a small docking port on the sides again in order to give them more stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iL35MCC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iL35MCC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was quite satisfied. Of course, the struts will be gone once, all the engines have been used. But on the return trip, all the tanks are much emptier and all the science modules will be missing as well, so the reduced stability might be compensated by the fact that the space ship will be much lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, the probe that goes into Jools atmosphere needs special treatment. Because of the thick atmosphere, solar panals dont work. So what ever energy is required needs to be taken with it. And the spacecraft cant really return either, so it has to deliver lots of science, using lots of energy. And it has to be transmitted fast before the gravity crushes the probe. So here it is, it will be sitting on the top of the Jool Spaceship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B0FxXHl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B0FxXHl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher already made more comments to the earlier parts.

Jebediah named it \u0027Green Moskito\u0027. Dont know where he got that from, but it got stuck. Maybe it will bite into the green Atmosphere of Jool when we arrive and airobrake (hopefully). As I was saying, I was heading over and Wernher just stood in my way and said I should put all the parts together in the intigration hall. Our zero-gravity design hall will be ideal to see if everything works if it is put together. So we went there and connected all the parts, one by one.

Especially going into Jools atmosphere with the first stage. Last time, I had many batteries as well, but I got no were near half way through the science before the juice run out. I cant use solar panels in the atmosphere as well because they get blown away. So I suspect, that I will not be able to get all the science from Jool, despite the heavy use of bateries. The bateries on the landers are for the same reason: I want science during descent, and that needs to happen fast, so a big buffer is required again. The bateries on the connection stage are not really necessary for their energy, rather than for the distance they add to the structure. Batteries are one of the lightest elements you can use to elongate your ship. Also they provide energy for the Kerbals remaining in the ship for the time thy are in Jools shadow. I put a ship into Jools orbit for the first time. The last one ended up descending into Jool because I chose a too close approach to Jool during aero-capture. It didnt made it out again, so I guess I was just a hair too close. Wernher von Kerbal punished me with this mission for that mistake. Better not do it again! Anyway, due to my lack of experience, all the parts are necessary because I want to make sure the mission is a success. So that means to bring extra! And it doesnt hurt (much) to have some extra. As for the fuel, I guess I have enough. In the tank-engine modules are three orange tanks worth of fuel, plus extra from the structure of the connector and the atomic engine modules.. so maybe around 3,5-4 orange tankes to get there, cruise around and return. Should be ok. If not.. ohh well. We have to send a rescue mission. And because we dont have atomic rockets any more (we have only 6, remmeber?), sending fuel would be a pain. We do it the Kerbal way!

After putting the first tank-engine into orbit, number 2 and 3 followed close behind, this time with more RCS fuel.

Unfortunately, it was nighttime when it arrived, but for exactly that reason, we brought some lights with us!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m6wcQpt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m6wcQpt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, something about the access fueltanks has to be done. I really did not anticipate to have so much fuel left in orbit. I guess, we will have to build a refulling station somehow. I dont know what to use it for to be honest, but since we have all that fuel, what else should we do with it? Before we start with that, we condense all the fuel in one tank. Then, we can deorbit the two empty fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XtWVilx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XtWVilx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter we disconnect the second tank, the solar panals are opened for the first time and we watch the tank burn up in Kerbins atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZtcKHCa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZtcKHCa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe cant watch the actual burning part, its too far away from the station, but it surely must have looked great with binoculars, which we dont have at the Green Moskito. Finally, the remaining fueltank from the connector stage is docked on the side of the connector port. That was kind of an issue because the Green Moskito wiggled and wobbled as soon as SAS was activated and it rotated if it was not. How can you build a giant station-space-ship if things dont work as intended?? Well.. we will have to deal with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4NpveVT.png\u0022 alt=\u00224NpveVT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext will be the Jool atmospheric probe and maybe one of the landers.

Due to the wired physics near large contraptions, the docking procedure became quite challenging. Especially because I build the lifting stage wrong! I forgot that the atmospheric probe is going to sit with its engine nosels towards the green moskito, so I should have mounted it upside down on the lifting stage. However, I didnt, and so in orbit, I had to perform two docking maneuvers, one for the atmospheric probe itself, and one for the tank. It had quite some RCS fuel with it, so I transfered that before deorbiting the rocket. There was not much real fuel left, so that wasnt really worth the trouble, but I didnt want to waste the RCS fuel. And because the solar panels had to line up perfactly, I had to dock the atmospheric probe twice! In my first atampt, I got impatient and turned the probe too far just a second before docking, which made it impossible to recover. What a nerve wracking procedure. Here the green moskito with the lifting stage still attached. I used a smaller one, since the probe was way lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OzATfbc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OzATfbc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat a wonderful sight the Green Moskito is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EBzkBN8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EBzkBN8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the lifting stage was de-orbited, Jebediah and I decided to dock the first lander. This was going to be exciting, because it meant we are finally close to finishing the spaceship! I thought however, that Jebediah might have some mad plan in Mind, so I checked the lander before lifting it. And sure enough, he hid in the space-suit cupboard in the landing capsule! But this time, I was smarter than him. He got a special mission for the remaining lift-offs: clean the heli-pad of the vertical assembly building. And I hid a tracking device on his jetpack, so I can check where he goes. Hope that teaches him. I have my doubts though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PtkUgFK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PtkUgFK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter docking, we again transfered the RCS fuel and ditched the lifting stage into the atmosphere. Hopefully it does not fall on anybodies head. Now, we have a beautiful space ship, and only 5 landers missing. Thats a piece of cake! But before we lift them, I guess, we have to build a space station to have some place for all the fuel in orbit. Maybe at 100 km, so we can make use of the left-over fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gjDxHrg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gjDxHrg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziv","CreatedById":91995,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a Challenge on this kind of mission, check that out! -\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-THE-ULTIMATE-JOOL-5-CHALLENGE-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-misson\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-THE-ULTIMATE-JOOL-5-CHALLENGE-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-misson\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Marten2Productions","CreatedById":101256,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T10:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1000?!
