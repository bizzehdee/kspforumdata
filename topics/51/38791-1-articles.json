So last night after having update to 0.21, of course the SPH is the first place I went. I made some small little jet, that was pretty decent, but I wanted something better (Bigger and Faster!) So I decided to take after a pic of someone else\u0027s craft i had seen, something like a giant flying riangle, with the engines and cockpit underneath. Now it didn\u0027t really come out like that, the wings weren\u0027t form like the big Dorito I was going for, cause I guess I was just being lazy i guess, and this was just supposed to be a test craft for the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot0_zpsfb4a0a7f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zpsfb4a0a7f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot5_zps1ba9323e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5_zps1ba9323e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot2_zps26de0adb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2_zps26de0adb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when it came to flying this thing, took off pretty good, i had flipped an earlier model very violently but anywho...in flight it was, well not the best, pitchin up or down when it felt like it, and had to use the softened controls (caplocks) Using the trim to level the ship worked fairly well, except for some reason eventually the trim would get funky and start flipping out, and diable my roll to the left, and only go right (I think one of my Alt keys is messed up) so mostly ened up making my own adjustments the whole time. After being up for a minute, I figured i wouldgo after the Second Space Center, but being adventurous, I just went where i though I Remember it being when I saw some map some time ago (I never found it...ooops) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo giving up I decided to just fly around Kerbin, and then wanted to see how high i could get. After getting around 10,000-15,000m i started burning up in the atmosphere, and was a man-made fire ball for while\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot3_zps8778aed8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3_zps8778aed8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot1_zps8fcfaba3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1_zps8fcfaba3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeventually getting to 20,000m, I figured out thats where the air seems to run out and cut out my engines, but not all at the same time of course, so one sided still powere for an extra few seconds, sent me into a deadly spiral. As I was spinning out of control, one of my engines snapped off, and the uneven thrust sent me spinning worse, so I jettisoned the second side engine leaving me with the one center one...yay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot6_zps9020b916.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6_zps9020b916.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot7_zpsf814710b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7_zpsf814710b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily gained control and checking my map, realized I was close, and heading towards the Arctic, and made that my destination. But as i got that sweet white snow in my view on the horizon, I noticed the fuel to my remaining engine was getting fairly low, and was worried I wouldn\u0027t make it, or at least i would be stranded in the arctic. But I remembered that cause I lost two engines, there should still be some ample amount of fuel left in thier tanks, and alas there was, and i realized that you can transfer fuel between you tanks, I mean I\u0027ve known you could when docking and what not, but didn\u0027t realize you could on same craft, guess I never really needed it before so...whatever. IN doing that, i drained one side first...not a good idea, cause leaving extra weight on the right side causing the plane to roll over, so struggling to empty the right side while keeping upright, I almost crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot8_zps6ce5df24.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8_zps6ce5df24.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot11_zpsf43f5df6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11_zpsf43f5df6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing on my journey with restored fuel, I came into the arctic! I was feeling proud, It was the longest flight I\u0027ve made, or at least one in full control, and I\u0027ve had some trouble, and made my way through it. I was really starting to appreciate this game like I hadn\u0027t before, it was awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was actually doing something rather than making some short lived craft on a useless flight. So I ended up getting near the pole, cause my compass was starting to rotate, and, well I passed it, ooops... So i circled back around, and started to power down and and get as close to the pole as I could, and BOOM I laned! I wasn\u0027t as close as I wanted to be, and cause my plane didn\u0027t really like to yaw very well, i can\u0027t taxi my way to the pole, and I din\u0027t add a ladder so I can\u0027t even make the final hike to the pole, if I ever want to return my Kerbal Home...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1294.photobucket.com/albums/b610/GrizzlyJones7/screenshot12_zps1c9250e3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12_zps1c9250e3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I am, landed near the North Pole on Kerbal, Successful on this Test flight of a new plane, to place I haven\u0027t been, where I hadn\u0027t even planned to go...and I\u0027ve acquired a new appreciation for this amazing game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to eventually return to KSC and bring back the news to my family, but for I\u0027ll enjoy the fluffy white goodness!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T23:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHint: the last engine you place on your craft flames out first.
