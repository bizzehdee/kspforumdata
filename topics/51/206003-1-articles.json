Consequently, this is the first mission I\u0027ve flown that required close to optimal piloting, and a lot of quicksaves and reloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, no docking or refueling, no part detachment shenanigans. This is a purist single stage craft that I fly as far as it can go. I don\u0027t use ion engines either, because I don\u0027t like ions - they\u0027re a hassle to work with. If I were to use ions, I might possibly be able to do a fourth landing, but I\u0027m not willing to try it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that the Laythe Star is not quite at the peak performance of a liquid fuel craft. I\u0027ve had better performance with three Rapiers and two Nervs for a 105 ton plane. However, the part count means that landings and takeoffs have to be done at quite a low frame rate, and vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E will be lower, requiring more periapsis kicks. In other words, it would be a lot less fun to fly, and the plane as-is can pull off the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStats of the mission:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe craft is composed of a Rapier and a Nerv, as well as six strakes, which I\u0027ve arranged into a star shape purely for aesthetics purposes. Almost all of the rest of its 39 ton mass is Mk0 fuel tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn this mission, I perform 49 gravity assists, which is more than I\u0027ve ever done before in a single mission. The bodies used were: Mun x15, Kerbin x13, Eve x7, Tylo x7, Laythe x6, Minmus x1. The Minmus assist was to prove that a Kerbin-Mun-Mun-Minmus-Mun-Kerbin-Mun-Eve route was viable in a real mission rather than just a proof of concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll gravity assists and burns over 1 m/s are shown in the video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XH3Geh7MeoY?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
