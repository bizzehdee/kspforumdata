How Aldner and Nelemy should proceed south from Barad-Dur was a bit of a conundrum because there were lots of steep features in the way, despite what Jeb\u0027s KerbalMaps indicated. Swinging to the left (east) would have taken them back to the Dead Marshes and they would traverse the same terrain that they covered on their way north. That would be boring. Swinging right (west) would take them further afield...and there was a large scarp along that path. So Aldner chose the central route toward a very tall feature...but it looked like there might be a path through the mountains there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kn92rHK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kn92rHK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a overview of the path south from Barad-Dur.

The reason Minas Tirith looked so much taller is because there is a large crater just to the north of Minas Tirith, giving the mountain a very steep and high north face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JhOYTWd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JhOYTWd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the view of Minas Tirith in the distance, and an overview of the area, looking southward.

The place I wanted to send Emilynn and Hellou was the next basin to the south of Minerva, which they named Juno Basin. This basin has a small area (see map below) of negative elevation, and I wanted to see if the same buggy behavior happens there as it did when they drove to the lowest spot on Vall (several episodes and KSP versions ago).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EKAAMnj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EKAAMnj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd indeed it does. When the Fido drove to sufficiently low elevation below zero, the surrounding landscape went dark despite the sun being in the sky. Hellou\u0027s suit lamps on EVA could light up the rover and ground.

The Guardian was designed to protect Kerbin from asteroid impacts. Below we see the ship. It launches on the new Kerbodyne Big Advanced Reusable Rocket with reusable core and (if the game designers would cooperate) reusable boosters. The Guardian ship is derived from the Big Advanced Tug, with the addition of radiation shields to protect the crew capsule from the gamma and neutron flux while the nuclear engines are in operation. An asteroid Claw/Recovery-Unit sits on the very top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/alIbSJY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022alIbSJY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is an abort simulation: If the rocket veers off from its flight path, all engines are shut down, the boosters are separated on their parachutes, the nuclear engine nacelles are separated on their chutes, and the capsule is pushed free by six sepatrons. The sustainer and tug body fall to crash and explode, but chances are (tests show) that three or four of the side boosters, all of the nukes, and the crew capsule would be safely recovered by parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wu9Q3p1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wu9Q3p1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe project\u0027s first crewed test flight began as Guardian 1 lifted off with Commander Adly Kerman and pilot Rondorf Kerman on board. The rocket boosted vertically to 13 km where the side boosters burned out and separated. The sustainer started its gravity turn at 14 km. The boosters are equipped with parachutes and landing legs so that they can be recovered at KSC (if the game supported this...I certainly hope it will soon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bMnr2o1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bMnr2o1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear engines were used to assist the sustainer core into orbit so that enough fuel remained in the core for it to return and land at KSC on its engine flame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hb36QyC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hb36QyC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Guardian 1 mission was tasked with checking out the ship in orbit for a long duration, and chasing down any small asteroids that might appear during its mission...any Class A or B for this initial test mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jY8IZ7D.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jY8IZ7D.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it so happened, a Class B object was spotted approaching from below Kerbin. It was already within Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence when spotted, and its orbit was nearly perpendicular to the Guardian\u0027s orbit (slightly retrograde, in fact). So...How do you catch an asteroid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pFiCVoJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pFiCVoJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Perform a burn to extend the apoapsis of Guardian\u0027s orbit out to the point where the asteroid\u0027s orbit crosses through the plane of the Guardian\u0027s orbit. That took a burn of 599 m/s in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y1L01a5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y1L01a5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V0JiSZw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V0JiSZw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: At the apoapsis point, perform a burn to shift the Guardian\u0027s orbit to match the plane of the asteroid\u0027s orbit. This is done at apoapsis because that is the most fuel efficient way. This was a big burn of 1286 m/s because of the 113-degree plane shift needed here. If you know ahead of time what plane the asteroid will be in, you could save fuel by launching from Kerbin into that plane to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9tantxZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229tantxZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w8elgrW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w8elgrW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: OK, here\u0027s where I made a mistake. I noticed that the Guardian\u0027s apoapsis was not quite touching the asteroid\u0027s orbit. So I foolishly dropped back to periapsis and made a little adjustment burn to change the apoapsis. Then I looked to see about rendezvousing with the asteroid...BUT it turned out that on the Guardian\u0027s next arrival at apoapsis, the rock would be somewhat short of that point...and on the orbit AFTER that, the rock would be about that same distance BEYOND the apoapsis point. Instead of tweaking the apoapsis point, I should have made another burn at apoapsis (right after the plane shift burn there) to raise the ship\u0027s periapsis in order to increase its orbital period such that it would arrive back at its apoapsis at the same time the asteroid got to that point. Silly me. (I thought the asteroid was still far enough out that I\u0027d have plenty of time to fool around in orbit, but that wasn\u0027t the case.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3b: So, instead, I had to push the Guardian\u0027s apoapsis out further to lengthen its orbital period and get a rendezvous with the rock (see plot below). And then I\u0027d have to make a bigger burn at the intercept point. Sloppy. But it got the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f88WcRx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f88WcRx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Plot Rendezvous. I placed a maneuver node at the intercept point, and then I dragged the prograde/retrograde AND the radial-plus/radial-minus handels as needed until the projected orbit matched that of the asteroid\u0027s orbit, including having the same point where they would leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI. That big 1230 m/s burn could have been smaller if I had not made my earlier mistake. But the Guardian has fuel to spare, since it\u0027s designed to handle larger asteroids as well as small ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FH9I755.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FH9I755.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: Rendezvous Burn. Below, we see the Guardian 1 most of the way through its rendezvous burn as the ship and the rock approach the intercept point. After the burn, the asteroid was located about 5 km from the Guardian. Then it was just a matter of pointing at the rock...thrusting toward the rock...if you miss, point retrograde to the ship\u0027s motion relative to the rock and stop at the point of closest approach...then lather, rinse, and repeat until you are close enough to start the docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tI56TMC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tI56TMC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Docking. Before docking, I lined up the Guardian so that it was pointing retrograde relative to its ORBITAL motion. Then I kept that attitude while using the RCS to slide over behind the asteroid and grab it with the claw. This way they ship would be pointed in the correct direction to immediately retrofire and slow the asteroid down for capture (no need to rotate the asteroid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/heku8py.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022heku8py.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D7E90e7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022D7E90e7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 7: Point to CoM. After docking, free the pivot of the claw and adjust the ship\u0027s direction as needed so that the ship is pointed at the Center of Mass of the asteroid. Then lock the pivot.

So I was frantically right-clicking on all of the chutes to get them deployed (in the mayhem, I accidentally cut one of the deployed chutes loose). I managed to get them all deployed above 800 feet...which is where they began to fully deploy in tweaked sets of two to gradually slow the rock to about 10 m/s (it would have been under 10 m/s had the other chute not been lost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WQoO23M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WQoO23M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe asteroid landed safely in the field west of the R\u0026amp;D building where the eggheads would have handy access to it.

Maneuver Mayhem!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time that Aldner and Nelemy we making the Great Tylo Drive, Thompbles and Kurt were dealing with the incoming payloads for exploring Bop and Pol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bop ship was coming into the Jool system first. It had originally been targeted toward Laythe, where I thought it would be best to use Laythe\u0027s atmosphere to aerobrake the payload into Jool orbit. But I later realized that a gravity-assist capture would be better (after having done that with the Tylo exploration equipment). The original trajectory toward Laythe would not work for gravity-assist capture because the ship was not coming in tangentially to Laythe\u0027s orbit...so the trajectory would need to be shifted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as the path was being shifted, it was decided to shift it out for a TYLO gravity-assist capture. This has the advantage of leaving the ship in a higher orbit, which is a plus when you are headed to the outer moons. So, just inside Jool\u0027s SOI, a maneuver node was plotted with prograde/retrograde (to adjust when the ship arrived) and radial \u002B/- (to shift the trajectory out to be tangent with Tylo\u0027s orbit) as shown below. The Tylo passage was adjusted so that the apoapsis of the resulting orbit would be out by Bop\u0027s orbit. The trajectory was also adjusted in the Normal \u002B/- direction so that the resulting orbit was much closer to the inclination of Bop\u0027s orbit. This tweak only required 52 m/s of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9gyuz3H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229gyuz3H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The parallel DoubleTugs of the Bop ship perform the Tylo-pass targeting burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ug2GWde.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ug2GWde.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo days later, a similar trajectory shift was applied to the Pol Ship\u0027s trajectory to shift it away from its originally-targeted Laythe encounter and bring it in toward a close pass by Tylo that would leave it in the red-dotted-line orbit shown below that had an apoapsis out near Pol\u0027s orbit.

The Bop Ship is a little ways to the right of the point marked \u0022Plane Shift Burn\u0022 at the apoapsis of the Bop Ship\u0027s orbit.

This took 410 m/s of delta-V.

Would the Advanced Grabbing Unit (The Claw) work for the innovative refueling use? Activate the Claw!

It\u0027s harder than you might expect, because you have to hit a surface with the small middle part of the Claw...you can\u0027t just grab onto anything within the fingers of the Claw.

But what I\u0027m picturing is what is pictured below: A nice propellant transfer hose that can be unreeled from the claw and connected to the target vehicle (aren\u0027t imagination and PhotoShop wonderful?). So until SQUAD gets around to giving us a simple refueling hose for our kerbals to attach on EVA, I\u0027ll fake the ability with the Claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UL5tmJv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UL5tmJv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest #2: Kurt tried docking the Fuel Fido to Fuel Station A. It worked like a charm. The advantage of the Claw method over my older BirdDog/GasStation docking method is that the Claw can be used to dock to greater variety of vehicles with less fiddly maneuvering around trying to dock ports. And I\u0027m just picturing hoses, remember.

He actually had a spot of trouble here: Walking along on top of the Fuel Fido is not easy...and he ended up falling through a gap between the tanks. He fell to the ground...but his head was still up between the tanks, so he couldn\u0027t get free. He spent a couple minutes wishing that SQUAD would give kerbals a \u0022bend down and crawl\u0022 function...but eventually I tried clicking on the closest command chair, and was given the choice to board it...so I guess that means he was able to climb up between the tanks.

Note that all of the fuel weight in the Fuel Fido and the weight of the other Fido docked to the back were needed so that the Fuel Fido could carry around the old GasStation without any danger of tipping over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JhHjRbA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JhHjRbA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive kilometers to the south is the landing location of the sky-crane that landed the original Fido Probe on Laythe.

Five kilometers puts this stuff well outside the range where they would possibly be a hazard to landing BirdDogs and spaceplanes (and, more to the point, this reduces the nasty lag I\u0027m getting around the main base area).

Kurt returned to the SSTO, offloaded some of the fuel from the Fuel Fido, and then drove over to grab GasStation 2. This GasStation was also almost depleted of fuel (and what little was left, Kurt yoinked into the Fuel Fido...that\u0027s why he needed to offload some fuel at the SSTO first). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aWC5Say.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aWC5Say.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Kurt picked up the GS2 (raised its legs) and drove off to add it to the junkyard collection.

Note: There was no safety violation in having the SSTO unable to do an emergency escape-from-Laythe (in case of tidal wave or whatnot) because they also have the RASSTO RAPIER-powered SSTO at the base if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KfkcqTZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KfkcqTZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Kurt was still not done! He\u0027s a wildman today! While dropping off the GasStations at the junkyard, Kurt noticed that the old sky-crane still had lots of fuel onboard (hooray for storable propellants!). That sky-crane was designed to land Fido Probes on airless worlds like the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Vall...but on Laythe it was only needed to perform the de-orbit maneuver -- parachutes did the rest of the job. So Kurt docked the Fuel Fido to the sky-crane and was able to pull out five tanks of fuel that will be kept in the Fuel Fido to be used in refueling ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S9MFrJq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S9MFrJq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest #4: Yet another test? Indeed! Indeed, I say. Because the Fuel Station is designed to refuel BirdDog rover/planes (without the intermediary Fuel Fido), and that needed to be tested. So Kurt drove the Fuel Fido back over to the Fuel Station, and then hopped on board the BirdDog to try docking it to the Claws on the stationary Fuel Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rSn53zz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rSn53zz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s where things went bizarre. The lower Claw of the Fuel Station is located at the height of the BirdDog\u0027s wing\u0027s trailing edge (and any other plane that uses the same basic design, such as the Airedale plane/rover). But, when I backed the BirdDog up against the Claw of the FuelStation.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hOMzDgt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hOMzDgt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....the surface of Laythe suddenly vanished...and the BirdDog, Fuel Station, and nearby Fuel Fido dropped downward (to what I assume is sea level).....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WjNz03K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WjNz03K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o2EtKVw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o2EtKVw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....and exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yyODycF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yyODycF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....and the game crashed.

Some more explosions occurred. Kurt had survived in his cockpit, and parts of the Fuel Fido frame survived, but the Fuel Station was completely gone. (Oddly, the SSTOs and the original Fido Probe, off in the distance, survived. Maybe they didn\u0027t fall? Or maybe they didn\u0027t fall so far because they were near the shore. I didn\u0027t check.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eQHqo3A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eQHqo3A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it so happened, Danny2462 had posted a video where he found this same bug several days before it bit me (although HE was trying to dock two Claws to a kerbal to see if he could rip him apart...but that\u0027s Danny for you). I remember being amazed at how Danny could always manage to find these outrageous world-killing bugs when I\u0027d never run into any such thing in all my years of playing KSP. I remember I was quite smug about it, in fact. Now you see what happens if you scoff at Danny, even in the privacy of your own mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappily, I had done a QuickSave before beginning Test #4, so the world-shattering Bad Bug did not destroy my world. So I loaded up the old save, and tried again... Ka-boom. Hmmm. I tried docking to the Claw with the BirdDog\u0027s engine, and not the wing... Ka-boom. So I tried docking the BirdDog to the Fuel Fido (not the Fuel Station)... Ka-boom (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KN33F0x.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022KN33F0x.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh. Docking the Fuel Fido to the BirdDog had not caused this disaster, but docking the BirdDog to the Fuel Fido DID. Apparently it only happens when your active ship is trying to dock to the Claw of an INACTIVE ship. To test that, I lined up the BirdDog to dock with the Fuel Station, started the BirdDog rolling, and then switched ships before they touched...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...The result? Successful docking with no worlds disappearing. Actually, it ended up that I had switched over to the nearby Fuel Fido (and not the Fuel Station), so apparently two inactive ships can dock via Claw, but an ACTIVE ship can\u0027t dock to an INACTIVE ship\u0027s Claw without disaster ensuing. Still...it\u0027s a work-around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yG5Vu1x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yG5Vu1x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole thing really surprises me because the first thing I did when version 23.5 came out with the Claw was build the Fuel Station and do test dockings at KSC. It worked fine there, even when the ship with the Claw was inactive. So I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027m getting this problem now. (I\u0027m still using version 23.5. I don\u0027t know what version Danny is using.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... SQUAD? A little help here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, the world doesn\u0027t end just because of a little game bug (well...in this case, I guess it tried to), and there was still work to be done. The Big Advanced Tug that had brought the Fuel Stack to Laythe still had lots of fuel in it, so Thompbles remotely directed it to dock with Laythe Space Station and offload the extra fuel. Then the Tug was shifted to a slightly higher orbit to await sending it back to Kerbin for re-use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ICspEs9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ICspEs9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t4Io5Fm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t4Io5Fm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ETylo Time: Exploration\u0027s End\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile all this fun with comsats, radiography rovers, transfer maneuvers, refueling tests, and planetary destruction was going on, our intrepid heros on Tylo were spend several productive months exploring.

So Aldner and Nelemy spent a couple weeks video conferencing with Hellou (who was still on Vall) to winnow down their extensive rock collection to the size allowable in the Tylo Lander\u0027s ascent stage.

The large arrow below shows that the small control surface on the back of the vertical stabilizer is now magically levitating. But it still works. The weirder problem is that the rear Mk1 fuselage has shrunk in size (small arrow shows the gap between it and the forward Mk1 fuselage). But the front Mk1 fuselage is still its original size. The bottom view shows that the gap goes all around the part. It\u0027s just shrunk.
