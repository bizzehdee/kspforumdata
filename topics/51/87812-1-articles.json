Gene Kerman today revealed the multi-phase plan to establish permanent and/or long term presences on seven different celestial bodies outside of the Kerbin planetary system, saying \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going past the Mun.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Purity Campaign, as it has been come to known at the Kerbal Space Center, is a nine phase expedition to establish either a base or an orbital station around multiple planets and/or moons around the Kerbol system. Planets listed by the KSI included Duna, Eve, Jool, and several others. The Mun and Minmus are not included, being stated that the point of the campaign was to establish a presence on a truly alien world. KSI has also noted the (debatably) successful Reach Campaign, of which (unsuccessfully) successfully landed multiple landers on the Mun along with an orbital station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSI has also mentioned that the campaign would take several years to complete, and several new technologies would need to be introduced, the most daunting being the interplanetary communication system that the KSI is proposing. However, KSI made mention that several new space craft are currently under development, thus marking the beginning of the first phase of the Campaign, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CResearch \u0026amp; Development Phase.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The comment was made that the R\u0026amp;D phase of the campaign is one of the most vital, and that the campaign will be considered a failure if the proper technologies could not be developed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSI was met with some criticism, with several critics stating that the KSI is very unlikely to secure enough contracts to properly fund the project; there is concern that KSI Engineering will have to cut corners in the development of new space craft in order to make the finances work. Some critics have event stated that the project will never get off the ground, or may blow up in mid ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the KSI is confident that enough funding will be secured to properly finance the project, making note that the KSI has already secured enough contracts to fully fund the Research \u0026amp; Development phase of the campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime will only tell, as KSI has stated that new launches are schedule rather soon.

The Purity campaign will take place over nine different phases, the first of which is the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CResearch \u0026amp; Developmet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 phase of the program. The Research \u0026amp; Development phase of the program will develop and test several new spacecraft and other technologies that are critical for the success of the Purity Campaign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDA6-01 is the first step for the Research \u0026amp; Development phase of the Purity Campaign, and is also the first test mission for the new Danub A6 orbiter. The Danub Orbiter Program has in the past produced the most successful spacecraft utilized by KSI Inc., the Danub A4. The Danub A4 was a nuclear powered orbiter that produced thrust through a thermal rocket. Although successful, the A4 was known by many pilots as being \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cunderpowered and overworked.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The new A6, addresses previous problems of the now retired A4 by using a more traditional \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnerva\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 rocket engine, thus providing twice the amount of thrust of previous Danub generations while still maintaining the absurd fuel efficiency that the Danubs are known for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission DA6-01 is manned by Jebidiah, Bob, and Bill Kerman. Once in orbit, the mission will fire its nerva engine to push the orbiter from a target altitude from approx. 125 km to 300 km. During the mission, the orbiter and its crew will conduct different science experiments to fulfill current outstanding contracts, of which are providing funding for the Danub Orbiter Program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Danub A6 will be used as a general purpose orbiter for support roles for the Purity Campaign. It will form the backbone of the short range spacecraft fleet. It will use the \u0022Mark II\u0022 rocket, a two stage rocket composing of a solid fuel first stage and a liquid fuel upper stage. The Danub A6 is also equipped with a liquid fuel transfer stage of which is hidden inside the Mark II fairing. The Danub A6 is expected to be able to launch directly into Kerbin high orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission DA6-01:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiter was able to launch and fire its first stage engines without any kind of issues. The first stage was able to propel the rocket to an altitude of approx. 30 km before stage separation and jettison. The second stage, however, failed to engage the liquid fuel engine due to an error in the stage sequence. The second stage was immediately jettisoned without any of its fuel being used. The orbiter\u0027s transfer stage was used to propel the orbiter to its target apoapsis, after which the transfer stage was jettisoned. The orbiter\u0027s nerva engine finished the circulation burn at the target altitude of 125 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 125 km, the crew performed several experiments, include a broad spectrum analysis and a mystery goo experiment, of which were stored in universal storage containers of the orbiter\u0027s fuselage. The orbiter then increased its altitude to 300 km, at which altitude an orbital camera experiment was performed. Jebidiah Kerman performed a space walk to manually move results from the experiment containers to the return module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return module splashed down approx. 97 km east of the Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENote: if you have problems viewing the album here on the forums, then view the album on imgur.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hkAgZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The Fenris A1 space plane today established an orbit of approx. 125 km and then returned to Kerbin and landed at the Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fenris A1 project is a part of the Research \u0026amp; Development phase of KSI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ambitious project (of which is projected to epically fail), and will act as a personnel carrier from the ground to orbital stations and interplanetary space craft. Nuclear Dynamics have stated that a cargo variant may be developed to help fulfill outstanding contracts to help fund the Purity Campaign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fenris features two thermal turbojet engines powered by two nuclear fusion reactors. Nuclear Dynamics have stated that the engines should provide enough thrust and ISP to give the Fenris a decent long range within planetary systems, such as the Jool system. In addition, the Fenris\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engines make it a likely candidate for an attempted landing and takeoff from the surface of Eve in phase 5 of the campaign. It is expected that because of the reusability of the space craft, that the Fenris will cut down on launch costs of future missions, a direct response to criticism that the Purity Campaign is a project the KSI is not able to finance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFA1-01 launched from the older KSC2 runway and then established an orbit of 125 km with an inclination of 45 degrees.
