The another big part is imgur albums, linked in each mission stage. Some of the pictures are commented with mission details, others are just beautiful. Take your time to look at them, hope you\u0027ll like it.\n\nHere is my Duna science mission report. The mission itself took about 1-1.5 days playing (not sure how many hours) from vessels design to the Kerbin landing with all the science collected. It was almost successful, but I has stated it as a partial success because of two big fails: Poor main ship design (no Jr. docking ports and no mobile lab) which forced me to only transmit Ike\u0027s science data without 100% recovery, and the terrible rover design (along with planning gap) which after all leads to little *cheating*. Well, without a cheat the mission was a complete disaster which leads to *death of two Kerbonauts*. The details are below.\n\nMission contains multiple launches mostly because I wanted to pilot each vessel without heavy lags and that means that each vessel parts count is below 100. The other reason for multiple launch is because the design of a big exploration ship will take ages (for me) and in case of failure it can lead to the whole mission failure, while one-of-a-fleet vessel fail is just a pity and nothing more.\n\n**Mods:**\n\nI have a lot of mods installed, I\u0027ve tried to use only well balanced engines on this mission, so If my craft has non stock engine it is stock-a-like as much as posible. No \u0027over 9000 isp\u0027 engines was used during this mission.\n\nThe most important mods which affected the nature of the mission are: **Deadly Reentry**, **Remote tech** and **TAC life support**. Having them installed affecting the vessels design a lot. I\u0027ve also have **FAR** installed, which makes getting to LKO a little easier (in dV terms). Also I\u0027d like to mention **Hangar mod**, which helps to improve performance and sometimes aesthetics (not in my case ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)).\n\n*No craft files will be included in this post, because of modded parts. If you like one of the designs and occasionally have same mods as I do - ask for a .craft and I will gladly post it here*\n\n**Mission plan and goals:**\n\n0.

Not too much, but some good views inside](http://imgur.com/a/EKJZG#0)\n\nThis flight begun long before the actual mission report (and the whole mission plan) came to me, I do not have many scree shots regarding Galileo 2.0 mission. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nThe mission took more then 200 days **after** arrival to Duna SOI and my Duna map was still partial. Not sure what went wrong, I\u0027ve chosen the wrong orbit, I suppose. Anyway the Ike was mapped till 100% and Duna like in 50%, but enough to choose a landing zone (as per mission plan).\n\nThe First maneuver after entering Duna SOI was to catch up with Ike - seemed as a big mistake, since I\u0027ve used most of my fuel reserves to catch up with this little rock.\n\nAfter Ike mapping with all dV left I\u0027ve got back to Duna SOI at ~500km polar orbit and begun to scan. As soon as the map showed me that most of the Duna Biomes are located next to each other near the south pole - I\u0027ve decided to send a mission to collect all the data from the surface at once.\n\n*Stage result: Partial success. Enough to continue the mission.*\n\n**Stage 2: Getting the manned mission ready and launching to Duna**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/VNq0n#0)\n\nThe album is well commented but I will describe some mission stages here anyway.\n\nPioneer was launched first, unmanned, long before the transfer window opens. Then the lander followed Pioneer to the LKO.\n\n\u003E ![cl8EQOs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cl8EQOs.jpg)\n\nAfter all maneuvers was completed and two vessels met each other at the orbit I\u0027ve realized that I too too much fuel to the orbit. In fact this problem will follow me during the whole mission now. Almost every vessel had so huge fuel reserve that If I equipped them with KAS ports or just some ordinary docking ports I would be able to refuel main ship and visit Eve before coming back to Kerbin.\n\nDocking was not a big deal, to be honest I did the docking so good, that I was even unable to make some nice pictures of it. The lander was shifting in all three dimensions towards the Pioneer docking port and BOOM, docked. Never managed to did that before, and will never repeat it again, I suppose.\n\n\u003E ![udBLaoe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/udBLaoe.jpg)\n\nAfter the ship assembly I just waited for the window to open and launched two other ships into Kerbin orbit. Since all of them are relatively light launches had nothing to picture, that\u0027s why we skip it and continue on Pioneer mission.\n\nIn four hours before the burn I\u0027ve accidentally remembered that Pioneer will actually need some crew to operate. The crew transfer mission begun in a rush, but speaking ahead: It was absolute success!\n\nJeb will carry 3 explorers to the orbit on a SSTO space plane. \n\n\u003E ![72aGDUr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/72aGDUr.jpg)\n\n\u003E , since most of people (and me too) do like SSTO space planes I have the launch and the whole crew transfer well pictured at the album. \n\n\u003E ![U1dHek5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/U1dHek5.jpg)![Q5vhKoo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Q5vhKoo.jpg)![9v5AenO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9v5AenO.jpg)![KEcnfzC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KEcnfzC.jpg)\n\n\u003E .\n\nHaving the crew inside the Pioneer, Jeb was going back to Kerbin. This space plane was designed for this crew transfer in a big rush and was barely tested, It took some time (and some save/loads) to realize that it require some fuel balancing before reentry, but as soon as I transfered all Oxidizer to the front-most tank the plane became stable again and Jeb landed it easily. \n\n\u003E ![bxWpB62.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bxWpB62.jpg)![IkDDS63.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IkDDS63.jpg)![BDYMrI1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BDYMrI1.jpg)![OGRup22.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OGRup22.jpg)\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission continues.*\n\n**Stage 3: Leaving Kerbin orbit**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/2YVW0#0)\n\nThis mission stage went smooth and has almost nothing valuable to report. As always - all pictures are at the album. And I must admit (again) that I took too much fuel, the rover Hangar executed half of ejection burn with it\u0027s launch stage while it has travel stage with dV suitable for the mission. I will have to eject it half-full later on at Duna orbit. What a waste!\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission continues.*\n\n**Stage 4: Duna arrival**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/Bi9WZ#0)\n\nJust as the 3rd stage this one went smooth and has nothing special to report. Each craft successfully arrived to Duna SOI at a planned time and Periapsis. The rover lander was the last one to get to Duna, like 4-5 days after the drone carrier. That was a little off plan, since the rover is the first thing to land on duna. Anyway shifting the planned dates in a long term mission is not a big deal, Pioneer crew was patiently waiting for the rover at the Duna orbit.\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission continues.*\n\n**Stage 5: Rover landing**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/zMwVu#0)\n\nThis one is one of my favorite. Since I use the Remote tech and unable to control the descending unmanned craft inside the atmosphere (due to antenna dish just fall apart under dynamic pressure) I had to use some \u0027smart parts\u0027 (mod name) bits to trigger specific actions according to altitude. First of all I had to actually fold the dish before the reentry (is it RE-entry when you enter another planet atmosphere?), then at a certain altitude solid boosters fired to slow down the hangar\n\n\u003E ![URaCJY3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/URaCJY3.jpg)\n\n\u003E , so it can safely deploy it\u0027s chute. Next was actually deploying chutes and landing gears\n\n\u003E ![8KrEmv0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8KrEmv0.jpg)\n\n\u003E , and at last the 4th stage at about 10 meters above the surface unfolded the dish aging returning controls to me. It was like watching a movie about the rover landing, when you can see the picture but can\u0027t actually do anything about it. Since the rover is valuable, but not vital part of the mission I\u0027ve decided to let is fall down and watch what will happen without loading the QS, if it crash into surface. But the whole landing was surprisingly as planned and I hit the flat ground next to south pole of Duna at the highlands.\n\n\u003E ![9yPkjyr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9yPkjyr.jpg)\n\nAfter the dish was enabled I\u0027ve opened the hangar and rolled a rover out.\n\n\u003E ![MAUAYfZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MAUAYfZ.jpg)\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission continues.*\n\n**Stages 6 and 7: Manned landing and rover arrival to lander**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/mDUFC#0)\n\nManned landing went as smooth as possible. I\u0027ve missed a rover landing zone just a few (4) km, and landed on a relatively flat ground. Watch the stage album for screenshots.\n\nAfter the rover roll out I\u0027ve realized a couple of things:\n\n1. The landing zone is flat enough to land without any precautions.\n\n2. Rover behaves weird at the surface.\n\nAs the first one is self explanatory the second needs some clarification. I am using the modded rover wheels which not only has the custom 3D model, but has some additional settings, like spring strength and dampener settings. The dampener was exactly the thing I f\\*\\*ed up with! While driving the rover at the flat surface it behaves well and even has a good speed. While you are jumping out of some hills the rover is super stable since it has additional SAS module. But when it comes to hill climb the disasters begun! The suspension reacts on increased G force when rover comes from the flat ground to a lift. Rover goes down to ground as is Elephant in the driver seat, and this leads to second design problem, rover has two RTGs *installed at the bottom*! Guess what? Right - when going uphill faster then 10-12m/s it\u0027s just enough for the RTGs to hit the ground and blow. I was even considering to cheat-send a fixed rover instead of this one, but decided to move on with what I have.\n\nTraveling 4km to the lander was not a big pain, so I thought that a poor rover is not that bad after all. *A big mistake!*\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission continues.*\n\n**Stage 8: Landing probe on Ike**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/b78Zl#0)\n\nBefore going on a rover trip I decided to perform some extra landings. And started the preparations for Ike exploration. Album has more the enough pictures if you are interested. I\u0027d just say that the lander was not a brand new vessel (in fact it was the one and only well tested ship I had, since the same lander was used in my Mun and Minmus explorations prior to Duna mission) - so it behaved as it intended to. Crash landing it at the 3rd Biome was not a problem since I had just enough electric charge left to transmit all the data collected. And after that I\u0027ve realized the second issue with this mission. *I have no way to collect the science data from the probes!*\n\nI forgot to place a mobile lab to my drone carrier, and there was no way to store all the data collected by unmanned probes. But anyway I have 2 spare probes left and will transmit all science from Ike, which leads us to partial success of the stage, and the unmanned mission as a whole.\n\n*Stage result: Partial success. Mission continues.*\n\n**Stage 9: Exploring Duna**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/qxvHz#0)\n\nHere comes the worst page in my story. I must say that stage album contains 100 pictures, most of them are commented and worse checking. Here I will describe the mission in words, not pictures.\n\nFirst of all as per my plan I was going to visit 4 of 5 biomes of Duna. I\u0027ve landed at the Highlands, so they are already visited. I\u0027ve just placed a flag next to the lander and brought all the science collected from the rover to lander. But the next thing I\u0027ve noticed - I can\u0027t fing the 5th biome on map! I had to search forum to find out that \u0027Craters\u0027 biome is adjacent to poles, and luckily after the close observation I\u0027ve realized a good thing: I will visit all 5 biomes on a rover!\n\nFirst two journeys from the lander to Craters and to Poles didn\u0027t took much time. It was unpleasant to go there, then get back and then again go to the south, but I had only one driver seat and there was no way to carry two flags at a time.\n\nHaving 3 flags placed (Highlands, Craters and Poles) I was aiming to Lowlands and Midlands, both of them was relatively close to the north. Just 37km... close.\n\nWhit such a poor rover I was not going to repeat the poles journey - I mean traveling 37km, planting a flang and then coming back to lander just to take another flag and head all the way back - that\u0027s too much! If only my rover was stable enough I would do that with Rover Autopilot, while watching movie, but my poor little piece of sh\\*t was unable to move on it\u0027s own longer then 3-5 minutes without colliding to the ground even in half speed.\n\nThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve used some field customizing with the help of KAS plugin I\u0027ve remove a ladder from the lander and attached it to the rover. Now I have two kerbals available, that means two flags and no need to double trip!\n\nProblems begun almost when I travelled the first 100 meters...\n\nThe first of them was the ladder: A hanging engineer was shifting down the ladder as rover moves, and I had to adjust his position constantly not to let him fall. He did fell several times while rover was traveling all the distance, mostly when I was AFK.\n\nThe second problem was combination of my mistakes and lack of Duna knowledge. As I have already mentioned - rover had two RTGs on the bottom, so they tends to collide at the surface. When it happened again I opened the mission log, found that only one RTG collided with surface and continued the mission (saved the game) that was a big mistake! I don\u0027t know when and why - but I\u0027ve lost the first RTG long ago! That means that as of now - rover became solar powered with just a few low grade solar panels, but it\u0027s not a big issue on it\u0027s own. I\u0027ve mentioned my lack of Duna knowledge? I didn\u0027t know how fast the sunset changes to night! I was 30\u002B km away from the lander when sun disappeared and both of my Kerbals was left to die (TAC life support requires Kerbals to have electric charge in their suits to live), that\u0027s where I have cheated and used the HyperEdit to recharge rover several times, just not to terminate the mission. Without cheating manned mission can be counted a catastrophe, witch lead to the death of 2 crew members.\n\nI have decided to count the cheating a miracle and continued the mission. I\u0027ve recharged rover\u0027s batteries like 3-5 times before I made it back to the lander.\n\nAll 5 biomes visited, and the manned mission is almost over. Time to go to orbit.\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission continues.*\n\n*Alternate stage result: Catastrophic failure. Unmanned mission continues / Orbital module pilot is the only Kerbonaut to survive.*\n\n**Stage 10: Manned mission packing**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/QlBv4)\n\nNothing unusual to report. Lander was well designed and easily achieved the duna orbit. To to the landing site elevation (~3km) I even had enough fuel to match planes with the Pioneer and randevu with it on my own. Docking was performed from IVA, and well pictured in the album.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention: I have evacuated all valuable scientific sensors from the rover, to conduct some researches at the orbit aswell.\n\n*Stage result: Success. Unmanned mission continues / Manned mission is ready to leave.*\n\n**Stage 11: Second unmanned mission on Ike**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/8z1Je#0)\n\nThe second Ike mission ended up just like the first one, but I\u0027ve managed to visit every last biome before the crash landing. I had a little issue with the Western mountains since they was always either in shadow, or on the dark side of Ike (relative to Duna) so I was unable to contact carrier and therefor unable to control the probe. It took a long time to Ike to align well, but I eventually made it to the last biome with some crash, and with enough electric charge to transmit all the science.\n\n*Stage result: Partial success. Unmanned mission terminated / Manned mission is ready to leave.*\n\n**Stage 12: Unplanned anomaly exploration**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/lGXbU#0)\n\nThis part was unplanned, but why not to visit the \u0027anomaly\u0027 if I have a spare probe left? Pretty short mission stage is pictured well in the album.\n\n*Stage result: Out of scope*\n\n**Stage 13: Kerbin return**\n\n[Imgur album of the mission.](http://imgur.com/a/6TZ2Q#0)\n\nAfter a long awaited Duna-\u003EKerbin window the manned module along with expensive lander is returning home. Bringing back 8591 science in it\u0027s storage! All the stage is well documented in the album and awaits you at imgur.\n\n*Stage result: Success. Mission accomplished.*\n\n**Mission review.**\n\nSo, it\u0027s time to write down some results and a lesson I\u0027ve learned the hard way.\n\nFirst of all: Before sending a complex mission to another planet: Have a checklist! Without it - you will be unable to complete all goals as I did with mobile lab missing.\n\nThe second: My next manned mission will have some kind of crew rescue system. I really didn\u0027t like to cheat, I\u0027d prefer to evacuate Kerbonauts next time if the sh\\*t with rover happen again.\n\nThe third: Always have a backup. I brought several probes to the Duna system. That allowed me to have some fun with crash landing and NOT loading the QS after it. While the one and only rover made me frustrated and want to kill myself.\n\n**If you managed to read the whole thing, and like it - please comment. I want to know if my report was entertaining, since I\u0027ve enjoyed writing it as much as I enjoyed the mission itself.** \n\n**Thanks for reading - fly safe!**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T22:22:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TC One**\n  \nBillions of typos corrected"}]}
