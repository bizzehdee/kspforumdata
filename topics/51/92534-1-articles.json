Questions flew through his mind relentlessly: What if the stage separation system failed? What if the parachute failed to deploy? What if there was a breach in the capsule? He had planned, checked; double-checked. Had interns go and check his checking. Had interns check their checking by jumping off the roof of the newly commissioned \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Vehicle Assembly Building\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 with a scale model of the parachute, and had their replacements discard that work and correct the errors.

The future of the program depended on it. He had lobbied for months for a program of this nature, and he couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t well lose his bottle at this point.

He shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be nervous at all. He had trained for what felt like years, committing hundreds of hours to simulators and advanced jet aircraft, set up to help with G-loading. He was a stone-cold fighter-pilot, with combat experience and a golden record for pulling it together when the odds looked impossible. And yet, this was completely unknown to him. No one had done this before, which was exactly why he had volunteered for the selection, and why he was thrilled to be the first. Through all of that though, he still found a cold bead of sweat forming on his brow as the count commenced. Gene had said something to him. He didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what; all his focus was on the panel of lights and switched presented before him. He opened his mouth to speak, perhaps saying something poetic to encapsulate the moment. But all he could find himself thinking was, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s go already.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153All stations, we are go in t-minus 10 seconds.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene looked out of the control room. Through the window he could see the rocket, built by the newly-formed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153United Launch Conglomerate\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.
