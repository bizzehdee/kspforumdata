I was screwing around testing some stuff on a planet I\u0027m working on, and decided to hop to another location. On the way, however, I remembered I need to repack my parachutes. So at about 80km and 600 m/s, Jeb hopped out of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uT3ACoP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022560\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uT3ACoP.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t expect there to be much air up there, but there was. Jeb was thrown 12 km away from the ship, and I was just testing, so I thought I should revert flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait a second!\u0022 I told myself. \u0022You could totally get Jeb! 10km isn\u0027t that far! It\u0027s just like a normal rendezvous! I\u0027ve done tons of those!\u0022 So I turned on my rockets and went right back to catch up with Jeb, passing him by over 2.5km and 250 m/s. Woops. My altitude was probably around 55 km by this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry again. Jeb has a lot of drag, so he has basically stopped moving horizontally and only falls vertically around 350m/s. I\u0027m about 4 km away, so I move towards him a little more slowly and deploy the airbrakes to slow me down to a similar speed as him. I turned on infinite propellant because, again, I was just testing stuff. Manage to park right next to him for a while, except that the airbrakes aren\u0027t enough and I\u0027m still falling way faster than him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use Jeb\u0027s EVA pack (pressing control the whole time) to get close to the ship. The only issue is, I can\u0027t find the hatch. Playing in 1.3.1, so the MK 2 Command pod has that weird door still, and I couldn\u0027t find it. The rocket is tilted to the side at about 45 degrees, so I switch to it and make it hold vertical so I can find the hatch easier. Quick look around shows the hatch is on the far side, so I switch to Jeb to fly him over there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Jeb isn\u0027t there. When I wasn\u0027t holding control, he floated right away, and was now over a kilometer above the rocket. I was in target mode so I couldn\u0027t see my speed well, but I was around 18 km up. If I was careful I probably could have landed the rocket, and then landed Jeb before he crashed into the water\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be pointless, though, because I could have done that all along, and now I was committed to catching him. I pointed the rocket to surface radial out and thrusted until I had the same vertical speed as Jeb, then throttled down to keep that speed. Jeb was still a kilometer or so above the rocket, so I flew him down and and was about to get in. I moved towards the capsule and...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBounced off. I hate when that happens. I was going, like, 1 m/s, but still bounced. Jeb was incapacitated for 5 nail biting seconds as we fell toward the water. This time, I moved in hurriedly but slowly to avoid that accident again. Jeb finally got in the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally look at the altitude gauge and find I\u0027m less than 2 km above the water, moving at 180 m/s. 12 seconds more and Jeb would have died. Luckily this ship has 3G acceleration, so I floor the throttle and head towards land. About 30 seconds later we are safely landed, and I have completed my first ever atmospheric rendezvous in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SD19Muu.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022560\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SD19Muu.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-26T05:58:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s really cool!
