Remember, my missionwas to explore Eve, which means I must land and transmit some data. However, my self-imposed goal was to grab more science on the surfaceand return it to Kerbin for max return on investment (as if acting asa mission director for a real space program). That meanswhatever lands, must then also ascend. Landing is fairly simpleon an atmospheric planet. Simply use the atmosphere to slowyou, and deploy chutes. (sometimes lots of them). Theproblem with this notion is that to leave Eve, a vehicle must becapable of changing its velocity (Delta V) by 10,000 m/s, as opposedto just 3,400 m/s for Kerbin.

What I decided to do was not to create a single ship that would go to Eve. For the same reasons that we want to drop spent stages as they are not needed, we also don\u0027t want to send a super massive ship to Eve if we don\u0027t have to. We\u0027ll drop what we don\u0027t need along the way. But, to initially reduce the requirement for leaving Kerbin in the first place, we can\u0027t (if we are to stick to my plan for the mission) lift something that is capable of lifting off Kerbin, pushing toward Eve, landing and most importantly, ascending from Eve, pushing to Kerbin (not to mention my Gilly(moon) requirement), and do return maneuvers and eventually land on Kerbin. That would be economically inefficient and increasing a bunch of the undesirable things that can happen along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, we have to launch separate pieces, and probably refuel pieces before putting them together and finally pushing to Eve. That \u003Cem\u003Eshould \u003C/em\u003Ebe fine. I\u0027ve done this at a smaller scale for Duna missions and saved tons of \u0022kash\u0022 along the way by first sending a Duna bound ship to Mun for refueling. It makes the lift requirement, and consequently, your mission budget, much smaller. I have re-usable ships at Mun and Minmus with fuel on standby for occasions such as these...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the stage which will eventually mate up with the Eve lander seen above and push it to Eve.

This one will eventually drop large tank stages when it is pushing the mission to Eve. But for this liftoff, it will not auto-stage so that I can refuel them. Luckily, this packs enough punch to lift itself regardless. Afterall, it has to eventually push something that is over 500 tons to another planet.

IMO, this is the way to start out doing it, rather than turning it into fuel on the surface, and sending THAT to orbit. Processing in orbit means you can convert the operation over to producing other fuel types. It also makes missions like these possible in the first place. Otherwise, if I had no network of vehicles and stations built up around the Kerbin system, as shown before, this vehicle would have to be much more massive that it already is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1266.photobucket.com/user/ex-xboxfan/media/Kerbal%20-%20Journey%20to%20Eve/screenshot32_zps6fedwqbm.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1266.photobucket.com/albums/jj531/ex-xboxfan/Kerbal%20-%20Journey%20to%20Eve/screenshot32_zps6fedwqbm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32_zps6fedwqbm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis requires several trips just to fill up the large tanker, unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1266.photobucket.com/user/ex-xboxfan/media/Kerbal%20-%20Journey%20to%20Eve/screenshot33_zpsl1rzcl2h.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1266.photobucket.com/albums/jj531/ex-xboxfan/Kerbal%20-%20Journey%20to%20Eve/screenshot33_zpsl1rzcl2h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot33_zpsl1rzcl2h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce the number of trips, i\u0027ve now gone the route of using two big ore pods at once, and increasing the fuel for the lander to compensate. The trade-off is that you cannot gather ore when both pods are absent from the surface (my ore extractor should have been fitted with a permanent ore canister), but that does not really matter because time can be sped up later to gather ore almost instantly. (It takes 12 game days for this to produce two of these pods full.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1266.photobucket.com/user/ex-xboxfan/media/Kerbal%20-%20Journey%20to%20Eve/screenshot34_zpszki83rgk.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1266.photobucket.com/albums/jj531/ex-xboxfan/Kerbal%20-%20Journey%20to%20Eve/screenshot34_zpszki83rgk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot34_zpszki83rgk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post more later as it develops.
