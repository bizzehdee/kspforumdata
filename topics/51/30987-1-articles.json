The Mark 1 through 6 vehicles all failed, generally catastrophically, during unKerballed testing. The first and only Mark 7 craft was launched to retrieve a stranded Kerbal, but suffered structural failure during rendezvous maneuvers, requiring a rescue mission for the rescue mission. The Mark 8 through 10 models all failed in further unKerballed tests, but with the Mark 11, success was finally achieved!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is to upgrade the Kerballed Orbiting Lab with a second habitation module, and a large fuel tank to support deep space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T20:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new command pod with the nice windowed cockpit is ideal for space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T20:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso Clamp-O-Trons Sr. are good choice for connecting station core modules.
