Because of KSP, I am trying to learn more about orbital mechanics and rocketry and in turn, trying to apply this knowledge in game to make my missions more efficient and precise (often with disastrous consequences). While I certainly know a lot more than I have before, I have a long way to go to becoming proficient in this area. The Sigma mission is a direct result of my basic knowledge of orbital mechanics.

The main reason I wanted to do such a mission in the first place was the fact that even in my 650 or so hours of playtime (before the mission), I had only landed on and returned from 3 celestial bodies: the Mun, Minmus and Duna and I hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even seen Moho, Ike, Gilly, and Tylo. I figured this would be a great way to fill in my KSP checklist of landing on and returning from every planet in the solar system. I named the mission \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSigma Mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 after Sigma notation as I am quite literally \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csumming up the planets\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, before 0.23.5 this kind of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cgrand tour\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 mission (at least for me) was impossible. There were simply no stock parts that could provide the necessary Delta V to perform all the planetary transfers and landings. The only engine that could do this was the ion engine, and given its very low thrust of 0.5 Kn it would take ages to do anything and likely break your sanity in the process. In addition, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not capable of landing a Kerbal on many celestial bodies. However, with the buffed ion engine, this mission becomes much more feasible as now you can use an ion powered vehicle to both perform burns in a timelier manner and to land Kerbals on celestial bodies up to the size of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the idea planted in my mind, I designed the various landers and modules I would need for the mission.

Therefore when it comes to planetary transfers, I want to use the ion lander as much as possible while using the supply ship only where I absolutely have to. For example, it is NOT necessary for the supply ship to transfer to planets without moons such as Moho, Dres, and Eeloo as you only need one flag for each of these planets. On the other hand, it IS necessary to transfer the supply ship to planetary systems such as Duna, Eve, and Jool as you will need more than one flag for each of these systems. Because of this, the supply ship only needs to make three transfers: Kerbin -\u0026gt; Eve -\u0026gt; Duna -\u0026gt; Jool. All the other planets can be handled by the ion lander, the GPL or both. So with this in mind, I constructed a flight plan that included every planet in the solar system. To calculate the Delta V required for planetary transfers, I used this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaunch Window Planner\u003C/a\u003E, for everything else, I used an excel spreadsheet and a calculator.

I think the largest payload I\u0027ve ever delivered to LKO using a space plane is less than 4 tons. Considering that I\u0027ve seen someone deliver 34 tons of cargo to Laythe, this isn\u0027t all that impressive. I guess what I meant to say is that I still have a lot to learn in the space plane department...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, no, I didn\u0027t use deadly reentry or any other mods like that for this mission(else Jeb wouldn\u0027t have survived the 7 km/s aerobraking at Laythe). However, I have used them before on a previous save where I attempted to play as a more realistic space program. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue that save because of constant crashing caused by all the mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T02:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, this is quite the introductory post.

However, when you think about it, its not that surprising as the flight plans we used made the most sense. For example, Eve should be the first target in anyone\u0027s grand tour as it is the easiest to get to and you get to dump your heavy eve lander early on. Moho is obviously next because its easiest to get to from Eve. Then its off to Duna for aerobraking and then Dres because its easiest to get to from Duna. So on and so forth...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGathering science was a consideration when I started planning the mission, but I ended up not doing it because, at the time, I thought it was impossible to carry all the heavy equipment around.
