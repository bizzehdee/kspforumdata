I enjoyed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E a lot but my it slows my computer down to the speed of an Ion engine which subtracts a lot of the fun from it. So my first mission back in stock was a Mun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I built this because 1, SSTOs are very fun to build and fly, and 2, I heard rumors about some parts\u0027 heat resistance was buffed and I wanted to test that. Here are some pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/a/tZ9eQ\u0022 style=\u0022height:452px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo once I\u0027d landed, (This took multiple tries, darn you small landing legs!) I decided that I\u0027m not going to recover reusable things. I\u0027m just going to leave them at the space center and refuel them when I want to use them again. If they don\u0027t land at the space center, then I\u0027ll bring them to the space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo onto the mission. I have attempted this many times before. But I always ran short of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E and couldn\u0027t enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere without burning within seconds after reaching 70km. So I eventually quit and went on to things like Jool V and Eve landing and returning. (Which I did both) Anyway. I decided to try it again. I made a similar space plane to the one that I took to the Mun, only bigger, better cockpit, quadrupled the batteries, doubled the power generation and added reaction wheels. (I\u0027ll add the craft files for both SSTOs\u00A0if anyone wants me to)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it was a simple ascent. Getting off the runway was tough because this thing really wanted to swerve to the left so in the end I just let it and went off the runway before taking off but luckily I wasn\u0027t damaged at 80 m/s and was able to take off soon after. I probably should have added more oxidizer and wasted fuel when I passed the apoapsis and started falling again. I made it up to around 2000 m/s so I was able to accelerate to the point at which the plane was going so fast, it starts ascending again,\u00A0even with a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I decided to use the Eve-Kerbin-Kerbin-Jool gravity assist method and this went well. I got a Jool encounter right after the 2nd Kerbin assist and was able to use Laythe to get into a nice low Jool orbit. This is where things went south. I thought I was going slow enough to aero-break at Laythe but I wasn\u0027t. There is a thin line between too fast and too slow for some reason and I was just passed too fast. I then spent 400 m/s to get a better encounter in which I was going way slower than before. About two or three passes and I was ready to land. Landing was smooth and on the first try. Better than when I tried to land my Jool V Laythe Spaceplane on Laythe. That was a disaster!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb got out and stretched his legs, planted a flag and then got into the plane again and took off. Since no oxidizer is needed at all on Laythe, getting into orbit was nothing compared to Kerbin. Now here I decided to try and do what all the cool kids do and try a Tylo gravity assist back to Kerbin. This didn\u0027t go very well and I ended up in a high orbit around Kerbol. Thank Kraken for F9! So I ended up using my 1000 m/s direct return to Kerbin technique which worked out way better than the Tylo assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow comes the part where previous missions have failed. Return to Kerbin. Here you have to reverse the gravity assists going to Jool to bring you down to a low enough speed to enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. I had 1000 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E left from the 6200 m/s I had left in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E at the start. So I got a Kerbin assist for 200 m/s.and then after that, an Eve assist for pretty much the same cost. This brought my Apoapsis to just touching Kerbin\u0027s orbit and my Periapsis to just under Eve\u0027s orbit. This wasn\u0027t ideal but it worked. Things got to about 70-80% critical heat, but nothing exploded and after a small burn to capture, we were back in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E... with about 350 m/s left. I was literally running on fumes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I did another pass and had about a 150 m/s plane change and then I had only one more pass to do... Only I misjudged it and... ended up dropping my periapsis into the ocean west of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Luckily, it was just off the coast of the desert west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and I managed to change my course stalling only 3 times and came down for\u00A0a bumpy, 1st try landing, in the desert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb got out and was recovered but I\u0027m sticking to that rule. That plane stays in the desert until I find a way to get it back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyways, I conquered the one thing I was never able to do, and then landed in the desert. Now Jeb is sitting comfortably in the astronaut complex and his plane is sitting out in the desert awaiting rescue... To be continued I think...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s all for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
