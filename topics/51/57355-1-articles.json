Not quite Arkingthaad-Lander-Tower-Large, but definitely within shouting distance. The wheel assembly I have planned out in my head, but we\u0027ll see how it actually handles. But right now the main chassis has my full attention. It has to be particularly robust; I will be putting significant weight on the wheel assemblies, and it won\u0027t do to have a flimsy chassis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say that I\u0027m building it with the expectation of it being able to land itself. And refuel, a\u0027 la Kethane. Three separate ambulatory systems... wheels, landing engines, transplanetary drive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
