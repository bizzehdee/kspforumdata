Then things started getting out of hand, five launches turned to ten then twenty then thirty because you know - I had to make sure I had everything, the transfer window was coming up right away and I didn\u0027t want to miss it; I would have to wait almost a whole year for the next one (gasp).\n\n![GpJv44e.png](http://i.imgur.com/GpJv44e.png)\n\nThe arrival at Eve wasn\u0027t quite so orderly and was more reminiscent of an invasion rather than exploration or even colonization.\n\n ![3qplhNf.png](http://i.imgur.com/3qplhNf.png)\n\nI sent a bunch of probes first of course because you need to be able to harvest that data.\n\n![KG2Qa1g.png](http://i.imgur.com/KG2Qa1g.png)\n\nA fuel depot is an absolute necessity.\n\n![5A6NaVo.png](http://i.imgur.com/5A6NaVo.png)\n\nA small outpost on Gilly (I still need to get that module the right way up).\n\n![7SoOAyB.png](http://i.imgur.com/7SoOAyB.png)\n\nAnd of course Gilly needs it\u0027s own space station as well.\n\n![TcuW2t6.png](http://i.imgur.com/TcuW2t6.png)\n\nThe large base on Eve was the most difficult and time consuming thing I\u0027ve ever built.\n\n![E3aYnRk.png](http://i.imgur.com/E3aYnRk.png)\n\nAnd just for good measure I added a smaller outpost close by as well.\n\n![g1qwxvq.png](http://i.imgur.com/g1qwxvq.png)\n\nI guess the most impressive thing I built was the space station. I called it Armenia after \u0022The Who\u0022 song \u0022Armenia City in the Sky\u0022.\n\n![wUgd7xO.png](http://i.imgur.com/wUgd7xO.png)\n\nAnd in the end it was all pretty much unnecessary, simply causing the game to get laggy and I ended up getting burnt out and putting it down for a while (of course the GF said I wasn\u0027t spending enough time with her, that may have had something to do with it as well). The game is designed to have single flight for each contract, and move on to the next. That\u0027s how it works best so let this be a lesson for all you kids...\n\nDon\u0027t get to crazy on the colonization it will MESS YOU UUUUUUUUP!\n\n![03Y3vnF.png](http://i.imgur.com/03Y3vnF.png)\n\nIf you want to play this scenario for yourself in KSP V1.0.4 I\u0027ve posted the quick save here: \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fb25qm8myxljxn/EVEquicksave.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fb25qm8myxljxn/EVEquicksave.sfs?dl=0)\n\nSimply create a Sandbox game named \u0022Eve\u0022, and download the file into the **...KSP\\_win\\saves\\Eve** directory and rename it to \u0022**quicksave.sfs**\u0022. Play the Eve game and hold F9 for three seconds to reload the quicksave and you\u0027re there.\n\nSome parts have changed between the time I did this and the latest version so a few craft won\u0027t work quite right, but I\u0027ve cleaned up most of the broken stuff. I would recommend using all of the remaining bases on Gilly - Eve is just too much work to try to build another base. Besides, it\u0027s bad enough that all the Kerbals already on the planet are stranded there...\n\nJR\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T22:00:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jolly\\_Roger**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T15:26:55Z","Content":"RIP your computer!

It\u0027s actually surprising how spread out the flights get - they all left Kerbin at pretty much the same time but variations in the orbit caused them to arrive at much different times and even angles of entry for the Eve SOI. I did it and trust me, it\u0027s better to build your colonies one flight at a time. Build a kick ass space station, and base and all of that, just do it in stages that\u0027s my recommendation. \n\nI checked the persistent.sfs and it was at just over 9Mb.
