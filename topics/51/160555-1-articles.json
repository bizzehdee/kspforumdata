Oh wait, I started already. I\u2019m in too deep. There\u2019s no escape. Well, I guess I\u2019ll get started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive years ago the kerbals ruined our future by voting for Lanod Murt to be president of the International Kerbin Government. I couldn\u2019t believe it when the results of the election were released. The media were all over him during the campaign\u2026the things he said\u2026let\u2019s just say they were unacceptable, and not go into further detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the first few weeks of his presidency things were going well; not so many Kwitter insults and atrocities, more rational speeches and decisions. Or so we thought. It turns out that during this period a lot was going behind the scene. I suppose I should have worked out something was wrong when he fired Sejam Mecoy, lead investigator at the International Affairs Department, without releasing any reasons why. I had some crazy conspiracy theories going as a joke trying to explain why Mecoy was fired. They ranged from secret ties with Ussari to him being secretly an alien, about to be discovered. Oh boy, was I wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMr. Murt had parents who had some\u2026interesting beliefs. It seemed at first that most of these \u003Cem\u003Ehadn\u2019t\u003C/em\u003E been passed down, other than the one about the link between hair style and life expectancy. Well, yeah, I was wrong again there. You see, Murt thought that Kerbin was flat. We heard that news a year after his election which was in 1516, along with his \u2018master plan\u2019.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat \u2018master plan\u2019 consisted of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCutting all taxes except for a universal 500 kerbuck per year per person to pay for maintenance of Murt\u2019s mansion, governmental fees (which was a fancy word for bribing), and the vast military.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCutting all social security services\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCutting all police services\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCutting all health services\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCutting public schooling\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd cutting pretty much anything else there was to cut\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut worst of all, for me at least, \u003Cstrong\u003Ehe cut the space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis left Kerbin in a scramble to get as many kerbucks as possible, and making businesses. Since there was no law enforcement, if you wanted protection you had to pay for private services. And that was it. Over the next five years, Kerbin became a wasteland. It is a surprise what is left of society hasn\u2019t crumbled yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way I can see to fix this is to start a whole new country with new rules. But first I need to gather some followers to start a space program. Not easy when you are unpopular, nerdy and everyone has rejected science. Why a space program, you ask? A) They are cool, B) I have to prove that Kerbin is round, and to do that I need to go \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E, and C) So I can send Murt to Duna and \u2018Make it Great Again!\u2019 as he would say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea where to start. That is why I\u2019m writing in you. I need to get some ideas down. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll start with some sounding rockets and get some pictures taken. Then again, it\u2019ll be rejected as CGI\u2026I suppose it\u2019s better than nothing. I\u2019ll think of a name when I\u2019ve got something to name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFormatting is strange from Microsoft Word...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T01:08:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry my friend, this is a little too transparent an allegory for current political events to be suitable for the forum.
