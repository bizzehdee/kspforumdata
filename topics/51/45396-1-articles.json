I\u0027ve made a few Mun and Minmus landings, but today I decided I wanted to take things up a notch. I decided I wanted to make a Mun base!

I\u0027m planning on shipping up at least a rover, maybe some more equipment. And eventually, I will send a shuttle with supplies, then a shuttle to switch out the crew.

I also learned that it doesn\u0027t like going sideways on hills at all, especially on high speeds. These things should be manageable, but if they aren\u0027t, I can just send up new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, now that I have rovers I don\u0027t know what to do next. Currently, I can\u0027t do much more than drive kerbals around and take \u0022samples\u0022. I haven\u0027t really used mods yet, but I might download Kethane, then make a few probes and send a miner. Then once I have that, I could set up a refueling station and all kinda of other fun things, and maybe make a actual habitation, rather than a science base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027ll do what you think I should do next, so please tell me what you\u0027d want to see!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
