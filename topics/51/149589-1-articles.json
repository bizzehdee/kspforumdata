[Redacted] could I possibly make a craft get back to the exact spot and then Dock while on the ground!! So starting with the Copola big mono tank and the 4 all facing down legs on the next small Liq/fuel tank, where and how to fit Legs?? so off i go decoupled, got into orbit 17.000 approx changed orbit to fly over station down in one of those smooth shiny surfaces, started retro burn at 145.m/s all looking good..is this at all possible what if the legs are not exactly the same height I struggle to dock at best of times, I cant tell you how nervous i am, Christ its only a game .i\u0027m sweating like hell, i was coming in so well i even pointed up to go closer as i was coming down to short..!!OH No its all going wrong, to fast theres the bloody shadow [Redacted] i\u0027m upside down, no, no how can this go so wrong Bang..XXXX there goes the engine there we are sliding away from the station upside down Me new energy thingies, ones broke off, I come to a stop, in my panic i try to flip it over using Mono jets...Bingo i\u0027m up the right way looking back towards the station, it looks like a scrap yard..lol bits every where, So, no engine but the mono jets slid this thing across the surface nice and smooth, but what the chances of a successful docking now,?? as i move around the back of the station there is the docking port, set as target ?? why, but i do anyway/ control from here ??? I line it up and ..dame it looks like i am 6-8inches short, these leges are slightly higher then the stations.?? but as i moved to contact ..The magnets were strong enough to lift the back up and\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n!!VOLLER!! i docked.. contract lit up green all completed...\u00A31.000.000 in the bank....So if you guys ever want to build from the ground stick wheels on your ships...lol\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPs e/mail me for pic\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022cfa3adfef88fa8bdaae1aeace1baa4\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat s L lower case lb17.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TopHeavy11","CreatedById":154744,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T12:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222795524\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149589\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476100933\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168401\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capt: scarlet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, capt: scarlet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to Scott Manley and \u00A0Mr House I soon learnt the basics so after 3 weeks of space travel to Mun .Minmus, and Duna, two orbiting labs, Minmus, Kerbal.
