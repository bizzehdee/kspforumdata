Unfortunately the storm claimed the lives of three crew working the deck who were swept overboard by large waves. The KerBalloon crew remained belowdecks throughout the ordeal and Specialist Bill, who only recently began accompanying sea voyages after staying on dry land throughout 2017, became so seasick he still couldn\u2019t stand up by the time the ship limped back to port later in the day. Needing engine repairs and a general inspection, the ship will not be ready to head out again until late next week at the earliest for another attempt.

Originally there were supposed to only be three, but it may require 4 or 5 to get around to visiting all the planets \u2013 this is what the team now has to determine. Several routes, like a hop from Kerbin to Eve to Jool, were deliberately not plotted to any further planets so that a feasible route had a better chance of being plotted for an initial mission design before trying to reach more distant targets. We\u2019ll have another update next week with the final results of the trajectory analysis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESecurity Tightens Around Monolith as Research Continues\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis past weekend saw some pilgrims attempting to approach the Monolith under cover of darkness. They were quickly spotted and apprehended, then released to return to Umbarg via the underground roadway. A story broke the next day on KNN that the pilgrims had been roughed up and threatened by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E security \u2013 this has been denied and we can also confirm these are completely false allegations. Unfortunately there has been an ongoing battle among the news media, political and religious figures ever since the Presider bypassed the Assembly to ratify the laws that allowed surface operations to continue. Thankfully this has for the most part failed to have any affect on us worth reporting, until this past weekend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecurity around the Monolith has since been tightened even further, especially as experiments on the edifice have resumed, which is apparently what the various Monolithic followers find the most repulsive. Another attempt was made to try to access the inside of the Monolith via a high powered laser cutter, which was attempted \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=5129\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elate last year\u003C/a\u003E with a less-powerful version. Unfortunately the failed attempt also took down power to the entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E campus for several hours, thankfully not seriously impacting any operations. Interesting news that has come out since then however is that the teams studying the crystal formations over in Umbarg registered an energy output while the laser was firing, suggesting that the heat from the laser was converted to electricity and distributed to prevent the surface from taking any damage. Scientists are still studying the crystals for use as a potential means of energy storage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EATN Database\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weekly update for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/timelines/806163555804479489\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAsteroid Tracking Network\u003C/a\u003E database is available \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d6VhHhqL0QbAJEdncfkekFfasU6DH3wDLzu1Vr3TIpA/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, containing 1,915 asteroids and 4 updated with new observation data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECelestial Snapshot of the Week\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot much happening in the heavens lately but we are approaching opposition with Urlum and Sarnus, visible here rising shortly after sunset as fuel trucks prepare to tank up a Progeny Mk6 Block I rocket.

No worries, he gets around to things eventually. I\u2019m just happy that I can continue to help improve the program even without launching things into orbit. So yea I always keep an eye on Alaba in the tracking station each day to make sure it doesn\u2019t sneak a Mun intercept without me knowing, which is when I caught the most recent one. All observatories were facing away at the time, which is why it took a day for anyone to realize what had happened, since Alaba is only visible for about 1/4 of it\u2019s orbit at this point in Kerbin\u2019s travels about the sun.

There\u2019s already someone else taking up the torch but they\u2019ve stripped out the mod\u2019s communication system, which was the most realistic-focused one to be found at this time. Unlike other comm mods it more accurately models the current use and design of the Deep Space Network, requiring vessels to connect to Kerbin via a high-gain antenna and can only talk to or relay data between craft with short-gain antenna (like the Mars orbiters do). In addition it modeled bandwidth of a signal based on distance and power \u2013 the further away the probe got the lower the transmission rate became. Signals could also be interrupted by solar activity. I want to keep this in Kerbalism moving forward so I would need to manage my own fork.

First off, Avengers Infinity War was coming and I had to of course do a marathon of all the previous movies leading up to it, so that was 2-3 per day for 6 days to get through them all. I saw Infinity War the Friday night it came out and yea, it was pretty great. On top of all that a vehicle accidentally rammed my building and so I lost most of a day or two while access was limited due to structural damage, and thus I couldn\u2019t work on my PC and had to shack up with my aunt and grandma down the street. Long story short, I\u2019ve only got 10 days lead time now so it\u2019s time to grind and earn back those 11 days to return to a 3-week lead. Inevitably the KSA operational pace suffers as a result, although I try not to let it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom contracts\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve mostly given up on letting the game give me contracts and have just started using old contracts as a basis for new contracts that I assign myself. The game\u2019s contract system isn\u2019t entirely useless though as I still like it for giving me ideas for contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk6 launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose there was some slight unconscious bias in choosing 5 flights at 15\u00B0 intervals knowing ahead of time what the shape of the radiation field around Kerbin actually looks like (you can see it in the Map view or in the Tracking Station using 0,1,2,3 on the numpad) but I did not calculate anything beforehand to determine that I would miss the field by the last launch. The plan just seemed to make sense regardless of what I already knew. If the last flight hadn\u2019t missed the radiation field, the Progenitor program would be doing something completely different, like buying 2 more Mk6 Block I rockets to push all the way direct south.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the system crash due to a write error was a real thing. For some reason kOS had a sharing issue with the telemetry log file, which meant it was trying to write to it while another program was using it. I don\u2019t know what program that was because I didn\u2019t have the file opened in any window I could see. After the second time it occurred I restarted my computer and then the entire launch went fine on that third try. I still kept the crash as a story point tho, and I could have actually done what I said was done to recover the rocket. I was ready to do it if it happened a third time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually forgot to remove the code that detached the fairings during the flight itself, but since that doesn\u2019t really make a huge difference in the outcome I didn\u2019t bother re-flying after realizing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the launch viewing area really is just over 600m from the pad and yes a kerbal really could run that far under 5 minutes \u2013 although to be honest I did not think to fact check this when I first wrote the tweets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDamn typos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate it when I \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/status/988191721338097665\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emiss these\u003C/a\u003E.

Turns out they managed to get it right to within 10 seconds \u2013 maybe even better but they were unable to see the encounter itself due to Mun being in daylight at the time. The margin of error was determined based on the slight difference in the actual current orbit and the one they had planned to see post-encounter. It was very close.

My process for keeping everything organized is insanely simple \u2013 I just write it all down. I literally have a plain text file in which I compose and date every tweet. They are all listed in chronological order. Below the most recent planned tweets are dates under which I have written what goes on at those dates \u2013 sometimes generally sometimes specifically. So I\u2019m currently at May 18th. Lets say I decide to tweet something on May 18th that I know I\u2019m going to have to follow up on later in the month. If I know what day then I\u2019ll make a line somewhere below with the date and a note about what I\u2019m supposed to follow up with that day. If not I have a general list of things that need to get done that month at the bottom of all the May dates with specific stuff I\u2019ve noted so far. Pretty simple. I get an idea for a future story plot? I just note it below. Now I can mostly forget about it until I reach that point down in the text file, after progressing through however many days to get there. If I reach that point and realize I forgot to do some setup tweets beforehand, well that\u2019s why I like having a 3-week lead time because that\u2019s generally enough time to go back and add some relevant setup tweets before anything related to this upcoming event is published.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I just need to keep seasonal allergies in check \u2013 went back on some over the counter meds after being laid up for almost two days when the pollen levels spiked.

Although it debuted alongside the Block I back in October of 2017 (then designated Mk5) the more-powerful Block II was put on the back burner after the Block I reached the height the Block II was supposed to fly to, negating any reason for it to to be used. Since successive flights of the Block I failed to make it high enough to pass completely through the hazardous radiation region, the Block II finally has a mission it can take on. While preparations are being made to launch two Block II\u2019s in close succession sometime in the middle of this month, the loss of the last Block I and tight purse strings has led to a part shortage.

The rocket mostly came together as planned, the only real problem was mating the test weight to the fuel tank. Because the entire rocket is meant to be recovered for analysis purposes (all the high-res data will be stored in the test weight) the test weight won\u2019t be leaving the fuel tank and the interstage decoupler seen in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/24VeS3W\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe blueprints\u003C/a\u003E was not included.

Problems arose here as well when it came to strutting the rocket down to the frame of the carry vehicle \u2013 the attach points created an uneven load on the treads that would have caused the vehicle to want to constantly steer off to the side. Adjustments were made and the rocket was successfully \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/gp/kerbal_space_agency/2e3c8T\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emoved out\u003C/a\u003E to the launch pad earlier today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever problems continued to plague the carry vehicle when the hydraulics failed during the lift to vertical. Thankfully fail safes locked the push rods in place and the platform did not collapse back down onto the bed. The cranes used to construct the service towers were moved back into position to help lower the rocket and the carry vehicle was able to return to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. The crews will continue working over the weekend to assess the failure and repair the carry vehicle to hopefully try again on Monday. There is plenty of room in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to raise the rocket there, so testing can be done before the move to the pad.

A fault line has sheared the vein vertically by just over a meter, which would have meant any energy sent along them would have not been able to reach any further. This could maybe explain why both caverns failed to receive deadly electrical discharges during \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=4566\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Incident\u003C/a\u003E while Umbarg and Kravass both experienced them. We say maybe because it is unknown yet whether these veins actually extend all the way to either cavern \u2013 the digging continues. This discovery has once again brought up speculation that the Monolith was trying to actively kill kerbals, but the discovery could also mean that the inability to fully discharge its energy across its entire crystal network led to more powerful than normal surges traveling back to hit Umbarg and Kravass. There is no evidence yet discovered that the energy was discharged at the break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn additional news, a peaceful protest outside the Monolith visitation registration offices turned violent earlier this week, forcing a police response with tear gas to disperse the crowd. Several arrests were made but none of them claimed to be responsible for agitating the crowd. The office has remained closed since the end of last year when it was attacked by a still-unidentified group of kerbs that left some staff injured. The government refuses to open it until those responsible have been found however despite religious leaders claiming to be doing all they can to help no arrests have yet been made and the case remains cold.

GTA: Online had a stimulus package giving you money for just logging in every day the past week so I did and wasted a good amount of time on it with my buddy. I also got a bit burnt out and spent some time planning a road trip for this summer. I enjoy the logistics of planning things. Once me and an ex-girlfriend planned a 5-day Florida trip to Disney World, Sea World, Epcot, MGM Studios and Universal. Yea, 5 days. We had an itinerary for all the attractions we wanted to hit and when.

In hindsight I probably could have created a launch site with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151818-12x-kerbal-konstructs/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Konstructs\u003C/a\u003E \u2013 not actually placing any objects just defining a new launch site location.

Then that kicked off the mission timer so I had to modify the persistence file to return the vehicle to a pre-launch state. Now I had to load into the flight scene for a vehicle already active which was a different state from just deployed, so my kOS code needing a bit of tweaking to operate properly at boot-up. Finally the launch base wanted to rotate veeeery slowly for some reason, so I had to engage timewarp while getting set up to launch so it would freeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than all that everything went fine. Well, except for the failure to recover the rocket. But that oversight with the altitude measurements was an honest mistake.

This last flight I actually looked into the stability settings and found I can set the hold point for roll. So by tweaking it to values like -0.175\u00B0 I can have the plane hold a bank juuuust enough to turn at a rate that keeps pace with the changing heading to the waypoint.

(Not counting all the work I had done previously on the carry vehicle, which I built weeks ago.) Yea no, it actually took me like 3-4 hours of total work to get right. First I tried to actually set it up that way in the game by using the robotic controls and lifting the platform and deploying the legs \u2013 oh my, physics had a field day with that. The whole thing wobbled so much I couldn\u2019t keep it straight long enough to get a good line up with the engine collar, and the stabilizer legs visually clipped into the launch pad. So back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E to just move everything into position beforehand, strut the excrements out of it, then move it back to the launch pad.

Darn it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are just the highlights of my troubles. In the end I still ended up with a slight misalignment of the engine to the clamp.

Nevermind the fact that I can\u2019t run-check my code outside of the game so I have to keep getting errors and restarting the flight to fix stupid syntax issues, there were several new things I was doing that introduced some tricky logic issues. One in particular hung me up so bad I had to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/comments/8llpe4/code_sleuths_assemble_seeing_odd_persistent/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eask for help on reddit\u003C/a\u003E.

Eventually though I will want to switch to lighter helium, which would be more expensive, even for kerbals. I also don\u2019t know the mass since I don\u2019t know the amount, so if I don\u2019t figure it out I\u2019ll just make the whole tank part a bit lighter when switching to helium at some point. The reason I\u2019ve bothered defining the pressurization gas is because both nitrogen and helium are actual gasses that can be mined and used for various aspects of the game in various mods, and picking between the two does have consequences given the difference in their properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot when I actually flew the mission to account for the slight amount of fuel that would have been used up during the first launch attempt that was aborted.

So the alternator allowed the battery level to remain constant while the engine was on, then it drained again.

On the monthly expense sheet I didn\u2019t change anything since in the overall finance scheme the expenditure is the same.

The fuel tank and its accompanying parts were nowhere to be found, at least in pieces large enough to be detected among the surface scatter at the bottom of the ocean. Upon setting eyes on the test weight it was pretty clear that the rocket had failed to deploy its parachutes successfully given the nose of the weight was almost completely caved inwards from impact. A look at the operations log showed that the AFCS crashed when attempting to deploy the parachutes and they were never used. The rocket crashed nose-first into the ocean at just over 300m/s but the test weight was built to handle impacts of over 500m/s with the instruments all huddled in the base. The fuel tanks would have still been pressurized on impact and thus exploded, but the engine would not have hit bell-first and we can therefore examine that part to determine why it failed during ascent. Video footage from the booster camera has turned out to be extremely poor for some reason and technicians are working to extract what still images they can from it.

A lot of work went into modeling the rocket\u2019s ascent based off data collected over the numerous Mk5 and Mk6 Block I flights this past year and for the first time engineers were relatively confident that the rocket would perform as expected. Their confidence was proven right as the longer rocket remained pointing downrange after launch thanks in part to the extra push from its radial boosters. The only real surprise was the recovery, since all of the simulations ran before the flight had the rocket either completely breaking up or traveling too fast to safely deploy its chutes. A lot of analysis will need to be done on this flight to determine how we want to proceed such as why the rocket became so unstable late into the flight, whether trying to broadside the atmosphere on purpose would help with recovery from higher altitudes and whether we can even support a mission higher than 1Mm due to battery power limitations. It\u2019s estimated based on this flight\u2019s performance that the Block II could reach out as far as 3.5Mm (1/3 the way to Mun) which would take almost three hours for it to return to Kerbin!

A check of the truck\u2019s fuel tanks in the game showed I was okay, but it made me think about the Ascension rocket as well for the first time. Checking that, I realized two trucks as depicted in one of the pre-launch photos would not have sufficed, so I added the tweet about making two trips to the launch pad. So it\u2019s not just the fact that I can sit back for a few days and not have to worry about things not being tweeted, I can actively go back and edit improvements to things I\u2019ve already written but not yet published.

Unless I can get the two mods integrated, I would rather be able to do extensive mission planning with a tool that makes it easy to share the process with my audience through graphs and such. I think though it should be possible, since the orbital decay mod gives you an estimation of time left in orbit, and hopefully that rough calculation can be used by KSPTOT to get a better idea of where a vessel might be after several orbits. I had also previously decided not to do this because I didn\u2019t like the thought of having to update the Ops Tracker database every single day with new orbital data so things stay current. However it\u2019s now pretty easy to do this \u2013 I literally just copy/paste values directly out of the game into the database \u2013 I may be able to automate it even.

After seeing absolutely no control issues during flight, the go-ahead was given to perform a release of the rocket while the aircraft flew level (as in, not climbing or descending, not perfectly horizontal). The decoupler is positioned at the top of the booster, just below the payload fairings, for a secure attachment that is also slightly ahead of the center of mass, which meant that upon release the rocket was kicked up and back. Once free of the aircraft, it flew stable on its own for a few seconds before drifting off heading and falling back towards the ground.

First I tried attaching the decoupler to the aircraft then merging the rocket and attaching it to the decoupler. The truss is the root part of the rocket so I had to attach that to the decoupler then translate/rotate the rocket into proper position. This however ended up leaving the larger piece of the decoupler on the rocket after it was detached. I couldn\u2019t flip the decoupler over for its initial attachment so I had to attach it to the rocket, but then when I tried to merge it to the plane it wouldn\u2019t attach via the decoupler. So finally I had to merge the aircraft with the rocket and attach that to the decoupler, then re-root to the aircraft cabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond challenge was that I wanted to video the release but I also wanted the release I captured to be a genuine first try, not a recreation \u2013 this meant I had to fly with visual effects enabled, such as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip11-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00244-17042016-11-compatible-faster-loading/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EScatterer\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149733-122-environmentalvisualenhancements-12-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. To make things workable I disabled the Scatterer water shaders and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E volumetric clouds. While things were still running only about 60-70% normal speed it was doable. Unfortunately I still had to fly and capture the release twice because the first time I made the mistake of switching over to the rocket after release to see how it was doing, which I know screws up the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150280-131-void-unvoided-vessel-orbital-informational-display/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EVOID\u003C/a\u003E data logging \u2013 it starts logging data for the new active vessel. I need that log holding the plane data to recreate the flight path for aircraft in the Ops Tracker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the flight I was able to use a save file taken shortly before the release and manually set the pitch trim value in the file after some experimenting to hold the aircraft level after the save was loaded, which let me re-create the release very well. I wrote up a small \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/165628-13-kos-v1130-kos-scriptable-autopilot-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EkOS\u003C/a\u003E script to show me the rocket pitch after it was let go, which is where the values that were reported came from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth noting that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/gp/kerbal_space_agency/Hxs43V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis image\u003C/a\u003E had Scatterer water shaders disabled, but the atmospheric effects still made it look good from a distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeuce carry mission 2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried flying this one again with VFX active and with volumetric clouds but unfortunately when I went to release I encountered \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zGhZnil.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis bug in Scatterer\u003C/a\u003E (fixed in a more recent version) and the lag was so bad also that doing the dive and climb maneuver and holding pitch with any accuracy was pretty much impossible. So again, this mission was flown twice, which always sucks for aircraft missions because they are flown in real time so that\u2019s a good chunk of wasted time.

Upon return the rocket would attempt to hold whatever heading it happened to be on, so it should have continued roughly along the trajectory it was following when we lost contact with it. What we really don\u2019t know is how far it would travel given that it is also programmed to nose up to 15\u00B0 of pitch once in the lower atmosphere to glide and help reduce speed and heating. If it crashed within the search area, it\u2019s possible it went into one of the water bodies and sank with a damaged sonar transponder.

The problem is that once I fly the mission and have to compile all the data and everything as a result of flying the mission, changing when it is flown becomes near impossible and I would have had to fly it all over again at another date and doubled my workload atop what I had already done.

I could have just launched the rocket without any lights on it but that seemed like too much of a cop-out so I did end up compositing multiple images to create the final photo \u2013 one of the rocket launching with smoke and one without was the main technique, along with a bare background plate so when I merged them I could remove the smoke above the lights and replace it with a layer of black I blended in to still blot out the sky under the rocket plume, which was also a composite since I couldn\u2019t get images of the rocket in the exact same spot when using smoke and when not. Also the flag doesn\u2019t really have a light on it that was a composite of an image taken with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71536\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eambient light tool\u003C/a\u003E adjusted upwards to make the flag brighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENight launch video\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was even more tricky, but I managed to figure out a way to get it done with minimal hassle. I can\u2019t turn off the smoke without pausing the game, and when pausing the game I normally can\u2019t access the SmokeScreen menu to turn it off, but I found that if I leave the particle emitter editor window open I could close the main SmokeScreen menu (which doesn\u2019t hide at F2) and it would still stay open. When it isn\u2019t selected the border is black so since it also doesn\u2019t hide on F2 I was able to place it all the way to the side of the screen where it is essentially invisible against the night sky. So I launch, waited for the rocket to ascend a bit, hit F2 and then paused the game, pulled out the editor, killed the smoke emitter, hid the editor on the side again, unpaused and hid the UI (if I had just paused and unpaused with the UI hidden both Kerbal Alarm Clock and Resource App would have stayed visible thanks to a bug).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow when I went into my Sony Vegas video editor I simply cut out the part where I was adjusting the smoke emitter however I could not show/hide the UI and pause/unpause fast enough without the rocket moving, so I still had several dozen frames where the UI was visible. For this I cropped the video down to just the rocket and had a still image background plate to fill out the rest of the frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit still took me a couple of tries to get everything close to right, and some screaming and cursing \u2013 I\u2019m still not 100% pleased with the result, I think the smoke trail goes too long and falls back oddly but I think the overall effect is still worthy of what I was going for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I have to get ready to keep tabs on today\u2019s launch\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-28T11:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:550px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ccaption\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOperations Summary \u2013 Week of 7/23/18\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/caption\u003E\n\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/3z04BEh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImages from the Week Gallery\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Analysis Posted for Both Recent Launches\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=7781\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProgeny Mk6 Block I Flight 6\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=7786\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAscension Mk1 Block I Flight 2\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the Progeny flight being mostly routine other than some extreme testing of the air brakes the more interesting read would definitely be the Ascension analysis, which covers why the rocket failed to make orbit.

This summer now I\u2019m able to stay cool enough even in 90\u002B\u00B0F that I can continue to work, but with a big new DLC dropping for GTA Online this week I knew I wasn\u2019t going to have as much time to work on KSA operations so I needed things to slow way down for a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I expected to get more work done than I did and it wasn\u2019t because of GTA Online but mainly I was sleeping very erratically, even for me, and I think I was fighting off something. I don\u2019t really ever get sick \u2013 I can\u2019t recall the last time I had to take any sort of medication to fight off even a minor cold or infection \u2013 so when I am tired and want to sleep a lot I just do, and it\u2019s probably due to my immune system needing the extra energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMore crash annoyances\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill having some trouble with KSP not wanting to load my save files when all my regular mods are installed.

This week, despite changing absolutely nothing else about my KSP install, the game decided it just wasn\u2019t going to work with KSPIE installed. So, love it. I just deleted it entirely. Good news is that I don\u2019t really use it for anything yet since it features a lot of very advanced space tech. At the same time though its a pretty deep mod that ties into many game functions so it\u2019s possible it could have an affect on current rocket launches somehow, I will need to keep an eye on things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMore annoying annoyances\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if dealing with the game causing trouble wasn\u2019t enough, now it seems that TweetDeck is deciding not to give me access to all my twitter collections anymore. Randomly. So, twitter collections are where I can group various tweets into their own timeline and it\u2019s how I compile mission logs and event sequences. They are a huge backbone in my storytelling. Normally, if I want to edit a collection to add/remove tweets I can select it from a list in TweetDeck to add it as a column, then I can drag \u0026amp; drop tweets into it. Now for some reason some of them are missing from that list, and I can\u2019t figure out why the ones that are no longer available were removed. The collections themselves still exist, thankfully, but I can no longer edit them in TweetDeck. Now, it only took me about 15 minutes to write my own little javascript page using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/jublonet/codebird-js\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecodebird\u003C/a\u003E, which lets me add tweets to the timelines, but it\u2019s just a tad bit more time consuming to do this now, which doesn\u2019t help things. Hopefully TweetDeck can get their excrements together, I sent in a bug submission but it\u2019s not a support service that guarantees a reply to all submissions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it really is my birthday today.

Although the Mk6-I has failed to return safely to Kerbin on previous flights, this was the first one where a safe return was a mission critical item so the samples could be studied. The investigation into why the rocket broke apart during re-entry has only just begun and given its forensic nature in having to examine both the data and recovered parts it may take up to 2 weeks if not longer before we hear any results. The two current main focuses of the analysis are the air brakes and the goo containment units. The air brakes were logged as being deployed just prior to the rocket breaking up. Although they deployed at pressures that were less than the last flight, we can\u2019t rule out a mechanical malfunction that could have deployed them improperly, or failed to deploy all at the same time. The goo containment units are suspect mainly because they are the only new parts on the rocket that have not been flown before. It\u2019s possible one or both units could have failed to cycle closed properly, allowing re-entry heat to burn them up from the inside and ruining the structural rigidity of the rocket during a time when Gee forces are at their greatest. Until we have answers, the next launch of the Mk6-I, which is set to carry more samples into space in similar containers, has been scrubbed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGenesis \u0026amp; Progenitor Move Closer to Airborne Rocket Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter 2 weeks of delays thanks to weather and mechanical issues, Flight Officers Tedman and Aldeny were finally able to take the Deuce back up carrying a Progeny Mk1-B rocket not once, but twice this week. The \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=7815\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst release test\u003C/a\u003E saw them pitch the aircraft up even farther than before to try and get the rocket as close as possible to vertical on jettison. Unfortunately the results were not what everyone was expecting, as the effectiveness of the decoupler in pushing away the rocket has reduced the more the aircraft noses up. It\u2019s not for loss of speed either, but more likely due to the rocket already being in a more stable orientation upon release and less likely to nose up because of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=7846\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esecond release test\u003C/a\u003E had them pull the nose up even further. This required both pilots to keep a careful watch on the instruments during the climb to ensure the aircraft did not enter into a dangerous stall, which meant the rocket itself (usually released by the copilot) had to decide when it was time to hop off. The flight computer used for the Mk1-B is rudimentary compared to the inline core used by later Progeny rockets and so a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gist.github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/55c59e7ea9aa9bd1d0746324b0ab659d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erough script\u003C/a\u003E had to be written to monitor the aircraft\u2019s pitch, speed and altitude.

This was mainly to get the astronauts accustomed to working within the restrictive confines of the capsule and also to ensure that all operations involving them and the capsules could be carried out properly. This included simply getting into and out of the capsules while on the ground, followed by getting in and out while floating in the waters off the coast of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Exercises then moved on to scenarios for both land and sea where the capsule had returned damaged or improperly landed, some cases with the astronauts simulating being injured or completely incapacitated. Testing was done for how the capsule might be recovered from both land and sea using trucks, boats and airships. Crews from all three of our contracted Maritime Service Vessels participated in various exercises as well to work out any problems with recovery operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis month will now include a series of meetings to review the various merits and debate the issues for both capsules, as well as additional operational training for the astronauts within the capsules.

This is likely due to the fact that accounts used to be limited to only a certain number of collections until several months or maybe a year ago. I don\u2019t know when but at some point twitter either removed the restriction or increased the allowed number of collections per account. I haven\u2019t gotten any errors yet creating new collections so if there\u2019s a new upper limit I\u2019ve not yet reached it (I was getting around it earlier by just creating the collections under my @DKerman_KSA account since ultimately the end user doesn\u2019t see what account the collection is from when it is displayed on the website).

Everyone at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E immediately knew this as a massive electromagnetic (EM) pulse surged through all active electronics on campus and the nearby Support Village and shorted them out \u2013 in some cases in a shower of sparks and electrical arcs. Minor fires were started in some areas and brought under control as personnel began to evacuate over the causeway bridge to prepare to head for Umbarg. This evacuation plan was set in place after the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=4566\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst time\u003C/a\u003E the Monolith sent out such a discharge. Several injuries were reported from burns but no deaths occurred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot all staff could be immediately moved off site as we had a Deuce aircraft in the air for its Progeny Mk1-B \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=7909\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecarry/release mission\u003C/a\u003E. Unable to contact them, we had to hope they would be able to fly back and land safely on their own and had what emergency crew we could spare ready near the runway. Aboard the aircraft, after losing radio contact Flight Officers Aldeny and Tedman first considered diverting to Kravass, but because the mission carried little fuel in order to make the climb to altitude easier, they did not have enough to go that far. Next they flew over Umbarg to see if they could contact anyone, but some boats in the bay and an airship on approach reported they too had lost contact with the city. Finally they flew back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to see if the space center had received any visible damage. Seeing none, Aldy took the Deuce in closer to get a better look at the condition of the runway in preparation for a landing on the next pass, however at this time the plane\u2019s electrical systems shorted out. Thankfully the Deuce is still largely mechanical driven from its engines to its control surfaces and even the landing gear have a manual pump. The engines did run rough and Aldy put her down as fast as possible, fearing they would cut out. The aircraft made a safe landing at 14:09 and the crew was evacuated on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that the aircraft lost electrical systems some time after the initial EM pulse was why we sent back a team to check on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as soon as we considered it safe \u2013 at least as safe as we could guess given we had no idea what the Monolith was actually doing. Could it explode? Release some kind of deadly radiation? We commend the volunteers who returned to the surface to take readings and assess the situation. When they returned the report was both good and bad. The good news is that there appears to be no harmful levels of detectable toxins or radiation in the area. The bad news is that what we initially thought was just a pulse is actually an EM field stretching out to nearly 10km (roughly twice the distance to the Umbarg tunnel mouth) in every direction \u2013 the surface crew followed the shore line north and did not have a means to check distance over the water but it\u2019s safe to assume it extends that way too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy generated by the field is more than enough to immediately fry any active electronics within it, which poses some serious problems for us to continue operations at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. The two main questions we are looking to answer right now are why the field exists and how long it will persist. Note that in asking why the field exists we mean what is the Monolith doing that is causing the field? Everyone already agrees the incident was triggered by the recent attempt to drill a hole up into the Monolith from underneath through the crystal structure found to form a base beneath the impenetrable facade seen above ground. In the meantime we will be working on the logistics of how to continue what KSA operations we can without the ability to use the Kerbal Space Center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to the effects the Monolith had on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, it once again made use of the crystalline network discovered running through the ground to Kravass and Umbarg. Unlike the first event which was a massive discharge, this time they actually drew energy and sucked both caverns dry of electricity. With no power making it out of the keothermal stations, utility crews quickly got to work inspecting the main power conduits leading from both plants and discovered the crystals had grown into them. It\u2019s likely the Monolith could have been leaching very small amounts of power for months, building up energy. Activating and maintaining the field would require a lot of power, and when reserves ran low it was forced to draw a very not so inconspicuous amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took nearly two days to perform the unprecedented task of taking all keothermal generators offline, cutting out and replacing the crystal-infused conduit section, and bringing all the generators back online. For quite some time now kerbs have been pressuring the power authorities to rebuild the poorly designed infrastructure, but it wasn\u2019t poorly built and the stance of \u201Cif it ain\u2019t broke\u2026\u201D kept redesign plans at bay. This event could finally make those in charge rethink their position, because taking an entire power plant offline to fix a single conduit is not a very efficient repair job. With the crystals removed, additional time will be needed to gradually bring power back to various areas to monitor for any additional drain points. As of right now the EM field does not appear to be affected by the loss of the crystals it was using to gain energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis report will also serve as our Ops Summary for this week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EATN Database\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weekly update for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/timelines/806163555804479489\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAsteroid Tracking Network\u003C/a\u003E database is available \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TPZRb-6h2cl8319_wlIyPVrRZGwTIBNwf-7M0ubznyw/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, containing 2,310 asteroids and 2 updated with new observation data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFrom the Desk of Drew Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan title=\u0022Out of Character Behind the Scenes stuff\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003EOut of Character Behind the Scenes stuff)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWritten on 8/3/18\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBREAK TIME!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u2019ve known this has been coming for months. Some of you may have as well if you\u2019ve been reading about the troubles I\u2019ve been having keeping up with things lately but even before that, like last year I dropped some hints of bigger things to come when I triggered the Monolith for the first time. Well, here we are \u2013 but not quite as I originally envisioned. That\u2019s not unexpected though, because although I can do lots of plotting on where I want the story to go ultimately it is also affected by events in real life as well as what happens in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yea, I always planned for there to be something big to go down around this time of the year since for months I\u2019ve been planning an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1zKUFNWoXwl33I1vH3O6_IdWW8AWt1vMI\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eepic 4-week cross country road trip\u003C/a\u003E to undertake from Sept to Oct. It\u2019s just that I wasn\u2019t sure where the KSA would be at the time. I had hoped by now the Ascension Mk1 would have made it to orbit, but that didn\u2019t happen so there was a delay in the ordering of additional Mk1 rockets to be constructed and I couldn\u2019t go with my original plot idea \u2013 which I\u2019m still going to hold partly in reserve. What I can say, because I\u2019m no longer doing it, was that it was going to destroy the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and damage the HAB. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E destruction would serve the purpose of not only halting operations but also overcome the problem I noticed and mentioned in a Desk Notes very early on, which is the Tier 2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is not located in the same spot as the original Tier 1 building. So I couldn\u2019t say that they \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E got \u201Cexpanded\u201D when it was eventually upgraded because the whole structure will have shifted position significantly. So having reason to rebuild it from the foundations up would solve that. However now I don\u2019t need to destroy the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to upgrade to a bigger building but I\u2019m not going to say how. That\u2019ll come along in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did want to have operations go on a bit longer through the month of August, but this week I got offered work for a fireworks show over in the Maldives for almost the entire second-half of August and 2 days into September. I\u2019m leaving for my road trip on Sept 8th so that gives me very few days over the next month to work on pushing out my lead time \u003Cem\u003Etwo months\u003C/em\u003E in order to be able to let things run while I am not home. I really need the work for extra money so the road trip doesn\u2019t completely clean me out \u2013 I know, hard to feel bad for me spending half a month on a tropical island.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to being gone most of this month and all of September, in order to continue to keep my bank account padded since I\u2019m not doing much other work these days I\u2019m likely going to accept an extended fireworks show overseas for New Years, which can begin work as early as the day after Thanksgiving. So after coming home from my road trip I\u2019ll have just under 2 months to work more on KSA ops before being gone all of December. However this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean KSA operations themselves will continue to be suspended for the remainder of the year. But they could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason KSA ops might be down for the remainder of the year is I\u2019m really frustrated with how far behind I\u2019ve fallen in keeping up with version updates to KSP as well as adding new features to the Ops Tracker and even the website could use a bit of TLC. I\u2019m putting all my time into just keeping ahead of daily operations I have no time for anything else. And yes, I do spend time doing other things as well because as much as I try I just can\u2019t do just KSA ops all day every day. So a big requirement of getting operations back on track will be how much I can get done working through my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSAMissionCtrl/OpsTracker/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eissues queue\u003C/a\u003E for the Ops Tracker as well as getting a KSP v1.4.5 install up and running looking the same as my current v1.3.1 install \u2013 which now seems to want to crash a \u003Cem\u003Elot \u003C/em\u003Ewhen I try to play with all my mods installed. I will look at the log, see what the last mod was doing before the crash, remove that mod and the game will run fine until it somehow finds a way to crash with a different mod after I\u2019ve done nothing else to it. Darn it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yea, that\u2019s the whole story right now. Circumstances have forced me into this position but again, that\u2019s just the way it is. Yes, it\u2019s a bummer that the KSA might not reach orbit this year like it was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/statuses/950366490410307584\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoriginally planned\u003C/a\u003E way back in January (among other things) but just like the real space programs you have to plan for the best and work with what you end up getting.

If you\u2019ve not been able to keep up with the twitter feed, here is a recap:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same day we released the first report, just as everyone in both Kravass and Umbarg were getting settled back in and enjoying having full power once more, everything went dark again. Well \u2013 almost. A small portion of both cavern systems stayed lit, which told the utility crews almost exactly where to look in order to find the additional crystal growths. Once again everyone had to wait for a full power shutdown, conduit replacement, and restart. The power returned and remained stable for two more days before new crystal veins had attached themselves elsewhere to suck up energy again. Because the power authorities charge flat rates, installing monitoring equipment was never a high priority and discovering a vein hooking into the system before it begins to pull massive amounts of power just isn\u2019t possible. Tired of dealing with the constant shut downs, a new plan was formulated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcavations had already been performed underground, drifting along one of the main crystal veins growing from the base of the Monolith. This was along the one leading towards Sheltered Rock and Ockr to determine why it didn\u2019t reach the caverns there (turns out it might, but a fault line broke the connection before it branched). However the two leading off towards Umbarg and Kravass have now been exposed from the surface near the caverns after days of digging to allow explosives to be lowered down and detonated. The energy-absorbing nature of the crystals took in the majority of the blast, leaving them with only minor damage and forcing work crews to manually dismantle the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith repeated attempts to draw power denied and the connection eventually completely severed, over the past couple of days the EM field surrounding the Monolith has shrunken considerably from its original 10km and now is currently holding stable at just 2.5km. This is still wide enough to encompass all the buildings in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, unfortunately. Even more unfortunate is that a potential reason for the EM field\u2019s strong existence was because the Monolith was quickly growing new crystal to plug up the drill hole bored by the research team. With the field size largely reduced, the same effect has been observed for the crystal growth. While it was originally discovered to be closing at a rate that could see it healed in about 2 weeks, its now healing at a rate that could take up to 3 months if the field remains constant. The connection between the field size and healing rate is what leads scientists to strongly believe the field is a result of the growth rather than a purely defensive mechanism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe theory that the field was a direct attack at our drilling attempts had always bothered scientists, since we don\u2019t need electrical systems to drill. We could rig up a mechanical setup that would have to be cranked by hand, but if it was designed for several kerbs to operate together, a decent amount of drilling could be done. With it\u2019s original healing rate, its doubtful any progress could have been made manually. The reduced rate of healing shows promise but we have to consider the fact that the crystal has shown the ability to absorb energy, as evidenced by the attempt to blow some of it up. Drilling produces heat, and that could be enough to give the Monolith the energy needed to still heal faster than we could drill. Having nothing better to do, researchers say they are going to try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will continue to monitor the field while the power authorities maintain vigilance on the crystal veins to ensure they do not reconnect. There was some debate as to whether an auxiliary conduit could be built so a limited amount of power could be directed towards the Monolith and speed up the healing process.

First, if you have not yet seen it, our end of year summary for 2018 is available \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ddaTKxUGSqDx39cpI7-LkHgqmLkz3ogW0aQaVJTEQvI/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. I will admit, this is not a pretty picture! We are now almost a quarter of the way into our third year of operations and as the Total Net Income field shows we have lost 171,094 funds from our original capital. This is not unexpected, given that we are trying to create an entirely new industry \u2013 the commercial support remains nascent at best as we attempt to adapt our current technologies to be able to carry out missions clients want \u003Cem\u003Etoday\u003C/em\u003E while at the same time working to advance our technology to meet their needs in the years to come as both air and space become more accessible. Lots of profits is not something we will see much of in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, we managed marginal yearly profits our first two years in operation so what happened? Thankfully, a large portion of our losses stemmed from external events that were entirely out of our control. Being shut down and unable to conduct operations twice in one year easily amounted to tens of thousands of lost funds. We were unable to accrue any income at all in March thanks to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=7024\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elegal injunction\u003C/a\u003E. Even with our limited operations during the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/timelines/1049060560468369412\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMonolith EM field\u003C/a\u003E, when you average out our income for all months we still managed 37k per month. Now also take into consideration the expensive infrastructure improvements to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, which do not happen often: the runway and the new Administration Complex. The Monolith EM field also incurred significant expense when working to complete the Dhumla in an off-site facility. Remove all these factors and our loss for the year was only around 43k instead of nearly 430k! That\u2019s almost breaking even if we had been able to put in only an average month\u2019s work in March. The entire time of lost operations has also held back our ability to satisfy greater contracts since we could not develop increasingly capable technologies without conducting missions to test them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worrisome may be the fact that we spent 78k more in overall expenses this year over last year. But a full review of all our expenses has shown this was mainly due to continuing to push forwards in our advancements to space and fixed-wing flight, not because we wasted it on needless activities and disastrous missions. It\u2019s a hard lesson for many people to grasp, but you have to spend lots of money to make money and our spending was on-point this past year to put us in a good position, with the possibility of 3rd party satellites being lofted into space on the Progeny Mk6 or placed into orbit by the Ascension Mk1. The Dhumla is also our first serious contender against the airship cargo industry and C7 Aerospace has already lined up several very interested customers should the aircraft flight trials pan out. This could be the year all our various investments really finally pay off!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr \u2013 maybe it won\u2019t be. Maybe we have yet another year of financial struggle ahead of us, thanks to external strife or poor mission execution and vehicle engineering. It\u2019s worth noting that our published financials are for just our \u003Cem\u003Eoperational \u003C/em\u003Ebudget \u2013 which I like to say means you won\u2019t ever know how much we spend on toilet paper until we need it on a mission. If this budget were to run fully into the red that doesn\u2019t mean the KSA would go bankrupt, but we would be seriously crippled in our ability to create more income. Thus, I have spoken with our Operations Director and gotten approval to open up two avenues through which the public can donate funds to the KSA. They both accept payments in Universal Specie Denomination and the current exchange rate is 1USD = 1000Funds. On the left you have an option for regular monthly donations, on the right is an easy option for a one-time donation (no account needed, PayPal accepted) that does not charge us a cut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:750px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022patron-300x71.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u002271\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/patron-300x71.png\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kofi-300x60.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u002260\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kofi-300x60.png\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the generosity of donors will help get us through any hard times ahead, perhaps not.

At least, not completely. It should be no surprise that this all takes up a copious amount of time daily, which means I have less time to spend earning money otherwise. Thankfully I\u0027m in a very good place right now and am self-sufficient with my current job coaching gymnastics. It doesn\u0027t quite leave me with a whole lot of money at the end of the month however so saving up for things I want is a slow process, which I like to speed along by supplementing it with pyrotechnical work. But that work takes me away from my desk completely for days or weeks at a time and thus impacts my ability to keep up and continue with KSA activities. If I can work up a decent amount of income through regular donations, that means less time spent away on firework displays - instead of shipping out for a month or more on the holidays I can still do well with only a few days. The basic idea is that the more income I have the less chance there is that I have to take more time away from working on the KSA, and fewer dormant periods will exist. Again, lack of money can\u0027t kill the KSA - I can always come up with some excuse for putting things on hold and coming back later - but I\u0027d rather not have to do that very often. So, we\u0027ll see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy now? I feel like I\u2019m in a good place finally in proving both to myself and you, the audience, that this is a sustainable and entertaining project worthy of monetary donations. I really didn\u2019t want to receive donations from the start and reward people with the collapse of this endeavor. It\u2019s not going to bring in as much as YouTube or Twitch content creation but from the very start I wanted to do something different that could still possibly support me fully or at least partially financially the way streamers and video creators do. I also want to state I have no plans to ever monetize my YouTube channel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI originally planned to use Paypal for donations but they do take a cut out of them and also I didn\u0027t want to deal with setting up a business account or whatever. I found Ko-Fi through the KSPTOT author who set up an account for himself.

It was a re-flight of the Mystery Goo containment units that took place last July, which ended with the rocket breaking up on re-entry. This time we know the rocket did succeed in making it down through the atmosphere to the point of parachute deployment, and the data we have is consistent with a good chute popping out to slow the rocket, but the rocket itself failed to be recovered. The splashdown point was ~80km away from where we thought it would come down and it took the recovery vessel over an hour to reach it.

I might finally have the pacing nailed down, and this month\u2019s 3 launches are only so jammed up because of the backlog created by the operation suspension that closed out 2018. So after this month things will calm down even more. Ascension launches will take more time to prep than Progeny, which on average usually took about 2 weeks. Actually no, now that I think about it Ascension launches will take about the same time since there are 4 more boosters already practically built and just waiting for engines and payloads. Okay well if they had to be built from the beginning it would take 3-4 weeks between launches. So I guess things will remain about the same as January through March/April depending on how missions pan out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of missions panning out, causing this last one to fail was mainly a plot decision that came after I realized the vertical ascent was caused by the rocket striking the launch base on lift off \u2013 something I had seen in earlier KSP versions when getting things setup but never during an actual launch.

Well, as a first priority anyways. Ascension was always meant to carry astronauts into space eventually but it was planned to happen later this year rather than sooner. This week\u2019s launch was an important step in allowing us to test new technologies that will be essential in allowing kerbals to operate in space and return safely. The reaction control system, comprised of 10 cold gas thrusters spaced around the payload test weight to control roll, pitch and yaw, had some minor issues at the start but otherwise performed as designed to properly orient the payload along various vectors relative to the trajectory. The heat shield, made of an ablative material to burn away during re-entry and keep the payload relativity cool, survived landing intact thanks to the low-mounted radial chutes flipping the payload over to land nose-first as planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost notably on this mission however was our use of the Launch Vehicle Designer, a recent addition to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/33568-winmac-ksp-trajectory-optimization-tool-v160-new-launch-vehicle-designer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKSP Trajectory Optimization Tool\u003C/a\u003E.

Without lead time had I been doing this in January I would have just been forced to proceed as planned and go for another orbit knowing it would fail but having to write as if I thought it would succeed. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to waste time doing that. Yay lead time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, the redesign led to a lot of work, because now I had to build a new payload and also match that mass to what the capsule would be so I had to essentially also plan out what my ideal capsule mission would be like so I could replicate that with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/156017-12-kerbal-nrap-procedural-test-weights/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENRAP\u003C/a\u003E test weight.

But the properties I wanted to optimize, hitting a certain pitch by a certain altitude, were not able to be optimized by the program itself yet (it can now in the latest release) so I had to do a lot of fiddling with values manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh geez and then I spent a good 2hrs hunting down \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E issues including an issue with the test weight not giving me access to the full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E capabilities. Turns out even though you can use a tweakable slider in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to set the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Level to 3, whatever is defined in the part config file is as high as it\u2019ll go and there was no defined value for the test weight (which originally came out before \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E levels were introduced to the game). The other problem was with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled the kOS steering manager was unable to actually point the payload in the proper direction \u2013 it would keep missing the hold point and oscillating back and forth wildly. I thought my thrusters were just too badly placed or too low-powered. Turns out it was the fact that the test weight has a ridiculous amount of reaction wheel torque that was wildly-overcompensating for movements despite having MandatoryRCS installed (but not compiled for KSP v1.5.1 so I guess wasn\u2019t working properly). When I completely disabled all torque wheels the kOS code was able to point properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting ready to write the launch for the Wednesday I remembered \u2013 \u201Chey dummy this is a day you actually have to do work IRL\u201D which sucks because I would definitely want to be at my computer during this launch. So it was delayed to Thursday, tho I think I may have delayed it anyways because I liked the technical issue that I came up with of having more empty area in the tank to pressurize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took me 6 tries to do everything properly \u2013 as usual syntax and logic errors were the main culprits and I need to work out a better and faster way of run-checking my code before I waste time setting up for a launch and going through with a mission and spending like 40min total to have the payload returning and the program crash because I didn\u2019t check to make sure the variable I defined for the parachutes was the variable I used to reference the parachutes. ARGH! So yea it basically took an entire day just to run the mission properly. One logic error did provide for some interesting storytelling in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E not cutting out after 10s. I\u2019ll explain the in-universe reason for that happening in the flight analysis. The computer crash at the end of the flight also really happened, on the sixth attempt, and at that point I was just like \u2013 \u201Clove it\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso every time I reset to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E all the surface attached parts on the test weight sunk to the middle and had to be replaced. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022-_-\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 title=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course those six attempts were merely to fly the actual mission. I then had to design two variants of the rocket because I couldn\u2019t stand \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20181211_061158.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehow it actually looked\u003C/a\u003E with the heat shield shroud. Ugh. Peh. Yick. So I made a second one that had the heat shield clipped into the decoupler. This is the one seen in all the launch and prelaunch photos. But clipping the heat shield like this meant that when the decoupler fired, even with a force of 0 the capsule was thrown away violently and I wanted to have it push gently away with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system. So a third rocket was built with the heat shield close to but not clipping into the decoupler. I then edited this rocket into the save file my kOS created as soon as the actual rocket entered space and that\u2019s what was used to film the separation. So yea I didn\u2019t refly the whole ascent but still got to capture what the actual rocket would have seen. In the future, since I\u2019ll need to do this with the capsule too, I\u2019ll just edit the attachment node lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh but the work wasn\u2019t over yet! In addition to doing all my other post launch work (flight database, website mission post, writing the tweets, cleaning up the kOS log, taking photos, etc etc) I had to massage the telemetry data because I only realized after this launch that I had forgot to patch in EC consumption for the radio antenna when adding \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139167-112-remotetech-v170-2016-05-06/http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139167-112-remotetech-v170-2016-05-06/http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139167-112-remotetech-v170-2016-05-06/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/a\u003E support to the test weight.

Best result was to slow to 1m/s, turn the wheel all the way over, and engage reverse thrust (I have buttons on my X55 throttle for this). Throttle up to ~15% and then halfway through the turn cut throttle to idle. 3/4 of the way through the turn toggle off reverse thrust and then steer out with the nose wheel back to straight. I actually don\u2019t need to use reverse thrust to turn the Deuce, it is small enough to swing around at the end of runways just with normal steering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines I\u2019m using are from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166467-kerbal-aircraft-expansion-_continued/https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166467-kerbal-aircraft-expansion-_continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKAX\u003C/a\u003E, and the sounds for them are\u2026 pretty sucky to be honest.
