A clean save meant starting over my exploration of the solar system from scratch, so before I download Kethane and update my existing designs I decided it\u0027d be fun to go back to basics and just to a good ole fashioned Mun landing! I commissioned the Munar Mission Package project, which began with the Mk. I. That didn\u0027t turn out so well... For one thing, it couldn\u0027t make orbit. For another, the escape system didn\u0027t work. I began the Mk. II from the lander and worked my way out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander, which is itself designated Thelanderer Mk IV-a, is a thing of beauty! I decided to go for the double-staged approach: I had the descent stage and the ascent stage. All told, I think she came out looking very much like the real-world LEM. Take a look!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7FldWIy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227FldWIy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UswPLVv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UswPLVv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y8JRP0N.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Y8JRP0N.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some brief testing, the launch vehicle quickly took shape. I built and tested an escape tower, which works pretty darn well, and looks shiny. With that, it was time to head to the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8GnYvn4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228GnYvn4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission itself went off without a hitch. My manual flying tested the wiggle room of the spacecraft, having been built with Engineer Redux. The margins were solid. A stage was practically dry whenever it was time to dump it, but I never felt pressed for fuel. Future tests with mechjeb revealed that the spacecraft was slightly overengineered, but not by much. Anyway, the spacecraft went up, up, and away. Once in orbit, Trans-Munar Injection put me on a nice free return trajectory. I uncovered the lander and docked the CM with it ever so beautifully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8JggF1P.png\u0022 alt=\u00228JggF1P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GmkRVPm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GmkRVPm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wdf663E.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wdf663E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SGhdIKx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SGhdIKx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we were there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hZmYBIf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hZmYBIf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI transferred over the crew into the LM, and detached. Our target was a large, equatorial canyon on the far side of the Mun. There would be no radio contact from the site - any messages to Mission Control had to be relayed through the still-orbiting Command Module. If anything went wrong, the crew would be on their own. It was tense, as the ground rose up and the canyon walls towered overhead there was little way of assessing the grade of the land below. At touchdown, the lander tilted at a weird angle but stayed on its feet. The crew got out and celebrated, planting a flag on the site and naming it \u0022Beggar\u0027s Canyon.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jty9HOe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jty9HOe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9MxpUmX.png\u0022 alt=\u00229MxpUmX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H3ounJS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H3ounJS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the initial celebration, the ground crew set about taking ground samples, assessing the terrain, and taking pictures for the Kerbals back home. Once the command module had made a full orbit of the Mun, Bob and Jebediah piled back into the lander and pressed the big red button to start the ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*TSSSSSSSS*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: \u0022What just happened?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Nothing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: \u0022Then why aren\u0027t we moving?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Because \u003Cem\u003Enothing happened\u003C/em\u003E...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob got out to investigate, and noticed something that the engineers, the contractors, the support staff, and the flight crew, and most importantly the omnipotent god who controls their every movement failed to notice... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZBU68Zd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZBU68Zd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, the fuel line connecting the ascent stage\u0027s tanks with the engine never got connected...

Picketers camped outside the gates, as eggs and other rotten fruit was lobbed at executives and flight engineers alike. Babies were left abandoned in the streets! Really, it was horrible. It wasn\u0027t long before MI:KSC released an official statement that a rescue operation was underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter making sure that the fuel lines were \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E attached this time, Bill Kerman set out solo a newer, modified version of the Munar Mission Package. The experimental Mechanical Jebediah Unit (or MechJeb, as it is well known amongst the flight engineers who built it) was attached to allow for the lander to land remotely, freeing up both seats in the ascent stage for Bob and Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C8UxPFi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022C8UxPFi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the technology was still experimental, Mission Control decided it would be smart to include a live pilot who is high on courage and low on stupidity to monitor its performance and take over manual control if necessary. If MechJeb botched the landing, Bill would have to take over remotely from the CM. This required an interesting contingency: because the mission planners had decided to explore Beggar\u0027s Canyon - inconveniently placed on the far side of the Mun - the lander could not be controlled remotely from mission control in the event something went wrong. In order to make sure Bill had the most time possible to react to anything that went wrong, the lander performed some brief maneuvers to place it just on the cusp of the CM\u0027s horizon. At the next passover, MechJeb took control and landed the ship perfectly. How perfectly?

The ascent stage performed as required and Bill was once again joined happily with his two comrades, whom he had not seen in several Kerbal days. The reception on Kerbin was much warmer than the last - with orange soda and snacks a\u0027plentiful. The picketers packed up and went home - the baby that somebody had carelessly left on the runway was returned to its mother, and life back home returned to normal...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...But back on the Mun, the story was already etched into eternity.
