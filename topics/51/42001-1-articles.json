I also use the ISA mapping mod as I think it adds a great \u0027science\u0027 element of the game as you can launch genuinely exploratory missions to check out landing sites ahead of manned landings. I try to build my own rockets, and part of this logging process is to try to developing lessons from each mission.

The Alpha launch platform was created, which launches initially with two small solid boosters which are then dumped, with power then taken over by two side mounted liquid fuel boosters, which are then dropped to the final stage, a single liquid fueled engine which is used to finalise the probe\u0027s orbit and then dumped. The probe is equipped with an ion engine for subsequent small maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first mission, KSA Science 1M (M for mapping) launched faultlessly, took up a highly inclined orbit (as per the thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27999-ISA-Mapsat-Ideal-and-Non-Ideal-Altitudes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27999-ISA-Mapsat-Ideal-and-Non-Ideal-Altitudes\u003C/a\u003E) and commenced mapping operations, identifying numerous anomalies.

It was discovered two launches had taken place, designated KSA Skunkworks SSA1 and SSA2, which lead to confessions that both stations had run out of fuel (but were powered!), and the relevant staff had no idea how to get the pair of two man crews home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo Alpha 4-S platforms used for the KSA Orbital 3 and 4M missions were modified to allow docking with the stations and set upwith a single crew member, so two seats were spare for the two kerbanauts to be rescued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some trials and tribulations, KSA Rescue 1 successfully docked with SSA2 (as SSA2 had a more stable orbit), and buoyed by the success, KSA Rescue 2 was launched and successfully docked with SSA1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the SSA1 crew had been aloft for quite some time, and included hero Jebediah Kerbal, the decision was taken to bring this crew home first.

Been busy with work, uni, training etc, but the KSA program has been progressing well. Crews were successfully recovered from SSA1 and SSA2 and the stations await their next crews.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther work with the Alpha\u002B platform saw Kerbollo 1 successfully land a three man crew on the surface of the Mun, with plenty of fuel for a return home. Sadly, the lone crew member (two other crew members remained onboard the first permanent settlement subsequently delivered by a new launch platform) was killed on re-entry due to poor time management by the Space Centre (i.e. didn\u0027t come off accelerated time quickly enough). The Alpha\u002B platform has been retained for Mun shuttle missions to Mun bases, and testing will be performed to see if the Alpha\u002B can perform shuttle missions to Minmus. If so, a single Alpha\u002B platform will be used for all manned ferrying activity in near-Kerbin space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst that crew explored their surroundings, VAT Aerospace worked on a new very large launch platform, due to concerns over the Alpha platform\u0027s tendency to \u0027spin up\u0027 during launches and difficulties in carrying \u0027wider\u0027 payloads. Development began on the X-Wing series, so called due to its distinctive X shape, with engines located at the end of structural framework. Development of this platform has been very successful, with the proof of concept placing a probe in orbit around Jool, and a lander placed on Eeloo. Much to KSA\u0027s frustration, we have been unable to successfully land probes on Duna (crashed), Eve (landed in ocean) and Gilly (lack of power whilst searching for flat landing space) or Moho (current upper stage package appears to have insufficient delta V to arrive in controlled fashion) but these are doubtless due to upper stage packaging rather than the platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe X-Wing has been put into service for the manned program and this has seen permanent settlements landed at the Mun (at the Kerbollo 1 landing site, which offers excellent terrain for safe landings) and, with the excellent performance of the package during the Mun delivery, the first manned landing on Minmus was achieved with the same permanent settlement delivery package. A manned rover was developed around the Space Station cupola part, and a skycrane developed and tested for delivery. This system successfully delivered a manned rover to the Kerbollo 1 Base. Concerns about performance of the rover in low gravity missions mean further development will need to be done for adaptation to Minmus (and other lower gravity environments).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent development is focussing on whether to further develop the X Wing platform for even heavier lift missions, or to develop techniques to assemble vessels in orbit, so as to allow manned exploration of the Kerbol system. With science packages announced as part of 0.22, the probe based science part of the KSA program has been put on hold for the moment, although given the short attention span of the department it is likely further missions will be attempted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
