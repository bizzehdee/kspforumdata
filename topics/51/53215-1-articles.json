Fine, I\u0027ll aerocapture, dock with my station, and ferry the brave kerbonauts down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.sarahlizzy.org/Moho3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Moho3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where it went a bit wrong. As can be seen, the ship is coming in \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E fast and a periapsis of 38 km isn\u0027t enough to get it even close to under escape velocity, let alone into a decent orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn vain, I burned my remaining fuel trying desperately to stop, then used up all the mono prop, and was still hundreds of metres per second above escape velocity as I shot out of the atmosphere and back into an escape trajectory. Oops! Flight time to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s orbit was merely 1 hour. If I was going to mount a rescue, it had to be fast!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully I have a nuclear tug hanging around in LKO for ferrying supplies to my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn base, and even better, it was currently close to the point at which the Moho mission hit periapsis. I gave chase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the point where I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve spent some time polishing my rendezvous skills. On an escape trajectory, with a considerable head start, I managed to catch and dock with my escaping Moho ship, and refuel it sufficiently to enter Kerbin orbit, and save the tug, before either of them reached the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s orbit, and I did all that without using a single manoeuvre node!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.sarahlizzy.org/Moho4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Moho4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter docking with my space station in LKO, the 3 kerbonauts are back home and relaxing in the astronaut complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext time, I\u0027ll aerocapture lower!
