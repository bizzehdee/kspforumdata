Both of these could be made even lighter by putting a Kerbal on a seat, but that wasn\u0027t the goal here. Also these fuel margins are tight and this was a building exercise not a piloting one so MechJeb is flying these. Complain about that elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I have a Mun round trip, no jets or ion engines, with a launch-pad mass of 15.65 tons: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/SedzD#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/SedzD#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear placement is a little cheaty, and I\u0027m taking advantage of the aircraft gear being massless (so yeah, spaceplane folks, you can only trust your SPH CoM indicator before you put the wheels on!). Several aerobrake passes to land back at KSC without spending too much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext we have a mountaintop Eve ascent vehicle at 39.53 tons (flight numbers are more reliable than VAB numbers, MechJeb/Engineer don\u0027t know which components are massless until you\u0027re in flight): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/piTkF#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/piTkF#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI persistence-edited this guy to Eve orbit (lifter and transfer stage left as exercise for reader) and turned on infinite fuel for MechJeb\u0027s land-at-target deorbit burn, but as soon as I entered the atmosphere I switched it back off. Those tanks sitting on the ground that the parachutes were mounted to had plenty of fuel for landing. This design is derived off of Nao\u0027s best entry to the Smallest Eve Ascent Vehicle challenge from before the forum wipe, just minus the central aerospike stage and with a bit less liquid fuel mounted in the initial SRB stage. By the old SEAV rules I should have replaced the final decoupler (for the front-mounted drop tank that feeds the LV-909) with a small docking port, so returning to Kerbin wouldn\u0027t need an EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hope you enjoy these.
