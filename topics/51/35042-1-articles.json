The stars had been held so tantalizingly close to the Kerbal people, but they lacked the mental stamina to reach it. At least, they lacked it until the year 1954. It had been a slow year, but a race between the two largest nations on the planet, the Republic of Kerbal and the Kerbal\u0027s Socialist Union led to an accidental discovery. After a long night of gulping down hard liquor, a young Kerbal scientist decided that the KSU\u0027s plane was slower than the Republic\u0027s, and began trying to figure a way to give his nation an edge. \u0022Borrowing\u0022 some solid and liquid state fuel from a nearby gas station (why they had solid fuel is still under historical debate), the young scientist created a small rocket. After test firing the solid-state one, and narrowly avoiding the damage it caused when it smashed into a small building, and test-firing the liquid-state one, he came to a sudden revelation: the immense power of these fuels could be enough to propel something out of the atmosphere (for those wondering if the KSU won, they didn\u0027t; the thing sent on fire promptly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSU quickly began a space program, the Kerbal\u0027s Kosmonaut Space Programme, or KKSP. Suddenly realizing that they were behind the ball, the Republic began its own, the Kerbal Space Program, or KSP. The two programs began working simultaneously in the hopes of beating each other to the stars, and beyond...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Starscraper\u0022 Program\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EObjectives\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Create a delivery system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Deliver a probe to Kerbin orbit (low-mid)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Deliver a probe that is capable of transmitting data to Kerbin orbit (L-M)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4a) Deliver a probe capable of transmitting data and infinite lifespan to Kerbin orbit (L-M)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4b) Create \u0022Data-net\u0022 by delivering three (3) probes to Kerbin orbit (L-M)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EGoal\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary goal of the Starscraper program was to create a delivery system that could take objects from Kerbin to low to mid atmosphere, which would become the basis of future missions into deeper space. After that, the KSP\u0027s directors hoped to create what would be called the \u0022Data-net\u0022. This data-net intended to provide the KSP with valuable information, such as weather conditions, radiation in space, and the like. With this data-net, the KSP would be able to accurately predict future situations and send up more and more advanced craft into space with less pre-mission effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDelivery System\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe delivery system designed for the Starscraper Program was created in a top-secret simulations cycle code-named \u0022Project Trashbin\u0022. It took four major designs and several revisions of the designs before an effective delivery vehicle was created: the \u0022Trashbin Delivery System\u0022, or TDS (see picture below). The TDS was broken into four stages (picture shows five; clerical error on behalf of staging team). Stage One was the solid-state boosters and the support stands that would keep the ship from falling over pre-launch. The booster would help get the TDS into sub-orbit, but the main amount of work was done by Stage Two. This stage composed of the main liquid-state engine which would push the ship to actual orbit. After that, Stage Three, by use of a lower power liquid-state engine, would push the system into orbit. At the start of the stage, four solar panels would deploy to provide charge for the probe\u0027s body until it reached a stable orbit. At this point, the probe itself would be released and be on its own. Unfortunately, this meant that both probe and delivery system would be stranded in space until disposed of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EImage(s)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921266761961438206/ACD687E77F200092A44892FB1611551DD808982C/\u0022 alt=\u0022ACD687E77F200092A44892FB1611551DD808982C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA picture of the TDS.

In many ways, both programs were running on the same program plans. However, the execution of these were to be far different. Another thing of note is that the KKSP was mainly directed towards propaganda victories, hoping to create something that would prove the scientific domination of the Kerbal\u0027s Soviet Union over the Republic of Kerbal. Not only did the program hope to prove that the KSU could put something in space, but it also hoped to prove to the Republic that the KSU had the capability of creating ballistic missiles more advanced than what the Republic could make. Later in the program, however, science was meant to take over in order to further the idea of scientific domination. It can be noted that the KSP\u0027s \u0022Data-net\u0022 and the KKSP\u0027s idea of a space/atmospheric tracking system were extremely similar. The idea would not be lost on the KSP once the Zvezda program was completed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDelivery System\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the KSP began work in \u0022Project Trashbin\u0022, the KKSP began work on a delivery system of their own. It was known as \u0022Project Kerbal\u0027s Ball\u0022, and it hoped to do the exact same thing that the future Trashbin Delivery System was to do: Create a delivery system that is capable of taking satellites to low-mid Kerbin orbit. Initial designs, however, were known for instability and unusual design flaws (see image 1 below). However, it was later in the first day of the program, roughly the same time the KSP figured out their own delivery system, that the KKSP managed to figure out their design. The \u0022Zvezda Delivery System\u0022, or ZDS, appears similar to the TDS, except that the ZDS is taller, has two more solid-state boosters, and is one stage larger (see image 2). Otherwise, it functions identically to the KSP\u0027s TDS. The First Stage is made up by six solid-state boosters, capable of counterbalancing the enhanced weight on the delivery system. The next stage is a liquid stage booster of immense power meant to push the ship further up. After that, the next stage has a less powerful but more fuel-economic engine meant to push the ship towards a stable orbit. At this stage, four solar panels are deployed. The next stage is a small engine with little power but immense fuel efficiency that is meant to adjust the ship into that stable orbit. After that, the probe is released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EStarscraper One\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovember 5th, 1955\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same day as the creation of both the Zvezda delivery system and the Trashbin delivery system, the KSP managed to launch their first probe first. It was afternoon, the sun beginning to draw down and darkness approaching. The KSP knew their deadline, and they knew that they couldn\u0027t wait any longer. It was a race with no prize for second place. The platform was cleared, and with a roar the four solid-state engines took to life as \u0022Starscraper One\u0022 rushed to the skies. The first stage put the ship in low orbit, but it was the second that pulled it into the realm of space. KSP was flying relatively blind; they had no picture, no data transmission-they had to hope that the remote control unit they had put in the delivery system\u0027s design would receive their commands accurately enough. Not long after the ship reached roughly seventy thousand meters above sea level, the final stage took control and pushed at a painstakingly slow pace towards a solid low orbit. Finally, at seven minutes and twenty six seconds into the mission, the probe was released (see image 3). Starscraper One was the first Kerbal \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E into space, and it was thanks to the KSP and the Republic of Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EZvezda One\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovember 5th, 1955\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiterally half an hour after launch for the KSP, the KKSP readied their first probe onto the launch position as well. Zvezda One was launched as the sun began to set, and streaked towards the stars. The enhanced weight of the delivery system meant that the boosters did not push the ship as far into the atmosphere as Starscraper One. However, by the time the ship had reached the next stage, it was far enough to where that next stage pushed it into space. The stage afterwards began to push it towards a stable, low orbit, but there wasn\u0027t enough fuel. It fell to the final engine, almost a design afterthought, to push the ship into low orbit. Because of the enhanced stress on the ship, there was no time for the orbit to be perfect, just enough for any probe launched not to fall back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. At fifty-six minutes into the mission, Zvezda One was launched (see image 4). For want of half an hour (though, in order for it to have won hands-down, it should have launched an hour earlier), it was the first launched probe for the KKSP, but the second launched probe for the Kerbal people. It was an embarrassing failure, but enough to serve as a minor propaganda victory. For those who saw it as it was, they immediately went back to work planning the next probe launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EImages\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/921266941041081828/F55BC5692B77F1673482504B7490FCA668E435A2/\u0022 alt=\u0022F55BC5692B77F1673482504B7490FCA668E435A2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENeedless to say, the KKSP had some early design flaws.
