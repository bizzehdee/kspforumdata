Little bit heavier than the radial 24-77, but significantly better specific impulse more than makes up for it.

So other than the FL-T100 tank having a different texture in stock 0.21 than it did in KSPX, everything looks the same so this should work nicely as a stock design now. The aircraft landing gear are still massless, and ladder forces are still reactionless.

I see no reason to do so until the aircraft gear actually have mass. Other people have built small (around 20ish tons IIRC) Eve ascent vehicles using ladders pre-0.20, but I believe all of those had the ladders mounted parallel to the thrust axis instead of perpendicular. When the Kerbals are standing on part of the craft, the collision does actually exert a reaction force so the Kerbal\u0027s mass counts as payload and takes more fuel. The perpendicular mounting ends up using less fuel, but only by exploiting buggy physics. So if I\u0027m exploiting one glitch, no reason not to exploit massless parts too while I\u0027m at it. It\u0027s nowhere near as bad as infiniglide or the FTL egg though, which can get off Eve without any fuel at all...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T22:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks interesting.

It\u0027s pretty steep right at the peak, but with either MechJeb targeting precision or luck/practice getting you pretty close, you can land above 7000 meters without too much trouble. That additional altitude allowed me to get rid of the extra set of FL-T100 tanks on my first stage and get to within 40 m/s of orbit with a 4.9-ton ascent vehicle, well within jetpack range or maybe even just by fine-tuning the ascent parameters.
