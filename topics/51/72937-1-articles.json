This is an amazing project that allows you to build (eventually, after a lot of work) self-sufficient colonies. It uses the mechanics from TAC Life Support and Kethane for resource consumption and exploitation and works with things like Extraplanetary Launchpads as well.

These things are also quite amazing and worth at least looking at. Most of LLL concerns rockets with rectangular cross-sections instead of round, so you can totally change the appearance of your space program. But it\u0027s a huge pack with tons of other very useful parts you never knew you were missing, but will find indispensable. SXT is much smaller at present, and its main thing is it uses stock textures for its parts so as to minimize memory footprint. It\u0027s got 5m rockets in it, though, and also a lot of useful miscellaneous stuff.

You definitely want it in a spot with Ore and Minerals in the ground, Substrate too if possible, and as a bonus either Water or Kethane. MKS modifies the Kethane scanners to find all these other things as well, on different layers of the hex map. So, you have to scan the target planet as you would for Kethane. I decided to build my test colony on Mun and found a spot with Ore, Minerals, Substrate all in 1 hex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving picked the hex, next I sent a probe rover there to look for the most level ground in the hex, and to serve as a landing target for the colony modules coming in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nHCkvk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5038/14254558113_4b8c242b3b_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214254558113_4b8c242b3b_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cool thing about this rover is that it\u0027s got an LLL \u0022Microchip\u0022 radially attached probe core on it. That\u0027s the small white spot near the center. This is a great part. It lacks torque and has no built-in electricity, but it very neatly solves the \u0022vertical to horiztonal problem\u0022 with rovers (necessary for me because I\u0027m using FAR in this game). I built this rover in the SPH starting with a regular probe core which would work for it once on the ground. Then I saved the body as a subassembly, went to the VAB, got out the same probe core, and stuck the body on it vertically. Then attached the Microchip in a convenient place and presto, I had a probe core to handle the landing, too. Then I could wrap the whole thing up in a fairing to satisfy the FAR Demons and send it off to Mun no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funny box on the side amidships is an MKS rover Science! part. It does some sort of ground sampling but because this is a sandbox game, it did nothing for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, having selected the exact site, I then sent the 1st module of the actual colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nFDda7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5078/14232095512_18a2483dd8_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214232095512_18a2483dd8_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s red capsule-looking thing on top, the ColonyHub. It\u0027s like the central control point for the whole show. It converts ElectricCharge into PunchCards, which are consumed by all other MKS modules during operation. 1 ColonyHub makes enough PunchCards to supply about 25 other modules. It\u0027s also a 3.75m capsule with 6 seats. The tutorial said to only send 2 Kerbals to start with but I filled it up and gave them all 670 days of supplies (tutorial says 500 days for 2). Anyway, this thing was sleek enough to get by the FAR Demons with no problems, and landed uneventfully\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nHCko6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5474/14254557693_f352c0410c_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214254557693_f352c0410c_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gray thing at the bottom is a cluster engine from either LLL or SXT. Seems to be order-made for 3.75m landers. The boxes around the bottom are filled with KAS pipe parts and ground pylons to hook the base modules together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that done, next was to send over a ConstructionHub and a PowerDistributionUnit (PDU), which I combined into a single payload. The MKS modules are interesting in that you can (if desired) send them out as just non-functional but very light-weight shells, then finish building them in-situ with ConstructionParts, which are made by the ConstructionHub from Ore and Minerals. Optionally, you can tweak the MKS modules to be fully built on launch but they weigh a LOT. And besides, this is a test of the system so I wanted to use the ConstructionHub for that. The PDU makes enough electricity to run a bunch of modules and also is relatively light when operational, so I sent it up ready to go. The combined weight wasn\u0027t that big so didn\u0027t need THAT big a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/npmAEH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14047790397_fc669b9c50_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214047790397_fc669b9c50_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ brought the Construction-PDU module down right beside the ColonyHub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nDNinE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5487/14211236076_fd799e9d8c_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214211236076_fd799e9d8c_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the 1st time in a LLLOOOOONNNGGGGG time I\u0027ve used those stock radial engines, which are so inefficient on small landers. But they\u0027re tolerable on things of this size. LLL also has some very interesting radial engines but none were quite right for this particular job. The ConstructionHub is on top and the PDU is on the bottom here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce down, a Kerbal connected the 2 units with a KAS pipe and then climbed into the ConstructionHub to supervise its operations, even though it couldn\u0027t do anything yet because it had no raw materials to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nDNinj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2918/14211236056_dc97093954_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214211236056_dc97093954_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS modules run at a variable efficiency. This can be improved by having a Kerbal actually in the module, and the less stupid the Kerbal, the more good he does. It\u0027s thus apparent that creating a large colony will cause serious \u0022brain drain\u0022 back on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, eventually each Kerbal in the colony will need his own pair of Kerbitat and Greenhouse modules, which are the same size as those shown here (most MKS modules are the same size). IOW, each Kerbal will have his own tower like this. So this gives you an impression of how huge this colony is going to become someday. Kerbals are an integral part of the self-sufficiency as their waste products are fuel for the things that make their supplies, eventually. With everything connected, all the resources flow around where needed so the Kerbal doesn\u0027t have to sit on the toilet all day to keep himself alive. But it does bring up the question of whether any of the crew will be able to do anything other than keep the system running in some way (as in crewing a module). We\u0027ll have to see as we go along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the final step of this \u0022Pioneer Phase\u0022 of the colony was to send up the drills to get the Minerals and the Ore, and some storage space, so that\u0027s this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iK6OYNN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iK6OYNN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis payload was heavy so needed a bigger rocket. The payload was 2 storage units, 1 for raw materials and 1 for colony consumables. The main one of these was ColonySupplies, which are spare parts and such consumed by all MKS modules over time. Ultimately, you can make your own in-situ but that\u0027s way down the road so for now, as with life support supplies, this has to be brought in. So I gave the colony a good supply to start with so as not to have to worry about that for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once again MJ brought the new unit down right next to the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vc0j6vF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vc0j6vF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another KAS pipe connection:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Jnh0Cn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229Jnh0Cn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I fired up the Kethane drills, which with MKS can also get any of the other resources in the ground at that spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dVtivKq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dVtivKq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Ore and Minerals started coming in, which the ConstructionHub began turning into ConstructionParts. This is a painfully slow process, requiring beaucoup raw materials per ConstructionPart, so it will be months before I have enough to build out the next module. Which is why this \u0022starter pack\u0022 colony has a couple years\u0027 worth of life support and ColonySupplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso coming in on the drills is Substrate. This is just being stored right now. Eventually, it will go towards making EnrichedSoil, which is necessary for the Greenhouses, 1 of which is necessary for each Kerbal to make a closed, self-sufficient system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this was a good place to stop for the evening so I took a moment to enjoy my creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rTrQXTO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rTrQXTO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drill unit has all the Gigantors on it just in case. MOAR power is better than not having enough and I wasn\u0027t sure at this point if the PDU was up to the job. And all this vast collection of parts does is turn dirt into parts to build more modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is to start using some of that substrate to make EnrichedSoil. This involves another module called a Terraformer. Once that\u0027s all done (and more ConstructionParts made), I can start bringing in Kerbitats and Greenhouses so the crew can move out of the ColonyHub. That will make the colony self-sufficient for life support, but it will still need to import ColonySupplies. The last phase will be to make it self-sufficient that way, too, which will require a vast manufacturing complex. Making ColonySupplies takes about 5 or 6 steps, each of which requires its own module(s). And then at the end you need a recycler module to convert the used-up ColonySupplies back into raw materials to feed into the factory again.

First, it added integral external lights to the modules (to save parts) and gave each type its own identifying decal on top (many modules use the same models). Second, it added 2 more lengths for the Expand-O-Tubes, so now we have 2m (new), 4m (old), and 8m (new). And third, it added Flex-O-Tubes, which are just MKS-styled KAS pipe ends. These let you connect modules using KAS mechanics but have it look like the other MKS tubes for aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I updated the mod and had no problems with the save that I could blame on that. However, I did run into quite a few problems, some with my learning curve, some with MKS, and others of unknown cause. These ultimately led me to abandon this test colony and start over again. Here\u0027s what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, the colony just started vanishing into thin air when I left it to go do something else. I have no idea what was causing this, but I discovered that I could prevent this from happening if I connected the colony assembly to something else via KAS piping. At first I used the Bomb Cart for this and, having proven the concept, then used a KAS ground pylon instead. KAS struts can only connect parts of the same \u0022ship\u0022 while KAS pipes can connect separate ships. Ground pylons attached to the ground are considered separate ships so that\u0027s why I had to use pipes to connect to them. But once I had the pipe in place, I could then also attach a strut. So I did this, too. This gave the colony an anchor to reality and it stopped disappearing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nxMrTj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2919/14143170620_1d705e7e09_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214143170620_1d705e7e09_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pic above also shows part of my learning curve--the \u0022MOAR POWER\u0022 unit being maneuvered into position. This is a stack of batteries and 4x Gigantor solar panels atop some more life support supplies. MKS has a unit called a PDU (Power Distribution Unit) that creates ElectricCharge from nothing (I assume it\u0027s a nuclear plant of some type). This is supposed to be able to power the normal operation of a number of other MKS modules as they consume and convert whatever resources they deal with. I really don\u0027t know how many MKS modules a single PDU can support, but what is clear is that it doesn\u0027t make enough juice to run 2 small Kethane drills and 2 MKS modules at the same time (apparently MKS modules don\u0027t need much juice). So to keep the drills running, I had to add the solar panels and enough batteries to last them through the Munar night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gave me an excuse to try out the new, 8m Expand-O-Tube, so the Gigantors wouldn\u0027t hit the adjacent Construction Hub module. I docked the MOAR POWER unit at a 45^ angle to the Construction Hub due to the Kethane drill\u0027s position. (NOTE: just to be clear, the Kethane drill isn\u0027t getting Kethane, it\u0027s getting Ore, Minerals, and Substrate in this location).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I started running into a problem with the Expand-O-Tubes. As mentioned before, under the hood they are essentially just the ARM \u0022Klaw\u0022 that can be extended forward. As such, they have the Klaw\u0027s lockable/free-able pivot, but this is only at the front end, not at the end attached to the parent module. This leads to some difficulties, at least in how I was building this colony. It goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule A is whatever amount of the colony is already in position and Module B is the new module with the Expand-O-Tube on it. Module A, without wheels, is on the ground, Module B is very slightly above the ground due to still being on its wheels. Thus, once Module B docks with Module A and Module B\u0027s wheels are removed, you have a seesaw. If Module A is heavier than Module B (which will usually be the case after you\u0027ve got 2 or 3 modules in place already), then Module B will remain up in the air cantilevered on the end of the Expand-O-Tube. If Module B is heavier, then it will fall to the ground and pry Module A up somewhat. Either way, if you leave things like this, then the whole colony, or at least certain modules, will jump violently into the air and slam back down again each time you come back to the colony from having been elsewhere. While so far nothing\u0027s broken on me from this, I figure that\u0027s only a matter of time so want to prevent it. So what to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have a choice. You can minimize this jumping and slamming by tying everything down to KAS ground pylons, but this appears to keep the forces bottled under pressure, resulting in varying degrees of Wobble Horse Syndrome (WHS), plus increases part count. Or you can free the pivot on the Expand-O-Tube, which does solve the immediate jumping/slamming problem. HOWEVER, it also causes new problems. First off, because the pivot only happens where the tube joins Module A, the tube remains perpendicular to the surface of Module B. This means that Module B will sit at an angle with its outboard 1/2 sunk slightly into the ground a varying amount seemingly dependent not only on local ground slope and tube length, but also on the relative masses of Modules A and B. This creates a bit of a phantom force. While nothing jumps and slams when you go back to the colony, instead you get sideways sliding. This is a function of the pivot being free both in pitch and yaw. The end result is that over time, with repeated returns to the colony, what were once neatly arranged modules get out of position, as shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nxMrN9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14143170320_211be8ffe8_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214143170320_211be8ffe8_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocking the pivot again will stop the sliding but re-introduces the jump/slam behavior. So what I had to do was apply KAS to the various modules. You can either run struts between modules (they\u0027re all part of the same ship once docked with Expand-O-Tubes) or anchor individual modules to ground pylons. Both hold things in place and neither seems to cause WHS. However, both add to part count and the struts especially make your colony look like a shanty town instead of the crown jewel of your space program. But you have to do something or your colony will become a messy tangle of modules pointing every which way, as mine did above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, obviously the whole concept I was using to build this colony has a fundamental flaw--it doesn\u0027t work well. This means back to the drawing board yet again to use a different method of connecting modules. There are a couple of options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Keep all modules on their wheels or legs for the duration, so they\u0027re always all at the same level (apart from ground slope and suspension flexing due to different weights). But this means part count, which I\u0027m trying to discover a means of avoiding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use the new Flex-O-Tubes instead of Expand-O-Tubes, so each module can have its wheels removed and be sitting flat on the local ground surface prior to being connected. This should prevent all the misalignments and phantom forces--KAS has gotten very good lately about dealing with such things. This means 2 parts per joint (you need a Flex-O-Tube on each end, same as with KAS pipes) and requires EVAs for assembly, but I think in the long run it will probably work the best of all the options I\u0027ve thought of so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also encountered another vexing problem and I\u0027m unsure of the cause. Could be MKS, could be MJ, could be a combination of both. It goes like this: I leave the colony and go back to KSC to launch the next module. This rocket works fine until it leaves the atmosphere, at which point the payload (MKS module with MJ on it) becomes absolutely locked in orientation, incapable of rotating around any axis. The rest of the rocket, however, still functions as normal (and I otherwise have full control over it all, plenty of electricity, etc.). So when I try to rotate the rocket for the next burn, the payload remains fixed at the angle it left the atmosphere while the rest of the rocket tries to rotate, making it bend at the joint between the payload and the engines until the joint fails. If I totally quit KSP and restart the game, this problem goes away, but it\u0027s tedious to have to restart the game after every launch. I\u0027m using MJ dev build 655 if that makes a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
