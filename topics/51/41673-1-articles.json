So far there is only one module, something like a self-sustaining outpost. It consists of an observation terrace, small solar panels array(despite being located quite deep into the crater, they get quite a lot of light), a crane for lifting/lowering my brave, lonely kerbal hermits(kermits?), a battery bank, fuel mining/processing equipment with a fuel hose included, and a lander can for the little guys to rest in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gf2bZCI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gf2bZCI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bh51XhL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bh51XhL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YFr5idz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YFr5idz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/shVakye.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shVakye.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p6QRfes.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p6QRfes.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see there is a lander can, some structural elements, a large battery bank, two small kethane tanks, two drills and a converter, as it will be probably used to provide fuel for vessels launched from a launch pad on the bottom of the crater(still to-be-landed there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E ), or to some little ships visiting a landing pad anchored to the wall nearby, via the bottom connector cable. The other not yet used connector will probably be used to lower/lift kerbals between the base and the bottom by means of plugging an unfortunate kerbal instead of a claw/connector, bungee jumping and lowering them slowly when they reach current rope length. I have edited the KAS files to make the cables about 1,5km long, which is about enough to reach the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe battery bank is used mostly when kethane is processed and mined simultaneously, especially if the solar panels are in shadow(since they are at about 80* angle they provide great amount of electricity for their size, usually between 0,8 and 0,95 efficiency when in sunlight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently planning to create a whole colony down(up?) there.

Just after installing it in place I\u0027ve realized it will be a bit wobbly(but not too much) and impossible to angle it away from the wall without some claws along the lower edge, but I didn\u0027t have enough patience to redo this whole flight...

Only LFO tanks were not stock, so engines were stock nuke ones - I really had no idea they were THAT efficient(see end of next paragraph) in space. (one of the probe cores was the core part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, after going into high Mun polar orbit, this stage was landed on the bottom of the crater and slowly lifted with ASAS on, then moved towards the wall with RCS. This time my technique was a bit better than on the first module, as I have found some useful things to help this whole process. Kerbin TWR of 0,33 was a bit too much to precisely control hovering. TWR of about 0,2 would probably be better. The best acceleration(showed by MechJeb vessel info window) at which I hovered after reaching desired altitude for a long while was something between \u003Cstrong\u003E1,55 and 1,6m/s\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Csup\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E, which changed a bit due to fuel consumption. RCS translation up/down was strong enough to control altitude without the need to touch throttle. Top down view helps a lot in the last few moments before firing claws, you know exactly where you are positioned and where you are going in relation to other modules. The fuel and RCS depleted really slowly, the ascent from the bottom of the crater to the moment of cutting the throttle off completely took me about 5 to 10 minutes, and the fuel reserves were barely touched(compared to what I expected), so there was a huge safety margin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here are the final moments of installing it on the wall:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproaching the colony(after its relocation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1rcWBO6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221rcWBO6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiring cables and lowering thrust to 1,4m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E to slowly swing towards the wall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MR0pmK0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MR0pmK0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U8URYTy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U8URYTy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose-up of the underside\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3YHzH11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223YHzH11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetached parts falling to (as it soon turned out, not only)theirs doom\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PQDKa5C.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PQDKa5C.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn their way down they accelerated to about 40m/s, crashed into previous lifters and obliterated each other(a bit).

It will require rescaling the domes and the \u0022windows\u0022, but that shouldn\u0027t be very problematic(of course this will also have to be another launch...).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T21:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by M4ck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"19spacepug","CreatedById":75611,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T00:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood update I bet the walkways will be hard can,t wait for the next update and on the landing pad I would just delete it and make a new one it may take longer but it will be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T00:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got to do this where is the hole located?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-14T17:52:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2013 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spartwo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T12:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve written somewhere on the first page, the location of the crater center is about 57*40\u002700\u0022 N / 9*05\u002700\u0022 E , it really has to be an almost vertical drop from about 4km altitude down, as the whole area gets rendered in a strange way and you might easily smack into the ground around the crater(it appears rather flat when you are a few km above the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, my laptop somehow manages to run KSP.

This time Bobman spent a lot of time connecting the walkway to the wall, watching it swing like a wrecking ball, pushing it where it was supposed to be, and sitting comfortably in his landing can house while ladders slammed into the wall right outside. Afterwards, he took a walk outside to show us what the base looks like from his view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the delay, but maneuvering crafts was so slow on my laptop I had to wait till I got home to complete this and to be able to post here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the walkway lander was sent to the colony landing pad, along with about six mobile KAS ports. The big ball was there to balance the craft(I-beams and KAS tipped it to the side), it was an empty fuel tank with a power bank.

KSP simply died, so I had to restart it, only to discover the three placed but not yet connected ports missing. I have no idea why, as the max debris count was set rather high, and all the other debris, like on the crater bottom, was present. Anyways, a little port-carrying probe was sent to the main module(it was quite tricky to land there, but RCS made it a lot easier during the last several meters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Jzlrg7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221Jzlrg7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll four cables connected(only the two closer to the wall in the finished walkway were actually needed, another note for Hanging Gardens 2).

After placing it somewhere near the desired point, it was \u0022wiggled\u0022 into its current position by detaching one claw, stretching everything to the side with RCS and slamming it into the wall again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Bobman goes outside to take a look at his pretty base he himself assembled\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside the hut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zxCt57r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zxCt57r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStanding next to the carrier probe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7edKA7n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227edKA7n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing up, climbing towards the stars\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EhPptiK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EhPptiK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DRzmpbI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DRzmpbI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtop the habitat(the jump had to be jetpack assisted, the future Hanging garden will have a tree-like structure of ladders connecting various modules, so each branch will end right on a platform)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KjuXRBL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KjuXRBL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the walkway(this time a regular jump was enough, the central module railing makes it impossible to simply walk onto it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B2f60bU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022B2f60bU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pad(high-res texture on it looks a LOT better than the ones in previous posts, IMO \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cqAVrM0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cqAVrM0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, a colony overview at night\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HVv5aIu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HVv5aIu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZkqvyJl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZkqvyJl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HNTPE1x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HNTPE1x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the last module, to be placed at the top of the ladder, I know HOW it will be attached so everything will work nicely with walking up/down the ladder and getting off, but I don\u0027t know WHAT exactly to put there...
