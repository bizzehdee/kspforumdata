You need extraplanetary launchpads, the K\u0026amp;K base\u2019s mod, kspi and some config tweaks to pull this off. That being said this mission was too awesome to not share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn my current career save I\u2019m not very efficient with my funds. All of my spacecraft are large, expensive, and offer powered by unreasonable amounts of xenon. And I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. However playing like this gets very expensive, and the contracts system couldn\u2019t compensate for my xenon habit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis lead me to investigate setting up xenon \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EIsru\u003C/abbr\u003E support. While my original purpose for mining xenon out of magic moon ore was initially to reduce the cost of ion probes, it soon turned into something much more sinister and ludicrous. I remembered that the game pays you for all the fuel you recover on kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext thing I knew I was flying an abomination of a rocket to Minmus.\u00A05m core with 4x3.75m strap ons,\u00A0Carrying a literal stack of outpost prefabs all piled onto a nerv powered lander. Still not sure how I managed to get it into orbit, much less land the stack on minmus, maybe Jeb was piloting the drone from the Space center.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe base setup consisted of 3 main parts, although I\u2019ve since expanded. It has a mining core with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E, a workshop with engineers and enough snacks to keep them working for years to come, and a launchpad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDubbed Xenon CO, this base works by mining xenon out of minmus\u2019s lake, pumping it into a drone rocket containing an IFS\u00A0pressurized gas\u00A0tank. This drone, when full and fueled with Liquid fuel blasts off from Xenon CO, sets up a re entry trajectory with kerbin, and lands a tank of xenon back on the surface. Pilots get a bonus check based on how close they land the tank to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Pilots that bullseye the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E get a rocket ride with Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently I\u2019ve already payed\u00A0for the base with the xenon shipments, my model one tanker can net me anywhere from 200k funds to a whopping 500k if I land it near the SC.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moral of this story, capitalism of minmus = profit. Profit = bigger rockets. Bigger rockets = more science. Capitalism = science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-04T17:32:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2018 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairPhysicist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DatBoi","CreatedById":185841,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-06T15:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting...
