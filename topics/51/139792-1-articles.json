The challenge, for those unfamiliar with it, is to send one spacecraft to the Jool system, land on each moon with varying numbers of kerbals depending on the difficulty level you\u0027re attempting, and then return to Kerbin. What makes my entry different from many is that I am sending 24 kerbals to the Jool system and land 3 on each moon. I\u0027m sending 3 multi-moon landers for one kerbal each, and will be attempting to land in different biomes where possible (Laythe will be a challenge in that regard). The other kerbals are a flight crew for the interplanetary transport (two pilots and two engineers), two mission scientists, and three kerbals for something special I have planned.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe mothership I\u0027m sending, the IPT Hera (IPT stands for Inter-Planetary Transport) is a highly modular spacecraft assembled in orbit via only four launches (not counting landers, lander fuel, crew, or\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;line-height:25.6px;\u0022\u003Emaintenance\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E). The landers, Juno A, B, and C, are identical spacecraft capable of landing on and ascending from each Joolian moon in a single stage, with the exception of\u00A0Tylo, for which the landers are equipped with a disposable de-orbit stage. And the Hyperion Crew Transport, which will take the crew up to the IPT Hera and then return them to Kerbin after the mission is complete, is a heavy transport designed as a highly efficient method of transporting kerbals to/from Kerbin orbit. All of this technology here is experimental, and this mission is the testing phase.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe first four albums at the bottom\u00A0of this post show the assembly of the IPT Hera in orbit of Kerbin. The next step will be to send the landers and the lander refuel tanks. Then I\u0027ll wait until the Jool transfer window approaches, and send the crew up, before transferring to the Jool system. Once there, the IPT Hera will make orbit around Tylo, and three kerbals will land on its surface in different locations. The next stop after that is Laythe, which the IPT Hera will transfer to from Tylo orbit. After three kerbals have landed on Laythe and returned, the IPT Hera will transfer to Vall to allow the crew to land there. Then it will move to a Joolian orbit between the orbits of Bop and Pol, where it will stay until the mission is complete. Three kerbals will depart to land on Bop and then return, followed by three more landing on Pol. Once they are all back at the IPT Hera and there are 15 flags dotted around the Jool system, the IPT Hera will leave the Jool system. What the special mission is and when it will be encountered remains to be seen.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/j6y3u/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Muodd/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Jd8x1/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/8XXmr/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-15T15:17:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2016 03:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded remaining imgur albums.

Honestly it\u0027s not super ambitious for a mothership the size of the IPT Hera. It\u0027s actually grand tour infrastructure; if I replaced two of the Juno landers with more fuel, added an extra liquid fuel tank for the NPM, and brought\u00A0a custom Eve ascent vehicle, I\u0027d be able to do a grand tour.
