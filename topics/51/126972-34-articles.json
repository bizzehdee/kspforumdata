Brilliant reds and yellows trailed in its wake, and occasionally a larger explosion would send pieces tumbling into the atmosphere to burn up on their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0481-harness.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022526\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0481-harness.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0482-harness.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0482-harness.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0487-harness.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0487-harness.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0493-harness.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0493-harness.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne final flash, and that was that.

Its burn to decrease its apoapsis sent another bright red cloud streaking across the sky, yet it was the one bit of fireworks they had to try not to look at as it came with an unhealthy dose of radiation.

Literally. In the dark. No phone, no lights, no motorcar. Not a single necessity. Primitive as can be.\u0022 He pointed at the map. \u0022See. Here in an hour or so the K-2 will blast a bit of luminous red plasma out of its backside, and after that we\u0027ll be completely in the dark until well after the year ball has risen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat garnered a quizzical look from everyone. \u0022The what?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll he could do was shake his head. \u0022Kids.

And it wasn\u0027t like they were in complete and total darkness. Not only did the stars cast a bit of (very dim and oft creepy) light, but the outer atmosphere of Jool was still scattering a good bit of the scant sunlight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo occasionally, one of the crew would glance out of their window and see a giant spacecraft floating past in the frighteningly dim green light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0520-jumble.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0520-jumble.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood way to scare yourself, even if you expect it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred set to work moving the Parts around the Jumble while the others watched. Gletrix was on deck and suited up in case an emergency EVA was needed during the task. Thomlock was in the shuttle cockpit in case they needed more power to wrangle the beasties into place. Agake was watching her science experiments cook and bubble, as always.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst Macfred undocked the Aluminium X-4B aircraft and its small tug from the K-2, moving them to the docking port at the other end of the Sulphur Shuttle. It wasn\u0027t the smoothest of operations... conducted by himself, in the dark, using the remote docking cameras... but it was far from the most dangerous thing he\u0027d attempted in his career. Still, had it not been for the docking tools, this was a task that would\u0027ve waited for the Sun to rise again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0523-jumble.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0523-jumble.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext he undocked the K-1 tug from the Jumble of Parts and moved to dock it with the K-2. From there both would consolidate their resources (moving as much fuel as possible into the K-1). Afterwards they would descend into a slightly lower orbit from that of the Jumble of Parts. The K-1 was to be their ride back to Kerbin, baring the arrival of an as-of-yet unplanned return craft, so best to have it fueled and ready should they need to make a hasty departure... in several hundred days time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis docking maneuver was a bit less challenging and yet a bit more unnerving, on account of the eight NERVAs the forward docking adapter of the K-1 had to miss. One misstep and who knows how many tons of radioactive fuel might be spread across Laythe orbit. Thankfully Macfred was able to thread the needle, and the two tugs were quickly made one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now they were well inside Jool\u0027s shadow, and Laythe was in seemingly permanent darkness below. The fuel transfer between the K-2 and the K-1 was completed without issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160709-ksp0537-k2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022541\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160709-ksp0537-k2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then Jool moved aside and let the Sun shine through once more.

No literal show, of course, though Macfred did try to raise Kerbin one last time. As they were still operating in the blind and unable to hear anything from Kerbin,\u00A0Thomlock decided to host his own show. \u0022Thomlock\u0027s New Year\u0027s Eve. Live, from Low Laythe Orbit.\u0022 Or something along those lines. He pulled the snacks and the drinks out of the overhead bins and passed them around, calling every kerbal within earshot to join them in the main cabin. Meaning Agake, of course, as the other three were already on hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred continued fidgeting with the radio, trying to coax it into recording the party and broadcasting it to an unawares audience. Or an uncaring audience. Or to mysterious aliens that were waiting to eat their ship in one bite. Who knows. Thomlock pulled him away from the obstinate beast and started into a strange ritual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This, kids, is this year\u0027s year ball.\u0022 He raised his hand to the middle of the cabin and released a small red rubber ball. Someone had written \u002799\u0027 on the side with a black marker. \u0022Now, back when I was a kid, back when New Year\u0027s was when it was supposed to be, some enterprising young kerbal decided to set up a big shiny ball atop the tallest building in Kerbin City.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix looked up from her bag of corn chips. \u0022M\u00FCn Tower?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022M\u00FCn what? Tower? Not on your life. That monstrosity is something your parents built, not mine. Anyway, about an hour before the zero second this other whackjob, this kerbal who might\u0027ve had a bit too much to drink that night, went to the roof of that same building and started counting down. Had a megaphone and everything. As it went on the revelers in the streets gathered around the building and joined the chant. Age old tradition, really, just this time there was a big shiny ball dangling over everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s this now? Start into a story without me?\u0022 Agake drifted into the cabin from the lower lab, several zip-bags filled with a mostly clear liquid in her hands. She tossed them at the other three and then passed out straws. \u0022Here, try this out. A little something I\u0027ve been cooking up over the last two years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And here we thought you were doing science.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That \u003Cem\u003E_is_\u003C/em\u003E science. And art. Tell me it isn\u0027t and you\u0027ll become a vacuum exposure test subject. Anyway, what\u0027s this about a big shiny ball?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock took a sip from the spacer equivalent of a mason jar and made a face that most would consider impossible for a kerbal. \u0022Sharp stuff, that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake shrugged. \u0022Didn\u0027t have much to work with. Enjoy it while it lasts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right.\u0022 Another sip, not so bad a face. \u0022So this loon is standing on the edge of the building next to this big disco ball, chanting to the crowd. Ten. With the crowd. Nine. He climbs out on top of the big shiny thing just as the moment nears. Eight. The M\u00FCn rises over the horizon. Seven. And he gets this idea. Six. That maybe he should go there. Five. To the M\u00FCn. Four. It wouldn\u0027t be hard, he thought. Three. If he dropped a giant rubber ball from the top of the tallest building.... Two. Surely the rebound would take him clear to the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One.\u0022 He gave the ball a push towards the top of the cabin, watching as it spun away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To this day I\u0027m still not sure if the ball was supposed to drop, or if that idiot with the megaphone somehow broke the cable holding it up. But the fall was something else. Really, like something out of a dream. One of those crazy dreams. The city lights reflecting off of it as it fell. A kaleidoscope of colors. The crowd below moving in rapid slow-motion, running for their lives as quickly as they could. The spray of glass as the ball finally hit the ground. Colors, lights, everywhere. Amazing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe red ball bounced off of the upper hatch and rebounded towards him. He had to blink a couple times. For a moment it looked like more than one ball, but, no, just the one. That concoction of Agake\u0027s was strong stuff if his vision was already going double.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A couple days later when I woke up in the hospital they said I was lucky to be alive. Spent hours pulling glass shards out of places no glass shards have any business being. And they suggested I was perhaps crazy. Yes, crazy. And crazy lucky. The newsreels played video of that night for munths to follow, and just about every New Years Eve thereafter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Waitsa second.\u0022 Gletrix took another sip out of an already mostly-empty bag. \u0022Why you were, were you, in the hopsital?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was my megaphone.\u0022 He grabbed the rubber ball as it floated past, tumbling lightly downwards. \u0022So the following year we tried again, just with a giant rubber ball instead of a giant glass one. Painted the year on the side if it.\u0022 He held the ball up as an example. \u0022Year ball.\u0022 A quick toss and the ball disappeared into the lab. \u0022Didn\u0027t make it to the M\u00FCn, and we don\u0027t talk about the following New Year\u0027s anymore. Wasn\u0027t pretty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clock started beeping and soon it was ten seconds to zero time. Thomlock started the count\u00A0as he had more than a hundred years before. \u0022Nine, eight, seven,\u0022 the others joined the chorus \u0022six, four, no, five, three, two, none, none?, one.

Gletrix and Macfred both started giggling, the others too, and the laughter amplified into a cacophony of giddiness. New Year\u0027s Day, finally upon them. Another year spent way out in the black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So,\u0022 Macfred said some minutes later after catching his breath. \u0022One hundred years.\u0022 He was looking out of the window pensively, perhaps wondering what was happening on the blue speck next to the red speck near the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, but one hundred years since what?\u0022 Agake looked at Thomlock, expecting an answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, if you kids ran your numbers right, one hundred years since that Jeb kid blew himself up on the launchpad. Morbid thing to set a calendar to if you ask me.\u0022 They sat in silence for some time, each reflecting on their own thoughts. Finally Macfred perked up and spoke directly to Thomlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, I forgot to mention,\u0022 he stabbed at the window with his straw, pointing at nothing in particular. \u0022I had the computer compare the flare you reported to the dat from the map sats and our own radar data.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you\u0027re right. Something\u0027s here with us. Something big. The Boss suggested we might find, uh, something, so maybe this is it. Maybe it isn\u0027t. Either way as soon as this little holiday is over and all our heads clear up we\u0027ll go check it out. Deal?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Deal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwenty four days later and they were ready to head out on their expedition. (That \u0022science\u0022 left them all with an incredible headache the likes of which nothing would chase away except time.) The K-3 and the extra fuel was still some forty days out, so instead of sitting around dreaming about where they might land on Laythe, they all piled aboard the Sulphur shuttle and went on a short trip. (They first had to move the Aluminium X-4B out of the way, but that was a simple task.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock had labeled their destination as Thing L-1, the first Thing around Laythe. After running over the data several times, they calculated it to be in an equatorial, 200km orbit. Just a bit above them.

Or perhaps formed a ring around Jool. Soon Jool was less than half the size of the ring. Then barely a third.\u00A0\u0022Twenty meters.\u0022 The approach looked good and steady, so he gave the controls another twist. That brought their rotation up to match the station again.

Attempting lateral movements while spinning only resulted in being 90 degrees out of phase... something the computer could adapt to, but required far more practice than Thomlock had ever had.

He activated the hard docking latch and checked the atmosphere on the other side. \u0022The air looks good. A bit warm perhaps, but not uncomfortable. Flight suits should be safe enough.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock turned off the docking aides and shut down the ship\u0027s other navigational systems while Macfred checked over their new anchor point through the tiny terminal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shall we see what\u0027s behind door number one?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo complaints so he pulled the hatch open. The outside was cold to the touch, having been exposed to the vacuum for who knows how many years. Ice crystals formed as the wet air of their ship became condensate, and then just as quickly melted away. The hatch to the station opened with a crank of the locking arm and a gentle nudge, and the slightly warmer air pushed past the four and into the Sulphur 3. They all slipped into the airlock and closed the shuttle behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe area immediately beyond the lock was empty and clean. A dozen suit lockers lined the edges of the room, and the center was best described as the unholy marriage of a hospital and a jungle gym. The room was clean, brightly lit, all in white, with a geometric latticework of pipes along the perimeter. Said latticework focused on eight doors, doors that led to the eight spokes radiating from the hub.\u00A0At some three and a half meters across, the hub was the largest open area any of them had ever seen off-Kerbin. A similar suit locker was at the other end, where a small collection of smaller craft were apparently docked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow indeed, \u0027Trix. After 96 years in a tin can, this place feels like a palace.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake pushed past them, scanning the room for... something. She didn\u0027t seem to be sure what herself. Finding nothing, she wrapped her legs in the latticework and shrugged. \u0022It\u0027s empty. Ten doors, 24 suit lockers. nothing else. No science, no crew comforts, nothing.\u00A0Why so empty?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Form follows function, maybe? This could be a loading dock. Only reason to be here is if you\u0027re coming, going, or moving cargo.\u0022 Macfred bounded over to a random door. \u0022Let\u0027s go take a look at the ring.\u0022 Thomlock wasn\u0027t sure haste was the safest approach, recalling their encounter on the M\u00FCn. Yet before he could say anything\u00A0Macfred had checked the door for an atmosphere and was through the hatch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other side was just a long tunnel, as one would expect from the outside. A ladder ran the length of it to another door at the top. Bottom. Other end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This place is enough to make a top dizzy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe centripetal force at the hub had been minimal, only enough to suggest the walls were where they wanted to be. As they climbed up out of the hub, they felt like they were descending into a heavy pit. Halfway through\u00A0they each realized they were going into it the wrong way, and flipped over carefully. The gravity helped\u00A0more than they expected or wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter three years in the void, this \u0022gravity\u0022 felt welcome yet disconcerting. On the ladder they were falling backwards. Upwards. Sideways. Downwards. That feeling of disorientation worsened as they reached the bottom. The top. The other end. Through the door and into another small room. A clean, white room with two more doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany doors. One in front, one behind, one overhead. Three doors. The room below them wasn\u0027t very large, and before all four could descend up sideways into the disorientation around them, Macfred needed to open a door and go through. He chose one at random, slid the hatch sideways and pushed through into a large, well lit room. Thomlock followed the other three in, closing the hatch behind himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a large room, though not as large as the hub. It was warmer in decoration than the rest of the station, wood trim around the floors and the walls, lights a welcoming hue.\u00A0The floor slanted down and away from their vantage point, the ceiling sloped down to match. Or did it? With the hatch closed the inside of the room felt perfectly rectangular, perfectly squared. On the far end a set of stairs led up to a door identical to the one they\u0027d just opened. The confusion of the hub and its spokes faded the longer they were in the room, and after a few seconds the sense of falling itself fell away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were in the library. Books and folders filled shelves and lined the walls, a set of high-backed flight chairs circled a table in the center. Small reading lights descended from the ceiling, positioned over each of the seats. The more Thomlock looked at the room the more wood trim he spotted. It was quiet, the eaves and shelves catching every sound. And nicely warm after their long, cold journey through the black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred stumbled into the room, and Thomlock wondered if perhaps the others hadn\u0027t adapted to the gravity as well as himself. Sure enough Agake was dizzily leaning against the bulkhead wall and Gletrix was walking with her arms outstretched. Thomlock laughed at their suffering and walked confidently over to the nearest bookshelf. He grabbed a folder from the top of the stack and started reading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A Study Into the Effects of Extreme Magnetic Fields on Exorem.\u0022 Macfred and Agake looked on intently as he read the title page, Gletrix was still relearning how to walk. \u0022Chief Researcher Bob Kerman, assisted by Lindra Kerman. 173rd Day of the 88th Known Year. Interesting.\u0022 He flipped through the first few pages of notes, mostly hand written, before holding it towards\u00A0Agake. \u0022And many more where that came from.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course there are.\u0022 They all\u00A0four stopped cold in their tracks. It was a male voice. Unfamiliar. Thomlock looked at Macfred, who could only shrug. \u0022That\u0027s all Bob does, write those silly reports that nobody will ever read.\u0022 Yes, unfamiliar. Yet not. The voice seemingly came from everywhere at once yet nowhere at all. Each of them looked around nervously, trying to find the source. Macfred motioned towards the chairs in the center of the room just as one started to spin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the chair sat a kerbal, not young but not ancient, his hair greying, his orange jumpsuit bright yet visibly worn. Unfamiliar, yet not. Not unfamiliar. Thomlock blinked when he saw the face and\u00A0then gasped uncontrollably. That face. The face of a ghost. He\u0027d seen it those many years ago, twisted and burned. It had etched itself into the forgotten halls of his memory.\u00A0He barely heard what Macfred said next, and completely missed Agake and Gletrix as they moved to opposite sides of the room.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock fumbled at his side for his spacewrench, only to find he\u0027d left it in the shuttle. Fool. The sense of falling returned, the universe spinning around him as he fell endlessly towards the streets of Kerbin City. The lights flashed past, a kaleidoscope of chaos, the sound of the wind and the crowd ringing in his ears. He went down on one knee and dropped the folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred put a hand on his shoulder and waved a greeting to the ghost. \u0022Hi, we\u0027re very sorry to have bothered you. I\u0027m Macfred Kerman and this is\u00A0the crew of the Jumble of Parts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other kerbal stood and repeated the gesture. \u0022Hello Macdude.\u0022 The impossible other motioned towards Thomlock, and started walking\u00A0towards them. It could still walk. \u0022Is he going to be ok?\u0022 No, he was most definitely not going to be ok. He shook his head to regain his senses, but nothing could shake the falling. Spinning. His mind twisted in upon itself, and for some reason his head nodded in the affirmative. A faint yes leaked treasonously from his lips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry, we\u0027ve been in microgravity for a very long time. I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll all be fine once we adapt.\u0022 No, they wouldn\u0027t. They couldn\u0027t. They were communing with the dead, they could never be ok. Ever again. Macfred kept speaking while the universe continued to spin. \u0022Sorry, again, we\u0027re on a mission to study Laythe and Jool, and we\u00A0just kind of stumbled on your station. Heh. Stumbled, in, your station. Where are we exactly?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ghost laughed. \u0022Where are my manners.

Impossible, most likely, at least in KSP v1.0.5. The game simply wouldn\u0027t have been able to handle the part count at the time. The scene was also originally written from Macfred\u0027s point of view, a change I made\u00A0only a few hours ago. So I apologize if any of the prose is a bit... off. Especially in the last bit.

I\u0027ll also work up a stock-only version while doing so. (I need to spawn a new version of it in 1.1.3 anyway so I can copy the new wheel parts to the craft that\u0027s at Jool.) As for flying anything - I use a joystick. Logitech 3D Pro is a nice, cheap stick. So if you\u0027re trying to fly by keyboard, that might be one thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T17:09:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if the station was spinning out of control and falling into the atmosphere, we would have to see if any of the Kerbals had a copy of \u0022No Time For Caution\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
