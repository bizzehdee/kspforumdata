Using the blimp bits from Hooligan really is the only reason I was finally able to land. As a side effect I discovered that when I was light on Kethane and fuel the air bags were enough to get a little lift and move the whole rig around (hence the propellers, got it up to 35 as long as my altitude is below 2k, above that the atmo doesn\u0027t seem to support the wieght)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mYO2XIX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mYO2XIX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Munar ecplisle interfered with my day here.
