As of this evening, I have now flown a sounding rocket that I designed from scratch. I have a lot of work to do on texturing, and getting some fiddly bits working with the engine heating animation. That being said, the joy of flying a rocket that I created with only parts that came out of my brain is arguable as satisfying as when I first achieved orbit, many months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that my journey will continue with unmanned Kerbin SOI vessels for a while, until I can build up the skill base to really create the range of parts I will need to explore the Kerbol system. But of course, this was my intention. I don\u0027t even need the tech tree anymore to have a satisfying game progression, and it\u0027s pretty cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures of my un-named sounding rocket, on it\u0027s was to an Apoapsis of 134km, on it\u0027s maiden ballistic flight. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/DxXMG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/DxXMG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pUv7T4n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pUv7T4n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T05:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egrats, looks cool\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
