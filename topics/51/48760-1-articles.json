The high altitude of the landing site means the service module will need to be seperated and chutes opened early to ensure a soft landing, which does carry some risk that the service module might drift too far and become lost. The service modules legs are extended to improve its chances of a soft landing. After tense minutes the service module is observed touching down and it doesn\u0027t seem to go rolling away, so the ground must be reasonably flat. 17 seconds later the command pod with it\u0027s fragile science module joins it.

Finally the manned module would make a polar landing to perform EVA and science there. I couldn\u0027t design the probes exactly as I wanted them - the radial attachment point for science Jr. is fixed so it is facing the wrong way (I needed it to face outward). As a result the parachutes couldn\u0027t be attached to the sides without blocking the science bay, so they had to go on the nose cone which looks a little silly. The Goo containers have an impact rating of 12, making them good landing legs. The light, along with antenna and thermometer not only help explore, they also provide the required weight balance to the decoupler.

As the orbital stage struggled to make up for lost delta-v Bill reordered his staging to eject two of the probes, hoping the loss of 2.2 tons of mass would help. It was still not enough.

As it turns out he just took the Mun 2 launch system and added the struts that had been discussed. He calls this a \u0027subassembly\u0027. The struts certainly fixed the solid booster stability issues and a polar course was entered with staging proceeding as on previous Mun launches. The first issue came with the orbital booster. It was known in advance that this would have more delta-v then needed, and would likely need to be cut off and dropped before stable orbit was achieved to prevent it from becoming space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever what was not anticipated was the thrust issue. The LV-909 just didn\u0027t have enough power to get into stable orbit fast enough. Since the ship itself carried over 1000m/s of delta-v Geofmin decided to shutdown and dump the orbital booster ASAP, slightly increasing the thrust to weight. It was still not enough but with some changes in the direction of thrust it managed to put the PE at 52km, enough that the ship could easily coast through one orbit without significant degradation. A burn was planned at the AP, but due to a continuing manuveur the planned node was altered and when executed sent the ship in the wrong direction, lowering PE to 40km instead of raising it. More fuel had to be expended to bring PE back up to 70km, leaving too little fuel left to circularize. This left the explorer with an elliptical path with a small window during each orbit in which to deorbit. In theory any almost any point on the planet can be reached, but it could take a day of waiting for it to line up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yLv4Kra.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yLv4Kra.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x3nqZ26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022x3nqZ26.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xABVd35.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xABVd35.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the situation accepted Geofmin got down to the task of landing each of his 4 biome exploration pods. Each pod is a self contained science lab designed to deorbit and study a Kerbin biome. Power for the probes descent is provided by a battery, though while connected to the mothership all batteries are recharged by the ships solar panels. Once all 4 probes have been landed the mothership, which contains its own science equipment in addition to Geofmin, are slated to make a polar landing to study the ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first pod is released and after lining up with it\u0027s intended drop zone, using a maneuver node keyed to 114m/s, its one time solid boosters are fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wroKYik.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wroKYik.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aBrg90Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aBrg90Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LWNmL90.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LWNmL90.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the long delay from Bill\u0027s failed mission, where he ejected or burned up all the pods without using even one, everyone had forgotten that the pods had to be fired backwards - the boosters are pointed \u0027up\u0027 with relation to the pod\u0027s control system. As a result the first pod was ejected in a permanent orbit, to run out of power in less then 2 hours. What science could be done in orbit and transmitted on the batteries charge was done, it had never been designed to transmit data from every instrument, just send temperature and pressure readings on the way day. Pod number 2 is able to deorbit, but overshoots its target landing zone, the desert, thanks in part to the difficulties imposed by the elliptical orbit. It lands in the grasslands north of the desert (on the continent with the big impact crater) earning about 20 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lcbzyFi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lcbzyFi.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FT3gXer.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FT3gXer.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPod 3 is released but some time is spent waiting for the orbit to line up a landing zone. Belatedly it is realized that the pod is running on internal power and the landing zone is changed to the intended target of pod 4, the water. This returns some interesting results for 30 science. As the mothership\u0027s potential deorbit zone begins to pass into night, an attempt is made to make a long shot at its edge, tossing the final pod over the polar caps toward a mountain range. However this low altitude pass proves too much resistance and it lands near the edge of the polar region. 30 more science is returned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xEmPDb3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xEmPDb3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M0sEqIq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M0sEqIq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the polar landing is begun.

Bob didn\u0027t think this was a problem for landing and that on take off he could just fly into the correct orbit, but it posed a danger if Lemgun didn\u0027t make his orbital burn at the Mun.

The intended landing zone, the canyon, had just passed into the dark side of the Mun. Landing there was going to be a challenge in the light and impossible in the dark.

Unlike previous landings which enjoyed the very large safety margin afforded by using the orbital stage for a long deorbit burn followed by using the landers engine for a slow controlled and mostly vertical descent, this landing used the orbit engine for the orbit adjustment and only a minimal deorbit burn. While the lander could have begun slowing down immediately (it was designed with enough fuel to make a deorbit and landing from 30km, then ascend and return to Kerbin with a few drops to spare) this would have wasted fuel and resulted in a landing closer to the equator. Instead a \u0027suicide burn\u0027 was selected. A suicide burn is a landing in which the ship descends in free fall for most of the trip, then suddenly goes into full engine burn close to the ground with the hopes of killing all the velocity at once and leaving little time for gravity to add any back before touchdown. If the burn is started too early fuel will be wasted because a second burn will be needed to cancel out the velocity accumulated during the second period of free fall. If the burn is started too late the kerbonaut goes splat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/goeuGzJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022goeuGzJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be the last of the Mun seen from outside the ship until touchdown.

Since the engineers don\u0027t have experience with larger ships yet, and no orbital infrastructure has been built for refueling it would need to have a reasonable delta-v cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna and Eve are obvious choices since they are close to Kerbin and have an atmosphere in which to brake, cutting almost half the fuel cost. Both have immediate non-optimal (but far from worst case) launch windows requiring about 1700m/s to eject, however Eve became the prime choice for a number of reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Transit time to Eve would be almost half that of Duna (40 days vs 77). In fact a probe could reach Eve about a week before the prime launch window to Duna opened, providing useful engineering data on interplanetary travel ahead of the launch of a potential manned Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere provides a bigger target for our first interplanetary aerobraking, increasing the likelyhood of a successful capture that is crucial to mission success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Due to the high gravity and thick atmosphere Eve will likely not be a target for a Kerbal landing for a long time. Any trip into Eve\u0027s atmosphere will be one way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Most of the probes instruments are useful only for atmospheric study, with nothing for geologic examination. Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere promises a wealth of scientific information if measured at all levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eve Explorer is based on several existing designs with only one truely new component. Since most of it has been tested to some degree in real world conditions the changes for success are high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch is a base is a standard Mun launcher. The one major difference is that instead of mounting the ship on top of the orbital/transit stage, the ship replaces it. Due to the dimensions of the ship this required that an additional structural fuselage be added to lift it above the 4 launch boosters (you can see it between the T800 tank and the decoupler). Rather then a full T800 a smaller T400 was used for the central body of the ship with the same LV-909 engine. Fuel was extended with a pair of T400 drop tanks. These where mounted at the same level as a pair of Mk2 biome exploration pods. The launchers radial boosters where also reconfigured from onion staging to asparagus to make up for a 1 ton increase in weight being carried by that stage (11 tons vs 10 tons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2 pods are based on the same design as the biome explorer from mission 12 but with a few enhancements. The parachute system and nose cone have now been dramatically improved by the new MK16-XL parachute which replaces all the previous elements with a single lower drag part. The instrument panel seen on the right was reconfigured to better match the weight distribution of the decoupler plate it is meant to mirror. And the most important change was the addition of omni-directional solar panels with which to recharge the battery and allow data transmission. These should provide maximum power during the daytime hours if the pod can land upright. Since a water landing is intended for one pod the panels are also tilted to ensure that even on its side there should be either one or two periods each day in which the batteries can recharge for transmission. The pod underwent a low altitude drop test at KSC to validate the new parachute design against the specs from the old one, it performed exactly as expected and will replace the old design in any future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LYOVsoT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LYOVsoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yJ1GpEK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yJ1GpEK.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/agwG7IL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022agwG7IL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe top of the ship contains a 3rd and final probe. With 2000m/s of delta-v this is the Gilly Grasshopper. It is intended to fly to the captured asteroid in Eve orbit and make several hops around the surface. Like the atmospheric probe it uses Goo Containers as landing legs to protect its Rockomax 48-7S engine from damage. It carries other scientific instruments including Science Jr, and has batteries and solar panels for transmission and charging. The drive section of the ship (the T400 tank and LV-909 engine) also contains 4 more solar panels. These are angled to face the rear of the ship, to ensure that it does not lose solar tracking while in deep space (since all the probe panels are biased toward a forward oriention). A docking port is used instead of a decoupler - we don\u0027t have tiny decouplers yet and the big one looks silly when used with a tiny engine. The docking port fits together more pleasingly, weighs the same and could be used in future to help deorbit the drive section, should a cleanup crew ever visit Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the mission will take over 40 days to complete, most of it drifting in deep space, it has been divided into 3 phases between which mission control can be devoted to other flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ship is launched into Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Course to Eve intercept is computed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ejection burn is made, drop tanks are ejected roughly half way through, leaving them in Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Upon exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI science readings are taken and transmitted back.

The course to Eve is computed the old fashioned way - create a maneuver node and push it around until the encouter is achieved. Since inclination was not lined up at either end the burn required both prograde and anti-normal burn to create a course that would connect with Eve. Unlike a Minmus or orbital docking encounter the time to reach the descending node for a dedicated burn was far from trivial and would have added weeks to the mission. The final course involved a 6 minute burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7TmQNGT.png\u0022 alt=\u00227TmQNGT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI knew before I started that the ejection of the drop tanks would alter the timing of the burn, since my T/W would suddenly increase. Given the length of the burn and distance to travel I didn\u0027t bother calculating any corrections for this, since a correction burn was expected and planned anyway. The actual burn revealed an odd bias, with the ship seeming to slowly nose up requiring a correction every minute. Once the drop tanks where removed the bias disappeared, though I can\u0027t tell if it was them or the weight change simply gave the overworked probe reaction wheels less to keep balanced. After the burn tracking showed an Eve near encounter at 380,000km, though that would be easily fixed in the course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BAFTfZw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BAFTfZw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4u5XlM8.png\u0022 alt=\u00224u5XlM8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 10 hours of flight the explorer reached the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, where a region of high radiation was detected.

He will pilot Deep Space 1 which has an advanced command pod with new innovations like a ladder. The rest of the ship is a simple design with 2 drop tanks and science instruments.

If everything is ready a pair of ships will head out to Duna, reach it and perform science, and then return within a week before Duna sets and the delta-v cost becomes too great, forcing the crew to wait several months at Duna for a window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve designed a mission outline based on the requirements; 1 sheet listing the ship designs required, and a 20 slide flight plan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/wxQeU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/wxQeU\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also started designing some of the ships. The crew ship is considered complete unless last minute changes are demanded. It features a 3 man pod for launch and return as well as living space for the long voyage (a ladder aids movement between the two). It is a clean and simple design, since it is intended only for the purpose of carrying the crew in comfort and safety and transmitting some crew reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UqxB28j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UqxB28j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas are still being pitched for an Ike lander, from which a general weight has been determined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gDrS7uu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gDrS7uu.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dNAQExD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dNAQExD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo plans exist yet for the Duna lander, which leaves its weight an complete guess. The cargo ship has begun to take form though is still under heavy work (lighting needs to be installed in several places), and may need more fuel depending on if the Duna lander goes over budget. It is designed to launch on the 30t lifter with mass to spare, after which it is loaded in orbit with fuel and the 2 landers. Unlike the smooth and friendly crew ship the cargo ship is pure function over form. Here it is both unloaded and with a full fuel set. The 3 radial tanks are burned to get to Duna, while the top and bottom tank are used to refuel the crew ship. Some of the other fuel is used for the Duna lander\u0027s refuel while the rest is enough to bring it home. Not seen are the 3 science pods (same as the ones on the Ike lander) that will be attached under the nose cones. The engines seen at the moment are placeholders for the nuclear engines still in development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jCSSugh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jCSSugh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/90HGpAf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002290HGpAf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA refueler has also been prototyped, based on the current shape of the fuel pods. I don\u0027t have any images saved but it is basically a thin rocket with 4 RCS thrusters at each ends. 2 fuel pods are then strapped onto the sides. The dual set of RCS thrusters are balanced so that the ship can reorient and fly \u0027sideways\u0027 during docking, without the RCS translation controls leading to rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I consider the 30t lifter to be the most important project. I\u0027ll be looking to get it working and then use it to launch a Mun or Minmus mission that uses the same science pod design as the Duna mission (the prototype Ike lander might even be used) to test usage and recovery of the science pods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RockyTV","CreatedById":57161,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T21:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice reports!

It would use the same pair detachable science pods, so that it could exchange them with the cargo ship between two missions. The advantages would be fewer structural questions about the cargo ship and less weight to carry.

Parachute stress tests haven\u0027t been promising and I\u0027m leaning toward trying to build a ship that lands on pure thrust though that means a lot of fuel (though so far it has only just got to the amount of lander fuel already budgeted for the cargo ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more productive front the 30t lifter problem has mostly solved itself. I\u0027ve been using the Kerbal design method to try lifting a 30t dummy payload without much success. I got it up once with plenty of each delta-v but the flight was not good with serious T/W problems. Structural stability became more and more of a problem until I literally had a lifter that would drop a solid booster or 2 before I had even lifted off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution, as always, was just math. Only 2 minutes was needed in Excel to come up with a starting point for a lifter design that worked immediately. I completely threw out any delta-v equations and instead focused on T/W entirely. Assuming that I could build a lifter with 5 skipper engines without losing structural integrity, and assuming a staging that dropped 2 engines at a time, what was the approximate amount of fuel that could be carried at each stage while maintaining delta-v. Working backwards from the final stage (1 engine) was just a matter of plugging in some fuel tank numbers until T/W was above 1 (for the bigger stages I actually went for a little higher then 1 for air resistance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qaFysxe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qaFysxe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YxvqELC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YxvqELC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only real revelation this made was just how small I should make the center stack. Previously there had been 2 stages for the center stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only small hicup is that after the first stage is released the second stage struggles for about 10 seconds to get enough power - instead of speeding up it is losing about 0.5m/s. I could make some further refinements to the fuel levels to fix this but due to how stable it flies I\u0027m reluctant to do that. Give that I have enough thrust I could also reduce the overall fuel by adding more staging - each stack of 3 fuel tanks could become a single tank with 2 tanks (or rather less) tanks attached radially so they can be dumped and reduce weight. But again that would increase complexity and reduce stability. The heaviest payload this is likely to carry for the Duna mission is the 28.5t crew module which will have a crew in it at the time. I can\u0027t afford to have a lifter with a lot of stability question marks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the total delta-v I could actually take the payload all the way to orbit with 400 fuel left, enough to circularize and then deorbit the last lifter stage. For that I\u0027ll need to figure out a stategy for attaching a probe core, since I don\u0027t have the large core (or even the regular radial) core yet, just some of the small ones. I will most likely build a tiny symetrical radial attachment for more then one probe core, that way I can get one pointing in the right direction for navigation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RockyTV","CreatedById":57161,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T23:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: nvm...
