The boffins at KSC were among the few to survive, thanks to the deep bunkers honeycombing the facility to protect against exploding rockets. They eventually managed to build expedient levers and such to get the blast doors back open, and when they finally climbed out, there was hardly anything left of KSC. So for the next week they bulldozed all the wreckage into a big pile behind the rebuilt VAB and designated it as the new R\u0026amp;D facility, the main purpose of which was to try to salvage anything useful from the wreckage. Then, once they got the new Mission Control facility up and running at a slightly different location, they attempted to regain contact with the KTC. And heard nothing but static. Of like 20 ships and 8 Kerbals, and countless spent boosters scattered from Kerbin to Jool, nothing showed on radar and nothing answered the radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the boffins decided to send out probes to either regain contact with the KTC or at least figure out what had happened to it. And, as is usual in the KSP, if they were going to do something, they were going to overdo it. So, instead of just following the trail of the KTC, they decided to send a probe to every body in the Kerbol system to map and scan for Kethane. This would eliminate the never version of the KTC from having to lug such probes around, which had always annoyed everybody involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this presented a problem. Most of KSP\u0027s subcontractors had been devastated as well. The major firm of KW Rocketry had suffered a severe blow so a new lifter contract had to be concluded with Nova-Punch. There were many other new faces in the crowd, some of which are still being sorted out and organized. Needless to say, the entire space program and all supporting industries will take some time to recover. But the probes had to get out quickly so the boffins did the best they could with what was available. And here\u0027s what they came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3763/10663961306_d14c0721f0_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663961306_d14c0721f0_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, the new light Nova-Punch lifter, powered by aerospikes, launches one of the probes. As with previous practice, the main tank stack gets the payload into LKO (which makes the math for the payload easier). But since the supernova had cleared all the previous spent boosters from LKO, the boffins had no intention of cluttering it up again so a new feature is the probe core, which uses the last of the fuel to deorbit the lifter stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3695/10663961246_859bd1ef0c_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663961246_859bd1ef0c_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probes look like this. Powered by experimental argon-burning VASIMR engines and toting a nuclear reactor, they have 12500m/s in the tank but pathetically low thrust. All to carry the Kethane scanner the new, experimental SCANsat mapping sensor. While still in pre-production form, it offers many significant improvements over the now-defunct ISA product, not least of which is the ability to use multiple probes at the same or different planets that map automatically in the background without having to be babysat. YAY! On the down side, however, it turns out you can\u0027t make argon out of Kethane (at least not yet) but these probes are considered expendable so no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5527/10664161443_8cd6853525_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210664161443_8cd6853525_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after a bunch of launches, I had 7 probes in LKO. Here you see the last booster as well beginning its descent to destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see form the KAC window, the Moho probe was the 1st to depart. Given this was the 1st interplanetary trip for the system, this was an appropriately hard test. As usual Moho was difficult to hit and I only managed to get a very bad encounter, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5540/10663924755_98d5405018_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663924755_98d5405018_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this is bad is because the probe crossed Moho\u0027s orbit at a large angle, meaning a very high relative velocity. How high? This high:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3812/10663960164_dc40b3db23_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663960164_dc40b3db23_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6600m/s and a burn time of 32 minutes, given the weak thrust of the probe. Which was actually longer than the time the probe would be in Moho\u0027s SOI. Despite burning retrograde from the moment it entered the SOI, the probe\u0027s blue line didn\u0027t even begin to bend around into an orbit. The burn started so far away nobody could even see Moho in Kerbol\u0027s glare until about 10 minutes into the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7300/10664160983_d37d7e301f_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210664160983_d37d7e301f_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, you can just barely see Moho beginning to loom out of the glare directly above and nearly as big as Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the probe had burned about 2500m/s to get here and did in fact burn about 7000m/s more in this failed attempt to get captured. Thus, it about 3000m/s left in the tank as it left Moho\u0027s SOI. But all these argon ions had not been spewed in vain. It put the probe into an orbit about the same as Moho but slightly off-center and thus phased up for another encounter after not quite a full circle of Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/10663924475_bcfbcb0f60_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663924475_bcfbcb0f60_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after this, it was no big deal getting into a nice polar mapping orbit at Moho. At this point, however, the boffins became aware that Moho doesn\u0027t rotate enough to notice, which made it take a LOOONG time for the probe to map it all. It also required several major inclination changes, but the probe managed them all and still has like 1200m/s in the tank despite all the hardships of the trip. VASIMR engines are cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next probe to arrive at its destination was at Duna, in hopes of finding something left of the KTC. But the vast flotilla that had been orbiting in the system was no more, and total polar mapping of both Duna and Ike showed nothing on the ground, either. The sensors did detect the faint odor of kraken dung, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/10663960286_da20e30f94_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210663960286_da20e30f94_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe that did this, which not only got out here, went polar at Duna, back to equatorial to move to Ike, then polar at Ike, still has like 9000m/s in the tank. Again, VASIMR engines rock (provided you don\u0027t mind doing 32-minute burns sometimes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this point, however, Mission Control was beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed by what it had set in motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3752/10664160443_bc5f76e7f8_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210664160443_bc5f76e7f8_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you see the probes for Eeloo, Dres, and Eve, plus 2 for Jool, still en route with those at Moho and Duna already in place. This was WAY more of a pain to manage than a flotilla of equal size going to the same destination. With just 1 destination, you do the same things for every ship in batches, with the ships spaced out enough not to interrupt each other. With this multi-destination diaspora, however, I\u0027d be in the middle of doing a mid-course correction for 1 ship when the launch window for another came up, or be doing a capture burn when a mid-course correction came up, and so on. It was VERY nice that the new SCANsat works when you\u0027re not looking at it. But a fair amount of argon was spent in excess of the minimum necessary due to deadlines passing while I was flying another ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, while saddened at the loss of all the hardware of the KTC, the boffins were reenergized by their makeshift accomplishments in this swarm of probes. Even now they\u0027re beginning to pour over the data streams in search of inspiration for the next incarnation of the KTC. Where will it go? What will it do? I don\u0027t have a clue just yet.

Basically, the best I could do was 50% coverage, every other hex. Then it was time to move to the real target, Gilly. Getting there from an Eve polar orbit was an interesting challenge in navigation. The way I did it was first to increase my Eve orbit into a circle about as wide as the minor axis of Gilly\u0027s egg-shaped orbit. Then I matched the plane of my orbit to Gilly\u0027s eccentricity. This gave me a circular orbit slightly overlapping the Eve end of Gilly\u0027s orbit. Then I stretched my Ap out to make my orbit egg-shaped, too, and fiddled around until I got an encounter out near the Ap. I did this because I remembered the experience of the Moho probe. I knew I had little thrust and Gilly\u0027s got a tiny SOI, so I wanted as little relative speed as possible. Here\u0027s the final stage of this maneuver, where I\u0027ve got the Gilly encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/10679724373_88b2f34d61.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210679724373_88b2f34d61.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all worked like a charm and I started mapping Gilly. This was SLLLLOOOWWWW because your orbital velocity out there is like 15m/s at the most gametime-efficient altitude. But I had a month before I had to mess with another probe so I opted for a higher orbit where I could warp at 1000x. This caused no problem with the Kethane because I was only moving like 11m/s out there, so wasn\u0027t covering much ground anyway. This resulted in an interesting scan pattern, with the map looking like Celtic knot decoration and the Kethane tracks on Gilly looking like a ball of string.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/10679534294_d61186d5b1_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210679534294_d61186d5b1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, mission accomplished and still about 1/2 a tank of argon left despite some really radical inclination changes while mapping Eve. Now what? Well, Gilly has like no gravity so, inspired by whatever probe it was that landed on an asteroid, I decided I\u0027d land, too. And like the real mission, I\u0027d never considered landing the probe until now, so of course this had never been tested. No landing gear and top-heavy. I hadn\u0027t even put struts onto the engines. But I managed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/10679724363_a2d99acdec_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210679724363_a2d99acdec_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDres\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres is one of my favorite places. Not because it\u0027s particularly interesting but because in the mythology of my KSP universe, Dres was the apprentice of the great smithgod Kerbin, and assisted in the latter\u0027s creation of the universe by adding the Sacred Strut across the sky to hold the heavens together. As such, Dres is the God of Spacetape, a patron of Kerbalnauts and boffins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA day or 2 after this, the Dres probe arrived. Despite having a very gentle merging angle at the encounter and only needing a 4-minute retro burn to capture in a 9-hour SOI window, I thought I was going to blow right by anyway. The blue line refused to even twitch until I was 3/4 through the burn, but then looped around quickly. Again, I was coming in under the south pole to capture directly into a polar orbit. With these VASIMRs, saving delta-V really isn\u0027t a priority but I\u0027ve got habits \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3686/10679494295_50166d619e_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210679494295_50166d619e_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas Moho, Eve, and Gilly had all proven challenging to map, Dres was as easy as Mun. Totally routine finished in about 3 game days. So again I had a lot of fuel left with nothing to use it on, so I figured why not try to land on Dres, too. Maybe, despite their pathetic thrust, the VASIMRs could pull it off and the flimsy probe wouldn\u0027t collapse under its own weight or fall over. So I gave this a try, too, and sure enough, it worked, and even landed in a place with a good view of Dres\u0027 Sacred Strut in the background \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/10679724303_13b29b6961_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210679724303_13b29b6961_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is probably about the limit for landing one of these probes. I had to burn at about 2/3 throttle the whole way down to keep my speed from getting too high for the weak thrust to stop at the bottom. The thing has enough TWR for the job but it doesn\u0027t apply it very fast so has a long \u0022stopping distance\u0022. But no problem, I had plenty of fuel.

In the end, they decided they could but it would be too much bother so they reluctantly started running simulations (as in F5/F9) for aerocapture. Jool aerocaptures are a doddle compared to places like Duna and (I was soon to discover) Laythe.

This is my usual way of getting to a moon upon entering a new system, putting my Ap out beyond its orbit. That way, when burning prograde at Ap, the probe\u0027s orbit would sweep all across Laythe\u0027s orbit, making encounters possible. As it happened, Laythe was in a place when the probe arrived that such an encounter developed very eary, needing only 234m/s. While this encounter was at a nasty, steep angle, the ability to aerobrake at Laythe made this a non-issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/10716061093_15baa31896_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210716061093_15baa31896_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the probe headed toward Laythe, sliding its Pe under the south pole while en route, and then it was time to \u0022simulate\u0022 the aerocapture. Did I mention that Laythe is VERY picky about your Pe altutidue? The boffins discovered that a range of only a couple of kilometers makes the difference between not capturing at all and lithobraking.

I\u0027ll try to keep it short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, mostly the boffins have been hard at work designing and testing the ships for the KTC proper, which has been taking a lot of time. They\u0027ve got the Laythe stuff pretty much ready to go and are now working on stuff for the other moons. But some of this required info on other moons so there was nothing for it but to keep on following the Jool 1 probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool 1 was last seen preparing to leave Laythe. It next moved to Vall, came in under the south pole, mapped it and scanned for Kethane, and the boffins took careful notes. Vall might end up being a handy Kethane source ships going to and from the future Laythe colony. But what really caught the boffin\u0027s eye was an anomaly in the southern hemisphere. Thus, after the probe had transferred to and mapped Tylo, the boffins decided it should return to Vall and take a close look at the anomaly. The Jool 2 probe is due to arrive in about 20 days and will do Pol and Bop, so Jool 1\u0027s mission was complete. It had enough fuel for 1 more trip; it would have had more but for pilot err--ER, experiments with different methods of transferring between moons used up about 1500m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the boffins decided to do was land Jool 1 at the Vall anomaly. Vall is rather heftier than Dres, which the an identical probe was barely able to land on, so Jool 1 was expected to crash. However, until that point it would be able to transmit information which might be of value in shaping the expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo down wen the probe. While still at about 20km, the boffins could see something on the surface, obviously rather large. As the probe got lower, the anomaly\u0027s features could be distinguished:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3709/10814041886_b916490f40_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210814041886_b916490f40_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boffins couldn\u0027t believe their eyes. It was obviously an artificial structure. But they only got a brief glimpse before the probe smashed down right in the middle of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2847/10814036785_a2d2883614_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210814036785_a2d2883614_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was stunned silence in Mission Control for a while. Then somebody mentioned that if they\u0027d known there were such things to be found, they wouldn\u0027t have crashed a nuclear reactor into it. Egad! What if they\u0027d contaminated it? Or damaged it from the impact and explosions? There were many worried looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then the probe\u0027s computer rebooted and the data stream returned. Much to their relief, the boffins saw that the main core of the probe had survived intact, including the fission reactor. Only one engine had exploded, the other had just broken off. Other than the kinetic energy of impact, the anomaly had only been sprayed with a small amount of argon, an inert gas. Probably no real harm done. And what was left of the probe was now transmitting a close-up picture of the place, as seen from ground level while lying on its side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2810/10814170464_db44c87ae8_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210814170464_db44c87ae8_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now the Vall part of the expedition is being significantly expanded. Instead of just a simply lander and perhaps a Kethane rig, now it needs a full-blown science mission to study the bizarre and inexplicable structure. And probably some means of removing the debris of the Jool 1 probe from the immediate area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeez, this is getting complicated. The Jool expedition was already going to be 15-16 ships. Now it\u0027s going to be a few more.

The 1st order of business was to secure a fuel source in the Jool system. The original plan was to use Pol as the main Kethane source for ships travelling to, from, and within the Jool system. This was the standard Kethane strategy that had been successful at Minmus and Ike, using the lowest available gravity. However, Jool 2\u0027s information on Pol (to be discussed later--I\u0027m SICK of probes) showed it to be unsuited for this purpose. It was just too far from the main action down at Laythe to be economically viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the boffins had to look elsewhere and decided the only option was Vall. Vall\u0027s got plenty of Kethane and lots of reasonably flat areas to get it from. However, it\u0027s got fairly substantial gravity, nearly as much as Duna. This necessitated a more complex exploitation strategy. Instead of the drilling rig itself humping lots of Kethane to the orbital refinery, all the heavy parts would stay on the ground and a separate, dedicated tanker would shuttle the Kethane in smaller batches. But this meant the tanker and drilling rig had to get together frequently and precision landings are not something the KTC is known for. Thus, it was decided that the tanker would land wherever within the Kethane field and the rig would come to it on wheels. So after much tinkering and cursing, the boffins rolled out the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5547/10863911906_2a5d590a59_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210863911906_2a5d590a59_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/10864209613_199252c54c_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210864209613_199252c54c_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Kethlab Jool, which will go into a convenient orbit around Vall and serve as the main fuel station. In the 1st pic, it\u0027s shown atop the standard Nova-Punch 5m heavy lifter developed for this project. In the 2nd pic, a close-up once in orbit. Its main tank serves as its own transfer tug using the in-line N-P big NERVA on the bottom. It\u0027s totally nuclear-powered to avoid the flaky and weak sunlight at Jool, the juice coming from the small-size Near Future fission reactors amidships with their cooling radiators open. The large spheres are big Xenon tanks, the purpose of which will be revealed in the next installment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/10864015574_f1a541e55f_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210864015574_f1a541e55f_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Vall Mobile Rig. It doesn\u0027t need a big Kethane tank because the idea is, it will be hooked via KAS to the Kethane Shuttle while drilling so the Kethane will go right into it. This pair of small drills are also powered by a small Near Future reactor on top. This one has a transfer stage instead of a reusable tug because it will probably have to make a fair-size inclination change once at Vall, which would take the tug pretty much out of business anyway. Thus, the idea is to use the transfer stage for the deorbit burn and a Soviet-style \u0022crasher stage\u0022. This thing isn\u0027t going anywhere else although it does have the ability on its own rockets to hop to a new Kethane field if need be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7367/10864015354_f117e53bcf_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210864015354_f117e53bcf_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the Kethane Shuttle and its separately launched transfer tug. The flotilla has 2 of these assemblies. The shuttle carries 8000 barrels of Kethane, half the load of the previous Ike Rig, which is why there\u0027ll be 2 of them. The standard transfer tug on the back has its N-P small NERVAs engines on outriggers and docking ports on each end should there every bee a need to use 2 of them to push something. I\u0027ll have about 6 of these things in the Jool system when all\u0027s said and done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7433/10863911286_5accbc5f20_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210863911286_5accbc5f20_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo round out the Kethane side of the expedition, there\u0027s the VHS (Vall Housing System) with its own little tug included in the same launch. You might have noticed that the Mobile Rig and Kethane Shuttles use KAS, so somebody\u0027s got to be on Vall pumping gas. Forever. Which is why the KTC uses unpaid, uneducated, pressganged bums for most of its crew requirements. 2 such Kerbals will live in this can.

This little jewel will be used by 2 highly educated, non-expendable xenoarchaeologists to help study the \u0022Stonehenge\u0022 thingy. While these scientists will ride out with the rest of the crew to save hassle, they\u0027ll be going home in this once they\u0027ve learned all they can. The vehicle\u0027s got goos, a Jr. Bay, all the sensors in the arsenal, and also some KAS grapples to help in excavation and in removal of the wreckage of the Jool 1 probe from the artifact. But the part I think the coolest is the spotlights on each end. These are mounted on Infernal Robotics Rototrons with 360^ traverse. 1 is angled slightly up, the other slightly down. With these, the scientists should be able to see what they\u0027re doing reasonably well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3770/10863929876_a6b3b24777_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210863929876_a6b3b24777_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, as a side note, you see here the new policy of the KTC: bombing Kerbin with spent ascent stages. As is the usual practice, each lifter is non-asparagus, consisting of a central tank core and SRBs. The SRBs land on or near KSC and the central tank has enough smash to circularize the orbit with a little left over. The new thing, however, is that these new N-P lifters have probe cores so they can use the remaining fuel to deorbit themselves. The KTC considers recycling to be political BS, doesn\u0027t give a damn about Kessler Syndrome, and is in general as environmentally unfriendly as can be, often deliberately so. HOWEVER, LKO is a small place and the Jool Expedition will involve nearly 30 launches (if you\u0027ve been keeping track, there\u0027s 8 just for Vall). While nothing\u0027s going to run into anything (probably), there\u0027ll be so many mission payloads up there waiting on the same window that it\u0027ll be hard enough to find the right one without doubling their number by leaving spent boosters up there.

So now that the Kethane mapping was done there and the in-system fuel station at Vall planned out, attention turned to the colonization of Laythe.

It has seats for 4 Kerbals and carries every instrument known to science, plus mapping equipment. It\u0027s fully amphibious, able to operate on both land and sea, and the wheels in the floats can steer and taxi it up a 45^ slope even in Kerbin\u0027s gravity. 4 of these will be deployed to Lathe in this wave. They get out there on the nuclear transfer and deorbit stage launched with the plane, which will be jettisoned to crash on Laythe. But all the Joolean moons are already awash in nasty radiation from Jool\u0027s magnetoshere so a little more won\u0027t be noticeable, especially because the engines will almost certainly land in the ocean.

Given the experience with the D\u0027OH,, they weren\u0027t sure it would work on a rocket, especially with the pontoons on it. However, it came as a happy surprise that it actually worked just fine atop a standard light lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach LOSER will be assigned to its own airbase, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5523/10896201056_05e76e0de9_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210896201056_05e76e0de9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 of these will drop on land-based Kethane deposits, chosen to spread the LOSERs out as much as possible. They have Kethane drills and refineries, plus housing for the LOSER crews. The plan is to taxi the LOSER up next to it and refuel with KAS. These things are not intended to move again after they land and have insufficient delta-V to return to space. The rocket tanks are as big as they are firstly in case last-minute panic burns are needed to hit small islands, and secondly to store enough to refuel thirsty LOSERs without having to drill up another batch in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach airbase needs its own separately launched standard tug as shown in the Vall Flotilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5508/10896451233_d57d811ba1_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210896451233_d57d811ba1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the land-based Kethane is concentrated in the western hemisphere and there is still no way to get the submerged deposits. But the whole planet needs to be explored this wave so to fill the gaps to the east, the boffins developed the Fuel Float, each of which contains enough jetfuel to totally refuel a LOSER twice. Obviously, this is only a temporary solution because these can only be replaced by sending out more from Kerbin, but needs must. 2 of these will go with the 1st Wave and held in reserve in very high orbit to be dropped into the ocean where needed. This is one of the reasons for making the LOSERs seaplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuel Float has 6 KAS systems so hopefully 1 will be within reach no matter which side the LOSER approaches from or which end up the Fuel Float ends up in the water. The transfer/deorbit stage uses chemical rockets just to be different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the simple concept, however, testing showed the Fuel Float is not easy to use. Extreme care has to be taken in all phases of the operation or serious disasters can occur. It appears that the LOSER and Fuel Float are mortal enemies that seek to destroy each other if given half a chance. The boffins therefore hope that the LOSERs will have sufficient endurance that the Fuel Floats prove unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6dXQiLy.gif\u0022 alt=\u00226dXQiLy.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s the basic mission equipment.

While 10 will stay there, 4 need to go to Vall and 2 need to get to Tylo, Bop, and Pol. Hence the mission needed a personnel transport and this is what the boffins came up with. It has 4 of the large Near Future ion engines, power for which is provided by 2 mid-size fission reactors. It could have been done with just 2 engines and 1 reactor but the TWR would have made the already painfully long burn times unplayable. But it gets great fuel mileage and the large docking port acts as a heatshield during aerobraking for the Kerbals seated immediately behind it. And despite being so long, it only weighs like 6 tons, so can be shoved out to Jool with another chemical transfer stage using 48-7S engines, again just to be different. 2 JERKs will also go with the 1st wave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, 4 LOSERS, 4 Airbases, 4 tugs for the airbases, 2 Fuel Floats, Jool Station, its tug, and 2 JERKS. 20 launches to assemble the 13 ships of the Laythe Flotilla.
