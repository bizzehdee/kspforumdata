To date, no program so ambitious has been attempted by the fledgling Agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHead of R\u0026amp;D at KAXA, Wernher von Kerman, speaking at the program-launch press conference earlier today, noted that, \u0022Very little is actually known about our cosmic neighbour, Eve, except that it is very massive, and also very, very purple. Even getting there will be a significant challenge, let alone returning from the surface.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAXA Mission Controller, Gene Kerman, who has been officially appointed as Head of Flight Control for the Suzaku Program, expanded on this sense of the unknown. \u0022Before we can consider sending Kerbals to Eve, we must first learn all we can about the purple planet. To this end, the first Suzaku Program mission, which we\u0027ve tentatively nicknamed \u0027Trailblazer\u0027 will consist of probe craft loaded with scientific instruments designed to thoroughly investigate Eve and its surrounds. It is hoped that we will be able to launch this initial Suzaku mission within the next few weeks, at the latest.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe added, \u0022Testing of lander and ascent vehicle designs will require significant time and resources, and this means that a fully manned mission will be impractical for some time to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile excitement runs high over the new program among KAXA scientists, concerns have been raised over the dangers inherent in sending Kerbals to other worlds, and regarding the large budget that will surely be required to see the program to completion. In particular, KAXA veteran and owner of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co., Jebediah Kerman, has gone on record saying that he doesn\u0027t believe that they could pay him enough to go to, \u0022that horrid, purple place.\u0022 We still await an official KAXA response to this comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the desire of this reporter, however, to wish all involved with Suzaku every success with the program, and I hope to be interviewing Kerbonauts returning from Eve in the not too distant future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42403518/Suzaku/Suzaku_pgm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Suzaku_pgm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe newly unveiled program flag for the KAXA Suzaku Program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-19T13:17:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2014 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AlexinTokyo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T15:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReserved for future stuff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T13:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESuzaku I - Investigator launched from KSC\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDateline: Kerbal Space Center\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy: Walter Kronk-Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first mission in KAXA\u0027s Suzaku Program, christened \u0027Investigator\u0027, was launched yesterday from KSC.

Two of these, known as Scout and Pathfinder, will be satellite probes. Scout will mount a newly developed Synthetic-Aperture Radar sensor to create a high-resolution scan of the surface of the purple planet. This will allow us to determine, hopefully with a high degree of accuracy, an appropriate landing site for the Suzaku Crewed Vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pathfinder will mount a Multispectral scanning sensor, developed by The Scientific Committee on Advanced Navigation, which will report back data about the conditions on Eve\u0027s surface and in the atmosphere. Pathfinder will be inserted into a much lower orbit than Scout, which is planned to have an approximately circular orbit at an altitude of roughly 750 to 800 km above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The third probe carried by Investigator, called Trailblazer, will be very different. Initially, Trailblazer will be inserted into a low orbit around Eve, just beyond the limits of the atmosphere. After reporting on gravitational parameters in low orbit, and based on data provided by Scout and Pathfinder, Trailblazer will be commanded to initiate a deorbit maneuver, after which automatic landing systems should bring it to a semi-controlled halt on Eve\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If the probe survives to this planned landing, a second set of scientific experiments will collect data on atmospheric composition, temperature, and pressure, as well as further gravitational parameters. A seismic sensor will also provide evidence of any tectonic activity on Eve.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Investigator has now been confirmed to be in a stable pre-departure orbit around Kerbin, allowing KAXA scientists and technicians to calibrate and test on-board electrical systems and sensor packages. All systems are reported to be in a \u0027go\u0027 status at this time. In slightly less than 2 hours, the Investigator Transfer Vehicle\u0027s engines will ignite to push it into an orbit designed to intercept our neighbour planet in approximately 170 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/44236409098014071/6CB203D1DB31EC9E269704B9104A5DD6BC085DBD/\u0022 alt=\u00226CB203D1DB31EC9E269704B9104A5DD6BC085DBD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Investigator Transfer Vehicle and its payload of probe craft, seen just after separation from the final launch vehicle stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
