The route I originally was going to take was through a pass I saw through the mountains west of the KSC. It took me 54 minutes game time to get to the base of the mountain and start my drive up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I got pretty far up too, but because of the battery, I had to be careful crossing certain ridgelines as it would become dislodged. I missed what appeared to be the route between two peaks, but instead found myself with no other direction to go. I couldn\u0027t even go back down without the rover accelerating out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s83.photobucket.com/user/Darkeldar/media/screenshot23_zpsb2358266.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j316/Darkeldar/screenshot23_zpsb2358266.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23_zpsb2358266.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I recalled the rover and going to try and skirt the mountains instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-10T17:41:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2013 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Darkeldar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
