After watching James May make the longest ever toy train journey for a TV special, it has re-awoken my fascination with steam locomotion and trains in general. I got out my old electric train sets and messed with them for a bit, I learned some amount about the real life Flying Scotsman, and I\u0027ve attempted to create vaguely locomotive like vehicles in KSP. Originally I wanted to do it with actual pistons and stuff, but the only requirement now is that it must use engine thrust to move mechanically (that engine thrust may not actually be used to move forwards).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is probably going to be a one off. Maybe I\u0027ll make a challenge based off of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00227zNzYKG.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7zNzYKG.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy early experiments took the whole \u0022train\u0022 thing very literally. The train was to be powered by pistons actuated by toggling twitch engines on and off with an action group. This was incredibly finnicky but I was able to get it working reasonably reliably, although I had to hit \u00221\u0022 repeatedly at the right time. The first issue was that fairings, while they are great at actually rolling, will explode if you go above 7m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022K8Gt9Qg.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/K8Gt9Qg.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next attempts used these Mk 3 to 3.75m adapter parts, as they are the only large circular parts with an impact tolerance above running speed. However, the ride proved incredibly bumpy as the hitbox doesn\u0027t have enough sides to make it a good enough cylinder for this purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022bliu6AT.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bliu6AT.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried covering the wheels with flags for a more circular wheel, with the knowledge that they made good takeoff gear, but in that application, they were constantly on the ground, not repeatedly impacting the ground. The flags blew up once speed was made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI attempted to automate the piston changing with the KAL controller, as there\u0027s no way I was going to be able to stand pressing \u00221\u0022 every few meters for an entire long journey. Once you get it at the right speed (easier said than done), it can keep going that speed more or less, but asking the KAL controller to change speeds, even slowly, led to it desynchronizing and slowing down instead. This inability to change speeds was the downfall of the KAL method. Even if you could slowly change speeds, going up a hill would change the speed more rapidly than it could likely cope with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution would ideally be some mechanical interrupt connected to the wheels that blocked the thrust of the engines at the right time. You wouldn\u0027t even need a KAL. But I really did not want to deal with moving parts more than I already had, so, in sadness I abandoned the piston based approach and instead attempted a sort of paddlewheel based approach. While this is a departure from conventional steam locomotives, steam turbine locomotives were also a thing, briefly, so this is technically still reasonably realistic!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00229VTkKE9.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9VTkKE9.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early attempts were simply the previous vehicle with one heat shield paddle per wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022N4jFPaa.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/N4jFPaa.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis worked pretty well and I was soon able to surpass my speed record. This is however when I found out that flags didn\u0027t like going that fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022Q1KDfhf.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Q1KDfhf.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also discovered that the vehicle would just refuse to exist going faster than about 20m/s. This turned out to be because of the common axle on the rear wheels, which wasn\u0027t needed any more because I had abandoned pistons (for the time being, at least).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022w8hjRcT.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/w8hjRcT.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next prototype upped the number of heat shield paddles to 8, 4 per side, and this, unsurprisingly, worked significantly better (and was significantly more fuel efficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022NgEluzo.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NgEluzo.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis version tested structural panel paddles and smaller engines, evidently without much success, as I quickly changed back to Thud engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I should probably say that I was having fun giving the engines increasingly British names.

While it kept the paddles from the previous locomotive(s?), the wheels were changed to structural panels and grip pads, as they had pretty good impact tolerances. The drive system was two Thud engines, this time moderately angled down so they wouldn\u0027t be so low as to be in danger of hitting the ground. They were fueled by just over an entire orange tank of fuel, in anticipation of a long range journey, as fuel economy was significantly better than previous piston based craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00229IRcZ1h.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9IRcZ1h.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Brisbane Challenger quickly surpassed the current speed record and was easily on track to break the distance record!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022PcRagrP.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PcRagrP.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, she quickly ran into a new problem: The vehicle was going so fast that the paddles didn\u0027t have time to cool down before hitting the engine again!

After the loss of several paddles, the engine just barely didn\u0027t reach that speed (or maybe just barely did, this is the only screenshot I have, it could have gone slightly faster). It attempted to stop before the end of the runway, but in my efforts to make the vehicle realistic, the only brakes were the main wheel bearings with the sliders set low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022UlRVupZ.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UlRVupZ.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, the vehicle did not stop in time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00224z5zp8L.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4z5zp8L.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Brisbane Challenger II was slightly changed, removing the grip pads on the wheels, and slightly increasing the paddle and wheel diameter for more torque, which resulted in improved performance. It soared past the end of the runway at nearly 50m/s, and promptly crashed into the water.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022HqVPiWt.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HqVPiWt.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Brisbane Challenger III placed heat shields over the paddles for better protection in an attempt to reach a higher top speed. During speed trials, it reached a speed of at least 56.8m/s, but at the cost of destroying nearly the entire paddle system. Jeb had to bail out with his parachute when the locomotive couldn\u0027t stop before hitting the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter another iteration, the Brisbane Challenger IV tested out some stuff, the design was upgraded into the L14 William Tell Overture (which is also not a British song like I thought it was, it is an Italian song for a French opera about a Swiss folk hero).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022ll8tslR.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ll8tslR.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was not a speedster, it was a long distance vehicle.

Maybe it is the noise. Maybe the inefficiency is the appeal.

At this time I also started looking at adding more train cars. In this case, just a fuel tank. Partially to test towing capacity, partially to make it as far as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022XylbzDg.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XylbzDg.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I had a really hard time keeping it straight and powerful enough to go up hills, especially given that I had to limit the throttle on the Wheesleys. Weirdly enough the Thuds gave me a lot of advance warning before the paddles exploded, but not the Wheesleys. After a lot of research and development trying to get the tender to stay straight and the engines powerful enough (L15 Willaim Shakespeare, L16 William Penrose), I found the solution: Cluster a ton of Junos together. I think I ended up with 8 per wheel. The temperature is not an issue (you can go full throttle), it looks neater than the Wheesleys). To keep the trailer straight, the two rearmost wheels had their friction controls turned up and were canted outwards by 5 degrees to provide some ground friction/drag. To maintain steering control, the friction control on the front pair of wheels was increased to 0.7 and the steering limiter was disabled. Previously all wheels had zero friction control as that helped solve other problems. The main drive wheels are very slippery side to side but very draggy forwards-backwards, at least compared to normal landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022bNUar6e.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bNUar6e.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe L17 William Tell Overture II set out on a journey to the mountains, modifications in hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00227tPdLA6.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7tPdLA6.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe locomotive made good time, and, at least for the flatter bits, a combination of MechJeb Smart A.S.S. and MechJeb Rover autopilot was able to keep it within 5-10 degrees of where it was supposed to be pointed, at least on the flatter areas. However, a new problem appeared. With a load this large, and going fast over terrain borders, the wheels liked to skip (either due to being momentarily airborne, or just slippery in general). The wheels were also kind of floppy, getting crushed like tires. While this was good for grip, it was not good for longevity, as wheel segments would also have some vertical velocity when slamming into the ground, increasing impact velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally the pieces should hit the ground with zero impact velocity each time under normal circumstances, up to any speed, but as we saw with the flags earlier, KSP still considers them to be impacting at least as fast as the vessel is moving for weird KSP reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022yKDJuwg.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/yKDJuwg.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter it became evident that wheel lifetime would be the limiting factor for this mission and not fuel, power and speed was reduced somewhat to extend the life of the wheels (which were already significantly damaged 13 minutes in).

Unfortunately the modifications (a second layer of plates and autostrut) didn\u0027t appear to help much, only managing to limit the vehicle\u0027s speed to 35m/s, and a breakthrough in wheel durability would have to happen for me to consider longer journeys. Nevertheless, the concept is likely capable of at least reaching the north pole. The current locomotive is probably good to 500 kilometers. The pole is only 950 (probably more accounting for routing to avoid mountains).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI briefly considered making train track, but the part count would be prohibitively high for even 100 meters of track unless I designed it to run in something really weird looking like an open cargo bay (and even then, the cargo bay would probably explode before the wheels do). Kerbal Konstructs may be viable but I would probably have to go through the hassle of installing a 3D modelling program again and actually making the track pieces. There is at least one other person doing Kerbal Konstructs trains right now but from what I know, it will not release for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of me wonders if this technology actually has any practical use cases. Assuming the heading control and wheel durability problems can\u00A0 be solved, I think I would rather drive one of these than a solar-electric rover, as they tend to eat power like crazy when encountering even moderately steep slopes. They also tend to want to flip over a lot. Except for not being able to accurately stick to a heading, the L17 was a joy to drive. I never felt in danger of flipping (except when tumbling down a hill), and I didn\u0027t have to stop to charge, or pay much attention to how I was driving, as the efficiency curve is significantly flatter for this design compared to rovers. I have not yet attempted to physics warp with this design, though, as I fear it would go poorly. Granted, that is a problem that stock wheels also have, you have to tune them to behave during time warp. Fuel cell electric is probably better than this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not 100% sure, I\u0027d have to do some more tests, but it might not be any better (or it might be significantly worse) than just using 16 Junos for their thrust directly. But it sure looks a lot cooler!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, of course, their efficiency goes down significantly if you use them on another planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat concludes my research into mechanical engine driven craft for the time being! I don\u0027t intend to do much more research at the current time, but if you have any ideas for making the wheels more durable, or know of any Kerbal Konstructs train track stuff, let me know! If the problems can be fixed I may attempt a run to the north pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
