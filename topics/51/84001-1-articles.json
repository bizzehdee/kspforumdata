But Jeb tired of making the trip alone. The solution suggested was 2 single man lander cans. Jeb did not like this answer, so he demanded an all stock parts, 2 Man Lander Can vehicle capable of ascending from sea level. So Werner built, and rebuilt, and tweaked, and started over numerous times, and finally, he provided Jeb with the Eve Gigantus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a single launch Jeb and Bill departed from Kerbin. There was no refueling and no docking. Everything needed to go to Eve is in this wonder of Kerbal Engineering. A 2 Man descent and ascent vehicle, a hitchhiker habitation for the trip to and from Eve. Science modules not included, but easily attached. MechJeb was used to perform the ascents and transfer burns, limit the vehicles to terminal velocity/max acceleration on ascents, and staging. All maneuver nodes were created manually, as were all of the burns needed to hit landing sites, tweak the aerobrake nodes, make inclination changes, and rendezvous after Eve ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.sidnaw.org/kerbal/EveGigantus/1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sidnaw.org/kerbal/EveGigantus/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEve Gigantus - Entire Trip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Narrative added to pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-07T02:31:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2014 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EdFred\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T07:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery inspiring to do it all stock. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T11:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I like your lander!
