It should be enough to burn anything unprotected (to be honest, I did not test if it indeed burn and destroy a naked pod, but it should)\n\n![8C4B8A129CF98EF76D14C9F6AE890A3FE5551B5F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/535143770352298132/8C4B8A129CF98EF76D14C9F6AE890A3FE5551B5F/)\n\nThe re-entry pod and its elegant design (cheap, cheap, and cheap).

Around 2500 m/s, could be faster, but as a demonstrator, it should be enough.\n\n![C6B0F6BD54B5EEE796226BD61F8C92523DBBE907](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/535143770352299037/C6B0F6BD54B5EEE796226BD61F8C92523DBBE907/)\n\nAnd the same 29 seconds, 30000 m and 2300 m/s later (quite a break bump).
