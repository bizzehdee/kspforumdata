Reports suggest that within a few decades, Kerbol \n\nwill barf out a small eruption of highly energised particles from it\u0027s Photosphere (so I started a new save). These will \n\nnot harm our Kerbals on Kerbin, but will make space travel almost impossible!\n\nThey have one mission, and one goal. They need to find a new system to explore! They need to go \n\ninterstellar! (Yes, I\u0027m trying interstellar travel... stock!)\n\nSo here are my plans for them.\n\nTwo ships. They are untested, as is the Kerbal way. We have little resources and few crew. I\u0027m aiming for a mainly stock ship. With Mechjeb for readouts/planning (and emergency maneuver). However, for such a long distance mission, KIS is being used for spares, repairs and redesigns in flight.\n\nThe \u0022LongBurn One\u0022 is the main Kerbal crew habitat and landing craft ready to explore new planets. With a heat shield and plenty of DV, we hope the Kerbals can survive long cryo sleep to their destination.\n\n![longburn1.jpg](http://benart.www.idnet.com/longburn1.jpg)\n\nTo aid them, a ship full of spares, will also be sent, just ahead of them it will also scout out the location of planets and possible landing spots.\n\n![spares.jpg](http://benart.www.idnet.com/spares.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T13:06:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Technical Ben**\n  \n..."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:02:25Z","Content":"Interesting.\n\nImg is borked.\n\nAre u using star systems mod by duracelle?"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:58:08Z","Content":"(Thanks, IMG fixed, forgot FF now hides HTTP prefix... darn \u0022progression\u0022)\n\nYep, should be, especially as they updated it kindly to 0.90.
