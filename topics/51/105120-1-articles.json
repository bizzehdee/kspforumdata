I\u0027m Wolf Kerman, and this is today\u0027s top news:\n\nEarlier today, representatives from the Kerbal Space Program announced a grand colonization effort of the Jool system, in collaboration with a multitude of private-industry partners. While nobody outside the KSC has yet revealed the scope of this undertaking, it is widely known that the Program has massively stepped up recruitment in recent months, and speculation about what was going on behind the doors of the Vehicle Assembly Building has run rampant.\n\nTo go with the announcement, the KSC released this series of images, which appears to show a space station of some type being launched into orbit. It is as yet unknown what the function of this mystery station will be, but it appears to be quite sizable and seems to be designed to produce artificial gravity through rotation.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![my3F9Th.png](http://i.imgur.com/my3F9Th.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![S2NULni.png](http://i.imgur.com/S2NULni.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![9PuWjRS.png](http://i.imgur.com/9PuWjRS.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![NcbFMb9.png](http://i.imgur.com/NcbFMb9.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![HVDxmWp.png](http://i.imgur.com/HVDxmWp.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![vkRjcMS.png](http://i.imgur.com/vkRjcMS.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**T-190 days to Jool departure**\n\n*Internal KSC briefing document*\n\n**PREAMBLE**\n\nThe Outpost Station design is intended to provide for long-term habitation by 88 crew members, to observe the long-term impact of space habitation in an unfamiliar setting. These stations will also serve as stopover points for crewed surface-orbit flights at a variety of inclinations.\n\n**DESIGN OVERVIEW**\n\nThe Outpost Station is designed as a pair of contra-rotating rings, joined by a despun utility/docking core. Each ring houses 44 Kerbals, and is capable of completely independent operation from the other (though unwanted motion may result if one ring is removed, due to conservation of angular momentum). At each end of the station are a set of docking ports, to allow orbital and surface-orbit vessels to attach to the station and exchange crew and supplies. The station itself lacks propulsive capabilities, but is expected to be used primarily as a static installation. It carries no scientific apparatus, as its primary purpose does not include specific scientific investigation.\n\n**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**\n\nCrew: 88\n\nLaunch Mass: 5936 tons\n\nOrbit Mass: ~1191 tons\n\nStation Mass: 216 tons\n\nUnit Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A14,618,105\n\n**MISSION CONTEXT**\n\nAs one of the KSC-supplied elements of the Jool Kolonization Initiative, it is intended for the Outpost Station infrastructure to be available to all private partners to use as necessary to support their own colonization and commercial endeavours in the Jool system. To this end, numerous Outpost Stations are being outfitted and launched, with the ultimate goal of placing at least one each in orbit of Vall, Bop, and Pol, and a network of them over Laythe and Tylo. Prospective distribution profiles for Laythe and Tylo are still being studied, but the (currently) most promising options are a set of stations located in low circular orbits at inclination intervals of 30 degrees, or, with sufficient private partner buy-in, every 15 degrees. The net result of this is that a minimum of 15 such stations must be launched and brought to the Jool system, with a total population of some 1320 Kerbals.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T03:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne**"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:35:20Z","Content":"**Part 2: A Frantic Schedule**\n\n**T-184 days to Jool departure**\n\n*KSC Administration Building, Jebediah Kerman\u0027s office*\n\n\u0022Well boss, you finally went and did it. You managed to sell this project of yours to the higher-ups, and I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027re the only one who\u0027s crazy enough to pull it off.\u0022\n\nJeb frowned at Scott\u0027s comment. Sure, he was excited to finally have the Jool Kolonization Initiative get off the ground, but it wasn\u0027t just him responsible for it, and Scott was forgetting that. The thousands of colonists, tens of thousands of ground personnel, and numerous private contractors and agencies involved in the project had a long few years ahead of them, and it was about to get heated very quickly. To meet the lofty goals of the Initiative was going to take an incredible amount of work, perserverance, and luck, especially over the next six months. He was just glad that the first launch had gone off without a hitch, and the first 88 colonists were in orbit awaiting the still-distant transfer window.\n\n\u0022Scott, what\u0027s the schedule looking like for the next three days?\u0022 he inquired of his second-in-command.\n\n\u0022Well boss, we\u0027ve got a bunch more outpost station launches in the pipe - that was the only bit that was ready before we got the go-ahead, so it\u0027s first off the block. Besides that, the R\u0026D boys finally have the science station ready, so that\u0027s got its first flight in a couple days. Plus EPSS is almost finished delivering their survey ship and wants a priority slot for the Kerbin mapping mission.\u0022\n\nThe last item on the list lightened Jeb\u0027s frown a bit. \u0022I thought they weren\u0027t going to be ready for another three weeks,\u0022 he inquired of Scott.\n\n\u0022They managed to step up their development a bit with some... ahem, encouragement from yours truly,\u0022 replied Scott with a smile, \u0022I don\u0027t need to tell you how important the orbital resource survey was to getting us the greenlight on this whole operation, after all.\u0022\n\nJeb nodded silently in agreement. The KSC management had been stonewalling the colonization proposal for years, and had only very grudgingly agreed to it, with the condition that the majority of the cost burden be shouldered by private partners, and that one of those partners had to send up a resource survey ship and map Kerbin before the departure date. ExtraPlanetary Survey Services had stepped up to the plate, designing and building a long-range survey/probe carrier ship in record time, and had been one of the driving factors in making the bureaucrats listen. Now Jeb\u0027s desk was piled high with requisition orders, design documents, contracts, and what seemed like a never-ending series of forms.\n\nAs Scott started going on about snack procurement for the upcoming launches, Jeb allowed his mind to wander a little, thinking back to his own visit to Jool so many years ago. He had marvelled at the oceans of Laythe, made a high-speed pass over the craggy terrain of Tylo, skimmed the Joolian cloud-tops, even gotten to glimpse the rock stacks of Pol. Crammed into the tiny little ship with just Bill and Bob for company, they had gone further than any Kerbal had ever gone before and lived to tell about it. And it was that mission that had inspired the Initiative in the first place.\n\n\u0022...and that\u0027s about it. You OK there, boss? You look a little glazed over,\u0022 finished Scott, looking up from the tablet and forcing Jeb out of his reverie.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m fine,\u0022 Jeb replied unconvincingly, \u0022Just not looking forward to all this paperwork. You think anyone would notice if I went for a walk around the VAB for a couple hours?\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027ll make sure they don\u0027t, boss,\u0022 replied Scott with a chuckle.\n\n**A few hours later**\n\n*Launchpad Observation Point, atop the VAB*\n\n\u0022Who the hell let all these civilians in here?\u0022 Jeb felt distinctly out of his element looking at the crowd of reporters vying for a position near the observation window to watch the launch. He saw crews from KNN, FKX News, KBC, and a couple of dozen other networks, and it seemed like nine-tenths of the assembled crowd had press passes.\n\n\u0022I did. The Initiative needs publicity, or else this whole thing will never get off the ground - pun completely intended,\u0022 remarked Bob, emerging from the crowd. \u0022I know this thing is your dream, but we have to keep the public interested, or our partners will dry up and take our funding with them.\u0022 Bob might never have been completely at home in space, but here on the ground, he was adjusting to his new role as chief of operations for the Initiative extremely well. Not that Jeb saw much of him anymore - Bob was constantly on the go, courting some private agency or the media or the KSC\u0027s own administration.\n\nA crackle interrupted them, as the observation room\u0027s speakers came on and the final countdown began. \u0022We are T minus 20 seconds to outpost station launch. All systems are go; repeat, all systems are go. Good luck up there.\u0022 All the reporters rushed to their positions, so they could be standing with the rocket behind them as it rose into the sky. Bob and Jeb moved off to one side, listening and watching as the last few seconds ticked off the countdown. \u00223... 2... 1... We have ignition... We have liftoff!\u0022\n\n*Well, they\u0027re certainly less dramatic than in our day*, thought Jeb sarcastically, as the reporters chattered into their cameras and microphones and everyone\u0027s gaze followed the trail of smoke skyward. There would be another launch in a few hours, and a few hours after that, but for now he could rest. Scott was taking care of some of the paperwork, and the VAB was working flat out to keep everything running on schedule. He quietly exited the room, while Bob waded back into the throng of journalists for another round of interviews.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T01:08:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne**"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:30:51Z","Content":"**Part 3: On Target**\n\n**T-182 days to Jool departure**\n\n*Cafeteria, KSC personnel building*\n\n*More forms*, Scott thought, as he sat in a quiet corner of the cafeteria eating his dinner, *Always more forms.* He had spent the few days since the project kickoff working practically nonstop, wading through piles of paperwork taller than he was. Even the addition of a massive staff of interns hadn\u0027t helped - there was just so much to do before the Jool window opened, and seemingly never enough time to do it. He was just praying that everything would keep running smoothly - a schedule slip was the last thing the Initiative needed. Just as he was finishing his soup, he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.\n\n*Scott, can you come to my office for a few minutes? There\u0027s something important we need to discuss,* was all the message from Jeb said. Scott groaned - he was already behind for the next launch. Resigning himself to the inevitable, he began the long walk over to the administration building.\n\n**A few minutes later**\n\n*Jebediah Kerman\u0027s office, KSC administration building*\n\nScott walked into Jeb\u0027s office, closing the door behind him.\n\n\u0022Listen boss, I\u0027ve gotta make this quick. I\u0027m swamped, and if I don\u0027t get everything filled out, we won\u0027t be able to...\u0022 he stopped as Jeb cut him off.\n\n\u0022That\u0027s actually what I wanted to talk about,\u0022 said Jeb cryptically, the weariness apparent in his eyes. \u0022We\u0027ve been hiring like crazy to fill out the rosters for the Initiative, but none of these guys have any flight time, let alone experience in deep space. We need the greenhorns, but we also need someone to keep an eye on them.\u0022 Scott blinked for a moment as he processed what Jeb had said, and allowed him to continue.\n\n\u0022I know you\u0027ve been grounded even longer than I have, but I also know that it was you who kept the Duna Expedition from ending in a blown airlock and four frozen bodies. And I need a point man up there even more than I need one down here.\u0022\n\nScott paused as his mind went back almost two decades, to the very nearly ill-fated Duna Expedition, to the thought of Bartdard straining against the airlock\u0027s wheel. To the rogue crewman trying to vent their air supply into space only a few weeks from home. And to Scott frantically trying to talk him down while Melman and Gerfrey searched frantically for something to restrain him with. He shuddered instinctively at the memory.\n\nThere had been a massive coverup, of course. The media darling of one of the most ambitious space missions in Kerbal history couldn\u0027t be seen as a raving lunatic by the general public. So Bartdard was quietly retired and placed in care, far from prying eyes, and the rest of the crew was grounded indefinitely. Now he was an urban legend, something the old hands occasionally discussed and the new guys rarely heard of.\n\n\u0022With all due respect boss, are you sure you want me up there? I haven\u0027t been to space in twenty years, and I\u0027ve got enough trouble keeping these interns in line filing papers. Isn\u0027t there anyone else who can go?\u0022 He asked of the boss, but already knowing the answer.\n\n\u0022Almost everyone else is already committed, either to the Initiative or other projects, or they\u0027re on R\u0026R and won\u0027t be available until near the departure date. We\u0027re less than a dozen launches in, and it\u0027s already getting harder and harder to keep order and traffic patterns going up there. I\u0027ve heard stories of airlocks being used as garbage disposals, near-collisions between stations, and of one of the outposts nearly tearing itself apart when someone turned on the rotation motors while they were still locked down. I need you up there yesterday, way more than I need you down here filing paperwork,\u0022 Jeb pronouned with great finality. \u0022You\u0027re going up on the next launch, on the first science station.\u0022\n\n\u0022Just my luck,\u0022 Scott replied with a wry grin, \u0022An untested lifter carrying a brand-new station design. What could possibly go wrong?\u0022\n\n**T-181 days to Jool departure**\n\n*Launch Control Room, KSC administration building*\n\nJeb stood in Mission Control, studying the big screen. There, between a map of the vehicles already stacked up in orbit, ground-camera and helicopter views of the science station on the pad, and a large ascent info diagram, was the smiling face of his friend. After two decades of being grounded, Scott was grinning like a madman from the thrill of being in a spacecraft again.\n\n\u00223... 2... 1...\u0022 intoned the launch director, \u0022We have engine ignition. We have liftoff.\u0022 As the massive spacecraft lurched skyward, someone announced, \u0022We have some wobble in the upper structure. Appears to be within acceptable flight parameters.\u0022\n\nJeb silently wished his friend luck as the rocket continued skyward and started its turn to the east. A minute later, it was out of sight, and the smoke plume was starting to dissipate. Then, without anyone noticing he was gone, he left the control room.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![5QmHkhi.png](http://i.imgur.com/5QmHkhi.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![0a5kUwq.png](http://i.imgur.com/0a5kUwq.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![FcYVYD2.png](http://i.imgur.com/FcYVYD2.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![rEB0PU7.png](http://i.imgur.com/rEB0PU7.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![m2DvfDJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/m2DvfDJ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![T5mGjg3.png](http://i.imgur.com/T5mGjg3.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**9 minutes later**\n\n*Jool Science Station 1, suborbital trajectory over Kerbin*\n\n\u0022Prepare for transfer stage ignition in 20... 19... 18...\u0022 crackled the voice from KSC, now half a world away. But Scott barely heard it, trusting that the other 59 members of the station\u0027s crew would act on the instructions being relayed to them. For now, he felt alive again, felt his body drift in microgravity, felt the tiny vibrations of the station around him. For now, he enjoyed space like it was his first flight again.\n\n**A few hours later**\n\n*Kerbin City Mental Health Institute*\n\nSigmund relaxed in his chair, just waiting for the day to be over. All this beautiful sunshine, and he was stuck inside looking after the ones who never improved. Most of his patients had been in for years, it not decades, and would likely never leave. Not what he had expected when he had taken the \u0022prestigious\u0022 job at the Institute. His final visit of the day was with Bartdard, not that it ever did any good. Bartdard never spoke, never misbehaved, never showed any indication of what was wrong with him, and was forbidden from being discharged by someone very high up in the government.\n\n\u0022\u0027afternoon, Bartdard,\u0022 he greeted the forlorn-looking Kerbal as he walked in. Bartdard inclined his head slightly in response, but said nothing. The TV was tuned to KNN as he walked in, but he paid it no mind. \u0022Care to tell me what\u0027s in your mind? Maybe today\u0027s the day.\u0022 Bartdard was as silent as usual as the KNN theme played in the background and Wolf Kerman started rattling off the nightly news, starting off with something about that big project at the KSC.\n\n\u0022Like the news? Maybe that\u0027s something. What do you think of Kustin Kerman\u0027s latest DUI?\u0022 he asked. He never got the chance to hear the answer, because the next thing he saw was a group of orderlies standing over him as he woke up. As he examined his broken nose and black eye in the mirror, he asked the orderlies where Bartdard was, and one of them responded that he hadn\u0027t been seen in hours.\n\n\u0022Well then, call the police and tell them to find him! He can\u0027t have gone too far,\u0022 he instructed the staff, sinking into his chair. He suddenly felt very tired, and the sunshine outside suddenly didn\u0027t look so appealing anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:23:02Z","Content":"This sounds like quite a project. Just don\u0027t rely on Kethane. First, it\u0027s not available in the quantities need to support consumption on an industrial scale, it\u0027s really only useful for small projects. Also, because Kethane makes no reference at all of a planet\u0027s landforms, odds are that at Laythe 95-100% of its Kethane will be utterly useless on the bottom on the ocean and what\u0027s on land will be in a very inconvenient place.

Is it too late to get out?\u0022 was the response to Ribfield\u0027s question.

Before long, Ribfield felt the deep *thud* of the first stage separating, followed a few minutes later by the second stage. Suddenly he felt significantly less heavy as the acceleration lessened.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![dND4Xbi.png](http://i.imgur.com/dND4Xbi.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u0022...ssion... here... gett... emetry... rrors... Can you confirm?\u0022 crackled the radio.\n\n\u0022*Farthest Reaches* here, Control. Can you repeat that?\u0022 asked Ribfield, clearly confused.\n\n\u0022I repeat, we\u0027re receiving some telemetry errors. Can you confirm?\u0022\n\n\u0022Board\u0027s green up here, CapCom. You sure you got the antenna pointed at us?\u0022\n\n*Just like Ribfield to joke while we\u0027re sitting on top of a 4-million-root firework*, Newsby thought sardonically, trying to keep his mind off his churning stomach. With his luck, he\u0027d have to spend the next few hours scrubbing his lunch off every surface with a toothbrush.\n\n\u0022Can the sarcasm, *Reaches*, and keep us advised. CapCom out,\u0022 replied Control curtly, clearly none too pleased with Ribfield\u0027s rejoinder.\n\n\u0022Hey Newsby, I\u0027m seeing some power spikes in the attitude control system. Keep an eye on it, will you?\u0022\n\nNewsby dutifully studied his console, but didn\u0027t see anything. \u0022Maybe it\u0027s a faulty sensor?\u0022 he suggested. \u0022Not like we could fix it until we\u0027re on orbit anyways.\u0022\n\n\u0022Eh, you\u0027re probably right. Just tell me if anything else seems weird, OK?\u0022\n\n\u0022Stand by for MECO,\u0022 came the voice from Control, \u00223... 2... 1... Main engine shutdown confirmed. Stand by for circularization in approximately 9 minutes. CapCom out.\u0022\n\nAnd, with that, Newsby realized just how isolated he and his fellow explorers were. Launched into a polar orbit of Kerbin to scan for new deposits of kethane and ore, they wouldn\u0027t even have the other members of the convoy to talk to on the airwaves. It was just him, Ribfield, and the ten eggheads who would be running the scanning equipment and probes. And it was going to be a very long six months.\n\nAs he and Ribfield prepared for circularization, the scientists and engineers were frantically working to prepare the scanners for their first deployment. Everything had been ground-tested extensively, of course, but nobody knew how well everything would work once it was exposed to the vacuum of space. In a few minutes, they would all find out.\n\n**A few minutes later**\n\nCompared to the ascent, circularization hadn\u0027t even been that bad, Newsby mused. A few-second burp from the upper stage, followed by the ship rocking violently as the retro-rockets did their work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![AvtXTzM.png](http://i.imgur.com/AvtXTzM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u0022Do you want to do the honours?\u0022 he asked Ribfield.\n\n\u0022Go for it,\u0022 the pilot replied with a grin. So Newsby flipped the switch that would open the ship\u0027s big bay doors for the first time, and kick off their mission here over Kerbin.\n\nOutside the ship, the doors swung open effortlessly, exposing the folded ore scanner to vacuum for the first time. Newsby pushed himself back into the chair using his console, and switched to the external camera view. He could see the scanner, now moved to the raised position but not yet deployed. Then, without a sound, the cable began to extend and the antenna started unfolding, preparing for the months of work that were to come.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hY5aD1Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/hY5aD1Y.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![H4e4n4w.png](http://i.imgur.com/H4e4n4w.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Meanwhile**\n\n*Mission Control, KSC*\n\n\u0022Circularization complete. Mission control, signing off,\u0022 said Jeb into the microphone before closing the channel with a sigh of relief. With all the assembled press here to watch the first private launch of the Initiative, he had stepped into the Capsule Communicator\u0027s chair to direct the flight personally. It had partly been about ensuring that everything went smoothly, but it was mostly because Bob wanted a good photo-op for the media, who weren\u0027t normally allowed inside. *And with good reason,* Jeb thought to himself, *It\u0027s always crowded enough in here without these guys and their cameras.*\n\nOne of the reporters, seeing him edging his way out of the room, broke off from the crowd and tried to engage him.\n\n\u0022Mr. Jebediah, the Initiative has 9 spacecraft waiting in orbit to leave for Jool, and we\u0027ve received reports that you\u0027ve sent your second-in-command to personally direct operations up there. What\u0027s next for the Initiative?\u0022 inquired the newshound, clearly eager for a big scoop.\n\nJeb forced a smile and answered, \u0022Well, there\u0027s still a lot of work to be done. We have several more craft being prepared for launch, and we\u0027re working with a number of private partners to provide services that the Jool colony will need during the flight and upon arrival in the Jool system. Negotiations are ongoing, so unfortunately I cannot give specifics at this time. Please direct all of your further questions to Bob, who\u0027s somewhere over... ah, there.\u0022\n\nThe journalist seemed satisfied with that, and wandered off to rejoin the rest of the pack while Jeb made a quick exit before he was cornered again."},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T00:19:15Z","Content":"moar moar moar plz."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T00:13:06Z","Content":"indeed we need more"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:19:02Z","Content":"is this dead"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T01:28:45Z","Content":"No, not dead.

Great. As if the guys working for us weren\u0027t enough trouble,\u0022 Scott complained to Jeb over the video link.\n\n\u0022I know, I know. But they\u0027re the ones who are paying for most of this, so we have to give them priority launch slots when they ask. Besides, these guys will be performing a necessary service for the Laythe colony - since most of Laythe is covered in water, we need some way to extract resources from the ocean floor. And KIMK people say they\u0027ve developed something that\u0027ll let us do that,\u0022 Jeb answered, \u0022I know these corporate types can be a bit cagey about their tech - even I don\u0027t know all the specifics of what they\u0027re sending up - but we all need to co-operate right now to keep things running smoothly.\u0022\n\n*Man, he looks tired,* Scott thought to himself as Jeb signed off, *Maybe he needs a vacation?*. But he knew the boss would never take one - the whole Initiative was his baby, and he would run himself into the ground before taking a break.\n\n\u0022Hey Newcas! Get in here!\u0022 he yelled into the hallway, before slumping over as much as he could in the station\u0027s microgravity. It was definitely going to be a long day.\n\n**A few hours later**\n\n*Kerbin Interplanetary Mining Konsortium corporate headquarters, Kerbin City*\n\n\u0022Yes, Mr. Kerbsson, I completely understand your frustration. We had to make some repairs to the launchpad after the last liftoff, and it\u0027s delayed our schedule by a few hours. Your vehicle should be ready to go any minute now, though,\u0022 Bob apologized to the executive standing next to him.\n\n\u0022Well, it bloody well better be,\u0022 Kerbsson growled back at him, \u0022We\u0027ve sunk a good 16 million roots into building this thing, and easily four times that in R\u0026D.\u0022\n\nBob was saved from having to apologize any further by the screens flickering to life in front of them. The biggest one presented a view of the KSC launchpad, half a continent away, with what was probably the most ungainly rocket Bob had ever seen perched on top of it. Nestled in the middle of a mass of fuel tanks and structural girders was a large vehicle, supposedly designed to be able to operate at the bottoms of Laythe\u0027s deepest oceans. Even from the minimum-safe-distance camera, he could see the massive drilling units along its flank.\n\n\u0022We\u0027re patched into the launch control audio loop now,\u0022 came a voice from somewhere in front as the launch countdown spilled out of the speakers in the cramped control room.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![9Ag2CKm.png](http://i.imgur.com/9Ag2CKm.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nBob could only imagine what the roar of the rockets felt like, and watched wordlessly as the ungainly craft began lumbering skyward. A few minutes later, he saw the first-stage boosters come crashing down around the launch pad as the screen shifted to a simulated view of the next phase of flight.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![bXPQYdq.png](http://i.imgur.com/bXPQYdq.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![zE6TTIf.png](http://i.imgur.com/zE6TTIf.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u0022Well, I think I\u0027ve seen enough. I\u0027ve got a company to run.\u0022 And with that, Kerbsson walked out of the room, leaving Bob to find his own way out of the building.\n\n**A few minutes later**\n\n*Crew quarters, KIMK Mobile Overpressure Acquirer of Resources*\n\nBurvin Kerman had done the zero-gee training, as had everyone aboard the MOAR, but it still hadn\u0027t really prepared him for the feeling of drifting out of his seat once the engines cut out, or floating around the cabin. Nearby, he could hear a couple of the less-well-constituted members of the crew of scientists and engineers filling their flight helmets with the remains of their breakfasts while the pilots snickered. He maneuvered himself over to where Endock was struggling to remove the now-unbearable helmet and helped him undo the last few latches. He could see that the normally dark green Kerb\u0027s skin had turned a pale white. He patted his struggling friend on the shoulder, and drifted over to the cockpit.\n\n\u0022How are we doing?\u0022 he asked Jefton, who was relaxing after the launch.\n\n\u0022Just one more short burn to pull us into a proper orbit,\u0022 replied the pilot, \u0022You\u0027d better tell the guys to strap back in, because it\u0027ll be in a few minutes.\u0022\n\nBurvin obediently moved himself back to the passenger compartments, and helped some of the others to get back into their seats for the last burn.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![f7B8HiZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/f7B8HiZ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![AsgR7cp.png](http://i.imgur.com/AsgR7cp.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Meanwhile**\n\n*Scott Kerman\u0027s Office, Jool Science Station Alpha*\n\nScott pushed himself back into his chair as he read the report about the most recent private launch. Everything was going so smoothly, and he couldn\u0027t help but think that something was bound to go wrong. With this much hardware still stacked up and waiting to go to orbit, he figured it was only a matter of time. But, for the moment, he could relax, as things in orbit finally quieted down a little and settled into a dull routine."},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T01:13:13Z","Content":"**Part 6: Giants of the Skies**\n\n**T-172 days to Jool departure**\n\n*Jebediah Kerman\u0027s office, KSC Administration Building*\n\nJeb looked at the folder on his desk with incredulity. 30 years in the Program, and he still couldn\u0027t believe it. Couldn\u0027t believe the blueprints and briefing docs in front of him, or the enormous vehicle being rolled out onto the launchpad outside his window. Even from his desk, he could see the swarms of news helicopters hovering around it, despite the media having moved on from the Initiative days ago. Even though everything was still on schedule, he couldn\u0027t help but worry - the last launch had caused significant damage to the pad, requiring days of repairs and reinforcement work.\n\n**T-171 days to Jool departure**\n\n*Launch Control Room, KSC administration building*\n\n\u0022This is *KWM Bright Future*, reporting in. We are T minutes ten minutes to launch,\u0022 came the voice over the radio as Jeb took his seat in front of the console, \u0022Everyone\u0027s strapped in and waiting up here.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![oRffmbF.png](http://i.imgur.com/oRffmbF.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nJeb had never liked evening launches, and this one made him especially nervous. There were almost 70,000 tons of metal, plastic, and rocket fuel sitting on the pad, waiting for something to go wrong. And, if something did, the rapidly fading light would make any emergency operations even more difficult. *But then, if we don\u0027t launch, KerbinWide will pull all their funding and we\u0027ll really be screwed,* he thought to himself. But as the clock ticked down, he banished his errant thoughts and focused on the task at hand.\n\n\u002210... 9... 8... We have engine ignition... 6... 5... Thrust curve is nominal... 2...\u0022\n\nAs the countdown completed and the massive craft began climbing skyward, Jeb heard a loud crash outside Launch Control. Across the room, he could see the Emergency Coordinator fielding requests for medical help all over the KSC. He turned back to his console and found that the telemetry was coming through in spurts. Keying up one of the Tracking Station cameras, he could see that two of the huge dishes were jammed and unable to track the slowly-rising spacecraft.\n\n\u0022Looks like the sound overpressure from the engines caused some damage to the KSC and tracking station. *Bright Future*\u0027s status is still nominal, and we\u0027re proceeding with the launch as planned. Keep your eyes open - this one\u0027s gonna be hairy,\u0022 announced the launch director.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![LdWZWpL.png](http://i.imgur.com/LdWZWpL.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![mnNS8SK.png](http://i.imgur.com/mnNS8SK.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![NGplbGD.png](http://i.imgur.com/NGplbGD.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**A few minutes later**\n\n*KWM Bright Future bridge*\n\nEven this far from the lifter, Frovin could still feel the massive explosive bolts firing and shedding another stage.\n\n\u0022Launch Control, what\u0027s our status? Over,\u0022 he said into the microphone.\n\n\u0022...systems... ational... amage... omin... over...\u0022 the headset crackled back.\n\n\u0022LC, I\u0027m not reading you. What\u0027s going on?\u0022\n\n\u0022mitter... amaged... oon...\u0022\n\n*Not like we can turn this thing around anyways,* Frovin mused as another stage dropped away.\n\n\u0022Launch Control here. *Bright Future*, do you read? Over,\u0022 came over the radio.\n\n\u0022Good to hear your voice. What\u0027s going on down there?\u0022\n\n\u0022We took some damage down here when you lifted off. We\u0027ve got comms back, but telemetry\u0027s still a little iffy. Looks like everything\u0027s nominal, though,\u0022 said the voice, \u0022prepare for final lifter stage separation and radiator deployment.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that, Control. Ready for final stage separation,\u0022 he replied just as the final stage thrusters cut off. But even as the *Bright Future*\u0027s own thrusters began firing, Frovin could feel that something was very wrong as the ship began to vibrate.\n\n\u0022*Bright Future*, we\u0027re reading a failure to separate the final stage. Can you trigger it manually on your end?\u0022\n\n\u0022Affirmative. Triggering now,\u0022 replied Frovin, pressing the button on his console. He was rewarded with a decrease in vibration and the massive, satisfying **KA-CHUNK** of the stage separator firing. His radar screen showed the blip that was the upper stage slowly falling away, back towards Kerbin.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ObTdKu7.png](http://i.imgur.com/ObTdKu7.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Meanwhile**\n\n*Launch Control Room, KSC administration building*\n\nJebediah breathed a sigh of relief as the telemetry came back on and revealed the massive ship to be safely in orbit, 200km over the equator. He walked out of the launch control room and took a couple of extra laps around the building to calm down before returning to his office and cuing up a link to Scott\u0027s office in orbit.\n\n\u0022So how\u0027d it go?\u0022 his old friend asked nonchalantly.\n\n\u0022Well, it looks like every single window at the KSC is now a hole in the wall, so at least it\u0027s not wintertime,\u0022 Jeb joked weakly, \u0022You know this bunch is going to be a handful, right? KWM spent over 90 million roots on that thing, but they cheaped out on training costs. You\u0027ve got a shipload of greenhorns up there just waiting for something bad to happen.\u0022\n\n\u0022You want me to shuttle over there? Maybe I can help whip them into shape before we ship out?\u0022 Scott asked.\n\n\u0022Not a bad idea, but I need you where you are. We\u0027re not even 10% of the way into the launch schedule, and I\u0027m worried that we\u0027re going to start hitting delays soon. I\u0027ll send someone up who can keep an eye on things,\u0022 Jeb replied.\n\n\u0022Alright. Just let me know if there\u0027s anything I can do,\u0022 Scott said before closing the link.\n\nJeb leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes and wondering when the last time he\u0027d gotten any sleep had been.\n\n**20 minutes later**\n\n*KWM Bright Future bridge, 200km equatorial orbit over Kerbin*\n\n\u0022Parking orbit achieved. Launch control, signing off.\u0022\n\nFrovin breathed a sigh of relief. It had been a hair-raising ride to orbit, but there was still one last task remaining. He unstrapped himself and pushed off towards the airlock at the back of the bridge.\n\n\u0022Help me suit up, will you?\u0022 he asked one of the other pilots.\n\n\u0022Sure thing, hang on a sec,\u0022 was the reply.\n\nA few minutes later, he was standing in the airlock as the air pressure gauge slowly dropped to 0 and the door opened. He sighed, activated his MMU, and puffed forward on a jet of gas.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Ws1MMSH.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ws1MMSH.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n*Never seemed this big in training*, he thought to himself as he drifted around the hull performing his inspection, *or space this empty. I guess we\u0027ll all have to get used to that.*\n\nInspection complete, he took one more circuit around the ship, pausing briefly on the Kerbin-facing side to admire his homeworld. Then, with that, he activated his thrusters again and jetted back towards the bridge airlock. After a few attempts, he finally made it back inside and got some help removing the suit before settling back into his chair to stand his first watch in orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-31T18:49:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2015 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne**"}]}
