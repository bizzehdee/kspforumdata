Here\u0027s a link: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86390-The-Dark-Side-of-The-Mun-Concert-Extravaganza?p=1276116#post1276116](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86390-The-Dark-Side-of-The-Mun-Concert-Extravaganza?p=1276116#post1276116)\n\nAfter 1.0 came out, I got to thinking: \u0022Could I do it again?\u0022. The answer:\n\n**HECK YES!**\n\nAnd so I got to work. Looking up stages and finding one small, but capable of landing without flopping over like an unbalanced whale on a rocket sled. And so, I designed this baby:\n\n![oMaKJnP.png](http://i.imgur.com/oMaKJnP.png)\n\nIt (hopefully) could get to the Mun. So, I put it on the launch pad without ANY testing whatsoever!\n\n![qMudthu.png](http://i.imgur.com/qMudthu.png)\n\nIt flew like a dream... for the first few thousand meters... and it started tipping...\n\n![9fFmHua.png](http://i.imgur.com/9fFmHua.png)\n\nBut, after some panicking and key-mashing later, I got her back on course. \n\n![fK2cLVM.png](http://i.imgur.com/fK2cLVM.png)\n\nSome circularized orbits and a maneuver later...\n\n![sVNj73l.png](http://i.imgur.com/sVNj73l.png)\n\n![ozyDX95.png](http://i.imgur.com/ozyDX95.png)\n\nFancy that! When the ship reached Munar orbit, I was still worried about fuel. I had about 160 units left after obtaining stable orbit.\n\n![adhrVGH.png](http://i.imgur.com/adhrVGH.png)\n\n![54ZVrQe.png](http://i.imgur.com/54ZVrQe.png)\n\nI\u0027ll see you on The Dark Side of the Mun!\n\n![OoznLKw.png](http://i.imgur.com/OoznLKw.png)\n\nTo victory! Or a crash. Maybe a crash.\n\n![ctCjJgO.png](http://i.imgur.com/ctCjJgO.png)\n\nAnd I thought the ring tanks were connected to the engine. Hah! How silly of me. Almost unbalanced the craft transferring the fuel from the rings to the main tank.\n\n![oDCknow.png](http://i.imgur.com/oDCknow.png)\n\nThis is where I thought I had messed up. I ran out of oxidizer just 200-300 meters above the landing sight, I hit at about 20 mps. Thankfully, the engine saved my struts by exploding. But, I had achieved a feat I would never have thought I could do when I first did it.\n\n![fWGHkKs.png](http://i.imgur.com/fWGHkKs.png)\n\nBonus! The stage at night looks pretty.\n\n![VHhN2xH.png](http://i.imgur.com/VHhN2xH.png)\n\nSo, there we go! A stage on the Mun ready for the concert! Now all I have to do is learn how to land close to it..."}]}
