Now i tried to gradually lower orbit first 2000 by 1000, than 600 by 300, than 300 by 100, and finally 40 by 40.\n\nI thin i saved loot of fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T17:43:18Z","Content":"Better outfit your lander with RCS.

The weight of extra engines (that are inactive) costs more during launch than you get back in reduced weight by not accelerating empty fuel tanks later on. If you replaced the middle engine (the one activated at 5:40) with a fuel tank of the same weight, you\u0027d come out with more dV in the end. Dump empty tanks (attached radially) or radially attached engines with spent fuel tanks (asparagus staging). Keep in-line separation only when the weight of the stages differs a lot, or changes the character drastically (atmospheric engine vs low-thrust high-ISp vacuum).\n\n- Late execution of maneuvers\n\n- you put a lot of effort into circularizing your orbit, an effort that goes out the window the moment you burn for the Mun. Wasted effort, wasted dV. Calculating the encounter from any sloppy orbit is somewhat harder but costs only effort, not fuel.\n\n- Poor encounter - a very distant one. By making the encounter periapsis much lower you save a lot of dV on orbital insertion thanks to Oberth effect, spending only marginally more in Kerbin orbit. That descent to low Munar orbit through so many maneuver nodes was sad - either launch into a very low periapsis, or correct your trajectory 1/3 the way away from Kerbin to Mun to make the fly-by very low - as low as 10km is good! Then just burn at the periapsis to (\\*roughly\\*) circularize. I estimate you\u0027d use half the fuel you used for maneuvers of descent. (Remember: the Oberth effect works when you\u0027re moving fast. You\u0027re moving fast at periapsis of a very elongated orbit, or at a very near flyby, so make that periapsis low when all it costs is moving your node half a degree left or right or speedin up or down by 5m/s. By gradually decreasing the radius of a circular orbit all you did was wasting fuel, painstakingly avoiding the goods of Oberth effect.\n\n- A lander this tall will be prone to tip over. Since you did use a fairing, you could have built your lander with two tanks with engines on the sides of the materials bay. (also remember, you can attach parts radially to a stack decoupler - in this case, two fuel tanks attached to the decoupler which would free the landing payload.) Wide, squat, legs wide apart (you can even tilt them so that they extend wider giving less clearance below!)\n\n- You didn\u0027t lose horizontal speed during the landing. (a pretty foolproof method is to burn \\*retrograde\\*). You barely saved your craft when it hit at a sideways speed too high.\n\n- You didn\u0027t brake with the engine after you rolled over and it pointed directly into retrograde direction.\n\n- Nevertheless, with so little fuel, return is impossible, so there\u0027s no point landing upright. As long as you didn\u0027t lose any science equipment or the antenna, you can perform all your needed science while lying on the side.\n\n- You have KER installed, but you don\u0027t use it. Things like horizontal speed or suicide burn time, they make the landing much easier.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T13:56:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T14:09:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait, how do you plan to pick up samples without a Kerbal?\n\u003E Notes:\n\u003E \n\u003E - that kind of staging isn\u0027t very efficient.
