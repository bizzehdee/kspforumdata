Rescue missions are definitely not the most fun, but whatever. I need people to put on futur base/station, and him being stranded on the pole makes it a more interresting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso Here goes Gatherer2, on its way to the mun. this is a probe lander with a rescue pod from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E survavibility, and loads of battery to accomodate the amount of light and stuffs I put on in case of a dark landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonce my course set, I warped until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change and unwrapped my lander to recharge battery....but half the solar panel broke due to poor design...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway let\u0027s get this kerbal back no matter what! looking at the course passing directly by the pole, I decided to land directly on site. and altered slightly my course to take care of the mun rotation, and I was all set...so was kerbin!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere is a point where I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SCREENSHOTS ! I started to see the mun disappear under a black blancket. My heartbeat was rising as I thought it was either a graphic glitch or my graphic card acting silly. then I noticed my electric charge was not moving in the right way despite the not-broken-solar-panels and then it hit me : kerbin was blocking the sun!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to land anyway, and manage to do it on the second attemps (thanks to quicksaves) just to see the wreck tumbling down a 1000m hill but I managed to get my kerbal back and had a superb sight as I was going down to the surface. The ship landed on the edge of the dark, which was quite dramatic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this must happen more than needed due to orbits of both kerbin and mun being on the same plane, but boy was it cool to see this happen it this very moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmoments like this are the reason why I can\u0027t get enough of KSP, no matter how much I play!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-09T09:49:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2017 09:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by psychopoak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T10:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002251aETCa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/51aETCa.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke is big, and it\u0027s in Duna\u0027s nearly equatorial orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eclipses are \u003Cem\u003Eoppressive\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T12:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving this excellent mission report to Mission Reports. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
