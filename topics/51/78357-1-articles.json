The Kerbin AeroSpace Agency has an exciting announcement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReporter: An exciting announcement about a KASA \u003Cem\u003Esuccess?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrent: \u003Cem\u003EAhem.\u003C/em\u003E Thank you for that comment, Klark. As all of you know, science is a long term project, and success can be a slippery term. So, while the long term success of the mission will be determined, well, in the long term, KASA is proud to announce the launch of KICKARUS INTERSTELLAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/nr9r3QB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nr9r3QB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nr9r3QB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlark: Interstellar?

The REBOUND 2 refueling mission was, ummmm, repurposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlark: But the mission schedule was released just last week.

We have no reason to believe Barmon\u0027s actions were intentional!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlark: So Barmon is incompetent?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrent: KASA has taken no position on that question! All we need is a craft with some 10,000 m/s delta V... just a little more funding will help us resolve this issue, investigate the Barmon incident, and help us educate the Kerban public on the importance of random interstellar rocket launches.
