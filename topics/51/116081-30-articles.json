Typically when I am about to play through a segment of a mission that will be in the comic I have a general idea of how I\u0027m going to present it on the page, so I take the shots I think I\u0027ll need from various angles as I go. I\u0027ll often take the same shot with and without F2 so that I can paste the character portraits somewhere alongside the \u0027uncluttered\u0027 image. More than once I\u0027ve had to re-play a scene because I didn\u0027t get the right shot the first time. For scenese such as Dilsby\u0027s mohole nightmare and the Kerbahashi Maru scenario, I have a separate save where I hyperedit and mess with the persistence file to get the kerbals and ships where I need them to be.\n\nTeaser while I work on the next bit:\n\n![nJwsQlH.png](http://i.imgur.com/nJwsQlH.png)"}]}
