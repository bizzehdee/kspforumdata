My main interplanetary \u0022carrier\u0022 is just a bit bigger (equivalent of a x200-16 fuel tank) than the Damkina and 4 LV-Ns is the engine-count wich gives it the more dV for its fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that everything is a question of balance. Having too much or too few engines on a ship will both result in a performance drop, respectively because of the unnecessary weight of the extra engines or due to the fuel wasted during the insanely long departure burns. Since the LV-Ns are heavy and do not have a lot of thrust, having the right number of them is really important if you want your craft be to as efficient as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, with 4 LV-Ns, my \u0022carrier\u0022 has 8.7 km/s (according to kerbal engineer) of dV with no payload and no drop tanks, for the equivalent of 2.5 orange tanks of fuel. If I were to remove one engine, I would lose 0.5 km/s of dV. If I were to add one, I would lose 0.3 km/s of dV. It\u0027s less of a loss but it can still easily make the difference between making it back to Kerbin or getting lost in interplanetary space. And of course, the more unnecessary engines you add, the worst the problem become. With 4 extra LV-Ns (8 in total) my \u0022carrier\u0022 dV would be reduced to 7.6 km/s. That\u0027s a loss of 1.1 km/s, think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a long story short, remember that what matters in interplanetary travels is the balance between your fuel reserves size and your engine-count (and of course your \u0022payload\u0022 size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S : I hope I didn\u0027t sound too aggressive or pedantic, or anything of the sort. My goal here was to share a bit of my KSP experience, and hopefully to allow some people to travel in the Kerbol system more easily and more efficiently.
