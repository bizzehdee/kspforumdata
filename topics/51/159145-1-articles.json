I\u0027ve been wanting to do an \u003Cem\u003EEyes Turned Skyward\u003C/em\u003E style mission report series, where I\u0027d play a new career mode game, presented in a history book format (Also inspired by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/148924-jawkins-space-prog/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E). These mission reports will have multiple different parties launching space vehicles - the USSR and the USA. Yes - It\u0027s basically just a career game with a moderately\u00A0entertaining backstory - but I wanted to do it so here it is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYear 1, Day 1. (April 13, 1957)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt a remote complex in southern Kazakhstan, a new ICBM\u00A0is being prepped for launch. But this is no regular ICBM. And it carries no nuclear payload. As trucks and jeeps drive around the missile, ground crew fuel up and prepare the ICBM for takeoff. This missile contains a small satellite, equipped with four long-range antennae and advanced scientific instruments. At T-minus ten minutes to launch, the three large, green metal launch gantries lower themselves away from the rocket, and the ground crew clear the launch zone. TV crews crowd around barriers, blocking any unauthorized personnel from gaining access to Launchpad-G. The rocket has two stages - the first, an FLT-800 fuel tank, with a singular BPT-180 engine, and a TR-18A decoupler to make way for the second stage - an FLT-200 fuel tank and another BPT-180 engine, with four Vernor engines to keep the rocket on course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KhgIsfA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KhgIsfA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt zero hour, the entire stack lifts off the pad, the 158 kiloNewtons of thrust more than enough to propel the rocket through the sky. Huge clouds of smoke billow from the engine as it approaches the highest-ever altitude set by an aircraft - 28 kilometres - and easily breaks that altitude record in a mere matter of seconds. At an altitude of thirty kilometres, the first stage cuts-off, and is jettisoned. The craft coasts to apoapsis, the Vernor thrusters aligning it on the correct attitude for the orbital injection. The second stage cuts-off with a mere ten seconds left in the orbital injection, at which point the fairing deploys and the \u0027Sputnik\u0027 satellite completes the burn using its NT-5R engine - an efficient, low-thrust experimental nuclear engine. The engine, also known as the \u0027Shiba,\u0027 has not been perfected, and slowly emits radiation, which would, if exposed to any astronauts for long duration missions - as the USSR would later find out - be lethal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the satellite had reached orbit, it took readings with its scientific instruments, and broadcasted a continuous message towards Kerbin: Beep, beep, beep, beep...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228a71adb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8a71adb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe successful\u00A0launch of \u0027Sputnik\u0027\u00A0prompted the United States of America to respond with their own space program. In the beginning, the task was handed over to the Air Force, which, to put it bluntly, couldn\u0027t get to space if they were given a prefabricated rocket with instructions spelled out in block capitals with simple verbs and multiple pictures and diagrams. They were better at designing aircraft. They just couldn\u0027t get their heads around the fact that there is no air in space. So it\u0027s no surprise that on Year 1, Day 3 (July 21st, 1957), when the US Air Force attempted to launch \u0027Voyager 1,\u0027 the rocket failed to get off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FzB4Yuh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FzB4Yuh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two strap-on TX-354-3 SRBs and core SCOUT \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ELRB\u003C/abbr\u003E were designed to carry the satellite, \u0027Voyager-1,\u0027 to an Apoapsis above the atmosphere, where the satellite would perform the orbital injection. However, the engineers made the embarrassing mistake of mistaking the vacuum Isp for the Isp at sea level, which wasn\u0027t even capable of lifting the rocket a single metre off the ground! The launch had made a mockery of the US Air Force, and the American people lost faith in their country\u0027s ability to compete with the USSR, with the failure being nicknamed \u0022Flopnik\u0022 by the American press.\u00A0And so, on Year 1, Day 4\u00A0(October 3rd, 1957), the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). And NASA\u0027s first task\u00A0was to launch a satellite to compete with the Soviet \u0027Sputnik\u0027 program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vOHJqew.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vOHJqew.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing NASA did was haul Wernher Von Kerman out from the Air Force\u0027s grasp to become their head rocket engineer. He and the rest of his team happily obliged, and, once work on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (Kerbal Space Centre) was complete, work on the \u0027Explorer\u0027 program began. The facilities at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E were less advanced than those at Vandenberg Air\u00A0Force Base, but they were completely NASA-owned, and because NASA was government-funded, it meant that they could decide what to do with their facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction of the \u0027Cygnus M-22\u0027 rocket began on Year 1, Day 5 (December 19th, 1957). First, the rocket required two DIOSCURI-1 SRBs to provide the necessary boost at launch to raise the Apoapsis. The contract to build and test the boosters was awarded to BDB International, while the first core stage, an FLT-800 fuel tank with a TR-18D stack separator and an MPT-180 engine, was given to LeBeau Space Industries. The upper stage, consisting of another MPT-180 engine and two fuel tanks, one FLT-200 and one FLT-100, was also awarded to LeBeau Space Industries. The payload, the \u0027Explorer-1\u0027 satellite, was to be built and tested by the NASA design teams themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, alas, on Year 1, Day 6 (March 11th, 1958), \u0027Explorer-1\u0027 was ready for launch. It sat on Launchpad-1A at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Crowds of reporters flocked to the Space Centre, and the local police had to be called in to prevent rambunctious Kerbals from jumping over the barriers and onto the pad!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt lift-off, the two SRBs and central \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ELRB\u003C/abbr\u003E ignited, and the rocket ascended towards the heavens on a plume of flame and\u00A0smoke. Across America, tall tales were told of the launch being felt across the continent.

(January 2nd, 1959)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Launchpad-G, at Baikerbanur Cosmodrome, a new rocket is awaiting launch. Once again, ground crew crowd around the missile, preparing it for launch. After the success of the \u0027Sputnik\u0027 program, the Soviet Union recognized that the next logical step in space exploration was reaching the Mun. Of course, manned spaceflight was a priority, but it wouldn\u0027t be ready for at least another year - and so, Valentin Klushko adapted the launcher developed for manned spaceflight by Sergei Kerbolyov, and, with the addition of a fourth stage, constructed the \u0027R-7 8K72,\u0027 a new lifter for launching small payloads on Munar flybys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first stage consisted of a BPT-180 engine, with one FLT-200 fuel tank and one FLT-800 fuel tank, with four strap-on MGU27A LRBs around the central core, with a TR-18A decoupler. The second stage was another simple BPT-180 engine, with an FLT-200 and an FLT-100 fuel tank. The third stage, an FLT-100 tank and another BPT-180. And, finally, the fourth stage was an LV-909 engine, with an FLT-200 fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload itself, the \u0027Luna\u0027 satellite, had another experimental NT-5R nuclear engine - so chosen due to its efficiency and reliability during the \u0027Sputnik\u0027 program -\u00A0along with three O-B fuel tanks, augmented so that they held no oxidizer, and only liquid fuel. The scientific equipment included a magnetometer, a new-fangled digital camera (Which raised the cost of the entire stack from 16,000 Kerbucks to 34,100 Kerbucks), four thermometers, four barometers, four geiger counters, and two micrometeoroid detectors. All in all, the \u0027Luna\u0027 satellite included more scientific instruments than any other space vehicle previously launched!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022q23G3IF.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q23G3IF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the rocket rose into the heavens atop a plume of smoke and flame, the launch was broadcast on global television all across Kerbin. The story of the Soviet\u0027s coming launch of a Munar satellite were in all the papers as the launch date approached, spectators flocking to Baikerbanur to watch the rocket lift-off. And they were not disappointed! At thirty-five kilometres, the four LRBs separate, and at forty kilometres, the core first stage cuts-off and is jettisoned. The vehicle coasts to apoapsis, the TR-C maneuvering thrusters setting it along the correct alignment for the orbital injection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second and third stages complete the orbital injection, and the fairing that conceals the \u0027Luna-1\u0027 satellite deploys, revealing an object reminiscent of \u0027Sputnik,\u0027 but with a longer fuel tank assembly and more scientific instrumentation. The four long-range C-16 antennae and two P-1NR solar panels extend, and the space vehicle simply waits, hurling around the planet at 2.2 kilometres per second, until an adequate opportunity for transferring to the Mun arises.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a two-hour wait, the satellite uses its fourth stage to set it on a trajectory towards the Mun, utilizing the Oberth effect by burning at Periapsis. As it approaches Kerbin\u0027s first grey, rocky moon, it orients itself along the Retrograde vector for the Munar Orbital Insertion (MOI). It uses the last of the fuel in the fourth\u00A0stage to complete the orbital insertion, and, with a minor orbital correction at Apoapsis, \u0027Luna-1\u0027 begins to take scientific readings of the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes many images, such as the famous \u0027A Long Way from Home\u0027 image:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tvHdWua.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tvHdWua.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... and the \u0027Too Close for Comfort\u0027 image:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bRqGS82.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bRqGS82.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, utilizing the long magnetometer boom, it took a photograph of itself, with Kerbin in the background and the Mun in the foreground:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jlCSuqe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jlCSuqe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the completion of the \u0027Luna-1\u0027 mission, which fulfilled it\u0027s purpose of scanning the Mun and photographing the far side, the USSR smugly sat at the top of the space exploration hill, with both the title of first artificial Kerbin satellite and first artificial Munar satellite in its hands. And, as the year went on, work on the \u0027R-7 Semyorka\u0027 by Sergei Kerbolyov was complete, and Russia\u0027s manned spaceflight program began on Year 1, Day 8 (April 12th, 1960), with the flight of \u0027Vostok-1.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the \u0027R-7 8K72\u0027 that launched \u0027Luna-1\u0027 was derived from the \u0027R-7\u0027 rocket that Kerbolyov and his design bureau were working on, the \u0027R-7 Semyorka\u0027 was practically identical to the \u0027R-7 8K72,\u0027 with the exception of not having a fourth stage. Instead of a satellite, the payload was a small, round orb - a crew capsule called the 5PUD-N1K - with a capacity of one. It was mounted on a service module, which consisted of a TR-18A decoupler to separate it for re-entry, an FLT-100 fuel tank, and a BPT-180 engine, with two P-1NR solar panels and four C-16 antennae.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qfh1dZR.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qfh1dZR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket lifted off Launchpad-G at 06:07 AM (Moscow time - UTC 03:07 AM), and, as the pilot, Valentina Kerman, sat in the capsule, her eyes scanning the instruments as she gently handled the joystick to control the rocket, she shouted over the radio: \u0022Poyekhali!\u0022 - whose rough translation was: \u0022Let\u0027s go!\u0022 As the spacecraft neared forty kilometres, the four strap-on MGU27A LRBs were jettisoned, and the space vehicle coasted to its Apoapsis.

A small fleet of half a dozen small military vessels was dispatched from Dzhida Naval Base to recover the capsule, and, at MET 123 minutes, Valentina Kerman, both the first Kerbal in space and the first female Kerbal in space, was recovered and returned to the naval base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe United States, however, not to be outdone by the Soviet Union, began the \u0027Icarus\u0027 program on Year 1, Day 9 (May 5th, 1960). The hardware required for the \u0027Icarus\u0027 program had already been mostly developed, as the launcher would be one of the \u0027Cygnus\u0027 lifter family rockets, with the addition of a third DIOSCURI-1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, to turn the \u0027Cygnus M-22\u0027 into the \u0027Cygnus M-23.\u0027 The upper stage, however, along with the payload, would require substantial modification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upper stage of the \u0027Cygnus M-23\u0027 was enhanced with the addition of two PIO-1 solar panels, while the development of the capsule, along with its flight instruments and scientific equipment, was contracted to, once again, LeBeau Space Industries. The capsule, which had to fulfill the parameters given by NASA, was decided to be derived from the company\u0027s tried-and-tested reliable NK1-2 capsule, which was used on the first supersonic \u0027eXell-1\u0027 flights. The capsule was enhanced with the addition of increased electrical capacity, along with a top-mounted small O-C fuel tank, which included four TR-C \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E maneuvering thrusters for attitude control, along with two parachutes, and an array of scientific instruments, such as barometers and thermometers.

The former problem was ironed out via increasing the gimbal range of the MPT-180 engines, and the latter was solved by adding small solid rocket motors in the tips of the SRBs, which ignited during separation to force them away from the rest of the rocket. And, finally, on Year 1, Day 10 (July 19th, 1960), the first manned flight of the Icarus program was scheduled to take place - \u0027Icarus-Liberty-1.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pa60ADh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pa60ADh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Cygnus M-23\u0027 rocket gracefully lifted-off the pad, it\u0027s one MPT-180 engine and three DIOSCURI-1 SRBs propelling it to over 400 metres per second in the first seconds of the launch.

(October 4th, 1960)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at Baikerbanur Cosmodrome, another \u0027R-7 8K72\u0027 rocket was being prepped for launch. It was identical to any other one of the rockets that launched the \u0027Luna\u0027 probes, of which there were now two orbiting the Mun. But none orbiting Minmus, reasoned Vladimir Khelomey, one of the three leading rocket designers in the USSR. A heated debate ensued, with the government focusing more and more on the military aspects of spaceflight, rather than the exploration aspects, saying: Why go to Minmus? There is no military advantage to going to Minmus. However, with gentle persuasion, Khelomey convinced the Soviet Union to allow the flight of \u0027Luna-3\u0027 to be redirected to Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cSyt1Yu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cSyt1Yu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt lift-off, the launch almost had to be aborted due to the absence of the Vernor thrusters that the engineering team swore were there when they checked it out for launch! Thankfully, the increased torque of the reaction wheels inside the \u0027Luna-3\u0027 satellite more than made up for this error. Other than that mishap, the ascent went smoothly, the fourth stage completing the orbital insertion and the fairings deploying to reveal the satellite. After waiting in orbit for one hour for a transfer window with a burn at Periapsis, the probe was sent on its way to Minmus, the second, green, rocky moon of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn image of the satellite orbiting Minmus, taken using the \u0027Satellite Selfie Stick\u0027 procedure, a term coined by Sergei Kerbolyov, who thought it was quite witty at the time:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226Q942eC.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Q942eC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capture burn was performed with both the fourth stage and the satellite\u0027s nuclear propulsion system. More than half the satellite\u0027s own fuel remained, and the space agency believe that the probe may even be capable of a Minmus landing! However, only two weeks later, on Year 1, Day 10 (January 3rd, 1961), President John F. Kermanndy made a speech that changed the world of space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtract from John F.

In the United States of America, a mission outline was planned almost immediately, involving maneuvers such as orbital rendezvous and docking - something not yet done by any spacecraft in the history of manned or unmanned spaceflight. So the US set to work designing a new capsule and lifter, capable of launching two Kerbals to space at a time, and equipped with docking hardware.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\u0022\u003EThe new lifter was named \u0027Hercules,\u0027 and the model that was lifting the two-man capsule, called the \u0027Hercules M-24,\u0027 had two core stages and four small SRBs. The SRBs were the same DIOSCURI-1s that were used for the \u0027Icarus\u0027 program, while the core stage was a different matter altogether. It consisted of one FG-120 engine, producing a staggering 700 kiloNewtons of thrust, along with two T-1400 fuel tanks, and one T-450 fuel tank, along with a BDD-0150 decoupler for separating the lower stage and the upper stage. The designing and construction of the first core stage was contracted to Wild Blue Industries, who subcontracted Home-Grown-Rockets Ltd. to develop the FG-120 engine and BDD-0150 decoupler, while Wild Blue constructed the fuel tanks themselves.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\u0022\u003EThe upper core stage consisted of one FG-90 engine, and one H-1600 fuel tank. Six PIO-1 solar panels were built into the upper stage, which also served as a service module. The construction and design of the upper stage was fully contracted to Home-Grown-Rockets Ltd. The capsule was once again contracted to LeBeau Space Industries. However, when they failed to produce a working prototype\u00A0within the three months they were given, NASA instead turned back to Home-Grown-Rockets Ltd, who claimed to have a working two-man capsule already in production. The NASA design team were not disappointed when a HGR Ltd. truck pulled up outside the Vehicle Assembly building (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E), and the driver wheeled out the HGR-57-Mk2 command pod, a small, 1.75 metre, two-man capsule, which, as a bonus, had an in-built scientific instrument unit and docking port mounted on the nose.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\u0022\u003EWernher Von Kerman and his team inspected every inch of the capsule, searching for any imperfections or equipment that might have a chance of failing during flight. As they inspected, the HGR truck driver added, \u0022We can bundle in a launch escape system for free if you bulk-order.\u0022 NASA promptly ordered twenty HGR-57 capsules for their new two-man program, which had the ultimate goal of docking two ships together in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

The \u0027Icarus\u0027 program, which was now cancelled in favour of \u0027Daedalus,\u0027 had a bail-out abort procedure, where the pilot would smash a button, immediately popping open the hatch so he could be ejected from the spacecraft and open his parachute to safely float back to Kerbin. And while that was all well-and-good with a one-man capsule, with two people and one hatch, an abort procedure like the \u0027Icarus\u0027 spacecraft would be near-impossible, so NASA were glad that they\u00A0had received a launch escape tower with the capsules.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\u0022\u003EThis new design wrenched the capsule away from a malfunctioning rocket\u00A0with small SRBs, where the parachutes would open, and the capsule would splash down off the coast of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

The rocket, the \u0027Proton-K,\u0027 was the largest and most powerful rocket ever built at the time, and was the brainchild of Vladimir Khelomey. It had a lift capacity to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E of 22 tonnes, the largest lift capacity of any current launch vehicle. The rocket used hypergolic propellants, and was the result of a heated argument between Khelomey and Sergei Kerbolyov. At the time, Sergei Kerbolyov was the lead designer of a project designated \u0027N-1,\u0027 the Soviet response to America\u0027s challenge to land a Kerbal on the Mun. It was projected to have a lift capacity to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E of 95 tonnes, and a payload capacity for a Trans-Munar Injection (TMI) of 23 tonnes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nHowever, though the rocket did not use toxic hypergolic propellants, during the first test launch that took place on Year 1, Day 12 (April 16th, 1961), the entire stack (Which, thankfully, was unmanned) exploded, devastating the launch site and striking a crippling blow to the Soviet space program. Khelomey suggested that the heavy lift vehicle that he was developing, which was much closer to completion than the N-1, could be capable of launching a manned Munar or Minmus flyby mission with a modified \u0027Soyuz 7K-LOK\u0027 (Which was in fact developed by Khelomey\u0027s rival, Kerbolyov) that had the orbital module removed, and the engine section shortened to save weight so as to be launched via\u00A0a \u0027Proton-K\u0027 on a flyby of Kebin\u0027s moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nThough Sergei Kerbolyov was disgusted at the idea of keeping men in a cramped cockpit with no facilities for a nine-day flyby mission, the Russian government pursued Khelomey\u0027s proposal, as it opened a window for the USSR to get further ahead of the Americans before they launched their own Munar missions. Development of the \u0027Proton-K\u0027 was complete as of Year 1, Day 13 (July 23rd, 1961), and, after the restoration of the launchpads at Baikerbanur, \u0027Zond-1,\u0027 an unmanned test of the \u0027Zond\u0027 modification to the \u0027Soyuz 7K-LOK,\u0027 designed to perform a Munar flyby to test the systems of the spacecraft, was ready to be launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nThe first stage of the two stage rocket consisted of six\u00A0clustered \u0027R-7 Semyorka\u0027 fuel tanks around a small, 1.875 metre fuel tank designed as a fourth stage for the \u0027N-1\u0027\u00A0but never flown, to lower the manufacturing costs and to speed up construction time. It utilized six LVT-270 engines on each of the clustered fuel tanks - the engines were actually manufactured by Wild Blue Industries, still holding up to their company slogan: \u0022We\u0027ll serve anyone, no matter where or who you are.\u0022 Of course, the slogan was coined in the 1920s, when the company solely produced aftershave and novelty watches, but by the time they realised rivals of the United States would also be able to access their more... advanced products, it was to late to turn back. However, because of the trade deal they had set up with the USSR to supply them with LVT-270 engines, the company in turn received 40 tonnes of pure titanium every month. These materials were directed to the construction of supersonic aircraft, particularly US Air Force aircraft, but the Soviets didn\u0027t know that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nThe second stage consisted of one GF-09 engine, with one 800-H fuel tank, and one 1600-H fuel tank. The \u0027Zond\u0027 spacecraft itself was very simple, with one LV-909 engine, one FLT-100 fuel tank, and one FLT-400 fuel tank. Above the tankage and propulsion systems stood an SC-9001 scientific instrument unit, surrounded by clusters of other instruments, which included ion traps, solar experiment packages, barometers, thermometers, micrometeoroid detectors, RADAR altimetry sensors, film cameras, geiger counters, and a magnetometer. Above that was a TR-18A decoupler, and mounted on top of that was a TN-7R crew capsule, which could hold a crew of three kerbonauts, provided you squashed them in there and that they were no bigger than your average chimpanzee. However, most kerbonauts were not this size, so the crew capsule only contained seating for two, while the extra space was taken up by rudimentary (toilet) facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QZSVCXR.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QZSVCXR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nAs the enormous beast slowly lumbers skyward, its six LVT-270 engines producing a combined 1710 kiloNewtons of thrust, there was not a spectator to be seen, only Vladimir Khelomey and a few VIPs, such as the director of the Soviet space program, and Valentin Klushko. At forty-five kilometres altitude, the huge first stage cuts-off, and the vehicle coasts to Apoapsis after aligning itself with the maneuver node for orbital injection. The fairings and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E are jettisoned at sixty-five kilometres, and at ninety kilometres altitude, with thirty seconds to Apoapsis, the first stage re-ignites to begin the orbital injection, separating with half of the burn left, and the second stage completing the burn. The spacecraft immediately performs the transfer burn to Munar flyby, and extends its solar panels, antenna, and RADAR sensors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nAfter a close flyby of the Mun, passing just twenty kilometres from its surface, the spacecraft reaches the top of its trajectory arc, and starts falling back towards Kerbin. With four minutes until re-entry into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, the propulsion-tankage module and the scientific instrument unit are jettisoned. During the real manned mission, the scientific data would have been transferred to the capsule before separation, but, due to the fact that the \u0027Zond-1\u0027 test was just that - an unmanned test - no scientific readings were taken. The \u0027Zond\u0027 spacecraft, however, was the first spacecraft to ever be fitted with an SC-9001 scientific instrument unit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nThe re-entry at a speed of 3.5 kilometres per second went surprisingly smoothly, considering the fact that this was the first-ever re-entry performed at that speed. But, as the entire mission was kept top secret until the maiden flight of the manned \u0027Zond\u0027 spacecraft, the monetary prizes to be gained for these achievements were never received.

(September 1st, 1961)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a special day at the Kerbal Space Centre. Crowds of spectators flocked to the newly-built grandstands near the launchpad, and another \u0027Daedalus\u0027 rocket was being prepped for launch. Of course, the American Munar landing mission\u00A0outline required maneuvers never before performed - orbital rendezvous and docking - and it was the \u0027Daedalus\u0027 program\u0027s goal to complete these maneuvers in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E before they could be conducted during a Munar mission. And so, two \u0027Daedalus\u0027 spacecraft were scheduled to be launched on the same day to complete these maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst came the launch of \u0027Daedalus-Friendship-2,\u0027 with its crew of two kerbonauts, Jebediah and Bill Kerman. It would be a routine mission, simply reaching \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and staying in a parking orbit until the second spacecraft completed the rendezvous, where the two veterans of the first kerbonaut corps, Jeb and Bill, would perform the docking. It was all in the \u0027Daedalus\u0027 mission manual provided with each capsule, hidden, strapped underneath the console. Not that Jeb ever looked at the manual. It was bad publicity to have your most experienced kerbonauts glancing at a booklet every ten seconds. And Jeb didn\u0027t want to be seen as the Kerbal who couldn\u0027t do anything without a manual. He wanted to be seen as the cool guy who could fly an aircraft supersonic inverted with his eyes closed while in a blindfold. (So instead mission control radioed instructions to him via the radio)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sR0ehne.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sR0ehne.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was simple, identical to the first launch, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E separation (SEP) at 20 kilometres, the MECO at 40 kilometres, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E jettisoned at 60 kilometres. The orbital injection was completed using the second stage, with more than half of its fuel remaining. The two kerbonauts waited for twenty minutes as they completed one lap of the planet, and the ground crew prepared another \u0027Daedalus\u0027 for launch, \u0027Daedalus-Independance-3.\u0027 This time, the crew would be selected from the new, second kerbonaut corps. The two successful candidates were Wehrus, a\u00A0pilot, and Jenlyn, a flight scientist. The launch was nominal, and the second spacecraft reached orbit without a hitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two kerbonauts set up the rendezvous maneuver easily, with only 12 metres per second of DeltaV expenditure. After completing the burn, the spacecraft was met up with the \u0027Daedalus-Friendship-2\u0027 capsule, and, after cancelling\u00A0their relative velocity, began the docking procedure. The two rookies from the second kerbonaut corps didn\u0027t actually perform the docking. Jeb and Bill did in their spacecraft. The tension in both the capsule and at mission control was so thick you could cut in with a knife, as Jeb maneuvered the last inches towards the other port. The docking probe of the \u0027Daedalus-Friendship-2\u0027 slid into the indentation of the \u0027Independance-1\u0027s passive docking port, and latched together, firmly connecting the two craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiple cheers erupted from mission control as Jeb and Wehrus radioed back simultaneously: \u0022Control, we have hard docking!\u0022 The crew of both craft conducted scientific experiments with their two top-mounted\u00A0scientific instrument units, and Wehrus conducted an EVA, taking a photograph of the two spacecraft with the film camera:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222WPHzlJ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2WPHzlJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter twenty minutes, the two craft undocked and re-entered one-by-one, first \u0027Daedalus-Friendship-2,\u0027 and then \u0027Daedalus-Independance-3.\u0027 After both the crafts had been recovered, the United States of America gave itself a well earned pat on the back. And then the Soviet Union punched America in the face, because on Year 1, Day 16 (January 9th, 1962), the manned flight of \u0027Zond-2\u0027 took place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was kept top secret until two days before it was scheduled to take place, and, instantly, the media was all over the mission, presenting it as \u0027the mission that would put the last nail in the coffin of American space exploration.\u0027 A huge crowd had arrived at Baikerbanur, with the most important people in Soviet Russia turning up to watch the historic launch. The President himself was there, observing the launch from his special seat in the administration building. The \u0027Proton-K\u0027 rocket developed by Vladimir Khelomey was greenlighted for crewed flight in the months following the \u0027Zond-1\u0027 test flight, and the two brave crew members of \u0027Zond-2,\u0027 Valentina Kerman, the pilot, and Bob Kerman, the scientific specialist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt lift-off, a huge plume of smoke and flame engulfed the launch site, sending many Kerbals scattering for shelter, and the launch was broadcast all across Kerbin on national television. The entire mission was to be televised, from the ascent to the flyby, and even the re-entry, to boost the reputation of the USSR and to knock America back a notch in the world of space exploration. The first stage cut-off at 45 kilometres, and, after aligning itself along the correct attitude for orbital injection, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E was jettisoned at 65 kilometres, along with the fairing that concealed the \u0027Zond\u0027 spacecraft, and, after using the first and second stages to complete the orbital injection, the crew underwent the hour of pre-TMI (Trans Munar Injection) checks and tests that were required before the spacecraft departed for its Munar flyby and return mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina Kerman gave an inspiring speech to all of the Kerbals back on kerbin, tuning in on their radios and televisions as her unforgettable words were broadcast across the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Courier New, Courier, monospace\u0022\u003EAll of you on Kerbin, all of you back home... we are about to depart on a historical journey around the Mun... it shall encounter many dangers, many perils -- if only one of the over 1 million components that make up this spacecraft fail, we shall die.

However, when she attempted to exit, the hatch was stuck. No matter what she did to open the hatch, it was firmly closed and not showing any sign of opening, so the EVA was cancelled by mission control, and replaced by an observation study to be conducted using the telescopes, and broadcasted around Kerbin. The spacecraft passed within 15 kilometres of the Mun\u0027s surface, taking photographs, and writing log entries. All of the spacecraft\u0027s systems performed nominally, and, after Loss Of Signal (LOS), the inhabitants of the planet Kerbin eagerly awaited the acquisition of signal that would occur in twenty minutes as the vehicle passed by the far side of the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo the relief of mission control, and everybody else, for that matter, the spacecraft radioed back after its flyby: \u0022Control, come in, control.

To land an American Kerbal on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zo6LLjB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zo6LLjB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first stage of the \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket, called the \u0027J-11,\u0027 consisted of one Jool H-1A engine - the most powerful single-chamber rocket engine ever built, producing over 2000 kiloNewtons of thrust! - along with an ADTP-2-3 adapter, connecting the engine to the enormous 13900 J-1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O tank, the largest fuel tank ever built at the time, using eight clustered \u0027Icarus-Cygnus\u0027 fuel tanks around a \u0027Daedalus-Hercules\u0027 core tank. (Yes, I\u00A0sucked it up and used BDB\u0027s Saturn 1B fuel tank, as it was cheaper than making my own custom clustered fuel tanks; it is a career game, after all, and I was nearly broke at the time!) Connecting it to the second stage was a BDI-0300 interstage fairing and decoupler, with built-in retro motors.\u00A0Construction of the massive \u0027J-11\u0027 first stage was contracted to BDB International, who worked in tandem with Kerbodyne Inc. to manufacture the stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second stage, the \u0027J-111,\u0027 was made of one J-10K cryogenic fuel tank, underneath which, hidden behind the BDI-0300 interstage, was a single Jool H-2S cryogenic engine - an efficient upper stage engine that produced 570 kiloNewtons of thrust to complete the orbital insertion - and, surrounding the rear end of the J-10K cryo fuel tank, were four J-IV ullage motors, for assisting the stage separation during flight. Mounted atop the J-10K fuel tank was a Jool SLA Spacecraft MEM (Munar Excursion Module - the name given to the Munar lander) Adapter. The adapter was designed to conceal the Munar landing module during flight, but it was perfect at storing other payloads as well. Every single component of the \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket was brand new, save the first stage fuel tanks, and specifically designed to serve the goal of landing on the Mun. The development of the \u0027J-111\u0027 second stage was contracted to Kerbodyne Inc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire \u0027Jool-1\u0027 lifter was capable of lifting over 25 tonnes to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, more than the USSR\u0027s current heavy lift vehicle, the \u0027Proton-K,\u0027 and though not capable of launching a mission to the Mun, it would be an important stepping stone in learning how to handle large rockets, as well as having the capacity to test the spacecraft designed to take Kerbals to the Mun without actually going there - by testing all of the systems in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. And, speaking of spacecraft, the rocket was designed to launch an \u0027Artemis\u00A0CSM (Command/Service Module),\u0027 a new spacecraft, with a capacity for four kerbonauts, as well as two weeks worth of life support supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe service module, which contained the propulsion and life support systems, along with the electronics, communications, and tankage, consisted of an AJ10-137 engine, a small, low-thrust engine specialised for vacuum flight, along with an \u0027Artemis\u0027 Block-1 service module, which was a small fuel tank. The tank also had two small shelves, hidden behind service module doors, which contained the batteries, antennae, and scientific instrumentation such as magnetometers, SC-9001 scientific instrument bays (Pirated from a Soviet spacecraft that failed to reach orbit and splashed down in US waters, kept top secret by both governments), film cameras, micrometeoroid detectors, ion traps, thermometers, barometers, solar experiment packages, geiger counters, and seismic accelerometers. The capsule itself was a new product developed by LeBeau Space Industries, trying to\u00A0get on NASA\u0027s good side after not being able to supply them with a capsule for their \u0027Daedalus\u0027 program, and was called the Kappa NK-V Serie SX. It included a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E, and, after a thorough inspection by NASA officials, development of the \u0027Artemis\u0027 CSM was contracted to LeBeau Space Industries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, on Year 1, Day 18 (August 4th, 1962), the \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket was rolled out on the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) crawler platform, onto\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s Launchpad-1A, and prepped for launch. The cargo that the \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket could carry inside the Jool SLA Spacecraft MEM Adapter would vary from mission to mission, but for this particular one, named \u0027Artemis-1,\u0027 it would be carrying a Mission Module (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E), which was simply a large, cylindrical, pressurised container, which could hold supplies and equipment, with enough supplies (If it was full) to last a two-month long mission. The \u0027Artemis-1\u0027 mission was the first manned launch of the \u0027Artemis CSM\u0027 spacecraft and the \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket after a long series of extensive unmanned test launches and flights. The crew consisted of one lone kerbonaut, Jebediah Kerman, who was to stay in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E for three days, testing the various safety equipment aboard the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zKfmTIq.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zKfmTIq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was viewed by millions of spectators worldwide, and was pinned as \u0027the mission that would put America back in the lead of the Russians.\u0027 The huge H-1A engine created a plume of smoke and flame that engulfed the entirety of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, with the clothes of everyone within five miles smelling like smoke and kerosene for days afterwards.

The \u0027Artemis\u0027 CSM had plenty of time to complete the transposition and docking maneuver it needed to complete, which entailed opening the SLA Spacecraft Adapter, decoupling the CSM, which would yaw 180 degrees until its nose was facing the docking port on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E (Mission Module), where it would use a short burst of its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to propel\u00A0it forward into a docking with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E.

After the failure of the first N-1 launch on Year 1, Day 12 (April 16th, 1961), the Russian government weren\u0027t taking any chances with their newly-rebuilt launch site, so they decided to postpone the second N-1 test launch until further notice, and launch other projects in case of another explosion at Baikerbanur. As Sergei Kerbolyov and Vladimir Khelomey were in fierce competition for their respective programs to be pursued at the time, they were both prone to a bit of plagiarism. Khelomey had proposed a series of manned space stations using his OPS (Orbital Piloted Station) cores, designated \u0027Almaz,\u0027 to perform top-secret military reconnaissance over certain areas of Kerbin. However, while Khelomey had caught the attention of the Russian government, Kerbolyov immediately found the blueprints to the OPS station cores, equipped them with technology and systems from his in-development \u0027Soyuz\u0027 spacecraft, and dubbed the station DOS (Durable Orbital Station).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Soviet space program reviewed both proposals, and deduced that both stations were viable programs to be pursued in the near future. Both Kerbolyov\u0027s and Khelomey\u0027s design bureau set to work, manufacturing the necessary components to construct the stations. Kerbolyov\u0027s DOS station was completed first, and, after development of the \u0027Soyuz\u0027 spacecraft, the Soviet Union\u0027s answer to the American \u0027Daedalus\u0027 spacecraft, capable of orbital rendezvous and docking, was complete, the station, named \u0027Salyut-1,\u0027 was mounted atop its \u0027Proton-K\u0027 lifter rocket and rolled out onto Launchpad-P at Baikerbanur Cosmodrome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J2EK12Y.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J2EK12Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch of \u0027Salyut-1\u0027 wasn\u0027t as popular among the media as the previous launches, and attendance was mediocre at best. The huge \u0027Proton-K\u0027 rocket blasted off the pad, the smoke and flame from its six LVT-270 engines was directed through enormous ducts, away from the launch site, billowing from huge openings in the concrete structure that Baikerbanur cosmodrome was based on. After an uneventful launch, with the first stage cutting-off at 45 kilometres, re-igniting at 75 kilometres altitude to begin the orbital injection. The second stage completes the orbital injection and is jettisoned, with the \u0027Salyut-1\u0027 space station now in an 80 kilometres by 79\u00A0kilometres stable orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost immediately, on Launchpad-K, a new rocket was being prepped for launch. It was a modification of the trusty \u0027R-7 Semyorka\u0027 that had launched the first Kerbals into space during the \u0027Vostok\u0027 program. This modification was simple; it replaced the four MGU27A strap-on LRBs with four LVT-45 engines, four FLT-800 fuel tanks, and four ANC-Type B nose cones - named the FVA-B LRBs - other than the change to the boosters, the engine of the first core stage, a BPT-180 engine, was also replaced by an LVT-45 - other than that, the rocket remained unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts crew, Valentina and Erillian Kerman, strapped themselves into the brand-new \u0027Soyuz\u0027 ascent and descent module, and the rocket was rolled out onto the pad on the crawler platform. The rocket lifted-off as the \u0027Salyut-1 space station passed overhead, as the mission planners for \u0027Soyuz-1\u0027 were confident that their craft could launch directly into a rendezvous. The new rocket, christened the \u0027Soyuz-FG,\u0027 shot upwards on a pillar of flame and smoke as the five LVT-45 engines burned away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four strap-on FVA-B LRBs were jettisoned at 40 kilometres, and the first core stage cut-off at 47 kilometres, with the rocket coasting to Apoapsis. The fairings and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E were staged away at 60 kilometres, and the first core stage re-ignited at 75 kilometres, with thirty seconds to Apoapsis, and was separated when it ran out of fuel, with half of the orbital injection complete.

Back underneath the T-N7R crew capsule was an LP-71H stack decoupler, which separated the ascent/descent module from the service/propulsion module. The service module itself consisted of a T-47Z orbital maneuvering engine, which came equipped with four TR-C monopropellant \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and two radial T-RYD solar panels, which had built-in antennae.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Soyuz-2\u0027 spacecraft rendezvoused with the \u0027Salyut-1\u0027 space station shortly after launch, achieving soft-docking (When the active docking probe of the T-4GZ port slides into the indentation of the passive T-PR9 docking port, but hasn\u0027t latched together) at MET twenty-one minutes, and hard-docking (When the two docking ports have latched together) was achieved at MET twenty-four minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA photograph of the station, with the \u0027Soyuz-2\u0027 spacecraft docked to the station in the middle-left area of the image, and the station in the middle-right area:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222Qj1Aj4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Qj1Aj4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the success of the \u0027Salyut-1\u0027 launch and the \u0027Soyuz-2\u0027 mission, the Soviet Union was ploughing ahead in the world of space exploration, with multiple jewels in their crown. They had put the first Kerbal in space, performed the first Munar flyby, launched the first artificial objects to Munar and Minmus orbits, and had now launched the world\u0027s first space station. The crew of the station had already set a space endurance record of two weeks when the United States decided they should do something about this new Soviet triumph - and that something was also launching a space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe development of the \u0027Skylab\u0027 space station was rushed since the beginning, with Congress and the Kermanndy Administration yearning for a station to be launched as soon as possible - and, while all the professional designers and rocket scientists were arguing amongst themselves, a bright intern at the R\u0026amp;D department at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E suggested: \u0022We already have Jeb up there in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, testing out the safety equipment for the \u0027Artemis\u0027 program - why not just keep his ship up there and expand it?

The idea came to fruition on Year 1, Day 21 (January 3rd, 1963), with the launch of \u0027Skylab-2\u0027 - the original \u0027Artemis\u0027 mission that had launched Jebediah Kerman into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to test equipment had been renamed \u0027Skylab-1.\u0027 The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E that was housed inside the SLA Spacecraft Adapter was replaced by a new module, the Experiment Logistics Module (ELM), which was a fully-equipped laboratory, with an androgynous docking port at each end, nicknamed \u0027Clamp-O-Tron\u0027 docking ports. However, the docking port\u0027s real name was the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECOT\u003C/abbr\u003E-125M. But everybody just called it the \u0027Clamp-O-Tron.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket sat on Launchpad-1A, with the umbilical clamps feeding the bipropellant fuels into the \u0027J-11\u0027 first stage and cryogenic fuels into the \u0027J-111\u0027 upper stage. At T-minus zero seconds to launch, the four, huge launch clamps that were holding the massive rocket down during the ignition sequence released their grip, folding up into their cowlings so as to be protected from the fiery exhaust from the massive H-1A first stage engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GlxrJYh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GlxrJYh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe massive \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket blasted off the pad in a cloud of smoke and flame, the roar of its single H-1A engine heard for miles around. The first stage cut-off at 35 kilometres, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E tower being jettisoned at 60 kilometres, and the orbital injection beginning with the first \u0027J-11\u0027 stage at 83 kilometres altitude. The first stage was separated with more than half of the injection burn complete, and the single H-2S cryogenic engine of the \u0027J-111\u0027 upper stage completed the maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the launch complete, the SLA Spacecraft Adapter slowly opened, revealing the ELM within it, the \u0027Artemis\u0027 CSM decoupling from the adapter and spinning around to face the ELM\u0027s frontal docking port using its monopropellant \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. With another short burst from the thrusters, the CSM connected to the ELM\u0027s docking port, and both the spacecraft decouled from the adapter, and\u00A0with the help of the CSM\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, slid silently away from the derelict \u0027J-111\u0027 cryogenic upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two crew members of \u0027Skylab-2\u0027 were Wehrus and Jenlyn, who would dock with \u0027Skylab\u0027 and spend over one month there, testing the endurance levels of Kerbals in space. Jeb, on the other hand, after completing the tests of the safety equipment, which would last another twelve hours, would de-orbit in his \u0027Artemis\u0027 CSM, while the \u0027Skylab-2\u0027 CSM would stay behind at the station. The rendezvous was completed perfectly, with the new navigation equipment performing nominally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the spacecraft came around to dock, however, a problem arose. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters were not responding to the controls. (I had run out of monopropellant during the rendezvous) And so, instead of aborting, as would be normal procedure in this kind of situation, Jebediah Kerman was confident that this fancy new autopilot feature called \u0027Target\u0027 and \u0027Anti-Target\u0027 could orient the two craft so that their docking ports could face each other, requiring only a short burst from the \u0027Skylab-2\u0027 CSM\u0027s main engine to propel\u00A0the crafts toward each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, with this daring maneuver completed, the two crew of \u0027Skylab-2\u0027 powered down the Artemis CSM Main Engine (ACME) and entered the \u0027Skylab\u0027 space station.

(March 18th, 1963)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the beginning of 1960\u0027s, NASA was in its boom years. Huge amounts of funding was being directed their way by both the government, and private companies. The \u0027Artemis\u0027 program was proceeding smoothly. The first \u0027Jool-1B\u0027 rockets, to launch the first men to the Mun, were almost complete. And so, NASA decided to ask a question it had never asked itself before. How do we lower the cost of space travel? How do we make launches to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E refund almost as much as it costs to launch them in the first place? And though NASA was hardly strapped for cash, developing a reusable launch system would save more funds to be directed to other projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, Wernher Von Kerman proposed his idea for a reusable launch system to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with the STS; The \u0027Space Transportation System.\u0027 It would utilize a small shuttle, capable of carrying 6 crew to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, dubbed the \u0027X-20,\u0027 and a large carrier rocket plane, which would take off vertically, and lift the shuttle to an altitude of 90 kilometres, where the \u0027X-20\u0027 would separate, and the carrier rocket plane would re-enter, and land at a different site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe the design for this carrier rocket plane was soon finalized in the coming months, and, finally, the contract to build and test it fell on the United States Air Force\u0027s doorstep. Well, not entirely. The rocket plane was developed under a joint USAF-NASA project. But it was the Air Force doing most of the work, with NASA just pulling the strings. Original plans for the carrier rocket plane had not actually utilized a rocket plane at all - rather, they would have utilized a high-altitude variant of the \u0027B-52 Stratofortress\u0027 bomber, named the \u0027B-52A.\u0027 However, when the \u0027JX-4\u0027 hypersonic turbo-ramjets were unavailable, NASA decided a different approach was needed - one that utilized a heavily modified \u0027B-52\u0027 that would launch vertically, with 5 immensely powerful rocket engines strapped to the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis new design utilized 5 WPT-x1200 liquid-fuelled rocket engines, attached to an MK3-3M engine mount. The rocket plane also featured 2 auxilliary J-404 afterburning turbofan engines for atmospheric flight, after deploying the \u0027X-20\u0027 shuttle at the required altitude. The entire carrier rocket plane would be capable of carrying over 6 kilo-litres of liquid kerosene and 8 kilo-litres of liquid oxygen. In total, that was 110 metric tons of rocket fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe modification and construction of this rocket plane variant of the \u0027B-52\u0027 took just over a month, and the first rocket carrier plane, called the \u0027B-57A,\u0027 was prepped and ready for launch at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RsaR9HS.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RsaR9HS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft itself, as it was to be reused many times, was named the \u0027Yeager J\u00E4ger.\u0027 Its one and only pilot, the brave Wehrnand Kerman, brother of Wernher Von Kerman, and legendary US Air Force test pilot, sat in the pilot\u0027s seat of the \u0027B-52\u0027 cockpit, the only component of the \u0027B-52\u0027 that the \u0027B-57A\u0027 rocket plane retained. Thousands of Kerbals flocked to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, reporters and families alike. The press swarmed around this launch like bees around honey, pinning it \u0027the easy way to space,\u0027 and \u0027the cheapest and safest way around the world.\u0027 In fact, one Kerbal, Walt Kerman, the head of public relations at NASA, proposed that the \u0027B-57A\u0027 and \u0027X-20\u0027 rocket planes be used as ultra-fast travel around Kerbin. After all, you could orbit the whole of kerbin in just 20 minutes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was broadcasted around the world as the \u0027Yeager J\u00E4ger\u0027 blasted off the pad in an enormous cloud of smoke. Plumes of flame trailed from the craft\u0027s 5 WPT-x1200 engines as it rocketed towards the heavens. The huge rocket plane continued its ascent upwards, before cutting off its engine at 45 kilometres altitude. The \u0027B-57A\u0027 coasted to Apoapsis, until, at 30 seconds to Apoapsis, it re-ignited its engines, increasing its horizontal velocity by over 1 kilometre per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWehrnand oriented the aircraft along the correct attitude for re-entry, 15 degrees above the horizon. As the flames lapped over the wings and nose of the craft, the vertical speed gauge displayed that the aircraft\u0027s vertical velocity was slowing... and then it started to ascend again. The craft had skipped off of the atmosphere! This was the first recorded act of doing so in Kerbal history, and Wehrnand Kerman was, following recovery, paraded around New York City, and celebrated as \u0027another great American hero.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft re-entered again, albeit with much less flames than the first one, and glided towards the nearest available land mass - Kermuda Island. It had been abandoned for years. As legend has it, an old airfield was once located there during the Great War, but there is no evidence to support this. (If I ever get into modding, I might use KK and put a small runway there for \u0027B-57A\u0027 landings) Wehrnand ignited the auxilliary J-404 jet engines, and flew\u00A0towards the island. As the altimeter reached 1 kilometre, he extended the landing gear. The land approached quickly, and at 500 metres above sea level, he deployed the airbrakes. The two rear rear wheels touched down first, and the drogue parachutes unfurled from the rear of the aircraft. The frontal wheel made contact with\u00A0the ground mere\u00A0seconds later, and the aircraft slowed to a halt after 12 minutes of flight, reaching a maximum altitude of\u00A091 kilometres, and landing over 400 kilometres downrange of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GPwOway.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GPwOway.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSA successfully launched \u0027Yeager J\u00E4ger\u0027 \u0027B-57A\u0027 reusable rocket plane - first ever atmospheric skip - Year 1, Day 29 (March 18th, 1963)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-07T21:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2017 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NISSKEPCSIM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NISSKEPCSIM","CreatedById":173812,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-07T20:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPost 6 - May 7th, 2017\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis update shall focus solely on the USAF\u0027s manned\u00A0space missions, and these missions were performed for no real reason other than to show off the array of other launchers that may or may not appear later in my career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the \u0027Artemis\u0027 program proceeding smoothly, the United States Air Force only saw fit to launch its own space missions. It had yet to redeem itself for the \u0027Voyager 1\u0027 launch failure, and, with the success of manned spaceflight for NASA, the US Air Force decided that it was time to put its own men into space, to perform \u0022scientific research.\u0022 Specifically, this \u0022research\u0022 was conducted in the airspace above the USSR, which was a 7-minute window appearing every 18 minutes during a regular low Kerbin orbit flight. Basically, the USAF wanted to launch manned spy satellites to point powerful telescopes and cameras at Soviet Russia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few months of planning, designing, and arguments among the US Air Force\u0027s rocket designers, the blueprints for the \u0027Moho\u0027 spacecraft were finally settled upon. Every single component of the \u0027Moho\u0027 spacecraft was custom-built by the Bloeting Aerospace Corporation, after BDB International declined the contract for construction of the parts due to an overflow of contacts from NASA for the bulk buy of every single component of the \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spacecraft consisted of a \u0027Moho\u0027 capsule, a \u0027Moho\u0027 retrofire pack for the de-orbit burn, a \u0027Moho\u0027 heat shield, an RW-50 EVA tether, a \u0027Moho\u0027 landing and control module, just a glorified parachute with built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and a \u0027Moho\u0027 science and antenna unit, which contained the telescopes and cameras to be used for the orbital reconnaissance. Mounted to the top of the capsule was a small launch escape system from Home-Grown-Rockets Ltd, surplus from the bulk order of 20 launch escape systems during the \u0027Daedalus\u0027 program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother \u0027Eagle\u0027 rocket was plucked from the seemingly bottomless pile of ICBMs, and the \u0027Moho\u0027 spacecraft was mated to the top of the booster. Wehrnand Kerman, after returning from his \u0027B-57A\u0027 test flight, was the ideal candidate for this mission - he was, after all, an Air Force test pilot, and not a NASA kerbonaut - which meant that he could keep his mouth shut. And, alas, on Year 1, Day 34 (May 7th, 1963), the \u0027Moho-Eagle-1\u0027 rocket was prepped and\u00A0rolled out onto the launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I installed the Historian mod on Friday - the \u0027B-57A\u0027 flight above was performed last week, and these missions were all completed on 2 days ago)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022V6D55YI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V6D55YI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Eagle\u0027 rocket blasted off the pad, its 2 XLR-89-5 and single XLR-105-5 engines spewing globules of fire and smoke as the tiny spacecraft ascended towards the far reaches of space. The \u0027Eagle\u0027 ICBM had an interesting design - it ascended using three engines - the 2 outer ones were designed for atmospheric flight, whereas the single central one was designed for vacuum operations. The 2 outer engines would be jettisoned at 20 kilometres altitude, where their thrust was so low, the atmosphere so thin, that they simply became dead weight. The 1 XLR-105-5 sustainer\u00A0engine would continue the flight towards orbit, and complete the orbital insertion with 100 litres of extra fuel remaining. The \u0027Moho\u0027 spacecraft would separate, and four retro-rockets would lower the \u0027Eagle\u0027 rocket\u0027s Periapsis into\u00A0the atmosphere, where it would harmlessly burn up. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E would be jettisoned during vertical the ascent, at an altitude of 45 kilometres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 \u0027Moho\u0027 flights were conducted, both crewed by Wehrnand Kerman, the US Air Force\u0027s one and only pilot capable of spaceflight. At least, until more USAF pilots were enlisted into the kerbonaut training program. The \u0027Moho\u0027 program was cancelled after 2 flights in favour of the more advanced, rendezvous-and-docking capable \u0027Gemini\u0027 spacecraft, which was capable of carrying heavier reconnaissance equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tw0foep.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tw0foep.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe successor to the \u0027Moho\u0027 program, the \u0027Gemini\u0027 program utilized existing hardware and technology to launch brand-new military spacecraft. To be launched using the tried-and-tested \u0027Hercules M-24\u0027 lifter rocket, the \u0027Gemini\u0027 spacecraft consisted of an M-63E capsule, M-68V \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, an M-7RC landing parachute, a C-16 antenna, an M-C32 nose docking mechanism, and, mounted to the rear of the capsule, there was a 1.5 metre diameter heat shield, a TR-15 stack decoupler to separate the capsule and assorted systems from the service module, which was constructed from a pre-fabricated M-O7N fuel tank, two PIO-1 solar panels, another RW-50 EVA tether, and a 48-7S orbital maneuvering engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe contract to construct and test this new spacecraft was awarded to TRAILS Manufacturing Ltd, and, after only a month, on Year 1, Day 40 (July 21st, 1963), after 9 unmanned\u00A0test flights, \u0027Gemini-10\u0027 was ready to be launched, sitting atop a brand-new \u0027Hercules M-24\u0027 rocket at Vandenberg Air Force base.

What\u0027s bad is that that station has an arsenal of twenty-four\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMIRV\u003C/em\u003Es. That stands for Multiple Independently Targetable Re-Entry Vehicles. Basically, the Air Force have put up a station that has nukes on it. And they can be launched at the press of a button.

This treaty, signed by the USSR, the US, an assortment of European countries, and China, states that, and I quote, \u0027The weaponization of space, the Mun, Minmus, or other celestial bodies by one\u00A0nation for gaining a strategic military advantage over any other\u00A0nation is strictly prohibited, under all circumstances, as an expansion of the \u0027Space Liability\u0027 treaty of 1958.\u0027 Which means that we broke an international treaty. In secret. And if this secret goes public, which it inevitably will, NASA will be the first to take the blame, with immense repercussions for the entire country!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kraken...\u0022 sighed Jebediah. \u0022So, what do you expect us to do. Go up there and catch it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene smirked. \u0022As a matter-of-fact, yes. Remember that old \u0027ROTV\u0027 concept that Wernher came up with a few years ago, back during the inception of the \u0027Jool\u0027 rocket program?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah...\u0022 replied Bill. \u0022It was where he planned to just strap\u00A0some landing legs, a radial crew cabin, and a whole load of parachutes to a \u0027J-111\u0027 stage, which could make orbit on its own, barely, and use it as a reusable spacecraft, which could perform \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKo\u003C/abbr\u003E missions, de-orbit, and land. It could even, with some modifications, carry a light payload, am I correct?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Spot on. But Wernher didn\u0027t think launching a payload from it was very efficient. Wernher\u0027s dream was to have the \u0027ROTV,\u0027 an acronym for Re-usable Orbital Test Vehicle, recover debris and de-commisioned satellites from Low Kerbin Orbit. Of course, Wernher never considered using it for... unsanctioned theft of US Air Force property.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hang on a moment,\u0022 interrupted Jeb. \u0022We\u0027re\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estealing\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ea USAF station from orbit, without permission, in complete secret, and if we fail, the United States get caught breaking an international treaty - just the plot of your average \u0027Special Agent Kirrim\u0027 film, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 He smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But seriously, guys - this is basically\u00A0space piracy. We\u0027re going to illegally steal a USAF spacecraft, in secret, and return it to Kerbin. If we fail, we could be court-martialled. Or worse...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene waited, thinking that the two kerbonauts would decline.

It was scheduled to be launched today anyway, just later in the evening. How are we supposed to cover it up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, the \u0027ROTV-1\u0027 launch was supposed to be a test flight - so our cover story is going to be exactly that - the first crewed test flight of a brand-new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E spacecraft. And the USAF are hardly going to report us for capturing their space station - they are breaking an international treaty, after all.\u0022 Gene smirked once again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay then,\u0022 added Jeb after a long pause. \u0022Let\u0027s light this candle and get up there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r8FeBOD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r8FeBOD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real story: I had launched the USAF \u0027MORL\u0027 space station, which was planned to feature in Post #6 - but I decided to leave it out of the final update, as, quite frankly, it was useless - I didn\u0027t need another station. But I didn\u0027t just want to terminate it from the tracking station either - so I decided to launch a recovery mission - but realised that there was no way I could come up with a sane plot point for why NASA would just steal an Air Force space station - until now.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket gracefully lifted off the pad atop a plume of flame, with a cloud of smoke shrouding the lower segment of the rocket. The Jool H-1A engine spewed a trail of orange-red flame as it climbed higher and higher, approaching the edge of the atmosphere; the beginning of space. The first stage cut-off and was separated at 40 kilometres altitude, and the H-2S engine of the \u0027J-111\u0027 \u0027Jool-1\u0027 rocket upper stage ignited at 75 kilometres altitude to complete the orbital insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe H-2S engine was shut-down shortly after completing the orbital insertion, and the four radial \u0027BID-132\u0027 Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines ignited, completing the small burn required to set the \u0027ROTV-1\u0027 spacecraft on its rendezvous trajectory towards the United States Air Force \u0027MORL\u0027 space station.

These ballutes were a combination of balloons and parachutes - a donut-shaped, toroidal\u00A0balloon, which had a heat-shielded bottom, and was activated by helium gas inflating it during deployment. These ballutes could be deployed at much higher altitudes that regular parachutes, and could be deployed at hypersonic speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary ballute of the \u0027ROTV\u0027 deployed at an altitude of 45 kilometres, and the secondary drogue parachutes were deployed at 20 kilometres.

The extension tunnel, designed to give the STS \u0027X-20\u0027 shuttle enough clearance to dock with \u0027Skylab\u0027 when the time comes, was manufactured by the C7 Aerospace Division, and so was the 6-way docking hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe huge rocket rose into the heavens atop a pillar of flame and smoke.

Its payload was unlike any other that came before it, a small, autonomous spacecraft, filled to the brim with various scientific experiments. The one thing that set this spacecraft apart from any other? The fact that all of the experiments were designed by high-school (Secondary-school) students - And it all started with a program called the \u0027PRI.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe \u0027PRI,\u0027 which stood for Public Relations Initiative, was a program started by NASA only five months before, which challenged high-school students across America to create their own experiments to be performed in space. Entries were then received by post, and then studied by computers and scientists, who ranked these experiments into a top 200\u00A0- the top 200 would make it onto an unmanned science spacecraft, which would carry 25 experiments per flight. Such a spacecraft would need to have parachutes and a heat shield, so that it could safely land with the science results intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nExperiments that were cleared for allowance into the top 200 included items like the studies of plant growth while in zero-G, and the examination of simple creatures like insects and guinea pigs, and how they would be affected by long periods of time in space. However, a new spacecraft had to be designed to carry these experiments, and, though some had suggested the use of an \u0027ATV,\u0027 this was impossible, as the \u0027ATV\u0027 autonomous spacecraft was not equipped with a heat shield or parachutes - or a storage unit for scientific experiments, for that matter.

So the USSR decided it was time to launch an expansion module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nHowever, there was a problem. The DOS \u0027Salyut\u0027 space station cores were never designed to receive expansions - they only had small sized docking ports, compatible with the original \u0027Soyuz\u0027 spacecraft. But the Soviet government had recently ordered a redesign, which swapped out the small-sized docking port on the \u0027Soyuz\u0027 spacecraft, and replaced it with a medium-sized docking port - one which would be used both by the next generation of \u0027Soyuz\u0027 spacecraft, known as the \u0027Soyuz-T,\u0027 and those modules of space stations which were designed for expansion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nWhich meant that, if the Soviet space program wanted to launch an extension module, all of the docking ports on it would be the medium-size non-androgynous passive docking ports, to allow for extension - except one, which would have to be a small-size non-androgynous active docking probe, as use on the original \u0027Soyuz\u0027 spacecraft to dock with \u0027Salyut-1.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nSo this new module was designed, and designated DOS-2-O. The 2 signified that it was the second variant of the DOS space station module, and the O stood for Core (Russian = \u041E\u0441\u043D\u043E\u0432\u0430 / Osnova, meaning \u0027Core\u0027), signifying that it was designed to be the core module, with a 6-way docking hub mounted to the front, and enough living space to sustain a crew of 4 for at least 1 year. Such a module would have to have enough life support, power generators, and crew capacity to sustain such a large number of kerbonauts, and would also require a thermal control system, and storage for nitrogen monopropellant, as fuel for the small maneuvering thrusters onboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe module itself was given a name before launch - \u0027Zemlya,\u0027 Russian: \u0417\u0435\u043C\u043B\u044F, meaning Kerbin, and also meaning soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nWith construction of the DOS-2-O module complete, the Russian engineers realised that any current launch vehicle in their arsenal would be incapable of launching the payload - so Vladimir Khelomey proposed that, learning\u00A0from his successful \u0027Proton-K\u0027 heavy lift rocket, a new design: The \u0027Proton-FGR.\u0027 FGR stood for Functional Cargo Rocket (Russian: \u0424\u0443\u043D\u043A\u0446\u0438\u043E\u043D\u0430\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0430\u044F \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043E\u0432\u0430\u044F \u0440\u0430\u043A\u0435\u0442\u0430), and was a design that took everything successful from the \u0027Proton-K\u0027 rocket, such as the hypergolic Dinitrogen Textroxide and UDMH (Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine) propellants, with their reliability and the ability to be ignited many times, as well as their ability to be stored at room temperature for many years, and incorporated them into a larger, more powerful lifter, with a higher payload capacity to\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThis \u0027Proton-FGR\u0027 design also made upgrades to the\u00A0\u0027Proton-K\u0027 lifter. Rather than using an inefficient core of clustered fuel tanks, the \u0027FGR\u0027 version instead had one large G-3M UDMH/Nitric Acid engine, and a number, varying from none all the way up to 8, of asparagus-staged hypergolic-fueled boosters, which would drain their fuel into the core stage, and then be jettisoned. Such an improvement would increase the lift capacity from 20 metric tons, up to 35 metric tons. This new version would also have a 2.5 metre-diameter core rather than the old 1.875 metre-diameter core of the \u0027Proton-K.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WRIDAis.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#3c6994;\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WRIDAis.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WRIDAis.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe contract to build and test the 1st stage, as well as the asparagus boosters, was awarded to Tantares Space Technologies, while the development of the 2nd stage was contracted to Home-Grown-Rockets Ltd. After much designing and planning, the variant of the \u0027Proton-FGR\u0027 rocket that would haul the \u0027Zemlya\u0027 DOS-2-O station module was finally selected; The \u0027Proton-FGR-26.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe first number, in this case 2, corresponded to the number of core stages the rocket was made out of, and the second number, in this case 6, corresponded to the number of strap-on asparagus-staged boosters. And so, after construction was complete on Year 1, Day 59 (February 23rd, 1964), the DOS-2-O space station module was mounted to its \u0027Proton\u0027 lifter rocket, and the \u0027Proton-FGR-26\u0027 was rolled out onto Launchpad-P via train, where it was righted to vertical position using crane, and the launch gantries rose into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nAt zero hour, the entire stack gracefully lifted off the pad on a pillar of flame and a cloud of smoke as it ascended towards the far reaches of the cosmos. The plume of smoke could be seen from miles away as the rocket roared upwards through the clouds. The 6 asparagus boosters were staged away at an altitude of 25 kilometres, and the main G-3M engine cut-off at an altitude of 40 kilometres. The entire rocket coasted to Apoapsis, aligning itself along the correct heading to perform the orbital insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\nThe G-3M main engine re-ignited with ease due to its use of hypergolic propellants, giving the DOS-2-O space station module a much-needed boost in getting to orbit, before its fuels were depleted, and it was jettisoned.

The DOD wanted the \u0027X-20\u0027 shuttle to be capable of launching tiny orbital reconnaissance satellites from a small cargo bay onboard, and the Air Force wanted a smaller, lighter, and cheaper alternative for their 2-man \u0027Gemini\u0027 spacecraft, one of only two spacecraft the Air Force could use for manned reconnaissance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, thanks to the interference of the USAF and the DOD, the \u0027X-20\u0027 shuttle devolved from a \u0027B-57A\u0027-launched, 6-crew spaceplane for civilian \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E operations, to a rocket-launched, 3-man spaceplane for both civilian space exploration and military reconnaissance (And even, as some government officials had suggested, to capture enemy spy satellites and disable them). Though the first \u0027B-57A\u0027 test flight managed to get the go-ahead on Year 1, Day 29 (March 18th, 1963), the rocket carrier aircraft was not necessary to the advancement and launch of the devolved \u0027X-20\u0027 shuttle. And so, the \u0027Yeager J\u00E4ger\u0027 rocket plane was retired to a hanger at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on Year 1, Day 34 (May 7th, 1963), with the future of the \u0027B-57A\u0027 looking bleak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, development of the \u0027X-20\u0027 spaceplane, nicknamed \u0027Dyna-Soar\u0027 (Dynamic-Soarer) by NASA and government officials, continued, with the aerodynamic mockups completing basic drop tests from the undersides of \u0027B-52\u0027 bombers in late 1963, and construction of the first operational \u0027Dyna-Soar\u0027 shuttle completed by May of 1964.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XMGyr4T.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XMGyr4T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, with the drop tests of the \u0027X-20\u0027 and unmanned suborbital flights complete, it was time for the manned suborbital test flights. The first stage of the \u0027Atlas\u0027 rocket, manufactured by the Rockomax-FTP Corporation, was outfitted with enormous wings, to counter the lift of the wings on\u00A0the shuttle orbiter, and was shipped to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E at the Kerbal Space Centre, where a \u0027Dyna-Soar\u0027 spaceplane was mounted atop the booster, and the entire assembly rolled out onto the pad on one of the MLPs (Mobile Launch Platforms).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe huge rocket blasted off the pad atop a pillar of orange flame, a huge cloud of smoke shrouding the launch site as the spaceplane, named \u0027Space Oddity\u0027 by Wehrnand Kerman himself, the brave pilot of this test flight, rose into the heavens.\u00A0The \u0027Space Oddity\u0027 STS shuttle would later go on to inspire Dowie Kerman\u0027s hit song in 1969.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket ascended to a peak altitude of 100 kilometres, where the \u0027Atlas\u0027 booster was jettisoned, leaving the \u0027X-20\u0027 space shuttle all alone, slowly drifting through the colourless vacuum of space, travelling at over 1000 metres per second. The spaceplane oriented itself at a 20 degrees Angle of Attack (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E), which meant that its nose\u00A0was at a 20 degree angle relative to the direction it was travelling in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027Dyna-Soar\u0027 shuttle re-entered the atmosphere at 900 metres per second, just barely enough speed to produce the re-entry plasma that was experienced on orbital flights. Wehrnand Kerman slowly banked the shuttle over, towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and deployed a new piece of technology: The \u0027Rogallo\u0027 parafoil wing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichard \u0027Rob\u0027 Rogallo-Kerman was one of the lead designers for the \u0027Daedalus\u0027 program, where he attempted to integrate an inflatable, deployable paraglider wing, which could be deployed like a parachute from the front of the capsule, and allow the capsule to glide to a landing in a dried-up lake bed or a runway. However, with constant redirecting of funds to other projects, and the various setbacks and failures during testing, he was forced to abandon his concept in favour of conventional parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the US Air Force hired him to be their lead designer for the \u0027Gemini\u0027 program, where he once again attempted to integrate the \u0027Rogallo\u0027 wing into the capsule\u0027s design. However, due to the same problems as he had experienced during the \u0027Daedalus\u0027 program, he was once again forced to abandon the concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then Richard Rogallo-Kerman was invited to work as the chief designer for the \u0027X-20\u0027 \u0027Dyna-Soar\u0027 shuttle program in late 1963, where he instantly shared his \u0027Rogallo\u0027 paraglider wing with his fellow designers on the program, and, through long nights, teamwork, and perseverance, managed to successfully integrate it into the \u0027Dyna-Soar\u0027 glider vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parafoil wing was shaped like a paraglider, and was slowly inflated after deployment. The parafoil acted as a huge wing, providing extra wing surface area, and therefore providing more lift, and more maneuverability. The shuttle ignited its two auxiliary jet engines, designed to assist the vehicle to reach the landing site in case of an over or undershoot, and flew back to the runway at the Kerbal Space Centre, where it performed a successful landing.
