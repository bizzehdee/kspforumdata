The trick is you need to be very precise in your alignment. If your a degree or two off only the first one will connect. Placing 3 on a tri addaptor was the most common configuration I\u0027ve seen in videos. I\u0027v also seen a few other double docked ring shaped stations people have come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
