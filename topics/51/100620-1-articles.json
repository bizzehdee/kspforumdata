But not everybody is trying to set there whole colony!\n\nRealism:\n\nI like making some things quite real and others not that much. So expect unexpected!\n\nMods:\n\nKER, Kerbal Alarm Clock\n\nInspiration:\n\nTo start making this, Long-term Laythe. For Duna itself, who haven\u0027t ever thought about making Duna colony? (I thought of making forum series before Brotoro started Developing Duna.)\n\nPart 1 - Communication (BELOW)\n\nPart 2 - Setting up orbit (1st page)\n\nPart 3 - First payload (1st page)\n\nPart 4 - Duna arrival (1st page)\n\nPart 5 - Duna Communication ([here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111644-Project-Red-Colony-on-Duna-PART-4-%28much-pictures-wow%29?p=1819464\u0026viewfull=1#post1819464))\n\nPart 1 - Communication\n\nShort version for those who only came for images\n\nI have made very precise triangle out of probes for communication reasons.\n\nNormal version\n\nThis is part I will keep real. It contains a lot of science. You have been warned!\n\nTo have full coverage of whole Duna (for communication for example between base and far-away lander) we need to send bunch of sattelites. We need even more of them if we want continuous link between Kerbin and Duna. If we place them on equatorial orbit on high enough orbit, they provide you coverage of whole planet, excluding polar areas. Picture below can give you rough idea on how it works.\n\nStart of boring theories **--\u003C** However even if we have these things covered, there are still problems remaining. If Duna and Kerbin are as closest as they can be, light will take about half a minute to travel this distance. And if they are furtherst they can be? That will take light 2 minutes if you don\u0027t think about fact that in these positions, Kerbol is inbetween them. So live communication is impossible. You have to wait approximately 2 minutes to get your answer (1 minute send message and 1 minute to receive answer). **\u003E--** end of boring theories\n\n![Ju7RXAa.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ju7RXAa.png)\n\nTo make it more clear:\n\n1. Imagine two near (2 km away) objects on flat land. They can communicate easily.\n\n2. Imagine two further (100 km away, which is much more on Duna than on real-life Earth) objects. You can still make direct link between them using really (really) strong antenna, but why, when you can send signal to satellite above you in direct path and that can send signal to second object?\n\n3. Imagine two objects each on another side of Duna. How the hell can these link with each other? Enough explaining, here is image of how do I think it can be solved \u0022easily\u0022\n\n![exFV1Cu.png](http://i.imgur.com/exFV1Cu.png)\n\nOf course, if satellites are to close to surface, straight signal between them will be blocked by Duna itself. You can send for example 12 satellites around planet, which will solve that problem, but that would be far more expensive.\n\nI have started putting 3 of satellites on orbit of Kerbin. I have named them Ion-Comms I and sent them to orbit. They have very simple construction. Probe core, battery, solar panels, antennas, xenon tanks and ion engine. As they are fairly small, lifter was also small. Each has different code name - Ion-Comm Ia, Ion-Comm Ib and Ion-Coom Ic. Here is image of each satellite on launchpad.\n\n![KkB49cK.png](http://i.imgur.com/KkB49cK.png)\n\n![dFUVyAP.png](http://i.imgur.com/dFUVyAP.png)\n\n![wBvzOVC.png](http://i.imgur.com/wBvzOVC.png)\n\nFor first time I actually haven\u0027t used Asparagus (if you don\u0027t count career and science mode until you get fuel pipe), because it wasn\u0027t needed. First, 4 side liquid boosters were used and then after throwing them off, central engine was activated.\n\n![3eRwOhD.png](http://i.imgur.com/3eRwOhD.png)\n\nFirst, I have get my apoapsis to 300 km, periapsis to 80 km and I have launched next probe. I did same thing with third probe. At periapsis, apoapsis was increased up to 800 km, which was final height.\n\n![tx686iN.png](http://i.imgur.com/tx686iN.png)\n\nControlling 3 flights at once was something kind of challenging for me as I haven\u0027t ever controlled even 2 flights at once. In middle of mission, I have installed Kerbal Alarm Clock, which helped me very much. I have done everything how it was planned to do and finally had 3 probes at 800 km ready for synchronizing.\n\n![M4eRMvN.png](http://i.imgur.com/M4eRMvN.png)\n\nMain engines also had their own probe cores, so I could have deorbited them, to not have debris on orbit.\n\n![SOTa8Lr.png](http://i.imgur.com/SOTa8Lr.png)\n\n![AlPNR8W.png](http://i.imgur.com/AlPNR8W.png)\n\nSynchronization was something not-that-easy-as-it-sounds thing to do and I even found those ion engine at lowest throttle very unprecise. It needs high precision to make them orbit synchronous and keep them in desired positions for as long as possible. If one of satellite would have orbit 2 km lower, he would meet other satellite after some time. I have synchronized them not in terms of kilometers, but in terms of meters. At 800 km around Kerbin. Now you may have realized why I found ion engines inprecise. On these images you can barely see (nearly) perfectly synchronized Ion-Comms.\n\n![XB5F7Oa.png](http://i.imgur.com/XB5F7Oa.png)\n\nTo be really precise I have first get each probe at absolutelly stable orbit (~179,979 meters). Then I have counted exact distance of probes from each other in triangle using this formula:\n\n![OPkpDD6.png](http://i.imgur.com/OPkpDD6.png)\n\nit is basically just expression of \u0022a\u0022 from formula for radius of circumscribed circle of an equilateral triangle. It is 2,424 km for my probes. If you would ever need this, remember that R is your orbit height \u002B radius of body you are orbiting.\n\n![FHZiAnV.png](http://i.imgur.com/FHZiAnV.png)\n\nWith my precision it should cover whole Kerbin equator for years, maybe decades.\n\nHere are results of synchronizing (on Y1, D7, 2:19). Also note that pure rotation alters KSP\u0027s orbit calculation a lot here:\n\nIon-Comm Ia\n\nApoapsis - 799,997 m\n\nPeriapsis - 799,956 m\n\nAverage - 799,977 m\n\nDistance to Ib - 2,141,319 m\n\nDistance to Ic - 2,441,922 m\n\nIon-Comm Ib\n\nApoapsis - 200,002 m\n\nPeriapsis - 199,963 m\n\nAverage - 799,983 m\n\nDistance to Ia - 2,141,319 m\n\nDistance to Ic - 2,402,809 m\n\nIon-Comm Ic\n\nApoapsis - 799,985 m\n\nPeriapsis - 799,945 m\n\nAverage - 799,965 m\n\nDistance to Ia - 2,441,922 m\n\nDistance to Ib - 2,402,809 m\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T17:45:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nik333**\n  \nPart 5"},{"CreatedByName":"Wabbit","CreatedById":110502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T18:49:16Z","Content":"Looks promising!

That way they don\u0027t necessarily have to be in precisely the same orbits - they\u0027ll wobble slightly, but always end up back at the triangle vertices. For my comms network I use 4 sats. To ease launching I launched all 4 together in a single rocket. I reached the altitude I wanted, released the first sat, and ciruclarized its orbit - ended up 180 minutes I think. Then, the remaining 3\u002Bdelivery bus I had change their orbit so it was 180\u002B180/4 or 225 minutes.

Station was sent in 2 parts - one with 4 senior docking ports and second one with 4 normal docking ports.\n\nHere you can see journey of first part. Setting first part to orbit is always much easier, because you don\u0027t have to do any rendezvous.\n\nWe have a night start, but I don\u0027t really care, because you don\u0027t have to watch rocket. My is extra stable, so I only watch height, navball and map.\n\n![bWSVK15.png](http://i.imgur.com/bWSVK15.png)\n\nI am really adicted to staging of side boosters.

Nothing legit helped, so I have modified save and bug was gone.\n\n![FoHTOGJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/FoHTOGJ.png)\n\nDesign of station is pretty clear and thus it look (in my opinion) simply great.

Well it\u0027s always better to do one more docking than one more launch. I am pretty sure that in this series you will learn how fanatic about docking am I. I will launch 4 engines right now. 2 with normal port (Engine S) and 2 with senior (Engine L). That\u0027s because smaller payload don\u0027t need senior and heavier payload wobbles with normal (and usually even with senior).\n\nHere is launch of first engine.\n\n![XGSSUGK.png](http://i.imgur.com/XGSSUGK.png)\n\n![QlCKxWW.png](http://i.imgur.com/QlCKxWW.png)\n\nAnother staging.

Presenting 3 Kerbals to you.\n\nIt\u0027s time to get some payload to orbit. I will first do so with unmanned payloads and see how fast can I actually dock engines. Then I will wait about half a year for Duna transfer to release our manned payload. Reason is that being long time in space without gravity may done strange things to you. So I will try to keep Kerbals in weightless environment for as short as possible.\n\nAlso, government told us that Kerbals usually sleep at night and thus night starts are no longer acceptable. They gave us few options: start only when part of sun can be seen on sky of Kerbin from lowest point of Kerbal Space Center (their clear definition of day) OR use rockets that don\u0027t do sound louder than 50 dB OR build 20 km wall around launch-pad OR move KSC to place further than 200 km from all civilian buildings. All of us accepted first option, only Jeb said that building 20 km wall would be super-cool solution. (That means better images for you.)\n\nAnd here is start of first payload - Ion-Comm II pack. Engine should be capable of taking 18 tons (half of orange tank) or more to Duna and still come back to Kerbin orbit (without payload). This payload is only 2 tons so it will be easy to get it there.\n\n![oS2H21r.png](http://i.imgur.com/oS2H21r.png)\n\n![sI0Vwpc.png](http://i.imgur.com/sI0Vwpc.png)\n\nCute little payload...\n\n![TDAfSET.png](http://i.imgur.com/TDAfSET.png)\n\nRendezvous finalizing...\n\n![Te77wTc.png](http://i.imgur.com/Te77wTc.png)\n\n![xu9J4Ql.png](http://i.imgur.com/xu9J4Ql.png)\n\nEngine looks smaller from this angle\n\n![RInlYzl.png](http://i.imgur.com/RInlYzl.png)\n\nI always imagine it does \\*click\\* sound when it docks. I imagine only it does, not sound itself. It sounds silly when I imagine sound itself... Docking = ruined.\n\n![4e5ScsW.png](http://i.imgur.com/4e5ScsW.png)\n\nWhen I wrote Duna colony (or something like that), electric plane came out. I am fascinated by that idea, although I hate when people call ion engine electric engine. I am not sure why. Problem with Duna is that there is atmosphere, but there isn\u0027t enough oxygen for jet engines, but enough atmosphere for wing\u0027s lift to work.\n\nI have started testing my own version and it works very well - even on Kerbin. I have did few test flights on Kerbin. Also, next 3 images spoiles old airport easter egg.\n\n![N94EWCT.png](http://i.imgur.com/N94EWCT.png)\n\n![IIwbxJw.png](http://i.imgur.com/IIwbxJw.png)\n\n![6zRH6vU.png](http://i.imgur.com/6zRH6vU.png)\n\nAfter proper tests, I have decided to do a simulation of flight over Duna. I use simulation software called HyperEdit. I have started simulation on orbit and did deorbiting and everything using ion engine. I know about people who do worse thing with ion. Anyway, it was doing really great in Duna\u0027s atmosphere. If you don\u0027t land in Highlands, everything is ok.\n\n![coui8mL.png](http://i.imgur.com/coui8mL.png)\n\n![evsPNFO.png](http://i.imgur.com/evsPNFO.png)\n\nAnd shadow suddenly appeared! Simulation was broken, I am sure I would land properly with real plane. Landing not pictured here. There wasn\u0027t really landing. If you know what I mean.\n\n![eQe6Jjp.png](http://i.imgur.com/eQe6Jjp.png)\n\n![Tk0h9Do.png](http://i.imgur.com/Tk0h9Do.png)\n\nIt seems like everything is ready and I did no mods after Duna simulation. Launch was a bit awkward, because lift of Ionizer\u0027s (as I named plane) wings was doing control upredictable.\n\n![lWoXncn.png](http://i.imgur.com/lWoXncn.png)\n\n![IX9JfZf.png](http://i.imgur.com/IX9JfZf.png)\n\nFirst 2 stages were enough for taking it to height of Kerbin Station (that\u0027s what engines are docked to), which is about 150 km. It did with everything but Ion-Comms, which ended at 100 km.\n\n![z6DqQpR.png](http://i.imgur.com/z6DqQpR.png)\n\n![49H5aGq.png](http://i.imgur.com/49H5aGq.png)\n\n![vvG0QOD.png](http://i.imgur.com/vvG0QOD.png)\n\nNearly there...\n\n![RtazXKg.png](http://i.imgur.com/RtazXKg.png)\n\n\\*CLICK\\*\n\n![MHUyBoq.png](http://i.imgur.com/MHUyBoq.png)\n\nAfter one quickloading due to bad setup of Alarm Clock, which gave me message about upcoming trasfer, but did not stop maximal warp, I have reached planned takeoff date for manned part of \u0022fleet\u0022. Here goes Habitat Module with 2 Kerbals!\n\n![yMgFYbB.png](http://i.imgur.com/yMgFYbB.png)\n\n![h49QtPV.png](http://i.imgur.com/h49QtPV.png)\n\nAnd next is parabolic Communication Module with one Kerbal on board.\n\n![aH1W1ht.png](http://i.imgur.com/aH1W1ht.png)\n\n![L6Zys53.png](http://i.imgur.com/L6Zys53.png)\n\nNow, it\u0027s time to tell you more about our heroes!\n\n**Malvis Kerman** - pilot\n\nHe is said to be Jeb\u0027s son. He likes crazy things and have all ideas that Jeb had. But he would rather let someone other sit in his dangerous rocket than being in it himself. If you don\u0027t count situations where he is near to crash, he is as good and brave pilot as Jeb used to be before he retired. If you was Kerbal, you would also know him as funder of Duna, inc., which makes delicious Duna and Kwix chocolate bars. And he was also member of second flight to Mun, but first one is more well-known about him. Besides he is one of best pilots, government found it funny to send funder of Duna company to Duna.\n\n**Froely Kerman** - scientist\n\nWhen first samples from Duna came to KSC, they tried many different stone analyzers to get info about them. He is one that said (as a ambitious student): \u0022It looks like sand, so why you don\u0027t use analyzers for sand of Kerbin deserts?\u0022. They have first laught, but then they really realized that they are actually putting dust in stone analyzers and try what Froely said instead. It worked really well and he was soon promoted to \u0022main sand and dust scientist\u0022. This gave him ticket for first ever manned flight heading to Duna.\n\n**Gregald Kerman** - engineer\n\nWhen K-mobile started with covering whole Kerbin with telephone signal, he was main engineer on that project. He have found really cool way to increase that small antenna\u0027s signal strenght 7998-times making it even better than yellow parabole. It has something to do with Kerbcoins mining virus that once infected his computer. He have made sattelites to orbit Kerbin and give happy K-mobile customers strong signal anywhere. Their documentation was so complicated that they rather sent him to space with each probe to activate it than asking him stupid question. Once they fired him after completing probe network, KSC thought that he might be useful for setting up communication with Duna. He accepted after he asked if they will make giantic parabole for him to pilot.\n\nRight, so back to our two modules. I have sent both of them and then rendezvoused them with engines.\n\n![dZc2OXz.png](http://i.imgur.com/dZc2OXz.png)\n\n![KlPTA6O.png](http://i.imgur.com/KlPTA6O.png)\n\n![buMLDL3.png](http://i.imgur.com/buMLDL3.png)\n\nHere comes the Communication Module...\n\n![TaQYXkx.png](http://i.imgur.com/TaQYXkx.png)\n\n![C1GFwEZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/C1GFwEZ.png)\n\nAnd then, it was right time to start Kerbin escape maneuvers.

Yes, I think I got it. Oh! I remember now! I only have to enable autopilot. How could I forget?\n\nMalvis: That\u0027s it! Hear ya later Greg.\n\n![G1D31MP.png](http://i.imgur.com/G1D31MP.png)\n\n![wSR3WIR.png](http://i.imgur.com/wSR3WIR.png)\n\nWith Kerbal Alarm Clock, I have get exact transef window and all I had to do was to do prograde burn with every ship.\n\nIon-Comm pack have autopilot installed and it\u0027s permanently on, so nobody can forgot on pressing blue autopilot button. Only if there was problem, KSC can tell Malvis to control it remotely.\n\n![Gn2v8AB.png](http://i.imgur.com/Gn2v8AB.png)\n\n![LJCc95T.png](http://i.imgur.com/LJCc95T.png)\n\n![lQn7hBX.png](http://i.imgur.com/lQn7hBX.png)\n\n150 days to Duna, I have done some corrections, because it costs much less fuel to do these far from it. In it\u0027s SOI, I will do more precise correction of course...\n\n![5hbQFys.png](http://i.imgur.com/5hbQFys.png)\n\nCorrections aren\u0027t done with full throttle as they usually don\u0027t require more than 10 dV.\n\n![DVsZnYL.png](http://i.imgur.com/DVsZnYL.png)\n\nOf course Ike, I don\u0027t mind you going in my way and making preparation for aerobraking harder, it\u0027s totally ok!\n\n![WqOlLX0.png](http://i.imgur.com/WqOlLX0.png)\n\nGregald is first ever Kerbal to see Duna from this distance. His voice was in live broadcast, which at least half of Kerbin was watching. He only said \u0022Wow\u0022 twice and \u0022Cool\u0022 once.\n\n![rpbqXOh.png](http://i.imgur.com/rpbqXOh.png)\n\nFew hours later, he have said that in night, Duna looks similar to Kerbin without lights. It is still considered as counterpart to our space Armstrong\u0027s quote about small steps.\n\n![qchjqZn.png](http://i.imgur.com/qchjqZn.png)\n\n![lh8T0Ag.png](http://i.imgur.com/lh8T0Ag.png)\n\nHere comes Ionizer. It is also controlled by autopilot.\n\n![nR8uAfb.png](http://i.imgur.com/nR8uAfb.png)\n\n![VYq3DGb.png](http://i.imgur.com/VYq3DGb.png)\n\nScientists on Kerbin are not actually 100% sure what is Duna gravity like. They especially weren\u0027t sure if it would affect aerobraking.\n\nKSC: Malvis. We need you to turn Ionizer\u0027s wings into vertical position. Confirm that.\n\nMalvis: Turning Ionizer\u0027s wings into horizontal position.\n\nKSC: Malvis! Turn Ionizer\u0027s wings into vertical position! Confirm.\n\nMalvis: Vertical position, sorry for that.\n\nAnd so Ionizer\u0027s wings did strange turnings before entering Duna\u0027s atmosphere. But after all, everything was alright and it was set to 102 km circular orbit.\n\n![RQZ8WHA.png](http://i.imgur.com/RQZ8WHA.png)\n\nKSC was very angry when their calculations showed that Habitat module will get into Ike\u0027s SOI for some time. But Froely as scientist looked like he will jump out and EVA to take some samples.\n\nMalvis: I don\u0027t think that is most clever thing, you now.\n\nFroely: Yes, I think it is not.\n\nMalvis: You was only kidding, weren\u0027t you.\n\nFroely: Of course. Malvis, I must get there once.\n\nMalvis: Well it is pretty near to our future home, so just tell KSC later. I don\u0027t see reason for being so excited about it. It looks even more boring than Mun.\n\n![r7fP4fd.png](http://i.imgur.com/r7fP4fd.png)\n\nAnd here are orbits of 3 vessels (if you look carefully, it does not look like 2 orbits as there are 3 vessels orbiting).\n\nIn next part, we will get Ion-Comms into 800 km high triangle to give our Dunians continuous link with KSC. And their families of course.\n\nIf you liked, tell me. It really motivates me to continue when I hear (read) nice word!"},{"CreatedByName":"Nik333","CreatedById":138436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:25:20Z","Content":"First of all, if you like this series, please tell me (\u002Brep, pm, reply to thread...). I am starting to feel like posting it here for myself...\n\nPart 5 - Duna Communication\n\n**TL;DR version:** Setting up communications around Duna. Synchronizing Ion-Comm IIs at 800,000 metres.\n\nLast time, you have seen getting 3 payloads to Duna\u0027s orbit. Last payload is remaining. It is Ion-Comm II pack, which is pack of 3 communication sattelites powered by Ion engine. I won\u0027t explain everything again, because I am pretty much doing same thing, which I did in part 1.\n\n![XvWb7mY.png](http://i.imgur.com/XvWb7mY.png)\n\nThis is pack itself with Engine S, before Duna aerobraking. Catched awesome moment of Duna-Ike conjunction.\n\n![scmeMLS.png](http://i.imgur.com/scmeMLS.png)\n\nCircularization in progess. As in part 1, orbit will be on 800 km, however it will need less often corrections. That\u0027s because Duna is smaller it is less likely that it will block signal. Got it?\n\n![2HPBpxj.png](http://i.imgur.com/2HPBpxj.png)\n\nCirculized at 800 km. It is not perfect circle, because with this precision, rotation of reaction-wheeled ship is enough to change orbit. And there are more strange factors like this.\n\n![IJEZTyu.png](http://i.imgur.com/IJEZTyu.png)\n\nFirst Ion-Comm awaiting sync.\n\n![XLpu20v.png](http://i.imgur.com/XLpu20v.png)\n\nSynced and showing distance between two Ion-Comm IIs.\n\n![riiutpr.png](http://i.imgur.com/riiutpr.png)\n\nAnother Ion-Comm disconnected.\n\n![oBHnU8I.png](http://i.imgur.com/oBHnU8I.png)\n\n![0BF2I6K.png](http://i.imgur.com/0BF2I6K.png)\n\nLast one going. On 1st image, you can see they were disconnected by undocking. As Ion-Comm was going with one port perfectly (ltd) straight relatively to engine, after decoupling it from Ion-Comm, it have redocked. Found it little bit interesting and felt like there is not enough text today. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![DxBegLD.png](http://i.imgur.com/DxBegLD.png)\n\nAnd network around Duna is complete! You can see two sattelites in place of right-top. One of them is Ion-Comm and second one is Engine S, which is now waiting for transfer window to Kerbin.\n\n![0IoXj8w.png](http://i.imgur.com/0IoXj8w.png)\n\nHere are Ion-Comm Is coming out of sync. If you would draw straight line between top-left and top-right (representing signal), you would see it crosses Kerbin. I have to sync them later, and maybe raise them up to 900 km, because I don\u0027t feel like syncing them every ~500 days."},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T18:43:11Z","Content":"What flight data mod are you using? those HUD look pretty nice and clear.\n\nThe drifting out of sync issue is going to be a problem for you.

I switch between projects more often than I should.\n\nI understand setting comm-sat network boring, but I promise that next part will be about most important part of mission - landing with station modules. I can\u0027t wait to test Ionizer (plane) in Duna\u0027s atmosphere. It has about 15,000 dV if I remember and later I will bring refueling thing along with rover(s?)."}]}
