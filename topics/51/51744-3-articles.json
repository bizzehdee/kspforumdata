I\u0027ve made a few attempts at space planes since I started reading this, they were all dismal failures. I think to start getting the hang of them in going to copy a few of your designs to get a basic idea, I may even start a new career and play through this way. Once I get through my current career though. I think one or two planetary landings out side of Kerbin will get me the rest of the tech tree. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s there a good guide out there that explains the difference in piloting a space plane? I can fight the design out, but the flying seems really different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah space planes are tricky, I\u0027ve got the hang of making an SSTO that can reach LKO and return but its taken me much longer to figure out than rockets and even so these craft don\u0027t carry a payload and only take a single kerbal. Building an SSTO plane that can take a payload to LKO or make IP transfers is still something I find hard. I\u0027ve seen one guy who took a full orange tank to Duna in an SSTO so I know much more is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey do require a quite different ascent profile to rockets, I don\u0027t know of any guides but I\u0027ll try to explain my SSTO approach. First you need enough Jet engines to overcome the crafts weight, I don\u0027t have a rule to guide this but once you leave the runway you should be going around 100ms and accelerating as you climb. Then you need to have enough intakes to feed the engines at high alts, but I\u0027ve never needed to stack intakes. I find one ram intake per engine is the minimum, more is better, if you can fit a ram intake somewhere and it looks good (this is very important) then fit it. I\u0027ve also found that space planes benefit from having a load of reaction wheels. This helps hold them steady as then engines start to flame out and during landing when the fuel is nearly empty and the weight has shifted it helps keep them level. A lot of my early space planes would tumble out of control as they re-entered the lower atmo, lots of reaction wheels solves this quite well. The Sprinter SSTO can stay level when one engine flames out cos of its over-abundance of reaction wheels. I try to put the Jets as close to the central axis as possible as this helps reduce spinning out during flame out and they are bound in pairs to action groups and I shut them down in pairs as the air runs thin. The outer most engines are shut down first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter take off I climb at about 50-60 degrees until I reach about 16km and then pitch down to about 20-30km (thou this is quite dependent on the craft\u0027s TWR). The aim is to gain as much horizontal speed while still in the atmo, the faster you are going the more air is being forced into the intakes, but you also want to continue to climb so its a balancing act. You want to try and accelerate to around 1000ms surface speed while around 25km. As the engines start to flame out, shut down your outer most jets and fire up your rocket engines. At this point I raise the pitch to about 30-40 as you don\u0027t want to spend much time burning rocket engines in the atmo. Try to keep the inner most jets running as long as possible by shutting down the outer ones in pairs. Once your last jets engines are shut down and your on just rocket engines you should be at around 30km and climbing at around 100ms. You should have been continuing to accelerate all this time, if not then your rockets engines are not powerful enough or you don\u0027t have enough intakes to supply the Jets in the higher atmo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce all my jets are shut down I switch to map mode to watch the Ap. Keep a pitch of 30-35 until the ap is around 40km and then pitch down to about 20 and keep gradually reducing the pitch. The Ap should be getting pushed away from you resulting in a wide sub orbital path. After that it\u0027s standard rockety circularising. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense and helps a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sesni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sesni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022It was agreed that this mountain should be remained Mt.

Mun was now within their grasp and all they had to do was refuel the Oddity (and patch the left wing) and the totally reusable craft could travel there again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the ever critical Jeb had already decided that a more efficient approach could be designed. The Oddity required a considerable amount of fuel to facilitate a single Munar landing and there where many sites on Mun that required scientific study. Jeb\u0027s new plan was to build a larger SSTO that could take a considerably heavier payload into LKO and then assemble a craft in LKO that would be able to perform several Mun landings. Even though the heavier SSTO and its payloads would require more fuel than the Oddity, he calculated that with this new system he could make 4 Munar landings using the equivalent amount of fuel required to run 2.5 missions with the Oddity. It would also be a refuelable system and after completing its first 4-landing mission it could be refuelled in LKO ready for another mission to 4 more sites on Mun. As only fuel and replacement sci modules would be needed on the 2nd mission its efficiency would be increased to 2 times that of the Oddity. A heavy lift SSTO would also open up many more possibilities such as sending a probe to one of the other bodies in their solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etbc......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry if the images are in a lower res.

It was perhaps best that Jeb had the more challenging landing sites as Bob was not as skilled a pilot. On his final landing he touched down at over 15ms and damaged 3 of the 4 legs on the lander.

It needed an ascent stage, but any additional fuel tanks and engines added behind it also required lots of wings to balance the high lift forces exerted by the light-weight glider. After many failed attempts Jeb came up with an ascent stage which while small in terms of the number of fuel tanks, had a massive wing span. The ascent stage had 3 jet engines and 2 aerospikes and as little fuel as possible. It would use up some of the gliders fuel during the rocket stage of the ascent and the glider would then complete its orbit on its own 909 engine, using up most of its remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Glider could take a single pilot, but it also had an on-board computer that would fly it unmanned into orbit.
