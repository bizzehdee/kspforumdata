It might be an explosion, an uncontrollable spin, or even just wanting to get back to Kerbin safely from orbit without all that heavy rocket baggage coming with you. To that end, I present the Kerbal Escape System! This comfy little four-seater can get you from a pretty decent height right on back to terra firma without too much trauma. Or at least, that\u0027s what KSP Mission Control is hoping! Today (okay, technically it\u0027s night when they did the tests), they find out if it really works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/escape_test1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022escape_test1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bob Kerman generously offered to test this system out for us.
