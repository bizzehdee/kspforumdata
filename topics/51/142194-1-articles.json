The first intended landing site atthe Jool System was Vall, but the dwindling fuel reserves made Laythe the only viable because of the possibility of either an unpowered descent or sporadically using the much more efficient air breathing engines on the plane. After a refuelling stop on Laythe\u0027s surface, landings on Pol and Bop are planned. Tylo is, of course out of the question as it would mean a permanent residence there for the Kerbals and their ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/7vQVR/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
