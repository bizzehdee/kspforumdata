You see, the mission pack will create randomized spawns of Near-Kerbin asteroids, some of which should land on s trajectory carrying them through Kerbin\u0027s SOI.

I should get on that- it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to set up a seismic sensor at the KSC, and then launch a small probe straight up from the mountaintop launchpad I built on a suborbital trajectory, turn it around at apoapsis and have it burn straight back towards Kerbin on the way back down with any remaining fuel for a relatively high-velocity impact event (drag will still slow it down quite a bit, unfortunately...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also be able to use the spent fuel tanks from the Light Munar Explorer, and any other similar missions in the future, as impactors as long as they collide into Kerbin\u0027s surface with enough force...
