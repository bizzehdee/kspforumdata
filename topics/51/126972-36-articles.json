The library was full with the two of them, Val and several other of the Forgotten lining the walls while Macfred\u0027s crew were resting in the seats in the center of the room.

Our observations - soil samples, core samples and other such tests - showed Kerbin to have a nearly impossible mass for its size.

And likely every other body in the system?\u0022 Bill\u0027s explanation was met with blank stares and shrugs as the crew traded glances. \u0022There\u0027s one at the space center. Literally right outside the door. Near the beach. How could you not see it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guess we never looked.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Say, Bob.\u0022 Jeb hadn\u0027t even looked up from his reading material as he flipped a page while tossing out the question.\u00A0\u0022You don\u0027t think maybe their Kerbin didn\u0027t have monoliths?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No Jeb, I don\u0027t. And you don\u0027t either.\u0022 Bob took a drink from his water cup before continuing. \u0022Anyway, the monoliths are made of a material that was impossible for us to cut or sample. Weird stuff. My team tried everything, lasers, plasma cutters, sharks, jigsaws, and absolutely nothing worked. Until one day a mysterious kerbal showed up and dropped a sliver of the stuff in my lap along with some cryptic notes\u00A0Strange guy, that one, rather familiar looking, but he disappeared just as soon as he\u0027d appeared so I didn\u0027t get any answers from him. Wernher and myself were still running tests on the Exorem sample when the space program took shape and distracted us. It wasn\u0027t dense enough anyway, not that it mattered for long.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded. \u0022The hyper-dense material theory broke down.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Sun. The data we collected from our space probes showed the Sun suffered from the opposite density discrepancy as Kerbin, and nobody could explain how its fusion reactions could continue. Or why it was even capable of sustaining the reactions in the first place, given its low mass. Our entire model broke down, and none of it made sense until we discovered this station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Still doesn\u0027t make sense to me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, nothing makes sense to you, even when it does.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How does \u003Cem\u003E_that_\u003C/em\u003E make sense?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob ignored him and continued. \u0022This room held the answers we needed to make sense of it all. Notes. Experiment logs. Data. Histories long forgotten. Most were written before even Maclie and Kening arrived. Some other research team had obviously lived here, studied the problem, and found the answer to the density discrepancy years before we even realized it existed.\u00A0And they possibly even found a way out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So it wasn\u0027t this Exorem stuff?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Black holes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lots of them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Inside everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake\u0027s hands shot up defensively. \u0022Wait, wait, wait, wait. If there\u0027s black holes at the center of everything, then why do the planets still exist? Wouldn\u0027t they have collapsed in on themselves by now? Shouldn\u0027t we be observing time dilation? Why aren\u0027t there other signs to indicate this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are observing time dilation. It\u0027s scant but measurable. Anyway, this is where the Monoliths come in. Our predecessors had gathered enough data to prove the Kerbol System was not a naturally occurring phenomenon, thanks largely to the density discrepancy. The only way the numbers could work, according to their observations, was if the entire system was one giant cluster of black holes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except the Sun, which is still kind of weird. And kind of unexplained.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. And if the entire system is a cluster of black holes, then these things we call planets and moons are either hollowed out by the black holes at their centers, or are artificial constructs built around said black holes. Either of which explains the density discrepancy. The outer shell is constructed of normal matter, explaining its normal density characteristics.\u00A0Only problem was\u00A0the theory is seemingly untestable.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except it was testable, just not easily so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right again. Our predecessors decided to drill through the outer crust of one of these moons and observe its creamy and destructive\u00A0interior directly. Based on their numbers they were able to estimate the event horizons of each black hole, and set up an\u00A0experiment to test their hypothesis. So they needed to find the moon with the thinnest crust\u00A0and punch through it to observe the results. Except they ultimately didn\u0027t need to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbin collapsed while they were in orbit. Three kerbals witnessed it first hand and recorded their observations in exacting detail. Chunks of it fell into the blackness beyond, giant rectangles like tiles falling from\u00A0a shower floor. And then, just as the last of their home disappeared into the impossible darkness, it apeared again. Seemingly untouched. Pristine Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except it wasn\u0027t. The three of them climbed into their capsule and returned to the surface, where they were promptly locked away in a mental institution. The space program had been completely forgotten, and these three were ranting and raving about things that couldn\u0027t be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Apparently only crazy kerbals go to space.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Same thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except in time another space program was started, and suddenly those three weren\u0027t so crazy. Except the first astronauts recruited by this new space program were identical to the three locked away by the doctors. Even had the same names, Jebediah, Bill, and yes, Bob. So they stayed locked up and under observation for many munths.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At least until it happened again.\u0022 Bill interjected. \u0022The kerbals went and forgot about their space program. There was a global crisis. The great powers took notice. Kerbin once again collapsed in on itself, and suddenly the three crazy ones were suspended over the nothingness, held stationary by forces they couldn\u0027t see and couldn\u0027t\u00A0explain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then they were back on Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pristine Kerbin. Untouched. And again the space program was completely unknown. Except now there were two of each of them. And somehow they stumbled into each other. The Bobs, my past equals, couldn\u0027t accept it at face value. Too weird. They had to have an answer, something solid to hang their fleeting sanity on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So they set up an observation program. They tried to guide the development of Kerbin, to accelerate the space program, to reach further every time before Kerbin collapsed in on itself. To find explanations for why Kerbin came back every time. Eventually they collected more Bobs and Bills and Jebs than they knew knew what to do with, and so they came here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Somehow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Or maybe they built this place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t know for sure. All we know is\u00A0this is where they perfected the theory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Theories.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mostly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Insane.\u0022 Gletrix leaned forward in her seat, the look on her face one of pure exasperation. \u0022You\u0027re all insane. This isn\u0027t a research station, it isn\u0027t even Thomlock\u0027s ghost ship. It\u0027s an asylum. This is where The Boss was sending Sieta. Not Dres. Here. No, no, no. You keep your hands down Macfred. These kerbals are all completely mad. Black holes? Collapsing planets? Multiple copies of themselves? If they\u0027re not mad then we are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock still wasn\u0027t sold, and he certainly didn\u0027t think these kerbals were all insane, but he had to admit none of the physics he\u0027d learned in school made much sense either. \u0022So, what now? These monoliths just rebuild Kerbin every time it collapses? Why does it collapse in the first place if the\u00A0monoliths are building it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob held up a sliver of very dark material. \u0022Exorem. We think that when this piece was removed from one of Kerbin\u0027s monoliths it destabilized the construct. And so over time the planet seeps into the black hole until it reaches a breaking point.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Think of it like this,\u0022 Bill offered. \u0022These planets are more like an arch than a simple sphere. Each panel of the sphere supports those next to it, with two keystones at the poles to keep them all inline. So once one piece of the sphere breaks, the rest follow it in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake kept pressing.\u00A0\u0022So, what happens to the kerbals when it collapses?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix seemed exasperated. \u0022C\u0027mon, you\u0027re not all buying this load of crap, are you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Agake has a good question. When the planet collapses, near as we can tell every kerbal on it goes with it except those that have been beyond the control of the monoliths.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They die,\u0022 said one of the other kerbals. Thomlock vaguely recalled her name rhyming with crazy. Grazy, was it? \u0022Every kerbal you\u0027ve ever known that wasn\u0027t in space is dead. All of them. Gone. Never to return.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For some reason we don\u0027t fully understand, any kerbal that has been to space is protected from these events. Most wake up never knowing it happened, aside from everything they know having disappeared. One of the previous Bobs suggested this was a deliberate action on the part of the monoliths to protect whoever originally built the system. Should they need to visit any of the planets or\u00A0moons to make changes, to investigate, they wouldn\u0027t want to succumb to the monster that lives inside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dead.\u0022 Macfred was just staring blankly at the wall. \u0022All dead?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake was unfazed, ever the scientist. \u0022So what are these monoliths anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe others all traded glances before Bob answered. \u0022We don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t know where they came from, we don\u0027t know how they got here, we don\u0027t know for sure this is their doing. All we know is what they\u0027re made of, and that they emit extensive radio noise when Kerbin collapses.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They sing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They scream.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then they whisper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s more,\u0022 Bill continued, \u0022is we\u0027re not even sure where the new Kerbin\u00A0comes from. My preferred theory is that Kerbin is reconstructed by the monoliths from a previous version. A snapshot.\u00A0Except none of us are sure where they get the matter to rebuild the planet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we have an idea, but that\u0027s where things get really weird.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix, having long since slumped back into her chair, offered a retort. \u0022Oh, so this is where things get weird.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 Bob corrected, \u0022this is where they get really weird. We think the monoliths have the ability to puncture the fabric of space and time. They pull in matter from another dimension to build a new Kerbin, or they pull in an entirely new Kerbin, already constructed in some other dimension. Which is my favorite theory - that the damage done at Kerbin is causing Kerbins from alternate universes to collapse into our own. This is our Omega Universe, the end point, and all those falling into it are from Alpha through N\u002B1 Universes. If that\u0027s the case, we suspect something will eventually be done to plug the hole.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we hope so. It\u0027s possible those that built this system have long forgotten about us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Regardless, both of these theories explain the multiples of us, Werner, Gene and the others in the space agency. Either the duplicates are direct copies of us created by the monoliths, or they\u0027re dimensional alternates who started from a common point, pulled in as Kerbin collapses through time and space. There are of course many other theories, but these two are best supported by the data at hand. It even explains how we all know Thomlock.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis grabbed his attention. \u0022How?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Either the snapshot was taken after your mission, or all of these alternate universes split from a common point that occurred after it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb closed his book and tossed it on a nearby bookshelf. \u0022You left one out. One of the theories. The best one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not that again, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look. It\u0027s no less crazy than all that other nonsense you\u0027ve been spouting. Shorter and easier to wrap your head around too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob took another drink before continuing. \u0022Jeb\u0027s theory...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not my theory....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022... The theory developed by a previous Jebediah Kerman suggests that we\u0027re all living in an elaborate computer simulation. When the operator of the simulation grows bored or meets a challenge they don\u0027t know how to overcome they start a new simulation, discarding the previous to the garbage collectors. Except these now discarded simulations are still resident in the computer\u0027s memory, what we call\u00A0the Omega Dimension, and their achievements are forgotten by all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This,\u0022 Jeb waved his arms around, \u0022all of this is fantasy. We\u0027re just bits in some silicon dream.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock huffed. This huff was followed by another that grew into a laugh. Not maniacal, or even concerning, more akin to a nervous laugh. An understanding laugh. A laugh that saw through the charade. The others could only smile at his laughter, clearly not in on the same joke as the hundred-plus-year-old kerbal. He paused between guffaws to explain himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So I\u0027m right. This really is the afterlife, and you\u0027re all ghosts. We\u0027re all somebody\u0027s ghost. We may not be dead ourselves, but everybody else is. Their ghosts are ours.\u0022 At that he rose, still laughing, and made his way out of the library. \u0022Ghosts.\u0022\u00A0The galley, that\u0027s the only place he could go. There was no amount of grog that could clear the madness that was reality from his memory, but he was willing to give it a go. Omega Universe, computer simulation, black holes, ghosts?\u00A0Madness. Pure madness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe Gletrix was right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll get two updates today - The one above that\u0027s pure exposition, and one later tonight that\u0027s an actual mission update.
