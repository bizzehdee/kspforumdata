Don\u0027t take a single heavy lander and try to do all the moons with it. It\u0027s a dumb idea. Much better with two or three small, clever landers, probably using command seats. Throw them away when used. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Don\u0027t cart the huge amounts of fuel a heavy lander needs to Jool. The craft needed is unwieldy. It turns poorly and uses stupid amounts of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you do need more fuel at Jool then take an ISRU. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

I used it to delete a spent fuel section because it was confusing having it and the mothership so close together in orbit. So sue me!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
