If you\u0027re reading this, then either time machines exist now, or we survived the black hole epidemic. If the latter, then Hooray! If not, this is still an interesting story. It all started in 2021, when Barnard\u0027s Star dissappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003EAn ordinary day in 2021(check spoiler), of just checking images with the James Webb Space Telescope. Ever since one scientist predicted a black hole epidemic after a black hole\u00A0popped up near Sirius, which meant it had happened 7 years ago. Leaders of the world got scared and created a new department to keep an eye on the stars, the Watchers of the Cosmos. But their nick name was the Watchers. Each Watcher had been trained on how to recognize a black hole. And one Watcher was looking at Barnard\u2019s Star, and then he spotted a strange dot, that took a miniscule bite out of Barnard\u2019s Star, he waited until the next day to be sure. The next day Barnard\u2019s Star was gone. It was confirmed, there was a black hole nearly 6 light years away, and the worse part though was that it was 6 years ago, when the black hole ate Barnard\u2019s Star. Over the next few days, more and more stars disappeared. Until the worst happened, Proxima Centauri disappeared, just like Sirius, that\u2019s when the Watchers really panicked. It didn\u0027t help that this would cause as much panic as\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0when the aliens brought Steve Jobs back to life and attacked Earth.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003EThey told the United World what happened, and the UW decided to keep it quiet until a decade before the black holes were scheduled to arrive, meanwhile all space programs would receive funding necessary to create an interstellar vehicle, when Elon Musk (President of the Marshall Islands and SpaceX) said, \u201CWhich planet would it hit first?\u201D \u201CJupiter\u201D, they replied. \u201CThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll make our stand.\u201D Musk said. And it was decided, they would send a mission to Jupiter, with one person who had the guts. They created the ISA(International Smartness Assessment) that wouldn\u0027t just look for the smartest, but those who are the guttiest.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003EAnd that\u0027s where we\u0027ll stop for today. Tomorrow, we\u0027ll go back to 2020, and check out that alien invasion.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minmus Taster","CreatedById":206159,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-09T15:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSend Jeb some say he has no guts to lose...i need to stop here before i get to graphix\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-09T15:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, but this is strictly limited to Earth, I may add some way for Jeb to be included.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-11T16:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the next chapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChapter One\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust before the very short alien invasion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeoff woke up to the annoying vibrations of his new alarm, at least it worked. He rubbed his eye and got ready for the day by setting up a replicate Apollo mission with NERVAs on KSP(Kerbal Space Program) while brushing his teeth, his mom texted, back from her walk, \u201CGeoff, it\u2019s only 6:30! Isn\u2019t that enough time to take a shower?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust a minute!\u201D Geoff replied. Muttering about how showers can be every other day, he quickly took a shower, put on a Mars shirt, with Kybertruck driving by it, Starman waving his hands through a broken window, with black shorts with white dots peppering it, and put on his glasses with the logo of every space company, but a white patch in the shape of a feather, was where the logo of Blue Origin used to be. And his Cochlear n7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re going to be late for school!\u201D Mom said. She made every meal, and all of them were delicious, but lately Geoff had been taking up most of the responsibilities for the food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s only 7 AM! Don\u2019t we need to go at 7:20?\u201D Geoff replied. Then the news came on, with a new announcement by Elon Musk about a new Starship, called StarshipXL, that would go to Jupiter and beyond. \u201CHeh, Elon\u2019s gonna rule the other worlds someday.\u201D And then news about Elon Musk\u2019s new baby popped up. \u201C*sigh*, it\u2019s annoying how he copies nature though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGeoff! A tray of German Pancakes with Nutella is waiting for you!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGive me 2 for now, mom!\u201D, Geoff said as he headed to the kitchen. Ever since Steve Jobs came back to life during the extremely short alien invasion, he created the O\u003Csub\u003E2-\u003C/sub\u003EC machine that got rid of the carbon atom in CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E quickly, and efficiently. It was light enough to take up in the atmosphere and get rid of the extra CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E. And the world was quite safe from the global warming threat, and then Jobs bought Sony, and created amazing products that put the iPhone to shame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater in homeroom at Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, someone came up to Geoff and said, \u201CGoing to make a book about space, eh?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd it\u2019ll be so complicated, no one can read it!

Then everything went black, and Geoff saw a weird future version of himself, holding a sign that said \u201CIt\u2019s happening in 2 hours.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDid you see that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSee what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C A person holding a sign with \u2018It\u2019s happening in 2 hours.\u2019\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just saw my dream game.
