The periapsis still had to be raised, and rather than waiting entirely until apoapsis, I decided to use the rest of my surplus Monopropellant to raise it as much as possible shortly after exiting the atmosphere, by thrusting radially inwards towards Duna.

Curious where I got my estimated loss of life? These are *conservative* estimates based on multiplying the area decimated by the Tunguska Event (2150 sq. km where all trees were cleared) by (38/15)^2, which assumes the Tunguska Event asteroid airburst was a full 15 Megatons. It was probably less- meaning *this* estimated 38 Megaton-equivalent impact (impact force would be MUCH less due to the asteroid\u0027s actual size if it were to hit Earth- but MUCH higher for its size hitting Kerbin, due to its thinner atmosphere. So I just use the figure for a 100-meter asteroid hitting Earth after a 45-degree re-entry angle. This asteroid is 1/10th the size, but Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is only 1/10th as tall, and the predicted re-entry angle is much steeper: more than 60 degrees...) would be even more deadly by comparison. I assume that blast radius only increases linearly (it actually increases exponentially, but with a low coefficient). I then take Earth\u0027s population density, divide it by 4 (as Kerbals are 4 times larger than humans in relation to the radius of their planet), and multiply this number by the first number- which is the estimated area that would be obliterated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if it\u0027s inaccurate to use the same blast radius as a 100-meter asteroid hitting Earth for a 10-meter asteroid hitting Kerbin, it\u0027s also entirely reasonable to assume Kerbals are more tightly packed in due to their smaller planet. And, even if not, I like to think of most things in this game as and analogy for Earth anyways in some sense (though if this were Earth with humans, and the asteroid size were increased proportionally, the estimated average casualties would be over 185k, as humans are smaller relative to their environment- and thus should be more numerous relative to their planet size.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S.

May God bless us all- and I hope in our next such meeting I will have only good news to report about the success of Project Amadeus...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOOC:\u003C/strong\u003E I hope you guys enjoyed the storytelling. My next post will likely be on the refueling of the Amadeus Mission Vehicle, followed thereafter by its ejection towards the asteroid (I will attempt a gravity-assist around the Mun if appropriate- the mission vehicle is going to need every drop of fuel it can get), and adjustment burns as necessary... Meanwhile, the Duna Heavy Equipment Deployment platform will arrive at Duna before Project Amadeus is complete- so expect to at least see something about my capturing it into Duna orbit as well, and possibly rendezvousing it with some of the other ships in the Duna Armada (I might save the actual colonization effort for a separate thread, and roleplay the delay as time spent actually assembling the first permanent orbital station from the components aboard the DHEDP...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T06:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new extended-tank version of the Reusable Crew Launch Vehicle made a launch and rendezvous with the Amadeus Mission Vehicle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Q5r3z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
