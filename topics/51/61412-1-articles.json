Construction commences!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey all. I thought I would share with you my \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmanual construction project\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Basically I wanted to assemble a ship outside of the vab, on the launch pad itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Introduction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal population has finally voted in a crazy rocket scientist as the new president of the world. Couple this with the fact that the majority of Kongress consists of whacky scientists and astronomers, there is no surprise that the go ahead was given to form a space programme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the launch site had been chosen and construction facilities built, construction could now begin on the first space fairing vessel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6or could it. Private companies as well has scrap metal merchants had delivered hundreds of parts to help the space programme get off the ground. However, this created a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COk Professor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6show me our space rocket contraption-majig!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked the president. Professor Kerman hesitated for a moment. What was he to do? The president would see how much he had failed. Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s dream was to build a rocket to get to space, it was all he had ever wanted. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYes Mr President. I must warn you, we are still in the early stages of construction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Kerman replied with a quiver to his voice. The president didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care, eager to see this grand marvel that would put a kerbal into space. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cyes yes yes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 replied the president \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cjust open the doors and show me\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The VAB doors squealed open. The president had already angled his head upwards in anticipation. His eyes widened at the marvel that stood before him \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis is truly amazing. An invisible space ship! The military will be pleased. Good job professor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and before the professor could muster up a response the president had already turned around and skipped away in delight. Proffessor Kerman gave out a hefty sigh of relief. The president hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t noticed the mound of parts sitting on the floor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal scientists had been unable to find away to attach the various parts together. Even the highest grade duct tape was insufficient for the job. A new way of constructing ships was needed! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Welcome to my project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with no way of assembling ships in the vab it was time to find a way to make them on the launch pad. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always wanted to try this but have never quite got round to it but a couple of nights ago I thought I would have a go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I wanted to have a modular ship that I could bring out in separate pieces and then assemble them on the pad using a crane. The reason I never bothered before was the fact that there is no way to weld parts together once you are \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cin game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. But I decided to bite the bullet and have a go just using docking ports! It probably seems stupid and pointless to most of you but I just fancied challenging myself. (which is kind of what this game is about in a way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the real joy of this would be in the designing of it all but it turns out that playing with a crane is good fun. I thought a crane would be quite simple but as it turns out ksp makes it kind of hard. The mods I used were \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKerbal attachment system\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cinfernal robotics\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. KAS would allow me to actually have a crane be able to pick up and drop parts and IR has a rotatable washer and a usable gantry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Designing the Crane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost I needed a crane and I thought it would be quite simple but it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t and this was a fun learning experience. First of all I have never used KAS or IR so finding usefull parts was difficult. My first crane used a rail and piston setup which wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t of any use at all but did prove I was able to pick up and move stuff around. It was small but I was just playing around to make sure this project would actually be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EmSWcac.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EmSWcac.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hvKyJlB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hvKyJlB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I started making some whacky but taller designs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/afOhe7A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022afOhe7A.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IKPMP8t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IKPMP8t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some playing around I had something almost useable. Obviously with something so tall but light causes some\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6fun, but a counterweight overcomes this somewhat. I added a fuel tank which I think is 2ton? So theoretically it should be able to lift and move 2 tons around. And to a certain extent it worked but it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very reliable (it would bend every which way it could) and when a test ship was put together the physics load just constantly caused it to topple over. But it was able to assemble a ship after hours of trial and error\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it just wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t reliable enough and at this point I almost gave up. A crane that could barely lift 2 tons wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to serve any purpose for this so I had a rest for a couple days. Then I had a brain wave at work. Why not anchor the crane to the floor with one of the KAS anchors? That idea also didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work as the crane would just topple over and drag the anchor along with it with any payload over 2 tons (even 2 tons was a bit hit or miss) However I then had another brainwave. Using the electromagnets (the one I use to lift things with) I could anchor the crane to an orange fuel tank to stop it bending and falling over. I was so adamant that this would work I doubled up the gantries at the top of the crane and anchored it to an orange tank and attempted what had been impossible so far\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6a 3 ton payload!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was sort of successful too! The only problem now was the washer was the weak point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mMHqmrw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mMHqmrw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I solved this by having an anchor point above the washer. This would be adjusted whilst rotating the crane to stop the anchor just pulling the top of the crane off as it tries to rotate. This proved very successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K53v7UA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K53v7UA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe great thing about kas is the GUI that allows you to see how much tension each winch has. So you can constantly fine tune the winches to get the perfect tension. This becomes a lot of fun when you are lifting and dropping several different payloads. But even so, actually rotating the payload around causes some lean but everything holds true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aFe4S0S.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aFe4S0S.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step was to see how big a payload I could lift was but anything above 3 tons still caused the crane to tip over. Even with the anchor. I later discovered this was because of the double gantry setup I was using. I wanted 2 as this gave the crane a lot of range to lift and move but it just proved to unuseable for large payloads. So i reduced it to 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mxxawTZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mxxawTZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZppTqo2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZppTqo2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IyeNxv3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IyeNxv3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Then i went for the biggest payload one of my crane designes has ever lifted\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A610 tons!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DKcqRsP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DKcqRsP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did successfully lift it (sorry I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a screenshot) but rotating with a 10 ton payload was too much. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t since lifted 10 tons again but I did increase the amount of anchor points to 3 so in the future I think 10 tons will be do able. You will be able to see the 3 point anchor setup in the final construction part of this project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end I had a crane that could rotate safely with a payload (if the speed is set to 0.1-0.3 depending on weight) and could also lift and drop things a reasonable distance. Heavy loads were lifted at 0.25 speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Designing the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning the actual ship wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really much of a challenge. However it was about 2am when I finally got round to this stage so all I wanted was a small ship that could get into orbit. The only real difficulty (if u can call it that) was working out how to stage it. You cant really stage using docking ports and action groups (well u can but I wanted to do it the traditional way) So basically wherever I wanted to stage I would just put a separator in between the docking port and the stage. Not weight efficient but it works. Also a special thanks goes to squad for the tweakables system. This means I can now remove all fuel to save weight for construction and as an added bonus I get to drive a fuel truck to the launch pad and fuel my ship before launch. Oh the roleplay!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship consisted of 4 parts. As I saved a lot of these parts as sub assemblies there are a few random docking ports that aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t used. They are there as a root part to attach the sub assemblies. They were all build in the VAB as I found it a lot easier to design in the VAB than the SPH. This meant that I had to drive out all the ship parts first and then setup the crane but this really is a minor inconvenience and as I wanted to drive the parts to the launch pad anyway, I guess it worked out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f7fMdWK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f7fMdWK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom left to right it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The lower Stage-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis consisted of a base for the whole craft to sit on during construction and a skipper engine.
