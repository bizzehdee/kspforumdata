Just a 20 m/s bounce . . . into a crater, which made that speed 90 m/s and not much would survive\u00A0that crash.

But, the craft that refueled it used robotic parts, and I noticed it getting a bit wobbly. As soon as it was done, I detached, and quickly deorbitted the kraken\u0027s next meal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-29T01:27:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2021 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wizard Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOh, for clarification I loaded a quicksave brfore I hit the bottom of the crater.
