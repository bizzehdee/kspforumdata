Perfect Munar landing site, optimal approach, everything going to spec... and then the fuel level alarm started blaring. Apparently someone back at KSC underestimated the weight of the new science equipment. Either way, Baring had to land right then and there or he would never get to leave. So he cut the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt almost worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5MekMyLl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225MekMyLl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo amount of landing leg toggling proved helpful. In the past the more rigid legs could perhaps have been used as a lever or at least propel the craft far enough upwards to right itself using the reaction wheels, but the newer model did not operate in such a fashion. Mission Control gave Baring the verbal equivalent of a shrug, saying they would \u0022get back to you\u0022. Baring was not optimistic, however. After all, he had no tools to work with, and remembered the many simulations back at KSC of similar situations - each and every one would either burn up all remaining fuel or result in rapid unplanned disassembly. Baring sighed and leaned against the flag he planted a moment earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hHssXndl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hHssXndl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETen minutes later, after breaking every single rule possible for safe spacecraft operation and nearly jamming the reaction wheel system, Baring managed to get the craft in its precarious position. This was never going to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WQtafnIl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WQtafnIl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDumping all excess weight possible, such as the no longer necessary science materials, Baring gulped and tapped the throttle lever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7yzmAcol.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227yzmAcol.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the craft was in position, with the flag pole bending under its weight all the while, he pulled the throttle to full. And immediately pulled on the controls to avoid smashing right into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vP6Q6AWl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vP6Q6AWl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncredibly, despite the precarious launch, the craft made low Munar orbit with just enough fuel remaining to return to Kerbin. On returning, Baring Kerman was awarded several honors previously reserved for Jebedian Kerman (famous for once pushing his crippled lander into Kerbins atmosphere using nothing but a decoupler and his EVA pack). Despite this, he opted to leave the active roster until, to quote, \u0022you tossers learn to actually TEST these things.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/M0Xvi#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFull mission report\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, usually my crippling social awkwardness would prevent me from writing anything like this and actually posting it, but I figured this solution was too...
