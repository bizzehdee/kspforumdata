They had always bickered over tiny things. Then one day, the Emperor of North Triania declared war on South Triania (when asked about this later on, he just said he was bored). \n\nThe fight raged on for a century. Many lives were claimed, but eventually, after the Final Snack Battle of 2014, the South Trianian Forces claimed victory. North Triania was assimilated into South Triania, and the Republic of Hexania was born.\n\nThere was a lot of technology developed from the war to fight the North, such as rocket engines, flat screen monitors, and high altitude suits. The trouble is, no-one knew what to do with this tech now the war was over. Wernher von Kerman\u0027s suggestion for a space program was rebuffed initially. But he was persistent. He was admired throughout Hexania, and eventually, to shut him up, the Hexanian Space Program was started up.\n\nThis is its story...\n\n**MISSION LIST****\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Mission 1:** [Hexnik-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113004-The-Hexanian-Space-Program-%28REBOOTED%29-%28Warning-Pic-heavy%29?p=1783732\u0026viewfull=1#post1783732) (Small Kerbin-orbiting satellite) - Failure\n\u003E \n\u003E **Mission 2:** [Hexnik-2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113004-The-Hexanian-Space-Program-%28REBOOTED%29-%28Warning-Pic-heavy%29?p=1785241\u0026viewfull=1#post1785241) (Small Kerbin-orbiting satellite) - Success\n\u003E \n\u003E **Mission 3:** [Hexnik-3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113004-The-Hexanian-Space-Program-%28REBOOTED%29-%28Warning-Pic-heavy%29?p=1788139\u0026viewfull=1#post1788139) (Scientific Kerbin-orbiting satellite) - Success\n\u003E \n\u003E **Mission 4:** [Hexnik-4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113004-The-Hexanian-Space-Program-%28REBOOTED%29-%28Warning-Pic-heavy%29?p=1788139\u0026viewfull=1#post1788139) (Scientific Kerbin-orbiting satellite) - Success\n\u003E \n\u003E **Mission 4:** [Hexnik-5](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113004-The-Hexanian-Space-Program-%28REBOOTED%29-%28Warning-Pic-heavy%29?p=1798712\u0026viewfull=1#post1798712) (Kerbin-mapping satellite) - Success\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T18:33:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaintedLion**\n  \nAdded Hexnik-5"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:25:03Z","Content":"\u003EPicture heavy\n\n\u003E I don\u0027t see any pictures\n\nTo make a new post you have to wait a certain amount of time"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:29:12Z","Content":"**MISSION 1: Hexnik-1**\n\nFunding was given to a series of Kerbin-orbiting satellites, to survey Kerbin from space, and to gain experience in preparation for more advanced manned missions.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
