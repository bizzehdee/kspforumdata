The vessel used the Rhea 2 HLV, which ran off of entirely liquid hydrogen and oxidizer, was just powerful enough to get the probe to a suborbital trajectory of 80km ASL, 10km higher than the atmosphere\u0027s edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel launched at 23:50, and looked promising at first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiftoff went without a hitch, and the vessel reached a trajectory of 76km ASL, with the NSW engine taking over for the rest of ascent. By then, the engine had reached around 1300K. The radiators were switched on, and orbital insertion begun. The engine continued to heat up, with the radiators doing little to stop the oncoming shutdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the vessel was well into it\u0027s insertion burn, the engine gave out and underwent an emergency shutdown due to surpassing 3000K, leaving the vessel on a 80 x -100km trajectory. The rest of the vessel burned up a few minutes later over the ocean, causing the leftover fuel to be scattered across the Origas ocean of Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission was quickly deemed a catastrophic failure, and personnel at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E quickly got to work on adding better radiators to the vessel for future flights. Currently, no injuries have been reported except a loss of many funds from the program\u0027s bank and minor injuries to our reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-05T19:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalsaurus","CreatedById":222386,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-05T21:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo pictures? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iapetus7342","CreatedById":233205,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-05T22:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, didn\u0027t take any.
