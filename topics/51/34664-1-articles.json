I named it MunBase Kalpha because the American Pack has the same rovers as Moonbase Alpha. It took me a full day and many failures. One of them was the docking port on the hitchhiker was to high so the rover couldn\u0027t dock so I had to redo that mission all over again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E but in the end it turned out good. I also have some kethane miners and kethane converters to the right of this picture and they are using the lazor mod to transfer from miner to converter then fuel to fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/luB415T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022luB415T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also landed on Duna today with Kartoffel V for the 2nd time. This time I brought a rover I built so the kerbals can get around faster. Later this week they will return back to kerbin in their lander without docking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2Ha4oaO.png\u0022 alt=\u00222Ha4oaO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T02:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, I notice you have wheels, are they for ground docking purposes, or is the base mobile?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T03:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spaceisbeautifulul\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spaceisbeautifulul\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice, I notice you have wheels, are they for ground docking purposes, or is the base mobile?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can undock the rovers but the main part of the base with the solar panels stay there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacob01","CreatedById":61842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T05:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks really good, I\u0027m trying to sort out a Mun base at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T05:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, what mod are those rovers from?
