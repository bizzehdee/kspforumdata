Either one of those should enable my spaceplanes to reach a high enough cruising altitude on Kerbin to make orbit with their ascent packages (which are pretty heavy- and reduce the craft\u0027s altitude ceiling by a great deal- further raising their required weight.

The problem with that idea though, is that it requires a lot of complexity in the craft- three separate propulsion systems in fact. One for flying on Duna, based on thermal turbojets; one for reaching high cruising altitude on Kerbin, based on oxygen-breathing jets (which are more powerful); and a third, rocket-powered ascent package to finally push the craft into orbit, and allow it to navigate to Duna without a separate transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed a vessel that could do all of this (I called her the \u0027DART\u0027- Duna Advanced Recon Turbojet), and still carry 12 passengers, but her part count was in something like the low-90\u0027s; and with 10 of those parts being engines and 8 of them being intakes, my computer was completely lagging out trying to fly it. That design also had huge stability problems, due to all the weight at the tail-end (my Blackhawk designs did too- but I was able to somewhat manage that by creating a second deck of wings that extended over the engines and moved back the center of lift, in my later variants...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which- here\u0027s the latest in my Blackhawk line of planes, for all those who missed it on the Flying Duna thread.

Oh, and they add reactor fuel consumption as well- but manage to make the new fuel mass-less, and instead make it so all the weight of the fuel is reflected in the mass of the container you carry it in...

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of you with a careful eye for detail might have noticed that the calculated Delta-V actually INCREASES (by quite a lot) from the first screenshots to the later ones. I\u0027m not cheating or anything- that\u0027s for two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is because the Thermal Rocket Nozzle is capable of two propellant settings: LFO mode, and LiquidFuel-only mod. No, these modes aren\u0027t for vacuum vs. atmospheric use (actually, the LFO mod works better in the atmosphere, for reasons following)- the reactor superheats the propellants and spits them out the back at high speeds using its thermal energy either way (it is NOT an air-breathing system). The difference, as I understand it, is that in LFO mode the LiquidFuel is allowed to combust with the Oxidizer at some point in the propulsion process- for additional thrust but reduced ISP- whereas in LiquidFuel-only mode the LiquidFuel (KSP Interstellar assumes it to be liquid hydrogen) is only superheated and expelled-without combustion; for approximately one-third better ISP (about 800 rather than 600- on par with a stock NERVA, but with far inferior TWR), but only half the thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, obviously, the LFO mode is superior to the LiquidFuel-only mode if you need to achieve high thrust for optimal performance (such as during a high-Delta-V burn, or when taking off from the surface of a planet). It\u0027s also useful if you have a cheap and unlimited source of Oxidizer (such as I hoped my atmospheric-scoop ship would provide, before I discovered that the technology is woefully inadequate to the task... And some people call KSP Interstellar \u0022overpowered\u0022. Hah...), since you essentially get over 50% more Delta-V per ton of LiquidFuel (and better thrust) if you combine it with Oxidizer... However, when you\u0027re trying to get a craft as far as possible on a given weight in fuel, LiquidFuel-only mode is the better option...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, tangent to explain the technology aside, the Early Spacedock carried a SMALL amount of Oxidizer on board (salvaged by my scrapper ships from one of the direlict hulks orbiting Kerbin, that still happened to have some LFO mix left in it when it was decoupled from the main vessel...), and a much greater quantity of LiquidFuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as a result, I started the engine in LFO-mode, until I had burned up all my Oxidizer (ALWAYS burn up your lower-ISP fuel first, if you\u0027re already in orbit and trying to get the most Delta-V out of a craft. For mathematical reasons I don\u0027t care to explain right now, you\u0027ll get a lot further that way...), at which point I switched the Early Spacedock to LiquidFuel-only mode, to perform the remaining majority of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result of all this was, MechJeb calculated Delta-V separately for each fuel-mode of the engine: and as a result, it calculated I had a much GREATER quantity of Delta-V available after I switched fuel mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wasn\u0027t the only thing going on, of course. I also ran into issues with Fuel-Crossfeed not working properly- so I had to use TAC Fuel Balancer to keep transferring LiquidFuel from the peripheral fuel tanks (the ones attached by girder segments near the engines) to the main one (the fuel tank on the opposite side of the craft from the engines) even though the \u0022peripheral\u0022 tanks were in fact closer to the engines, and the only additional parts they had in between were one XL-girder segment each... This also resulted in apparent \u0022increases\u0022 in my total Delta-V: as MechJeb could only calculate Delta-V from the fuel immediately available to the rocket engine, and as the craft\u0027s overall weight came down, the amount of Delta-V that the LiquidFuel in the main tank (always full- due to TAC Fuel Balancer refilling it from the peripheral tanks) could be used for constantly increased...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I hope you\u0027re all satisfied I wasn\u0027t cheating or anything (this is especially important this time, as this is also part of my challenge run for the \u0022Flying Duna\u0022 challenge, since the Balckhawk Mk6 meets all the challenge\u0027s requirements for an SSTDABK craft...)- the Early Spacedock\u0027s overall Delta-V definitely WAS decreasing as it progressed through its burn- only MechJeb wasn\u0027t capable of calculating this correctly due to the issues mentioned above...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Early Spacedock is currently on an intercept with the Mun. The orbital map was doing something screwy where it kept bouncing around in showing the (rather distant) intercept- which isn\u0027t about to smash into the Mun or anything (I don\u0027t THINK- the velocity difference when it reaches the Mun\u0027s SOI *should* be enough to avoid a collision, if I made the burn half as accurately as I hoped...), so really leaves me quite in the dark as to what was going on... Regardless, I\u0027m going to be making a couple adjustment burns on the way (look for them in the next post on the Early Spacedock), and soon the Early Spacedock will arrive in the Mun\u0027s SOI, perform a capture burn, and then adjust its position to where I figure out I want the upgraded spacedock (lower part-count, less Dry Mass uselessly allocated to structural supports that aren\u0027t needed anymore for a non-mobile permanent space station, a less overpowered and lighter electrical system, and higher capacity for both LiquidFuel and Oxidizer) to be constructed, to replace the main spacedock and perform its designed functions of acting as a major hub and point-of-origin for many of my future missions from the Kerbin system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-10T07:07:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2013 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T08:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, here are some very nice screenshots of the Blackhawk Mk6 on its way towards the Mun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CTE0gSD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CTE0gSD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6RTZQj2.png\u0022 alt=\u00226RTZQj2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, screenshots I captured of the adjustment burns (there were two- made close together but with low Delta-V changes, to increase the accuracy of the predicted course changes) to fine-tune the Munar approach of the Early Spacedock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/q0K22\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The depot will be based on the HexCans included in KSP Interstellar, as a large enough number of (deactivated) reactors to store an equivalent amount of reactor fuel would require a much higher Dry Mass, as the reactors have a much lower fuel-fraction than the HexCans...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, even so, the Munar Spacedock doesn\u0027t yet have enough RocketParts on board to construct a sufficiently large fissile fuel depot- as I used virtually all my freely available RocketParts to construct the Munar Spacedock (which I wanted to make even bigger- but was limited by the quantity of available raw materials...) So, I won\u0027t be constructing the fissile fuel depot until I can get one of the several fuel tankers I have in parking orbits around Kerbin to the Munar Spacedock, and recycle it for RocketParts after unloading all its fuel to the Munar Spacedock. And I won\u0027t be scrapping the Early Spacedock until I can unload all of its reactor fuel...

I probably won\u0027t keep the Early Spacedock as my Munar Hub, due to its high part-count (which would cause SERIOUS lag near some of the very large interplanetary vessels I will be refueling and constructing in Munar orbit) and comparatively low fuel storage capacity to the Munar Spacedock- but I could very well reassign it as a tried-and-tested long-range research vessel (it does have more than enough Delta-V storage-capacity to reach places like Jool, Eelo, or Moho), one sure not to have any of the fuel-crossfeed issues of my previous Nuclear Science Lab; or I could move it to a less-crowded location like Minmus orbit, where I could utilize it as a secondary spacedock location, and, once again, a research station (for Science Points- which I need a LOT more of to unlock the remaining KSP Interstellar tech nodes, such as Fusion Power).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you guys think about this- I really can\u0027t make up my mind whether I should just scrap the Early Spacedock for (at this point) badly-needed RocketParts to establish my Munar colony, or instead load it up with enough fuel (and maybe some RocketParts- to construct a couple landers and possibly a small surface outpost- much smaller and less independent than my planned Mun colony) to reach some other location (such as Eeloo, Dres, or Vall- I\u0027m particularly eying the cold and icy planets/moons- as I\u0027d like to test out the ISRU refinery\u0027s electrolysis abilities on ice; and the ship\u0027s large nuclear reactor is better suited for operation far away from the Sun, where solar panels would be less effective...), where it could still see many years of active service as a research station and minor spacedock...

One of the latest KSP Interstellar mod updates (great mod, I love it, *BUT*...) removed all electrolysis and other In-Situ-Resource-Utilization abilities from the KSP Interstellar Science Lab, as well as the ability to reprocess nuclear fuel (which was entirely revamped, and made much more complex, to the point I don\u0027t even pretend to understand quite how it works now just yet...), and moved all of these abilities to a new part: the \u0022ISRU Refinery\u0022 (ISRU= In-Situ-Resource-Utilization).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upside to this is that they reduced the mass of the Science Lab part from 3.5 to 2.5 tons (though, technically this is actually a downside for me- since I had plans to recycle the vessels containing my existing Science Labs for RocketParts- and now I won\u0027t get quite as many RocketParts from the vessels...) The downside is that the refinery is, though lighter than the original Science Lab (at only 2.5 tons instead of 3.5 tons), even more unwieldy to integrate into an existing rocket design (it can only be attached to on the bottom, or some spittle like that...) AND, worse for me, this change completely obsoletes the Duna Science Module design I sent as part of the Duna Mission- which means that even though it will arrive before the other two modules, it will no longer be able to land on Ike and start electrolyzing regolith in preparation for the arrival of the Crew Module and Duna Heavy Equipment Deployment Platform. Instead, it will just have to wait around in low Dunar orbit until the other two modules arrive- at which point I will be able to transfer out its crew and remaining fuel, build a recycling ship, and scrap it for RocketParts with which to build one of the new ISRU refineries to land on Ike... This will, of course, waste precious fuel over a direct insertion of the Duna Science Module on Ike to begin immediate electrolysis; and further will be complicated by the fact that both the Duna Crew Module and the Duna Heavy Equipment Deployment Platform will lose power shortly after arrival (I forgot before that the Duna Crew Module relies on an unmanned command pod and now update-broken NearFuture reactor as well- as all its crew are cloistered in a Hitchhiker Storage Container...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the (otherwise worthless- except as an inefficient crew transport) Duna Science Module will retain electrical power (due to its reliance on still-functional KSP Interstellar reactors rather than NearFuture reactors), and, assuming they don\u0027t break during aerobraking or the capture burn- due clipping issues resulting from the change in their length in one of the latest updates- I will need to dock the Duna Science Module with the DHEDP shortly after its arrival to provide it with electrical power until I can manufacture a small RTG-probe to take its place... (the lag from having two such large vessels docked will be ENORMOUS) This is looking like the Duna Mission is going to be an *INTERESTING* experience... Hopefully I can salvage it, before any more idiotic preexisting vessel-breaking mod-updates manage to make the Duna Mission any more, err... *challenging*...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and, I\u0027ll have to check on this- but it looks like that LiquidFuel tanker I sent on a slow intercept to Duna has been broken by the NearFuture update as well- since I\u0027m pretty sure I designed the thing before NearFuture removed the built-in radiators from their reactors... One *MORE* vessel I\u0027ll have to play around with when I have it loaded vs. unloaded just to ensure it doesn\u0027t run out of electricity before it can capture into a stable Dunar orbit... At this point, I\u0027m pretty sure the only vessels that will still have stable electrical power in the Duna system will be the Duna Science Module (*IF* the reactors don\u0027t break due to clipping issues from the latest KSP Interstellar update changing their length), and the Long-Range Argon Probe I sent there for a gravity-assist: which is powered by RTG\u0027s, and might just end up being used to save my Duna mission if nothing else works...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-11T04:39:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2013 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T10:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been busy with real life for a while (and will continue to be far busier than in the past for while), but I did find the time to make a MAJOR set of updates to my mods list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the OP for details. Basically, I just brought all my mods up to the newest version I could find, and updated the base game to 0.23- which means TWEAKABLES!

(this allows me to essentially design the kind of three-step SSTDABK spaceplane that I previously dreamed of, but could not attempt due to the necessary part-counts and resultant lag) This means I should be able to escape Kerbin orbit with a much lower fuel fraction- which also means a relatively lighter fuselage and thus either improved sustained performance on Duna or a much smaller overall vessel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, explanation aside, I need a name for my new line of spaceplane.

Sure this design was powerful enough to just point-and-shoot, but it\u0027s not like we still don\u0027t have plenty of warheads left in the thing. The Duna colonists will just have a few less leftover thermonuclears available to salvage for their modified Bluetonium nuclear reactors and lithium, deuterium, and tritium stockpiles.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are they really going to tear apart thermonuclear weapons for spare LITHIUM?\u0022 asked the subordinate incredulously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure, what else are they going to do with them? They\u0027re authorized to retain a few of the compressor plates for designing smaller sounding charges to detonate underground and locate ore deposits- but most of the material is better off used for fueling fusion reactors anyways. You know our engineers are telling us that the colonists will probably be able to eventually design plasma-drive HEAVY ROCKETS that will work on Duna, if they have adequate supplies of lithium for tritium-breeding, and deuterium to combine with it for some of the early fusion reactors our engineers think aren\u0027t too far away from entering service. Maybe they could even develop some more powerful thermal turbojet spaceplanes there- although you know personally I think a fusion reactor is a little overly-powerful for a spaceplane. Why waste valuable fusion material powering a spaceplane on a frontier planet where fission reactors will work just fine?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good point Sir.

Keep that in mind if any of you are thinking of using an Orion to lift really heavy payloads...

And this design only used the 3.5 kN variety of thermonuclear bomb- the Orion can be equipped with up to 400 kN devices for REALLY heavy payloads! Also, if I had assembled this thing in orbit (perhaps using smaller Orion vessels to bring up the necessary parts, tools, and bombs), waited for a better transfer window (Duna was near closest approach), and relied on a lower-energy transfer trajectory and a Munar gravity assist, I could easily have sent several *DOZEN* MEGATONS tons or more of payload to Duna, on a single transfer vessel utilizing a somewhat smaller quantity of the larger warheads (which get exponentially better ISP)... Using a propulsion system and bombs weighing in at under 100 tons... That\u0027s MEGA COLONY SHIP proportions (scaling it up to real world masses, you could probably transport over a GIGATON, maybe even two or three- thousands of colonists and their belongings)- though building anything that massive in KSP would inevitably crash my computer...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T12:25:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T17:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust some scrapping operations for you guys at the moment...
