At first I used direct missions which cost about 2000 m/s from LKO to Jool aerobraking, but I\u0027ve seen a few missions in these forums that use flybys to reduce that to around 1200-1300 m/s. So I wondered just how slow one can go and still get there. And I think I have the answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ILKwM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This means that getting from LKO to Jool orbit takes \u003Cem\u003Eless dV then getting from LKO to a low Munar orbit\u003C/em\u003E!! (which is about 1130m/s minimum) Even if you don\u0027t use the Mun flyby this is still true. I love flybys. I finally got some hard data on the value of a Mun flyby too- it is around a 60-80 m/s savings for a trip to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I made a few mistakes in my mission, like leaving 15 minutes late for Mun and not launching into an inclined orbit, so I think someone could knock 10-20m/s off of this, but I don\u0027t see a way to get to Jool for less than that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT July 4:Doh!! See 4 posts down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize for others who may wish to try this route:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use a node editor, Mechjeb has one and there are others. It is brutally difficult to set up a flyby without this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Leave Kerbin between UT Y1 day 146.0 and 148.0, with around 147.0 being best. Go outside this window and the dV to get to Eve starts climbing dramatically. Note the Z-axis, or normal velocity of -110m/s which becomes \u002B20m/s if you use the Mun. Note I had to leave late on day 147 because I had to wait until Mun was in the right position, yet another problem with using a Munar flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Arrive at Eve as close to UT Y1 day 195 and 17 hours as possible. Try to arrive a few hours earlier if you left Kerbin early on day 146 or a few hours later if you left Kerbin late day 147. This is the tightest window in the flight (except for Mun if you do that). If you arrive at Eve on D197 the flyby will have to be in its atmosphere (i.e. impossible), and if you arrive earlier the delta V required goes way up and eventually a big maneuver will be required after the 2nd Kerbin flyby to get to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The first Kerbin flyby is around Y1 D296 and a few hours. If you flew by Eve at the right time you will have no choice but to arrive at Kerbin around the right time, just be sure to set it up before the Eve flyby so it is cheaper. Adjust the orbit between the 2 Kerbin flybys so that it has a period exactly equal to 2 Kerbin years, and make its plane be as close to Jool\u0027s orbital plane as you can tell by eye. That will be good enough. You will have the problem that you cannot set Kerbin as a target while you are in its sphere of influence (SOI), but if you set the period of the orbit right, as soon as you leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI after the 1st flyby it will be easy to set up the 2nd Kerbin flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As always with flybys, set up the Jool encounter before the 2nd Kerbin flyby. The Jool arrival time is quite variable, it soaks up any errors you may have made earlier. Earliest arrival can be around Y3 D71, to as late as Y3 D200 if you arrived at Eve late and just skimmed its atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a Mun flyby is tricky, I wouldn\u0027t try it until you have a some flyby experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t have studied flybys if it hadn\u0027t been for Jasonden\u0027s \u0027Inspiration Kerbal\u0027 flyby challenge and then Otis\u0027 \u0027Lowest delta-V to Moho\u0027 challenge, if you guys read this, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-04T20:48:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2014 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PLAD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spiritplumber","CreatedById":84232,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T01:35:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is what they do IRL...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jasonden","CreatedById":96415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T17:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is crazy man!

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan it be reduced even more? I think so. For reference the next numbers all refer to starting from a 75x75km orbit and not using a Munar flyby (which we know would save 87m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This minimum start for the initial K-E in this window is 1068m/s. But you can get to Eve for as little as 1025m/s in other windows. Could we start with that? No. I found you cannot go K-E-K and arrive back at K with more Vinf than you left with if your start boost is less than 1044m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-So can we start with 1044? Not exactly. When flying K-J you must leave the last K with a Vinf of at least about 2670m/s. But I have found no K-E-K-K-J window that starts with less than 1068m/s that gets up to 2670m/s by the time you head to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I did find a route that theoretically gets to Jool with a starting dV at Kerbin of 1044m/s. It goes K-E-K-K-E-K-K-J*. So 24m/s less than 1068 but with 3 extra flybys. I budget 5m/s per flyby so your net savings would be about 9m/s over the mission shown above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: I hereby contend that you cannot get to a low Jool orbit from a 75x75km Kerbin orbit for less than 997m/s, except by random luck which might save a couple of m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Or maybe there is a multi-orbit solution that can do a little better?

You can get V when leaving SOI from TOT, FF, or LambertE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make a rough estimate by knowing that Mun will turn your path by about 29 degrees, and Mun will move about 25 degrees in the 2h 45min it takes to get to it, (empirically determined) so I set up an initial ejection-to-Eve burn when Mun is about 54 degrees retrograde from the direction a burn that doesn\u0027t use Mun leaves Kerbin\u0027s SOI at (don\u0027t execute it, just set it up and use a protractor). I then note the altitude above Mun\u0027s surface that that flight would need to go to get to Eve and use the empirically determined rule that a change in 1 minute in the boost time changes the required Mun periapsis by 1 km, at least for an hour or so before and after the optimum time. Since you can\u0027t see the Mun periapsis altiitude when it is below the surface you should shoot for a too-early initial trial. A big problem is that a low orbit around Kerbin has a period of about 30 minutes, so you can only execute your boost to Mun at a certain instant every 30 minutes. If you can live with your Mun flyby being up to 30km above the optimum possible altitude then just use the window closest to that. Otherwise you will have to change your launch time (hit F5 before you launch) to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think of it as trial-and-error- if you\u0027re not picky then just a couple of trials will do, if you want to squeeze the last possible m/s out of the flyby then 5 or 6 might be needed. Remember each minute of error reduces the benefit of the flyby by 0.5m/s, at least for an hour or so before and after the optimal time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Somebody ought to write something that gives you the optimal launch time for a Munar flyby if you give it the planetary transfer dates, like \u0027I want to leave Kerbin around day 147.0 and get to Eve at day 195.6, when is the best time to leave Kerbin and use the Mun?\u0027.
