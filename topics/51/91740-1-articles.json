This term at my university, one of my classes had a long term project involving coming up with a creative project and doing pre-planning work throughout the quarter. At the end of next week, we are expected to present a sort of rough prototype of the project to the class. I chose to do a KSP mission blog, something that I\u0027ve wanted to do for a long time. Unfortunately, I got caught up with other homework and with some other games after making two posts and a draft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://peoplesseb.wordpress.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://peoplesseb.wordpress.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if you guys had any feedback for, particularly in regards to the writing style and the types of information in the posts. What you liked / didn\u0027t like, what you\u0027d like to see more of, what was useless to the narrative, etc. I would like to discuss the feedback during my presentation. Additionally, I plan on rebooting this as my own personal project once KSP 0.9 drops, so any feedback I can get can be applied to the newer iteration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers fellas,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-CobaltWolf\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T10:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with feedback is, you often only get it when people have something bad to say (particularly on the Internet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a section that says [this post is unfinished], but if you pulled that out no one would notice and it would look fine.
