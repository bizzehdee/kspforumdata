Happy operational anniversary!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSA is becoming a \u0022mature\u0022 agency now and that helps because it doesn\u0027t tweet or generate content nearly as much on a daily basis as it used to back in the earlier years, however at the same time the complexity of the operations has also increased. The pandemic these past few months and me being unable to do my \u0022real job\u0022 coaching gymnastics and thus spending nearly all my time at home has also brought about a startling realization: this whole project is taking up a lot more time nowadays than it used to. In earlier years I would have at least 2-3 weeks of lead time, sometimes as much as 2-3\u003Cem\u003E months\u003C/em\u003E and now I\u0027m struggling to keep ahead by just a few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is another consideration however - the whole pandemic situation has also brought me closer to friends online since regular in-person gatherings aren\u0027t really a thing anymore lately. Ironically this has eaten up time as well because it\u0027s easier to get together online to play games than it is to coordinate IRL meetups. So before Covid I was spending less time hanging with friends but getting more from the in-person interaction so I felt less compelled to connect to them online often, freeing up more time for me to work on KSA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if I free up more time from gaming with my friends online that will help me stay ahead when lead time grows short but another upcoming problem will be when financial assistance for unemployment related to Covid dries up over the next few months. If I return to the gym to coach or search out some other employment opportunity because I need the money to sustain myself then that is once again less time I have to spend on this project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf time becomes an issue, as I have said before I will be forced to scale back the timeline and scope of this project in order to allow it to continue. Updates will become fewer, background story elements will fade away, crew will develop less character and time between launches will be extended so that I have more time to prepare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA final consideration for how much time I have to work on KSA activities is contributions from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.patreon.com/KerbalSpaceAgency\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPatreon\u003C/a\u003E. Obviously if I can make enough money through here that I don\u0027t have to spend as much time coaching or traveling away to fireworks shows then that is more time I can spend on this project instead. Currently I\u0027m making just enough to cover the monthly $10 payment I make to prolific KSP mod author LinuxGuruGamer, who in keeping various mods alive also helps keep the KSA project moving forward with new KSP versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I of course hope my personal situation and the pandemic situation stabilizes in the near future, I also doubt it\u0027s going to happen - especially considering this upcoming U.S. election. I remain committed however to not voluntarily giving up the project. I take a lot of enjoyment seeing people react to what the KSA is doing and I thank everyone who has reached out to me over the years with comments and suggestions or even attempted to take part in the role play. It does mean a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really looking forward to making it back to orbit over this coming year and continuing on this journey with you all. Thanks for following along and please don\u0027t forget to help spread the word about the KSA\u0027s existence!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-14T07:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103177-drew-kerman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022103177\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103177-drew-kerman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Drew Kerman\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0take your time!
