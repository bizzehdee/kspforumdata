The lab situation here is unbelievably primitive, not to mention that we had to pack up and move some very delicate long-term experiments. These are things we could have left behind if our science team hadn\u0027t been sent to do maintenance and janitorial work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald was rapping his knuckles on the edge of his desk. The call with Verly had been going on for too long, and he was silently questioning if he should have bothered keeping communications satellites in M\u00FCnar orbit all these years. Or maybe he should\u0027ve sent all the old crews to Dres instead. Of course Rosuki\u0027s kerbals would push back against his agenda. They weren\u0027t ignorant, and by now understood they had no parts to play going forward. It was nothing personal, really, just matters of business and trust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Your concerns have been noted my dear. Now...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not your anything, you old snot. Where\u0027s Rosuki? We haven\u0027t heard anything from here since she landed. Can you put her on instead?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Your boss is indisposed. As we\u0027ve discussed repeatedly, until she recovers from her issues there is nothing...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, nothing more you can do except relay my concerns to her, blah, blah, blah. Look, we get it. You took over. It\u0027s your show. We can still work together, there\u0027s no reason to fight like this, but we at least need to be honest with each other.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald smiled, a gesture completely lost on a radio call. Honesty, of course. Why hadn\u0027t he thought of that. Obviously these kerbals would all play along perfectly nicely if he told them that he was planning to abandon them and fly off into the dark between the stars.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As I was about to ask before you interrupted me, what do you need to bring the M\u00FCnar operations back to full capacity? Food, water, air, laboratory resources? How are your fuel reserves? Monoprop?\u0022 The call was empty and filled with static for a few moments, and it sounded as though Verly was shuffling around near her microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll have a full manifest sent back, but we could use another fuel depot, or at least a resupply for the ones we have. Especially if you\u0027re bringing a bunch of new landers out here to drink from our tanks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Done. Anything else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, that\u0027ll do for the immediate future.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me I have some pressing matters to attend to prior to my launch. We\u0027ll continue this discussion once my teams and myself have transferred out to your station.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood. Pequoni 2 Out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned off the microphone and unplugged it. The handful of papers he had scattered across his desk were gathered up and returned to their file. The file itself was slipped into one of his desk drawers. His office door opened just as he closed and locked the drawer. The members of the Continuum Council walked in and closed the door behind them. Right on schedule. Cartina Kerman, former tourist and the public face of the Space Program, Munlin Kerman, monk and representative from the \u0022The Order of Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society\u0022, and of course Gene Kerman and Wernher von Kerman, his two most trusted advisors. They each took their place in seats opposite from him. Gene and Wernher were already wearing their flight suits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You two are certainly eager to go back up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene answered in the affirmative and smiled. \u0022Nothing like it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Indeed.\u0022 Jonbald folded his hands and let them rest on his desk. \u0022Shall we begin? The plan as it stands now is for our three teams to proceed directly to The M\u00FCn. Gene\u0027s team will land at the abandoned Pioneer M\u00FCn Base and prepare it for habitation, while Wernher and myself will land directly at the site. We expect this expedition to take no less than a full year to complete, excavation and repairs or recovery of the object included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As such, this will be our last face to face meeting for some time. Once we have secured the crash site, I do not intend to leave the craft or return to Kerbin until we have completed our objectives. Cartina, that will leave you in command of all operations here on the surface. You have proven yourself more than up to the task.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Munlin, you are welcome to remain at the Space Center or return to your order, whatever is needed. We will be in contact when we need your assistance or advice.\u0022 The monk nodded, but did not answer. Typical.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well then, let\u0027s get going. Three of us have a flight to catch.\u0022 He chuckled and flashed a half-fake smile. No objections were raised, so he adjourned the meeting and bid Cartina and Munlin farewell. Gene and Wernher made their way back to the astronaut ready room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce they were gone he paced around his office one last time, making certain he was leaving nothing which would be needed on The M\u00FCn. His office was mostly just for appearances anyway, filled with the odd book and random assortment of broken tools, his attachment to anything \u0022real\u0022 having been broken many cycles ago. He tried to remember what it was like, back when he was just a regular astrokerb. Landing on the M\u00FCn, assembling space stations with his hands and a few simple tools. He stared out of his window at the distant mountains and allowed his memories to wander. Had it really been so long ago?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he turned back from the window he jumped at the sight awaiting him, one of the few times in his life he had been startled by anything. One doesn\u0027t expect to see three monks standing in the center of their own locked office. Unnerving, how they always appear out of nothing. Now that he thought about it, it was entirely possible Munlin hadn\u0027t left. Yet he was absolutely certain Archibald and this third, otherwise unknown monk were not there before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Archibald. My apologies, that was rather a shock you gave me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. Perhaps it will awaken you to the danger you face and divert you from the course you have set.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what course would that be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchbald sighed. \u0022We\u0027ve been over this before. There is no need to twist your words, Jonbald, if that is who you still are. I have already given you a warning as a friend. Now I give you a warning as a gravely concerned monk, as a protector of Kerbin. If you insist on venturing to the crash on The M\u00FCn, if you attempt to recover it and use it to press your advantage, you will die.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. You are messing with things far beyond your understanding and control. Things deadlier than you have realized. For the sake of yourself and those under your command, turn back. Turn back now. This is the last warning I can give.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if I say no?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then I bid you farewell, old friend.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald looked down at the floor under his feet, briefly considered the request. What were keeping from him? All he wanted was help Kerbin escape from its own gravity. To venture out into the void, sail between the stars, leave the cradle behind, all the usual desires of adventure and exploration. To return home. Their real home. To return to the stars. How could that be so terrible as to bring ruin to all of them? No, Archbald was not a murderer. The crash was not dangerous. He looked back up at his old fellow crewmate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very well, your concerns have been noted. And I promise you they are unfounded. Everything will be perfectly all right, perfectly safe. You will see.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchibald\u0027s eyes carried a heavy sadness, one not hidden by his faint smile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So be it. I have tried, but you will not see reason.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, I see your reason perfectly clear. You are afraid I might expose your lies, your decades of manipulation. \u0027Worlds First\u0027 indeed. No, I will no longer play along with your game, whatever it is. Do give Rosuki my regards, won\u0027t you? And let her know her crews are asking after her.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will do as you ask. Goodbye, Jonbald.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Likewise, my dear old friend. We\u0027ll talk again once I have finished my work on The M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wish it could be so.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArchibald bowed, as did the other two, and they retreated from Jonbald\u0027s office. Empty threats, veiled dangers. Shadows and whispers of shadows. Never a direct answer. Nonsense, all of it. He knew what to expect with the crash, he himself had been in the one up North. This one was no different, no more dangerous than a sleeping infant. He gathered his belongings, little as they were, and made his way through the astronaut complex to join Gene and Wernher in the ready room. It would be good to be back in null gravity. Up there, up where everything was perfectly safe. \u0022Nothing like it,\u0022 as Gene had said. Nothing like it indeed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETitanium Y-8\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft rolled out to the launchpad over night, as had become standard for Titanium launches. It was just now finishing its fuelling, and the ground crews had moved the crew loading gantry into position. The Titanium Y-8 flight would be the fourth full mission for this Ti-Y1 spacecraft, quite possibly the most reuse any spaceplane had ever seen. Jonbald certainly couldn\u0027t remember any which had been to space and back four times. And this was to be another routine mission, just with a short year-long berthing for the Ti-Y1 at Copper Station as they all rode Irons out to The M\u00FCn.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKadun was once again piloting the craft, the flight computer once more directly commanding the ascent. Jonbald joined her in the cockpit, Gene and Wernher secured themselves into their seats in the passenger compartment. The ground crews rolled back the boarding gantry and gave the signal once they were clear of the blast zone. Jonbald watched Kadun work through the final pre-flight checklist with the controllers in MC-1. It was interesting to see the process from both sides, having witnessed the Titanium Y-6 launch from inside MC-1 and now the Titanium Y-8 from the inside. Once the checklist was complete, Kadun secured the clipboard, gave them all a thumbs up, and flipped a toggle switch on her flight console. The equivalent switch was soon flipped by a controller in MC-1, and the flight computer started counting down from 10. One final callout from their interim flight director, some motivational message Jonbald was too wired to remember, and off they roared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1065_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1065_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1069_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.83\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1069_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1070_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1070_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was rather a bit louder than he had expected, especially for a single-engine craft. In all his previous flights the main engines had been at the far end of the rocket, separated entirely from the crew capsule. Nice, quiet rides, if a bit bumpy. He was trying to remember what his last launch was exactly. Obair 2? The mission to build Baile Speir and its hardened communications system? Most likely. Either way both it and his M\u00FCn mission launch aboard the Fios 3 were both much quieter and less turbulent than the Ti-Y-8.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it was an effect of pushing their huge fuel reserves in front of the craft as they ascended? No, it was still a winged rocket, no matter where the fuel was. Center of mass was still in a properly engineer place, moving backwards as they burned through their fuel reserves. Just two wings and the most powerful single engine they could build. The turbulence became a rough shake as the craft passed through the sound barrier, then retreated back to just an annoyance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s weird.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe remark was little more than a whisper in his headset. Jonbald glanced over at Kadun, hoping she would explain herself. That\u0027s when he noticed she wasn\u0027t wearing a helmet. No wonder he could barely hear her over the radio. Not many kerbals would be comfortable enough to ride a kerbal-built craft into orbit without a helmet firmly secured to their neck ring, but there she was. He\u0027d picked a real winner; cavalier, borderline crazy, and right good pilot, and loyal to a fault. She tapped at some gauge on her console, trying to coax a better reading out of it. He flashed a question handsign at her, open palm facing and motioning upwards, asking what was up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Off course slightly.\u0022 She pointed outside to the left. \u0022Might have something to do with....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1071_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.83\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1071_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1072_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.83\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1072_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1082_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1082_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had happened fast, too fast. The ringing in his ears was louder than the bang which had preceded it. One second he was listening to Kadun, the next his helmet was pinned to the bulkhead to his right. The loud crack it gave off at impact was drowned out only by the sound of the universe ending. Outside he could see a cloud of thick vapour, its periphery burning a sickly orange colour. Inside, Kadun\u0027s neck was cocked at an odd angle, her body pulled to the very limits of her acceleration couch\u0027s straps. Her left hand somehow made its way back to the flightstick while her right clawed toward the switch to disengage the flight computer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe computer disengaged itself first, all its screens and alarms and alerts going dark at once. Only the manual and independent systems continued their assault on his senses. It was likely the computer had broken from the g-forces, or even the sheer violence of the event. The bang. The slap. The noise. The spin was lessening, Kadun\u0027s neck returning to its proper shape. Kadun absentmindedly finished her sentence while wrestling the craft into her control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022... Something to do with the shimmy we picked up at 5k ASL. What in the world was that?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1090_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1090_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe could feel the g-forces subside as the violent tumble became a gentle drift, but his helmet was still stuck to the bulkhead. He could barely move. Acting without thinking he used his hands to release his straps, unlatch his helmet, and then slip free from his entangled headwear. His guts twisted when he saw why it wouldn\u0027t move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA shard of some unknown debris had punctured the side of the cockpit, speared his helmet, and even slashed apart the right ear of his headset. It had missed his head by millimeters. Had he not been looking at Kadun... he didn\u0027t want to think about it. He pressed his feet up against the bulkhead and pulled his helmet free. Free from the grasp of his helmet, the shrapnel was shot out into memory, the pressure differential between the cockpit and the outside atmosphere propelling it at an incredible speed. A glob of the ship\u0027s self-healing gel quickly filled the V-shaped hole it left behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was silent now, no engines or turbulence or other disturbances. They were in freefall. The ringing in his ears was starting to fade. The computer screens caught his eyes as they blinked and flashed back to life, showing their default boot message. \u0022Advanced flight instruments for every conceivable occasion.\u0022 They just as quickly went blank. For every occasion except this one, he thought. The helmet turned over in his hands, and he ran his fingers over the hole in its side. This elicited a surprised whistle from Kadun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Close shot you took there hoss.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1092_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.92\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1092_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed. Too close. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. \u0022Status?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not good. At a guess I\u0027d say the main engine exploded, taking the jets and our vertical stabilizers with it. Lots of dead systems back there, bunch of red lights on my board. Hydraulic systems are leaking, so we\u0027ve probably got a big hole back there somewhere. The good news is we still have both wings, our elevators and ailerons work, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is intact. At least the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E up here at the front of the ship. The bad news is that won\u0027t matter much when we hit the ocean here in about four minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can glide. Glide back to the space center.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not with the back half of the craft missing we can\u0027t. Too out of whack, too front-heavy. But I think I have enough control and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep our nose up high enough to make a splashdown survivable. At least for some of us. Maybe even get us near that island.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald slotted his helmet back onto his neck ring and latched it into place. They may not be going to space today, but he\u0027d not want to be without it when they hit the water. Even with the giant hole in the back of it. He gave Kadun a thumbs up and passed her own helmet to her from behind the seat. She slotted it in and latched it without complaint. He motioned again to get her attention, unsure if his headset still worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you need me to do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right now boss, the only thing you can do is get in the back, get strapped in, and let me wrestle this angry steer into the ocean.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d be of more assistance up here. I\u0027m a pilot too, you know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not a very good one, sir. No offense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022None taken. But I insist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You can insist for about thirty more seconds, after that I\u0027ll throw you back there myself. When we hit that ocean, these two front windshields are going to come flying into this cockpit at half the speed of sound, with a wall of water chasing after them like a bad shot of whiskey. We both know how that story ends, so no more arguments. Got it? Go, now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe opened the hatch to the passenger compartment to find two scared faces looking back at him. Wernher\u0027s glasses were floating freely around inside of his helmet, having been knocked loose from the force of the explosion. Gene\u0027s eyes might have been doing the same, based on the dazed look. He turned to Kadun one last time, patted her on the shoulder, and started to say something before she interrupted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank me when you swim up onto that island safe and alive. Now get going before we hit the soup.\u0022 She shifted slightly in her seat as he turned and made his way into the rear cabin. \u0022Sir? It\u0027s been a pleasure.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Likewise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1143_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.83\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1143_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180401_ksp1147_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180401_ksp1147_ti-y-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene and Wernher both started speaking at the same time, talking over each other on the ship\u0027s main channel. He waved downwards to silence them, pointing towards the seats behind them and tapping at his headset while walking past. Wernher looked positively comical with his glasses bouncing around inside his helmet. Finally, once he was strapped in and ready, he asked them to speak slowly and repeat their questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey both spoke on top of each other again, but soon Wernher went quiet and Gene got in a coherent question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What happened?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing good. Main engine exploded. We\u0027re going to hit the ocean, and hard. Kadun is going to try to glide us down as best she can. Splash land. Make sure you\u0027re strapped in.\u0022 He checked his straps again before continuing. \u0022Wernher, secure your glasses. Last thing we need is a half blind chief engineer with an eyepatch.\u0022 His helmet was off and back on again in record time, after which Wernher tried to hand his spectacles back to Jonbald.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What am I supposed to do with those? No, put them someplace you won\u0027t lose them. Someplace they won\u0027t get crushed.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe turbulence was back. They had hit the soup, as Kadun had called it. It felt rougher than normal, the newly-jagged edges of the Titanium almost certainly to blame. Kadun would occasionally lose her wrestling match against the aircraft, causing the nose to drop down violently. Then they would be out of the dive and back to \u0022gliding\u0022. At least she was keeping the craft falling in the same direction, and not challenging it into a flat spin. With no tail it would be easy to become a discus.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe noise made him think the turbulence would rip the craft into shreds before they got anywhere near the ocean. The airframe must be in better shape than it sounded, the wings must still be fully intact. Otherwise the craft would be pulling to one side or the other. The noises were haunting. Low whistles that slowly climbed into higher frequencies as though they were accelerating downwards. He knew it was just the increasing air pressure and the holes in the hull whistling. Mocking them as they fell to their fates. Jonbald chuckled when he realized they had made the world\u0027s most expensive flying flute.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, this wasn\u0027t the time to laugh. Was the air mixture getting to him? Maybe. This was serious. Not funny. Serious. As serious as jumping out of a perfectly good spaceplane without a parachute. The idea scratched at the back of his mind. Parachute. Clawed at it. Parachute. Demanded an audience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wernher?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ja?\u0022 The fear in Wernher\u0027s voice was palpable. Shaky. Scared. Of course he was. He had every right to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve got an idea. Something new for you to work on when we get to the space center.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It can wait?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I suppose it can. Just remind me later, okay?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Prepare for impact.\u0022 Kadun, her voice projected forcefully into each of their ears. \u0022Ten seconds to ocean.\u0022 She counted down, maybe even skipping a number here or there. She said \u0022seven\u0022 twice, or did she? He wasn\u0027t sure. Time stretched off into infinity, ten seconds became ten lifetimes. It all spread out before him, just as in all the movies and stories of near-death experiences. \u0022Six.\u0022 His first trips to the orbit. His mission to The M\u00FCn, landing alone. Baile Speir. \u0022Five.\u0022 The return to Kerbin after the program had gone silent. The police. The asylum. \u0022Four.\u0022 The new space program. The monks, older than even himself. The Orbital Sciences Division, his first project for Continuum. The North Pole Expedition. The crashed UFO. Working in the shadows for years. \u0022Three.\u0022 Kanawha, Elite and her crazy plans. Hiding in plain sight as a flight systems programmer, then a radio technician, then hiding in the north. \u0022Two.\u0022 Rosuki, the cataclysm, the purge, the Council. All of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis stomach dropped suddenly, as though it had fallen clear through the rest of him and out onto the floor. Kadun had pulled the Titanium up hard one last time, the airframe screamed in protest. So this was it. Falling, broken, bloodied. Knocked right out of the Titanium Sky. His sky. He looked outside and saw nothing but water. Endless, infinite water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Brace! Brace!!

I think that\u0027s part of The Park\u0027s design. Somebody kills all of us off, it just makes more. Somebody makes too many of us, it just recycles a few to keep the balance. Remember, we were just toys to these self-anointed gods who built us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, I think these guys,\u0022 he raised his arms to indicate the rest of the crew, \u0022and all the rest of us stranded wayward souls are somehow in the way. And maybe beyond his reach or his absolute control. The more worlds we get stranded on, the more of us end up Forgotten, maybe he loses just that much more control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, so what then? We can\u0027t trust him enough to go to his moon, and we can\u0027t stay here without him meddling in everything. Do we just wait for him to give up and die of severe old age?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, we\u0027re the same age, me and him. Only I was in hibernation for 95 years and he doesn\u0027t look all that much worse for wear. I don\u0027t think waiting him out is an option.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know exactly. Maybe we move everyone to space. Live in big spinning shelters like dandelions seeds floating on the breeze. I have no idea how many we would need to move every kerbal off planet, but I\u0027m guessing it\u0027d take most of our lifetimes just to get a millionth of them into orbit anyway. So that\u0027s probably out of the question. And to be honest, I\u0027m not really sure how this plan of Albro\u0027s to get all of us to Espadarte will work either. Seems like a huge undertaking just to find all these old broken portals and fix them, and then we\u0027d have to move millions of kerbals through them. The logistics just don\u0027t make sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, we need something else. And maybe it\u0027s too big for just us. We\u0027re talking a planetary-scale engineering project here. If he\u0027s serious about this, and it\u0027s not just some ruse to get us to flip some switch he can\u0027t reach that allows him to do whatever it is he really wants, I don\u0027t see how me, the four of us, this entire crew, or everyone we\u0027ve ever known could somehow make it work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shard was dimming, its perfect note was becoming faint and distant. Thomlock held the sample container and watched intently as the bright green receded back towards its dull translucence. The green of it reflected in his eyes while its soft spin sent waves of light across his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No matter what we do, I think it\u0027s time we stopped running.
