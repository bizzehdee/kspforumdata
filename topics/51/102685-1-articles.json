I clicked it by accident, the numbers looked great and I didn\u0027t realize what I was up to. So I sent in my first little ship, just to realize this asteroid was huge and I didn\u0027t bring enough power or fuel or anything to handle it. I didn\u0027t have any problems capturing it. It\u0027s fiddling with the manouver nodes, which is tricky, because there are a few bugs (I can\u0027t click more than 5 times on the \u0022do on the next orbit\u0022 button until it resets. So time warping and trying).\n\nWhat did I learn? When handling big stuff, bring heavy tools. The mission got me around 3 million credits and I spent 2 million for the ship. It uses 28 LV-Ns, weighs 718 tons and has over 12000 dV, which was a bit too much 10000 would\u0027ve done. With it\u0027s launcher the start weight was 5000t. I bet there are more efficent ways to get this beast up, but I haven\u0027t found them yet.\n\nMost important things: \n\n- Pull, don\u0027t push. I made several tries with pushing, until I saw a post here where somebody pulled. Works much better.\n- Bring enough RCS with you, put many RCS thrusters at the end (or at the top, depends on where you\u0027re pointing ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) to stabilize, because if you don\u0027t hit the center of gravity very very precise it will wobble. And I never made a very precise grab. In fact I tried several times and I always slipped away. Unlocking the grabber so it can tilt didn\u0027t do the trick. Luckily I had plenty of RCS with me and let SAS do the rest.\n- It took me around an hour after grabbing the asteroid to get it out of the system. Bring time!\n\nJust for the fun of it I made a safe game and then \u0022landed\u0022 the asteroid on Kerbin. Very satisfying after weeks of fiddeling around to get the ship right and then get it up into orbit... (Did you know? These things leave no crater and roll around like boulders... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\nSo, whatever you do, if you see this contract, try to complete it. I\u0027ve learned a lot. Also thanks to the rest of the forum, without some hints from different threads I wouldn\u0027t be able to write this."},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:44:26Z","Content":"Would this be a task suitable for a gravity assist?

Everything I have read though suggests that the trick with the big ones is to pull, not push. That of course means you have to somehow keep the engine exhausts from hitting the asteroid.

I think key is to use an engine cluster and tweak the thrust limiters to fine-tune the balance. Also consider \u0022control sections\u0022, little probes with a claw, reaction wheels, and maybe RCS that you dot about the asteroid. Finally be patient when slewing the asteroid around - turn SAS off, build a little speed, and wait for it to drift onto its target heading.\n\nIf I were trying to eject a rock from the solar system I\u0027d opt for gravity assists. In an ideal world you can ping-pong off Eve and Kerbin until you get your apoapsis out to Jool which will easily fling you into interstellar space. However with a large and heavy asteroid tug getting the precision for gravity assists may be hard. A single powered flyby of Kerbin will take around 1000 m/s of delta-V to get a Jool encounter, vs 1800 m/s for a direct boot out of the system, and may be more manageable."},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T13:18:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Most important things: \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - It took me around an hour after grabbing the asteroid to get it out of the system.
