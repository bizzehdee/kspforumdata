I have used the Maritime Pack for the entry and sort of commented on the pictures, don\u0027t know what you will think about the comments though. I have got two imgur albums which should be embedded, nontheless you can click to go to imgur for the full images, i don\u0027t really mind. Everything should be explained, if not, too bad the albums will provide enough information. Anyways enjoy, or click through it furiously at which point you should ask yourself: \u0022why am I looking at it at all?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetup:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Cy8h4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
