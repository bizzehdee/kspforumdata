I think I\u0027m going to roughly estimate that each kerbal needs about a thousand snacks to get to Duna, which in theory should last them for over 300 days! In practice, I plan to also ship with a full ore hold that I can convert to food or fuel as needed, as kind of an insurance policy. The interplanetary vessel also *should* have enough recycling to give two kerbals \u0022free lunches\u0022, so in theory if I pack 6000 food I should have enough for eight kerbals to cycle over to Duna on my first transfer. I have just over 4000 food storage on the transfer vessel, and over 3000 on the rover itself, but after my math fell apart on my trip to Minmus I just have a hard time trusting my Kerbals not to eat themselves to death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause my soil recyclers all seem to be hab modules, my deep space vehicle effortlessly fits five kerbals comfortably, or eleven in a pinch, and under normal flight conditions each crew member gets their own individual Buffalo Short Crew Cabin (except the pilot, who apparently sleeps in the cockpit). It\u0027s hard to compete with the Buffalo Short for recycler mass efficiency; it recycles 0.5 kerbal-waste-days per day (if I understand how soil works) and the cabin plus an airlock weigh just half a ton dry and can also store 600 snacks, which is enough for just about 0.5 kerbal-transfers! That means two short cabins should comfortably be able to transfer two kerbals to Duna. In theory, anyway. First I have to get SLV 2 into space and load my final crew complement. I\u0027m thinking Val and an engineer aboard the Diplomatic Vessel, and Bill, Bob, and Jeb on the rover plus a miner, a farmer, and a kolonist.

SLV-2 launched with what I expect to be a surplus of delta-V; it must first encounter SLV-1 then tug the rover to Minmus for final refueling and snack resupply before hitting the D240 Duna window (with a lot of leeway because really, if fuel were the limiting factor I could just head to Jool and visit all the muns).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnacks! says that with 11 crew on board I have enough snacks at 20% capacity (mostly all from the snacks the rover had previously mined) for about 80 days, which means this setup should, in theory, have 400 days of snacks for the 11 kerbals on full tanks, which is promising because for my second flight I can probably bring on the order of 30 or 40 kerbals over. I expect an empty NPM of about one ton per kerbal, roughly, if I only consider snacks, which with other considers means I should be able to bring at least 20 kerbals per launch.

The stuff is amazing on paper but between the fantastic power requirements and the fact that it never seems to perform up to snuff, I think it\u0027s best as a secondary propulsion unit for my main ships. Even with 31000 electric charge and an additional 86000 capacitance (click the capacitors or use an action group to discharge them quickly, and then they charge slowly over time) AND with 500 charge per second between two nuclear plants and a really big solar array, my deep space vessel\u00A0only gets about 200 meters per second of full thrust and then it has to throttle down to 20% power output.

If the food survived at least 24 days to D375, she could unlock the rest of the food early, but if it survived less than 24 days she\u0027d have to ration out the remainder, flirting with mutiny by starving her loyal expedition a day at a time. By transferring food out only every other day, she hoped to give the reprocessors time to produce more Snacks from the recycled soil; every soil container was full and more was being produced that had to be jettisoned, so every bit of soil that could be recycled meant a better chance of the expedition surviving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xqTIYGf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xqTIYGf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/190611-sturmhauke/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022190611\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/190611-sturmhauke/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sturmhauke\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Not sure if that disqualifies my DRO, but if my Kerbals all starve to death (my snacks settings make them starve after missing 30 meals, which should be about 10 days) then that is mission failure.
