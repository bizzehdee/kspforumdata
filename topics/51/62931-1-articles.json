The cost of the mission is kept low by not taking along all of the propellant required to return from Mars. Instead, only some liquid hydrogen is brought along, and the hydrogen is used to produce the return-trip propellants from the carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere. I will do the same thing for a kerbal Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep one was the launch of Kerbin Return Vehicle 1 (KRV1). This vehicle has no crew on board. The KRV masses 15.7 tons (23.2 tons with its nuclear transfer stage). To launch this payload, I\u0027m using a variation of my Reusable Rocket with just two side boosters, since this provides plenty of lift capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XyB07B3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XyB07B3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe side boosters were dropped while the rocket is less than 5 kilometers up, still traveling vertically, so the boosters would drop straight back down to be recovered at the KSC (well...they would if the game didn\u0027t despawn them, but that\u0027s hardly my fault).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AtHGaGe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AtHGaGe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket can place the payload into orbit without having to use the nuclear transfer stage at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/efTDQiv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022efTDQiv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sustainer has sufficient fuel remaining to return from orbit and land at the KSC under rocket power.

Tank #1 is a Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank that contained the propellant for the nuclear transfer stage that would be used for the trip to Duna. Tank #2 (there are two of them) is a small FL-T100 Fuel Tank that contained the propellant for deorbiting and landing on Duna. The tanks for the return trip (#4 is an X200-8 tank, and #5 is one of two FL-T200 tanks on either side) were tweaked to be empty before launch. The four FL-T400 Fuel Tanks (#3 marks two of them in the image) contained the liquid hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZsFdpdO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZsFdpdO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the surface of Duna, the liquid hydrogen will be used to create liquid methane and liquid oxygen to fill the return tanks (#4 and two #5 tanks). The Sabatier reaction is used to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide from Duna\u0027s atmosphere, creating methane fuel and water. The water is then hydrolyzed into oxygen (which is liquified and stored as oxidizer in tanks #4 and #5) and hydrogen, which goes back into the Sabatier equipment. The power for these reactions and refrigeration comes from the nuclear reactor slung underneath the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KRV will require 6 tons of methane/LOX to return to Kerbin. Different sources online tell me that this would require between 0.43 and 0.5 tons of hydrogen as feedstock. Because of its low density, liquid hydrogen would require a little more than the volume of three FL-T400 tanks... so I have included four of those tanks (#3 marks two of those on the diagram) and tweaked them to contain no oxidizer and a small amount of liquid fuel equal in mass to the hydrogen it represents. Basically, it takes roughly the same volume of tanks to hold the liquid hydrogen as it does to hold the much greater resulting mass of the methane/LOX propellants. Assuming I calculated this right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, we see the trans-Duna trajectory required about 1033 m/s of delta-V, which required about 6 minutes 40 seconds of burn by the nuclear transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LJeCwc5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LJeCwc5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FIGe0vP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FIGe0vP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small plane-shift maneuver was done enroute to Duna, and then the much smaller burn shown below to target the ship for an aerocapture at Duna. I\u0027m using the Precision Node mod to set up my burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rSNYUQn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rSNYUQn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the KRV1 dropped into the Duna system. Note that if Ike gives you problems when coming into the Duna system, it\u0027s just a matter of using a burn with a retrograde/prograde component to change the time of your ship\u0027s arrival in the Duna system, along with a radial component to adjust the periapsis distance. This is most efficient to do (propellant-wise) when far from Duna. I did that targeting after I made the plane-shift burn out at the descending node (see earlier orbit trajectory plot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oXn2MGl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oXn2MGl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerocapture was slow enough that there were no entry flames visible... but I did include a token heat shield to protect the lander\u0027s more sensitive components. I\u0027m sure that in the Mars Direct plan, they meant to drop in directly to Mars, but I chose to stop off in Duna orbit to make targeting my landing easier. The initial aerocapture put the payload in an orbit with a 1000 km apoapsis. I did a burn there to raise the periapsis for a couple subsequent aerobraking passes, followed by a final burn of the transfer stage to put the ship into a roughly circular, equatorial orbit at about 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yiVqwnq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yiVqwnq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KRV1 was separated from the transfer stage, and then it fired its two Rockomax 48-7S engines (through gaps in the heat shield) to place the lander on a trajectory to one of the lowland basins on Duna. (I chose this particular spot because it was the first place I ever landed on Duna in my original save-game, so I wanted to see how it looks nowadays.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9dk6bAF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229dk6bAF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AleM2lo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AleM2lo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, there were no visible entry flames. Somewhere around 8,000 meters, the drogue chutes were deployed. When the drogues opened fully at 2,500 meters AGL, the heat shield was dropped and then the main parachutes were deployed in reefed condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/agCObFr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022agCObFr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V2AE9Kn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V2AE9Kn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe eight main chutes were tweaked to stagger their full-deployment in pairs between 700 and 500 meters AGL. Below, the two Rockomax 48-7S engines were fired to slow the final descent of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mf6OWqB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mf6OWqB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Kerbin Return Vehicle 1 safely landed on Duna with Ike looking on overhead. The KRV1 then began the job of transforming its liquid hydrogen into methane/LOX propellant. There is a jet intake on the side of the ship to represent the compressor for taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. To represent the nuclear reator that powers this process, I used a nuclear engine (slung under the bottom of the lander) with its nozzle part covered in plates and doo-dads to represent the power conversion apparatus. Some other parts like xenon tanks and solar panel containers on top of the landing engine pods, as well as unseen equipment located behind plates below the #4 tank, represent the chemical processing equipment that performs the Sabatier, electrolysis, and refrigeration steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0qj7sHd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220qj7sHd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may be wondering why I have the \u0022nuclear reactor\u0022 mounted on wheels. Some of the Mars Direct diagrams I\u0027ve seen show that the reactor would be positioned in a nearby crater to protect the astronauts from the radiation from the reactor (which has very little in the way of shielding to save weight), with a long power cord running from the reactor to the lander. So my reactor is on wheels so that it can be positioned in a safe location. I don\u0027t have any power cord mod, but you can picture a long power cord in the images below if it makes you happy. Or, you can go with the alternate explanation that the reactor is kept attached during the chemical processing operations, and is later separated and driven away to a safe location before the astronauts arrive to use the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear reactor was positioned some distance away (the inverse square law is your friend when dealing with radiation) behind a large boulder. It could have been driven much further away if that would make anybody happier, but be very careful driving this rover! It must drive slowly or it can tip over. This is not an exploration rover...just a method of slowly relocating the reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Om3GeYN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Om3GeYN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TWk5aNC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TWk5aNC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the reactor hides behind a rock so that it is not in direct sight of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UIXjxID.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UIXjxID.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly after the KRV1 vehicle reports that it has generated all the fuel needed for ascent (I just went in and edited the save file so that the ascent tanks were full of propellants and the hydrogen tanks were empty) does the crew leave for Duna. Below is the Duna Habitat Unit launching with our brave heroes, pilot Raywin Kerman and scientist Kenlin Kerman, on board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UGU8vt2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UGU8vt2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DHU1 payload and its transfer stage are boosted into Kerbin orbit by a two-side-booster Reusable Rocket a few days before the opening of the Duna transfer window. Below we see the aerodynamic nose cone being jettisoned after the side boosters have been dropped back to the KSC. Those of you who love aerodynamic fairings may, of course, feel free to imagine my payloads enclosed in such... but I\u0027m only using stock structural parts here (even if I\u0027m doing non-stock things with them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mCtlQnJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mCtlQnJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, a closer look at the Duna Habitat Unit on its transfer stage in Kerbin orbit. The crew of two has plenty of living space with a two-kerbal lander can and a 4-kerbal Hitchhiker module. Below that is the pressurized Duna exploration rover. This ship serves as the crew\u0027s habitat enroute to Duna and while on the surface of Duna. No doubt Raywin and Kenlin were giving their systems a thorough checking-over before committing to their voyage to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UthdeII.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UthdeII.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back at the KSC, the engineers were scrambling to get the next ship, Kerbin Return Vehicle 2, on the pad and ready to be sent to Duna during this same transfer window. The KRV2 is identical to the original KRV1 that is currently sitting on Duna. It could possibly be used by Raywin and Kenlin as a return ship (if something turns out to be wrong with the KRV1 lander), but it will otherwise be used by a future crew that will be sent to Duna after it has generated a full load of return propellants from its hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zphkH7b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zphkH7b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DHU1 and KRV2 were sent off to Duna one after the other. The DHU1 masses 13.3 tons, so it is lighter than the KRV ships, so it required a shorter burn to send it to Duna. This means that there is plenty of mass that could be added to the Habitat unit if you\u0027d like to send along more equipment or consumables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0IDtwmX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220IDtwmX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Mars Direct plan, the Habitat Unit is supposed to be separated from its transfer stage with the two sections connected together by a long cable. The two sections can then be spun around the common center of mass to provide artificial gravity. I don\u0027t have any mod for this cable, but I have represented it below with a little work in Photoshop. For the shorter trip required in the diminutive KSP system, I suppose they wouldn\u0027t bother with this. Also, I intend to use the transfer stage for some small orbital maneuvers at Duna, so I\u0027d have to reel it back in later and re-dock it for any burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L9CZHYq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L9CZHYq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the KRV2 arrived at Duna several days before the Habitat Unit (due to differences in trajectory), and it did the same aerocapture/aerobraking maneuvers that KRV1 used to get into low Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i1y2tzZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i1y2tzZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tS8FIUj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tS8FIUj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DHU1 habitat ship containing or heroes did the same aerocapture/aerobraking maneuvers to get into Duna orbit. Its maximum speed was about 1550 m/s, so it didn\u0027t show any exciting entry flame effects, but I imagine its token heat shield did its job well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BoBr8Yu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BoBr8Yu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer stage was jettisoned in Duna orbit, and then the retro engine (a single 48-7S) was used to deorbit the Habitat Unit and target it to the landing site of the KRV1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fNQKdOG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fNQKdOG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P9GFFof.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P9GFFof.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 5,000 meters, the heat shield was jettisoned and the six main chutes were deployed in reefed condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WKiqUh7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WKiqUh7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachutes were tweaked to deploy fully in pairs between 700 and 500 meters above ground level, and then the two 48-7S engines were used to soften the landing a couple hundred meters from the waiting KRV1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YCS56XM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YCS56XM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing, the pressurized rover was decoupled from the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ydwOG56.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ydwOG56.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe position of the KRV1\u0027s nuclear reactor was shifted a little to shield it from the location of the Habitat Unit (while still being mostly shielded from the location of the KRV1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NLXTjxh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NLXTjxh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Raywin and Kenlin get out for their historic first steps on the surface of Duna.
