I\u0027m not a pro, and I want other better people to how I do and get me few tips, advise while I progress.\n2. RP is something I like, and to combine it with a game I like, I just love it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n3.

I also put a section for my drafts and notes and other random stuffs related to this topic at the end of this post hidden inside a spoiler tag, I aim to share my views or ideas about this in order to make it more interesting... so ANYTHING you guys have on this or any new ideas or suggestions, just let me know.\n\n **RL updates:**\n\n\\* I am planning a mission per day at minimum, but I really apologize if a day happen without anything as I\u0027m kind of lost literally due to the massive pressure I got at work.. long story, but my job really sucks, but I love what I do though :S\n\n\\* On Friday, 3rd April my save file crashed... ALL of the career folder was crashed, so I thought that was it. luckily I have enabled versions backup on the whole career folder, so I was able to recover with only 1 mission lost which was the station, but I will relaunch it again (with some modifications ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)).\n\n**\\* April, 16/2015: Between 6th April, and yesterday 15th April, I had a sudden business trip that came at work on me and my colleagues, we had to be out of the city for few days to work and finish a new important and large project we got it after few weeks of debating... I will resume the activities on this post as soon as possible.**\n\n* * *\n\nSo enough talking, and here we go:\n\n**SaEman Space Agency**\n\nAfter that catastrophic disaster we had at our previous space center, we did not give up!... even with backers and shareholders are getting thin day by day, we are determined to prove that everyone was wrong about us! we will reboot our space program and we will make it shine everyday.\n\n**Program objectives:**\n\n- **=\u003E** Re-establish the space program after that catastrophic disaster\n- Build a low-orbit fueling station for interplanetary projects.\n- Build stable and life-sustaining Mun outpost.\n- Build a stable and life sustaining Duna outpost.\n- **=\u003E** Establish a solar system-wide communications and relay network.\n- Run experiments on Mun, Minmus various biomes.\n- Implement a 100% reusable shuttles and space crafts.\n- Perform researches and experiments on the atmosphere and gravity effects of Eve.\n- Research on the possibility of SSTO launches from Eve surface\n- Attempt a permanent life-sustaining base on Eve.\n\n**Latest activity:** **** [**\\* Press Con. #11 -

He proposed that the [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars) were just distant [suns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suns) surrounded by their own [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanets) and raised the possibility that these planets could even foster life of their own (a philosophical position known as [cosmic pluralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_pluralism)). He also insisted that the universe is in fact infinite and could have no celestial body at its \u0022center\u0022.\n\nBeginning in 1593, Bruno was tried for [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) by the [Roman Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition) on charges including denial of several core Catholic doctrines (including the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), the [divinity of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology), the [virginity of Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_%28mother_of_Jesus%29), and [Transubstantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation)). Bruno\u0027s [pantheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism) was also a matter of grave concern.[^\\[4\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-4) The Inquisition found him guilty, and in 1600 he was [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_by_burning) in Rome\u0027s [Campo de\u0027 Fiori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_de%27_Fiori). After his death he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as [a martyr for science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_thesis),[^\\[5\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-5) though scholars emphasize that Bruno\u0027s astronomical views were at most a small part of the theological and philosophical beliefs that led to his trial.[^\\[6\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-6)[^\\[7\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-7)[^\\[8\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-8) Bruno\u0027s case is still considered a landmark in the history of [free thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought) and the future of the emerging [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science).[^\\[9\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-gatti18-9)[^\\[10\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-montano1-10)[^\\[11\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-birx-11)\n\nDuring the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the [Tower of Nona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Nona). Some important documents about the trial are lost, but others have been preserved, among them a summary of the proceedings that was rediscovered in 1940.[^\\[26\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-26) The numerous charges against Bruno, based on some of his books as well as on witness accounts, included blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, and involved some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology. [Luigi Firpo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Firpo) lists these charges made against Bruno by the Roman Inquisition:[^\\[27\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-27)\n\n- holding opinions contrary to the [Catholic faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism) and speaking against it and its ministers;\n- holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), divinity of [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ), and [Incarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnation_%28Christianity%29);\n- holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith pertaining to [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) as Christ;\n- holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith regarding the [virginity of Mary, mother of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_%28mother_of_Jesus%29);\n- holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about both [Transubstantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation) and [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_%28Catholic_Church%29);\n- claiming the existence of a [plurality of worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_pluralism) and [their eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_of_the_world);\n- believing in [metempsychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metempsychosis) and in the [transmigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmigration_of_the_soul) of the human soul into brutes;\n- dealing in magics and divination.\n\n He was turned over to the secular authorities. On February 17, 1600, in the [Campo de\u0027 Fiori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campo_de%27_Fiori) (a central Roman market square), with his \u0022tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words\u0022, he was [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake).[^\\[29\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#cite_note-29) His ashes were thrown into the [Tiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber) river.
