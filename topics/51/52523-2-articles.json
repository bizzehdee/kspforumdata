He suffered moderate brain damage as a result- though for some reason, the space program still kept him on their launch rotation (interestingly enough, this Kerbal\u0027s \u0022Stupidity\u0022 rating actually did climb heavily after recovery from that mission- I\u0027m still not sure why...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I just hope something like that doesn\u0027t happen to me\u0022, was all Jebro could tell himself.

Most of our knowledge of biology is derived from observation of life here on Earth (the only planet or moon to support life that we yet know of), and personally, as a Biologist myself in real life, I am of the school of thought that most life elsewhere would also have similar metabolisms. This is a result of the chemical properties of different elements- only a few have the necessary qualities to enable their use in construction of molecules that could support life. That is, after all, why science fiction usually has Silicon or Nitrogen-based life if it\u0027s not based on Carbon- because those are the only two other elements that could even come close to the versatility of Carbon in constructing organic molecules (trust me, take a year of college-level Organic Chemistry and a year-and-a-half of college Biochemistry classes and labs, and then you\u0027ll understand...)

If you perform one or two gravity assists on the way to your target (keep an eye out for my next post- I performed a double gravity-assist with both the Mun and Minmus for the Duna Heavy Equipment Deployment Platform; and having already performed a Mun gravity assist for the Duna Crew Module, and am also planning to perform one with Minmus shortly...) then you can (and in fact should) break up the acceleration to escape Kerbin into multiple shorter burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best places to perform these burns are usually at a Periapsis with one of the gravitational bodies you encounter- due to the Oberth effect (you gain more energy from your thrust when you burn while moving at higher speeds). Especially if you perform a multiple-assist, you can end up with not just two or three, but four or more Periapsis points at which to ideally perform a burn. This is because the gravity assist with a body such as the Mun can easily slingshot you back towards a relatively close Periapsis with Kerbin given your speed- before you shoot out again towards the system\u0027s edge, with even higher speeds than when you left for the Mun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo,you can get great efficiency if you let gravity do the turning for you, and realize you don\u0027t always need to burn towards your final target (in fact, often it is advantageous to simply be burning prograde- even if that\u0027s in the opposite direction. If you plan it correctly, gravity will end up turning around the direction of that velocity for you)- after all, energy is conserved. Any energy you lose in kinetic energy (velocity) you will gain back in potential gravitational energy- assuming you don\u0027t enter any atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the entry angle and speed- that\u0027s entirely based on your transfer path. Even a very \u0022slow\u0022 transfer will have a lot of relative speed to the planet if it comes in at a 90-degree angle. On the other hand, a properly-angled high-velocity transfer can actually arrive with very little speed relative to the target. The ideal angle is around 45 degrees- and varies based on your velocity- too much less than that, and you will arrive with very little velocity relative to the target- which will mean you will need to accelerate just to avoid a direct collision. Too large of an angle, and you will shoot through the system at very high velocity- which will make it hard to slow down or plot an aerocapture maneuver (if your trajectory isn\u0027t already pointed towards one). Of course, the higher the velocity of your transfer orbit, the shallower your angle should be, and vise-versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hohmann transfers most players love so much are actually quite terrible in this regard. They tend to arrive at the target with very slow speeds relative to the Sun at that solar altitude (if moving outwards from Kerbol- very fast if moving inwards) AND very shallow angles relative to the target. The combination of these two factors means a VERY high velocity relative to the planet when you enter its Sphere of Influence (the planet is moving in the same direction, but much faster/slower than you)- exponentially more so the further away the planet is from Kebin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that being said, I do prefer to come in at a relatively fast velocity to the target- but pointed straight towards the planet so it\u0027s easy to do an aerocapture. That does put a lot of G\u0027s on my ship- bu I\u0027ve never had a ship fall apart on me doing it yet... Usually, if the ship can survive ascent from Kerbin, it can survive an aerocapture on Duna- I\u0027ve so far found... Of course, one of my Eagles *DID* snap in half during ascent- so I might use some of my rather huge Delta-V budget and thrust on the Eagle\u0027s transfer stage to slow down first... As for the colonization ships- I\u0027ll probably use a combined aerobrake with Duna and gravity-brake with Ike (which also happens to be my initial landing target for the Science Module), if I can line it up right... (I\u0027ve done it a couple times before, but it\u0027s definitely one of the hardest maneuvers to perform correctly)...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-23T06:52:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2013 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T07:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I meant to have this post up sooner, but a *cough* friend came to visit me at my apartment, and so I was busy with her for a while...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBriefly: I decided to show her KSP a bit before we got to *other things*, and performed a really quick suborbital flight to the polar ice caps as a demonstration for her (I was also lucky enough to land in the hard-to-fin \u0022Tundra\u0022 biome- and rack up a few Science Points- though it looked just like any other part of the ice caps to me.)

True to my description, I made use of a rather advanced form of gravity-assist for this transfer burn. It took very careful timing, and a bit of luck, but the rewards in Delta-V savings were significant. Which is good, because I had the Duna Science Module go for such a high-speed trajectory to Duna that it will arrive more than a day BEFORE any of the other modules- despite being the last to depart Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DSM expended all but about 3600 of its initial Delta-V budget of over 12,000 doing this (although I did accidentally dump quite a bit of fuel and oxidizer into space, not properly balancing the fuel tanks with TAC Fuel Balancer and letting the engines flame-out a couple times), but its transfer time after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI will only be about 18 days (for a total Mission Elapsed Time of about 29 days- the DSM spent quite bit of time in Low Kerbin Orbit)- which is awesome from a roleplaying perspective. My Kerbals won\u0027t have to spend too long in dangerous interplanetary space, getting bombarded by tons of solar radiation (and, if it were implemented yet in this version of KSP- risking getting hit by dangerous solar flares... Oooh, that\u0027s going to be FUN to see in a later version...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, here\u0027s a nice picture of the orbital map showing my entire flotilla of four gigantic ships (and my tiny damaged SensorSat from before- on far right) en-route to Duna.

Being in a low Munar orbit, it will also be conveniently within range of 100% reusable vessels propelled solely by Aluminum-Hybrid engines refueled on the Munar surface- which will eliminate the need to utilize more valuable LFO mix for transporting LFO and RocketParts produced on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun will form my main departure points for other points in the solar system; and while I wouldn\u0027t exactly call it a hospitable enough environment to consider my operations there a full-fledged \u0022colony\u0022- I will eventually establish a fully self-sufficient outpost capable of constructing rockets in orbit (and on the surface) destined for more distant locations like Duna and Jool...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is almost in position to begin Munar base-building at this point. I\u0027ll have RocketParts hauled on-board the Early Spacedock- which also serves as a large mobile construction platform; a couple extra Kerbal crew members onboard the Early Spacedock to staff new rockets with; and a decent amount of LFO mix I\u0027ll soon be hauling from the Munar surface (onboard the Munar Science Module- which will then be recycled, the eventual base to be constructed out of lower part-count structures without integrated engines or even command modules, except for a central command module for the entire base- which will all be interlinked by KAS connections.) the Munar Science Module is almost full of Oxidizer at this point, by the way, and ready to lift-off the Munar surface again when the Early Spacedock reaches orbit overhead.

I\u0027m sure by just over 3 months (game-time) after the arrival of the first ship (the Science Module) my Duna colonists will be hungry for a little more LiquidFuel- seeing as the only fuel they will have had in that time is what they brought with them and what they can mine and refine from Kethane...

I forgot to give it a Spacedock Identifier, so it\u0027s not actually a spacedock- but it is a GIGANTIC fuel depot (thanks to a HUGE Stretchy Tanks 9000-type tank) with plenty of RocketParts storage capacity (what looks like a Rockomax Jumbo-64 is actually a large Orbital Construction warehouse- the mod borrows stock textures, as it doesn\u0027t yet have its own), a reasonable nuclear power-supply, and two Science Labs (which require 5 MW of power each to run at full capacity- so only run at about 80%) for research and nuclear fuel-reprocessing as well... The current researchers/fuel attendants are Lury (who if you remember, was part of my earlier storytelling- and had been reassigned to my Heavy Scrapper Ship from my Duna crew) and Malman Kerman (who had been sitting idle in one of the extra seats on the Early Spacedock):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3wnh3JZ.png\u0022 alt=\u00223wnh3JZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aH8PcaL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aH8PcaL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might add a bit of storytelling on that crew reassignment later, but at the moment I\u0027m too tired/busy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T10:21:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
