It was tested around KSC and works pretty well, at least in Kerbin\u0027s high gravity. I expect it to be able to keep going day and night, and it has proven itself able to go up some pretty steep hills (namely, the side edge of the end of the runway). The only drawback to it is that it\u0027s simply\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eawful\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to transport. I had to build a really awkward rocket to get it to the Mun, and it took a really long time to get it just right. It didn\u0027t quite have enough delta-V, it always decided to RUD when separated from the rover, and the rover\u0027s engines were pointed towards the crew module, which cancelled out the thrust because PHYSICS. Here is the rocket as I first designed it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xxF9x0b.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xxF9x0b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is the rocket which actually made it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HtgcdWS.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HtgcdWS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RkW1t/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the process of getting a rover to the Mun in working order, Jeb was stranded.

However, it landed in a rather heavily cratered region, from which it had to get out of. Furthermore, it kept having this issue where it wouldn\u0027t get hardly any traction when going downhill, but did just fine uphill. I managed to fix this by tweaking the brake parameters, I guess. I also disabled the back wheels\u0027 motors because they didn\u0027t really add to the speed and they kept making it do wheelies when going uphill. After that was fixed, I ran into a terrain glitch where I fell straight through the Mun and came out the other side at over 50 km/s. I changed my terrain detail setting from \u0027low\u0027 to \u0027high\u0027 and the problem was fixed, as well as making things a little prettier. By the time all those problems had been taken care of, I had reached a downhill slope at the edge of a particularly big, old crater. I had some fun catching some air (vacuum? There\u0027s definitely no air here) and even doing a few\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etotally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0intentional flips, at the cost of only an RTG. I still have three left, and the batteries aren\u0027t drained when I run everything, including lights so I should be ok. I finally managed to get out of that cratered region though! It took me about an hour to go 32 km in in-game time. This means it should take me 40 hours to get around the Mun\u00A0(right? I think that math was correct...), not including the countless quickloads I\u0027ll certainly have to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/U4LQb/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T01:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECHAPTER III: THAT WAS EASY...BUT NOT FOR LONG\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I\u0027m out of the hole I was in, it was time to make my way towards the next hole I was to endure, and a much bigger one at that: The Farside Crater. Until then it was smooth driving, with one huge hill to climb and descend, and gentle slopes the rest of the way there. I was travelling at 20 m/s for the most part, sometimes getting up to 30 downhill. That means I was going 3 times the speed of the Mun\u0027s rotation, so the sun got low in the sky fast. I turned on the lights for more, well, light. After a calm period of straight driving, going between two craters, and driving a little more, I had reached the nemesis of the day. The slope into the Farside Crater was intimidating in height and steepness, but I had to press on. Furthermore, the sun had almost set here so visibility was poor. I slowly, carefully guided the rover into the massive depression. After a while, I had cleared the worst of the crater wall and could continue carefully. There were more, smaller craters ahead which I had to maneuver around. I ended my day at ~90 km from my original flag, and planted a new one for measuring my progress once the old one is out of range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vP6iu/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall I went much faster than last time I drove, mostly because the rover wasn\u0027t giving me trouble.
