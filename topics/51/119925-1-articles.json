On the armor side, I have something like reactive armor. I have timecontrol installed, so I can see what happens to the armor. I also have hack gravity and do not apply drag on, so missiles fly basically straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, I need your help! I need missiles and armor setups, so I can test them.
