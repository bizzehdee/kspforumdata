Docking system has been mentioned as poor, so a replacement for the new orbiter will be made. Orbiter fuel systems have been mentioned as \u0022insufficient\u0022, or not enough for high DV burns, however, this Monopropellant fuel is the best form of propellant considering the circumstances. Power source (two RTGs located within the inside of the cargo bay on the rear of the orbiter. Also two batteries act as the primary form of power located next to the RTGs. The orbiter also has power within the cockpit in case of hull separation). Airbrake failure as on the previous three test articles does not occur on Horizons. (Let it be written I still haven\u0027t found a reason for the failure, but I\u0027m glad it ends). The chute deployment as part of final landing procedures seems to over power the shuttle and cause a slight pitch up at the last moment, however cutting chute prior to that seems to solve the issue (solution applied for the first time on SSM-2). Lastly the front nose gear should be lowered to prevent Ground Effect from relifting the shuttle after landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Failure Report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWritten By: Gus Kerman (Head of SSM Engineers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft: SOV-005 Horizons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft Status: Destroyed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft Recovery: 81%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECause of Failure: Missile Strike (right aft portion of the spacecraft)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReport:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 1:32pm, SOV-005 Horizons was returning to the KSC after finishing a routine mission. At 1:45pm the orbiter was struck by a SAM. Data reports as located in the Black Box states that several Kerbals EVAed through the hull to access the ELES. It also shows that two Kerbals, likely the commander and pilot activated the Emergency protocols and also attempted to fly the craft. However, the right wing was completely destroyed, the tail fin was broke loose and they had no vertical stability nor a stable aircraft. We have reason to believe that the science crew and the engineers moved to the ELES. However the ELES broke loose and the crew could not activate it in time (ELES found separated from the main portion of the orbiter- it\u0027s assumed it broke loose and was carried away by drag. Sadly, only 1 corpse was found. It is unknown as to who\u0027s body it is due to burning of the body and suit, along with major crash damage (ground impact).

Such as chute problems, docking problems and also landing gear issues. One of the greatest advantages of SOV-006 over SOV-005 is that SOV-006 is far more versatile and can be altered much easier than her sister. The orbiter has modular systems which can be removed and altered for faster and easier alteration, changes and replacements of systems as needed where needed. Major changes include the chute change (moved, change of chute) and also a new bottom control surface as suggested by outside engineers to solve the pitch up after landing with chute deployment. Docking port system replaced entirely with a new system. Last major change is that the front landing gear has been lowered as per previous suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOV-004 Nomad Reconstruction Process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently SOV-004 is under going significant reconstruction in preparation for space flight. First major objective is to gut the inerts of the spacecraft and remove the dummy simulator equipment and replace it with real flight components. Nomad will resemble SOV-006 when completed, aside from solving a few of her major faults. Airbrakes have been completely replaced, which has solved her previous issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOV-007 Inspiration Report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOV-007 is currently just in blue print. She will be larger and be able to go further than her older sisters. She will also have newer engines and other systems to assist with newer launch and flight unlike ever before (waiting for 1.1). She will also take advantage of the Saturn Nova series of rockets to see her go further than ever before. However we must wait for testing of the new launch system to commence before we can begin construction on SOV-008. Should the Saturn Nova rocket series fail to come to light, then SOV-008 will be remade as a larger variant of shuttle made for lower orbit. Or it could become a duplicate orbiter similar to SOV-007 which can be used to launch more missions faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sampa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sampa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m guessing you modified the core i sent you?

Well, from what I\u0027ve read, ALT-2 had a bumpy landing am I right? Destroyed the right wing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Indeed... We lost the wing shortly after landing due to the vehicle tipping, granted the airbrake failure helped lead to the impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: The airbrake failure. I remember seeing a lot of debate over the mysterious airbrake failures. Do you have any ideas about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I haven\u0027t looked too deep into it, but I feel it was a hydraulic failure in the lines. Either there was a leak or some other chemical got into the lines and caused it to seize up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: But why would it happen on all the ALT flights?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I don\u0027t know, I figure that it was a technical issue within the orbiters. Even after the flights they never got it to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re prepping Nomad for flight after the SSM-5 disaster, is the issue solved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: From what I\u0027ve heard, yes.

I didn\u0027t work too much with the science crew, so I didn\u0027t know them. I worked mostly with the engineering crew since they were struggling to work with the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: What was the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: They were struggling to communicate between the orbiter computers and the payload computers. Issue is that the orbiter uses a different language than the payload. So they had to learn a new language and how to use a language thy already know to translate it into another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Sounds complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Hence why they needed me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Did you know the mission commander of pilot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I did... We were friends outside of the space program. The mission commanders tend to hang out, get a drink and talk about our missions. Compare how we did, what we should\u0027ve done, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Sounds like you get close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: We do. We all know that any mission could be our last, that we may not come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Is it worth the risk? 6 souls were lost in the persuit of space. Is it worth that risk? And more on SM-1. Is it worth the risk?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Is it worth the risk to climb the tallest mountain? To explore the unknown? \u0022Is it worth it\u0022 is a bad question. The question you should be asking is, are you willing to accept the risk?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Are you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I am.

Do you think, if you were aboard SSM-5, that you could\u0027ve saved the orbiter, or the crew?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: No. It was impossible. The SAM hit behind the right wing, next to the hull. It completely destroyed the engine mount. They lost the tail fin. They were in a death trap. There was no hope for them... I just wished they could\u0027ve gotten to the ELES sooner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: I thought they did get to the ELES?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Reports say that 2 members got strapped into the ELES-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Emergency Launch System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Yes. 2 crew members got into it, but the hull which was rapidly breaking apart, lead to the ELES breaking free and it\u0027d was carried away from the orbiter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Why didn\u0027t they fire the escape motors once they saw they were separated?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m guessing it was because by the time they knew, they impacted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: I\u0027m certain your aware... The crew was... Conscious when they impacted. How do you feel about it? What do you think was their final thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I\u0027m sorry they had to be. If the missile impacted higher maybe the change in pressure may have been enough to incapacitate them... But it happened too low. I hope they were too busy trying to follow protocols that they were aware of the true danger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: What about to two who got lost with the ELES? The others in the cargo bay loading into the ELES?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: I hope the same for them as the rest. It\u0027s a nightmare of a situation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Indeed it is... What has been done to prevent this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: A new escape system installed directly into the cockpit in the event of hull separation, and also a new re-entry path which will see us further north an more importantly above a military airbase which will give us protection, along with early implementation of the SCVs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: SCV?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Shuttle Chase Vehicle, basically a fast, yet slow aircraft that follows alongside the orbiter on its return path. The vehicles were designed, but pilots were being trained. In light of this, we are going to draft airforce veteran pilots to be the chasers until the pilots who are being trained are ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: How close will they follow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJabe: Close. Within 50-100m. All the up to landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterviewer: Well this has been an interesting session with Mrs. Jane Kerman, a major asset to the space program and the Shuttle Missions. She\u0027s a fantastic engineer, an outstanding scientist and a pilot with exceptional piloting skills.
