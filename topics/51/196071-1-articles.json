Only one thing to do: Try a FOURTH TIME! Officially at least. I did an undocumented minimal test run a while ago with an uncrewed ion probe just to reassure myself there was hope.

The mission had been meticulously planned out from tiny payload components all the way to the vast hull of the mothership. Thus the only thing to do was begin assembly by launching the core of the ship, the payload section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KZEy5Wn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KZEy5Wn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the aerodynamics of the payload section as designed, a custom launch configuration was necessary, composed of a large fuel reserve at the top, an engine cluster at the bottom, and a support cage featuring four large winglets to ensure stability on ascent. Only by using its own LV-N nuclear engines and onboard fuel supply was this component able to reach orbit. While its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was very low whilst running on these, they could be fired fairly early, as even a few kilometers up they near maximum thrust and are already more efficient than any chemical engine, and they could sustain thrust for a very long time and thereby gradually accomplish the orbital injection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next launch was a cleanup operation to remove the payload section\u0027s launch hardware so that its docking ports would be available for the rest of the orbital assembly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gjhxSif.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.33\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:600px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gjhxSif.png\u0022\u003E_\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Oojv7gs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.33\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:600px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Oojv7gs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis contained two orbital tugs.

My 250-ton launch vehicle was barely able to insert it into orbit, and then it performed the rendezvous using its own engines and the fuel from a small tanker I had included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Lca8mIf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Lca8mIf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally the transfer stage drive core was carefully docked onto the payload stage\u0027s rear docking port.

If too much deviation occurred here, these pods would cause significant torque and make the mothership unable to maintain a heading during its ejection burns from Kerbin and later from Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStay tuned for the next installment, which should feature the installation of the side-mounted drive pods and possibly of the crew or of one or more payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-03T04:49:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2020 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by problemecium\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eformatting bug\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T16:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EPart 2: Aletheia, The End of Darkness\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the central hull assembled, it was time to attach the four side-mounted drive pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022at9G966.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.06\u0022 height=\u0022792\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/at9G966.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drive pods for this mission use the same basic design as those on the Phthanophaneron, the only changes being an invisible subtle adjustment to the part attachment hierarchy to improve rigidity and the addition of a shielded forward tocking port to make assembly more convenient. Thus for the first two I used the same 150-ton launch vehicle I had used previously, but for the second two I decided that it was too long and wobbly to easily control or land safely, so I designed a new vehicle with several improvements. The new vehicle has a noticeably larger capacity, though for the time being is still rated for roughly 150 tons. Its shorter frame and wider base make it more rigid, easier to steer, and more stable after landing, and it happens to have a higher landing speed tolerance and both a lower cost and a lower part count. These improvements made the last two installations and recoveries go very smoothly - although by the time the last one was finished I was working with less than three units of MonoPropellant!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs shown in this large collage, each drive pod was launched and rendesvoused with the mothership using the launch vehicle, then handed off to the heavy-duty orbital tug to be moved into place. The launch vehicle was immediately returned and recovered, as due to the very high launch costs, even with the reductions from the improved version, there were not enough funds available to have multiple of these vehicles in operation at once. Fortunately the launch vehicles had a comfortable delta-V margin left over and managed to land very close to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to maximize recovery value. There is a small mistake visible in the image wherein I accidentally named one of them based on a 250-ton payload rating rather than its actual rating. A few operations ended up occurring at night, but hopefully with the brightness increased it\u0027s easy enough to tell what was happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that, the hull is at last fully assembled!

Near despair, I weighed my options: Cheat, swapping in a fixed version and hope nobody notices? Carefully extract the defective section, somehow manage to recover it, and send in a replacement, all strictly legit?

This launch proved to be very problematic, as invisible problems in the part attachments in the craft kept causing the rocket to be uncontrollably wobbly or to self-disassemble when the fairings were deployed. Apparently some bug exists where stacked fairings detach their bases when the sides are detached. Also, somehow, despite checking specifically at least twice, I managed to launch the thing all the way into orbit and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E find out that it had no MonoPropellant tank aboard, causing me to have to start over.

I first separated this section from the rest of the ship in order to prevent any bugs that might occur from propagating into the other sections and dooming the entire mission. Since several glitches had occurred already I was in no mood to take unnecessary risks.

She found Tatiana, the Scientist, poring over instrument readouts from the Blame Jeb Space Telescope, which had recently been tasked with attempting to identify exoplanets. Unbelievable, Tatiana kept saying. When she finally settled down enough to start explaining the situation coherently, she reported that the telescope had somehow not only met with success despite the short mission duration but managed to chart over 9,000 new planets - within optimistic estimates, if the telescope had been operating for at least \u003Cem\u003Eseven months\u003C/em\u003E! Could it, Peggy asked, be a bug, or the result of hacking? Tatiana denied it on the basis that as soon as she noticed the anomaly, she had examined data from the Kerbal Deep Space Network and even taken a few measurements of her own. The data was real! After going through every explanation they could imagine, the two gathered the rest of the crew for a discussion on the matter, which is when things got even weirder. All the EVA packs and personal parachutes were missing! The crew scoured the ship, but it was as if they had all simply stopped existing at the precise time the telescope had experienced its anomaly. Then Barbara, another Scientist, pointed out not one but a myriad of stars visible out the ship\u0027s windows were either missing or new and unfamiliar. The crew contacted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and found that all the space program\u0027s top minds - yes, even Mind Kerman himself - were in a frenzy over the situation. As best anyone could guess, only one scenario explained everything that had happened - the Kraken had struck, but rather than destroy any of their ships, it had somehow transported the entire Kerbolar system seven months into the future! There had been a number of other effects, including changes to nearby stars and more subtle alterations such as the disappearance of personal equipment. Miraculously, it seemed that nothing truly deleterious had happened to anyone or to Aletheia, although the space program would have to run checks on all other active craft and probably make a few adjustments to future designs. As far as Aletheia was concerned, despite the strange events there seemed little reason for the mission not to continue, so continue it did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah that\u0027s my explanation for the seven month hiatus in posts here ;P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next order of business for the mission was to launch and install the lander for Tylo.

During the aforementioned checks, it was discovered that the hatch, which previously had been able to allow pilots to embark and disembark, no longer had enough clearance.

Out of abundant caution, rather than use the fuel aboard the last fuel tanker to dock, a space tug was detached from the mothership to tow it into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/41HMx2H\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002241HMx2H.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:640px;height:360px;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/41HMx2H.png\u0022\u003E_\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/pQbkmIN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pQbkmIN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:640px;height:360px;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pQbkmIN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/sUIgqGY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sUIgqGY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:640px;height:360px;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sUIgqGY.png\u0022\u003E_\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/iCoJfm3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iCoJfm3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:640px;height:360px;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iCoJfm3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce both craft were attached, Tanuki quickly transferred into the mothership, the ship\u0027s fuel supply was topped off, and then the cargo was transferred into various compartments. It was just barely possible to store everything without needing the additional storage modules, so they could be left behind to save delta-V for the mission. A thorough final check was performed to make sure every last tank aboard Aletheia contained the fuel it needed, including a small reserve for refueling the small lander. Last, Valentina, who had been overseeing construction, transferred out of the ship and into the crew cabin aboard the larger fuel tanker. With that done, Aletheia appeared to at last be fully ready to detach from the tankers and other construction modules and begin its journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew, initially proposed to be ten Kerbals, had been reduced for various reasons to seven, allowing for a different Kerbal to land on each of Jool\u0027s five moons and return to Kerbin while the remaining two could stay in the Jool system aboard the portable station. The five scientists were Mavis, Barbara, Maya, Tatiana, and Tanuki, Peggy served as the engineer, and Lars took the position of pilot.

I had recalled some instance in the past wherein my small lander hadn\u0027t been up to the task, so I\u0027d used the large lander instead, but alas! This had not been part of the mission plan, and not enough spare fuel had been brought along to refuel it.

The now empty and all but spent mothership placed itself in a stable orbit to serve as its resting place while its crew bade it a loving farewell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022s3Dq3YI.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/s3Dq3YI.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022a3Jv3Au.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/a3Jv3Au.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly after they bade the Jool system farewell as they performed their ejection burn back toward home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022b8GJCsS.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/b8GJCsS.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LOSzWg9.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LOSzWg9.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jool receded into the distance, everyone took one last look at the system, the planet and all of its moons visible together as if to wave goodbye themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iPCkPOA.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iPCkPOA.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe return to Kerbin ended up involving an incredibly fast approach that was very difficult to handle. A strategy was adopted wherein the ARK would expend most of its delta-V just before entering the atmosphere, then orient perpendicular to the air stream and roll to combat any concentration of heat as it aerobraked, and finally use a gravity assist from the Mun to achieve a safe re-entry trajectory within a vaguely reasonable distance of the space center:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BY7fo1V.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BY7fo1V.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iHawm60.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iHawm60.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229pCVIA1.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9pCVIA1.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TGM1Z81.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TGM1Z81.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022m3hJRau.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/m3hJRau.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving barely managed to survive intact, the ARK was now able to parachute gently to the ground and use the last of its fuel to provide a soft landing for its weary occupants:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224KseM9s.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4KseM9s.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew jubilantly climbed out and planted a flag to commemorate their achievement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002218ea5Zo.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/18ea5Zo.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore Aletheia reached Jool\u0027s sphere of influence, the space program stood at a total of 2906.8 science points.
