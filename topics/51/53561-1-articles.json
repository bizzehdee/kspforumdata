At this time, we are currently orbiting the Sun itself. We have also deployed our solar panels and discovered that Eight out of Eighteen Solar Panels are being blocked and unable to produce power from the sun. But the ten that can produce power, are more than enough to keep our power supply for...well indefinitely. And surprisingly, food supply is NOT a problem!

We have decided to scrub that mission and assign you a new long term mission. You are going to be the fueling station for all coming and going space crafts that may need the fuel to reach other planets in our system or return home. We will be sending a fueling pod to you, actually right now. *Back ground: 3...2...1...We have Lift Off!* See, it\u0027s being launched as we speak. Every so often we\u0027ll send a ship to refuel your fueling tanks so you can continue to be a Fueling Station, and of course transfer a new crew over so you can come home. We don\u0027t intend to keep you up there forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew: *Huge Sigh of Relief*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKolonel Alan: Ahem. That\u0027s great news, Command! Does such pod also carry some solar panels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: We have established the pod to extend Solar panels when electricity is needed, they are also placed so they won\u0027t be blocked by your current Solar Panels, so that you can continue to maintain power. Wouldn\u0027t want to overtax your power supply without enough panels to recharge them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKolonel Alan: Of course. When will we be seeing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: Probably after several days, maybe ten...twenty, give or take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKolonel Alan: Copy that, Command. We are sending our current stored data now and ending transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: Good luck Alpha, and whatever you do, don\u0027t light a ma- *cuts off.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKolonel Alan: Why did you cut it off while they were speaking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt.

Kol Jenbur: We read you Command, we just activated the comms array, whats up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: Well we ran into a problem. One of our pilots down here was trying to remotely control the fueling pod towards your station so we could dock it and have the ability to run as a fueling station but um...well something went horribly wrong. Some how one of the fuel lines ruptured and took half the tanks with it, now it only has two instead of four fueling tanks. And we lost the main rocket booster that was moving the ship so the only thing left is a bunch of RCS, which is completely insufficient to reach your station, so we may have to make another attempt....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt. Kol Jenbur: Okay, I\u0027ll inform Kolonel Alan then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: Where is he right now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt. Kol Jenbur: Sleeping, we think.

Bravo to orbit the Mun, they have begun making modifications in hopes to make it more...safe. Like, Escape Pods. Maybe.

Command, this is Alpha do you read?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: It\u0027s about time Alpha, we were beginning to worry. We re-established control with the Fueling Pod and discovered that the RCS is sufficient enough to get it to your station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt. Kol Jenbur: I was about to say, we\u0027re seeing right now and I was worried that it was out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: Nah, we would of warned you first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt. Kol Jenbur: ... Right. Anyways, we\u0027re seeing it real close now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK.S.C.: Uhhh...scratch that Alpha. It just ran out of RCS Fuel, there\u0027s no chance of it reaching you now. We\u0027re going to terminate it and try again. Command out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt.

I have been informed that this next mission may result in not me returning to Kerbin, at all. But they were being pushed by the Committee Board to get to the Mun as soon as possible, no matter what the cost! So the Engineers and Technicians worked around the clock to build a rocket capable of sending me to the Mun. It is pretty much the same rocket design we have been using for the past missions with the three Command Pods and such, but more modified to be able to complete the task that I am about to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter seeing the Rocket, I was actually beginning to believe that there may be a possible chance that I would be able to return home after all. But to make sure that no other brave and capable Kerbonaut has to endure my prolong adventure on the Mun, or steal my huge supply of snacks that I had stuffed into both Command Pod Two and Three, I requested to do this by myself. Apparently even before I made that request, both Jenbur and Billy-Bob took a vacation...so I was going by myself no matter what. Very suspicious....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell when it was time to launch, I got on board into Command Pod One and began my systems check. Well to cut it short, I used my primary booster, one that had the most fuel out of them all, to try and get me maneuvered to the Mun. At first I noticed that I was falling back to Kerbin and thought, oh man, I\u0027m going to have to abort!! But then I noticed that the fuel in my main booster was about empty, and well. You see, I seriously thought I would make it back because the Techs strapped four rockets onto Command Pod Two, to use to safely touch down onto the Mun and I figured it would have more than enough fuel to get me back to Kerbin. Well apparently the Egg-Heads at Command were right and I was wrong. I had no choice ditch the main booster, and fire my Munar Rockets, which eventually pulled me out of Kerbin\u0027s orbit and put me right on course towards the Mun, in which case I throttled all the way back to cut the engines off so I can save the much needed fuel, and to my surprise, I had quite a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I reached, THE MUN!!! WOOOO!! I have never been SO HAPPY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!! But yes, I reached the Mun, I began to use my Munar Rockets to immediately slow me down so I would be heading straight to the Mun. And as I began to get real close to the Mun, I adjusted my ship and fired the Munar Rockets just enough to slow me down. With several more burns here and there, and the extended landing gear on Command Pod Three, I managed to land safely onto the Mun! And then that is when I checked my fuel gauge. My Munar Rockets only have a total of 54.04 Liquid Fuel left out of the four fuel tanks for the four engines. Even if I made it off the Munar\u0027s surface, which I am pretty sure I would come crashing back down if I attempted to do so, the Mun does have a bit of gravity, small, but enough to grab my ship and slam it into the surface if I were to attempt to leave. With that being said, I collected all the data I could and I am attaching this Report to the data stream. I only hope that I have enough power to transmit it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just hope that no one has forgotten about me.

So we added some more ladder bars and finally, Jenbur was able to make it back to the Cab with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/487808633071886717/C4F4663E38DA3A2EBB51F965377418F7E0B98446/\u0022 alt=\u0022C4F4663E38DA3A2EBB51F965377418F7E0B98446\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are probably wondering, why the landing legs?

Well, we had no idea what the speed would be for this thing, and we wanted to see what would happen too. So we had Jenbur drive the Rover all the way to the Airstrip there, reaching up to 21 m/s! Not bad for a rover. Yes it has TONS of battery power, so it should not die on Alan while he is exploring the dark side of the moon, BUT if the batteries were to die in some odd way, he can extend the solar panels and wait for the sun to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Jenbr got to one end of the Airstrip, he straightened himself out, put the pedal to the metal, reached to 20 m/s before firing the eight rockets (small, so very little power behind them) and generated to 52 m/s! And for some unknown reason, we never set up a switch to turn the engines off...so he crashed into the ocean... BUT HE IS OKAY! *coughs*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/487808633071887773/16BB752AF437D57279B694C335C57839A4E99EF1/\u0022 alt=\u002216BB752AF437D57279B694C335C57839A4E99EF1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we took out the landing legs, the rockets, the fuel, and rearranged the solar boxes when we realized they opened up the panels in a odd way but now fixed that...we began to realize how heavy the front was and worked around the clock to balance the weight out. It was important because, holy crap it would throw the rocket off real bad. Well that is what we came up with! So yeah, some day, Alan will have a buddy! But we intend on sending the Rover to the Mun on its own, so Alan will continue to be alone sadly.... Oh and we added a Docking port! So once we start sending up structures so Alan can set up a Mun Base, hey we still having devised a plan to save him and we may never will *coughs* BUT doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t get a Mun base established while he is there!!!

That one fuel tank you see there on the other side of that larger tank, is to help counter balance the weight because we could not get the Rockets attached underneath the Rover, since we still have a lot of researching to do....and well, we just gave up and attached some structures and a docking port underneath as you may be able to see there. We intend to send this rocket up and Orbit Kerbin, then we will launch a similar Rocket, capable of attaching itself to the Rover and then launch it towards the Mun. Of course, we COULD use the Rockets attached to the Rover to get it to the Mun, but we are afraid that we may not have enough fuel to safely land the Rover...in which case, we are not going to risk it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/487808633071890535/501D189214DE37512F8ECF04D4D0253CB4A45E96/\u0022 alt=\u0022501D189214DE37512F8ECF04D4D0253CB4A45E96\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally here is the Rocket that has been launched and is taking the Rover to Orbit Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: As soon as I returned to the game, the darn rocket was spinning out of control inside the atmosphere, and i was like \u0027WHAT WHAT WHAT?!\u0027 *facepalms* I may have to HyperEdit this Rocket into the Orbit of Kerbin and just set it off towards the Mun.

But I just don\u0027t understand much of it anymore. I just hope that future updates would help lessen the lag a bit, if not all of it.

I still had all my saved rockets an such, and I loaded this older quicksave before the Rover landed, so thank god for that. But it meant the loss of my ISA Mapping satellite, which sadly, after upgrading the satellite, I will hyper edit it into orbit of the Mun.

And the reason for the \u0027a\u0027 behind the \u0027.II\u0027 is because it has a special attachment that is allowing it to be docked to the rear of the Command Module. Sorry, but the Experimental Rover was too short and Alan didn\u0027t want any changes made to its height. So, we came up with a way for it to dock with the Command Module, and even a way to decouple the attachment, problem is, once it is decoupled, that is the end of it. We did not think of a long term on this, but we figured Alan won\u0027t forget to apply the PARKING BREAKS!
