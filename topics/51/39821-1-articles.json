No one was quite sure why the rocket failed to launch but instead rumbled then exploded beneath him and the two crew members he was carrying. However, when the investigation team sought answers from Hudsey and Macly, they didn\u0027t seem very shaken by the event and seemed to suggest that they should check under the pilot\u0027s seat for empty snack wrappers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s that Bob, I tell you. Someone needs to check his pockets for snacks before he takes the pilot seat.

He might have been eating krackers in the pilot\u0027s seat. Off the record.. I think he might be krazy and I\u0027m not going to fly with him again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater that day, investigators did find snack wrappers in the wreckage near the pilot\u0027s seat. Further investigation also revealed that they were the same snacks that were aboard the Joint Orbiting Lab mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control was not available for comment, but before Bob left the KSC that afternoon, he was seen reading a memo on the KSC\u0027s Misson Control corkboard announcing that the CDM development was complete and no further testing was required. It was now kerbal-rated and ready for robotic control and that only the Duna Surface team of Hudsey and Macly would be ascending tomorrow. The memo also named Bob Kerman to be on the other Duna Surface Module, launching tomorrow with Ludlong. The memo also had a footnote asking if anyone was interested, there was a new opening on the test pilot team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But, I don\u0027t want to sit in a tin can for 6 months with those squares!

Sure, he was eating snacks during the countdown, but that never stopped him from having a successful launch before. And he never left snack wrappers around. And it certainly was coincidental that the wrappers found in the wreckage were the same kind as the ones that he, Jeb and Bill left behind in the Joint Orbiting Lab pod for the \u0022new guys\u0022 to clean up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ludlong?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hi Bob!

Since this launch was being sent to Duna outside of an optimal transfer window, it was going to take almost all the fuel onboard to get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing into the Duna encounter on fumes, Mission Control was grinning ear to ear when they saw that the encounter was already less than 300km above Duna\u0027s surface. They were also grinning ear to ear when goldfish were put into the fountain outside of the new Mission Control building, so it really didn\u0027t take a lot to get them grinning. However, this was a major accomplishment, and with a short burn to drop the periapsis to less than 10km above Duna, the Resupply Mission was successfully captured into orbit with no fuel expenditure at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso amazingly, and completely by luck, there were no Ike encounters to mess up plans!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter several orbits, the Resupply Mission docked with the Duna Surface Module vessel on day 196 and provided the awaiting crew on board with enough supplies to keep them going until day 435. By then, the craft from Kerbin to bring them home would arrive at Duna to pick everyone up and have the crew home sometime around day 499.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Duna surface team had already descended to the surface as soon as a stable 75k equatorial orbit was established, on day 126. Seventy days later the resupply mission arrived and the return lander was dropped from orbit using robotic control and arrived only 830m from their base. However, fuel consumption was alarmingly high. The design team were sent a critical update requiring a contingency if either of the landers could not return from the surface back to orbit. However, if both landers used too much fuel and both could not return to dock with the orbiting return ship, the new design must accommodate supplies for two kerbals to be left on the surface for an extended mission. An unplanned fifth launch to Duna may be required in order to pick up the extended surface team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHudsey and Macly drove over to the lander to get their supplies and repack the parachutes.

Bob hated the thought that the kerbal engineers back on Kerbin would be reading the reports and might associate his reports with the ones written by Macly.

It seemed a little lazy and sounded too much like slang to him, but he knew that Mission Control calls the shots. Bob had asked Mission Control if he could pilot the lander down instead of using the robotic descent programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Well, Bob, that\u0027s an interesting idea to pilot the lander down yourself, but we on Kerbin here think that the probe should pilot itself down, instead,\u0022\u003C/em\u003E radioed mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How come?\u0022, Bill asked without trying to sound too disappointed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Piloting the lander instead of using the robotically controlled landing is not in the mission plan, so it would require someone with \u0027test pilot\u0027 status to land it. Besides that, we heard from Macly that too much fuel was used during the descent profile you programmed and now it doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back to orbit, and we feel that it\u0027s better this way, just to avoid any mistakes.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob, definitely sounding disappointed now, replied, \u0022But I used to be a test pilot before this mission.

Bob was accustomed to bumpy rides, having been a test pilot before this mission, but Ludlong wasn\u0027t used to it. Bob noticed, however, that Ludlong\u0027s expression didn\u0027t seem to change during the entire landing. He wondered if Ludlong even knew what was happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, Ludlong, we\u0027ll be on the surface soon.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The surface of what, Bob?\u0022 asked Ludlong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The surface of Duna, what did you think I meant?!?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know, Bob. You\u0027re hilarious!

Bob didn\u0027t realize that Ludlong even knew how to use the radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Macly told me about it last week. It\u0027s a great name, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh yes, Ludlong. Macly is an inspiration to the entire Space Korps.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two rovers were jettisoned from a higher altitude than planned because of the steep angle and high speeds which Bob and Ludlong entered Duna\u0027s atmosphere. By dropping their added mass from the Habmod and letting them come down on their own chutes brought the landing under control at the last moment and the landing continued normally. However, the rovers came down a little further than planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are we on Kerbin?\u0022, Ludlong asked Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes Ludlong, we\u0027re on Kerbin. We\u0027ve been on a space mission for 196 days to go nowhere.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh that\u0027s good!\u0022, exclaimed Ludlong gleefully. \u0022Why do you think the sky looks like Duna?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pure coincedence, Ludlong, I\u0027m sure,\u0022 replied Bob sardonically. \u0022I\u0027m going to plant our flag and go pick up a rover. What do you want to do, Ludlong?\u0022 Bob asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m doing it! I\u0027m just happy to be here with you, Bob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a sigh, Bob puts on his helmet and leaves the habmod. Walking over to the landers, Bob notices that his fashionable orange suit looks really good on Duna by making it an even brighter orange. He shakes his head in silent disgust recalling that he has to give up his test-pilot-orange suit when he gets home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob picks up the good rover, deciding that even though both rovers were identical that he could tap into his sixth, or even his seventh, sense to channel his test-pilot skills to pick the better rover. He hops in and drives back to the habmod, taking special care to park his rover exactly parallel to the habmod legs and close enough to the door so that he could get away from Ludlong in a hurry if he needed to. He also ensured it was far enough away from the habmod so that he could just sit in the rover and listen to the radio and not have to hear Ludlong talking to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob planted the flag beside his rover and wrote on the plaque: \u0022Test Pilot Parking Only\u0022. He looked over to the habmod and Ludlong had just returned from getting his rover. He was trying to park it under the landing engine for some reason. As Ludlong lowered his head and peered up into engine bell of the landing engine, Bob wondered if there had ever been any \u0022accidental\u0022 ignitition of these engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith his luck, probably not. Sitting in the rover and switching on the radio, he hears the Mission Control broadcasting an update on the second supply drop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022If anyone is outside or near a window at Habmod Two, you should be able to see the resupply lander coming in overhead now,\u0022\u003C/em\u003E crackled the radio. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob grabs the microphone and says, \u0022Yes I see it overhead now. Your re-programming of the lander is off-course.. it\u0027s going long.. going to be at least 20km from our landing site.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022That\u0027s not a mistake, Bob. We didn\u0027t want to play favorites with you guys so we dropped it exactly half way between your sites. That way its the same distance for both when it comes time to leave.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What a great plan....\u0022 replies Bob with a sigh. \u0022So does that mean you haven\u0027t decided who is going back to orbit and which two are staying?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022That\u0027s correct, Bob. But remember that the return lander seats three, so we may just bring three of you back up and leave one on the surface on an extended mission. We have a re-supply drop planned when the Crew Return Vessel arrives there in about 100 days, so there will be no problems with an extended stay.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter repeating the words \u0027extended stay\u0027 in his head a few times, he cautiously asked Mission Control, \u0022Any idea who might be selected for the extended stay...?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Decisions are being made. However, seniority will probably play into the decision as the extended stay will require a more experienced kerbalnaut.

These two modules docked in orbit and a 10 day mission commenced there on day 273. During that mission, two Crew Delivery Missions docked with the vehicle and seven kerbalnauts were in space simultaneously, more than at any other time in KSC\u0027s history. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELead test pilot Jebediah supervised a thorough inspection of the crew quarters and on day 283, the inspection team left the vessel and the two replacement crews left LKO for the Duna surface stations. This crew is arriving at Duna on day 349 and bring with them another 240 days of supplies. There are rumors that one of the surface return shuttles will not be able to ascend back to orbit which we can confirm, is unfortunately correct. Plans are being developed to bring all four of the crew members back to Kerbin on this crew exchange mission. However the plans are very tentative at this time and will require experienced test pilots to conduct.

He was also really proud of how thorough Ludlong was being in his pre-flight check of the shuttle. \u0022I think Ludlong is going to be a pretty good pilot\u0022, he thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Ludlong, I\u0027ll handle the docking but I was wondering it you wanted to take us into orbit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure thing, buddy! I was hoping you\u0027d ask me!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they settled in to the pilot and co-pilot seats, Bob continued to be impressed with Ludlong\u0027s ability behind the controls. He knew where every switch was and every step to complete as if he\u0027d been doing it his whole life. As Ludlong counted down to ignition, Bob turned his head and took one last look at Duna. He was almost going to miss being here, he thought. Then, as Ludlong got to zero he hit the throttle and they quickly ascended into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBob and Ludlong leave Duna\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gyqViqX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gyqViqX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESupply Drop and New Crew to Habmod Two\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong did an amazing job getting the shuttle into orbit and it only took two orbits to meet up with the Duna transfer stages. They were docked together still, but there was no plans to use them for anything. There was almost no power on them and no supplies left, except for a small amount of fuel; just enough to top off their tanks on the shuttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking was very challenging as there was very little room to squeeze the big shuttle onto the docking clamp. Bob was thankful that Ludlong turned out to be such a good pilot. Bob let Ludlong handle the roll controls while docking to make it a bit easier. Eventually, the shuttle latched on to the docking port and they began the fuel transfer. There was only a few units of fuel left when they were done, but they did get a full tank of fuel. They should have enough to land on Ike!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Ludlong and Bob undocked from the Duna transfer stages and moved their orbit to match Jeb and Bill\u0027s orbit, the Crew Transfer Vehicle was busy with their activity. First, the two supply drops were sent to the surface, each carry 480 units of supply, and then the two new crew members descended to Habmod Two, Ludlong and Bob\u0027s old campsite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the Duna shuttle approached the Crew Transfer Vehicle, Bob looked out his window and said, \u0022Man, that thing is big..\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It sure is, Bob! I\u0027m going to miss our little Habmod, though.

There might just be enough to support five kerbals down there until the next supply. Good idea, Ludlong! Oh, and by the way, you just earned your wings.. you\u0027re officially a pilot now! Congratulations!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I couldn\u0027t have done it without you, Bob.

He would have to use the crew descent vehicle as his base, and there was only enough room for one, but he seemed really excited about it. Bob documented the changes to the mission plan and sent them back to mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a handshake and goodbyes, Ludlong boarded the crew descent vehicle alone. He was still grinning, but at least Bob knew why this time: he was really excited to be going back to the Duna surface. With a short burn, Ludlong expertly piloted his descent module back to the surface. As soon as he landed, he marked his site \u0022Fort Ludlong\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen mission control replied, Bob finally found out what Macly and Hudsey were up to and why they weren\u0027t coming back with them to Kerbin. Mission control said that they volunteered to go on a mission to the mountain that was north of their habmod and to stay on Duna as surface experts for another tour of duty. Bob was not sure how this happened since he had read every communication that was sent to mission control and there was never anything about volunteering to do anything, but he was very happy about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Say, Jeb, you didn\u0027t have anything to do with keeping Macly and Hudsey on Duna, did you?\u0022 Bob asked Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb smiled briefly but did not acknowledge the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now lets get to Ike and earn those test-pilot wings back for Bob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KpQWfHs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KpQWfHs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/15SWIhJ.png\u0022 alt=\u002215SWIhJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDay 500 - Back on Kerbin\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna Space Progam was going extremely well. To date, there have been 1491 kerbal-days on the Duna surface, the program was extended for an additional 500 days, and Macly and Hudsey volunteered to be Duna surface experts and also to drive up to the mountain in the north. Mission control thought it was interesting that the email from Macly about volunteering to stay on Duna came from Jeb\u0027s email address, but they decided not to worry about small details like that. Macly radioed back that they were at a peak, but couldn\u0027t go any higher with this rover due to the terrain. He named the mountain Kolympus Mons and sent back a panoramic sunset shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the day 511 transfer window approached, the new 3 kerbal habmod was launched into LKO and the dual launch of the Duna Orbiting Station and its propulsion stage were also launched and docked together. Three kerbals were sent to check out the Duna Orbiting Station and three more were sent up to crew the new habmod. While the inspection team was at the station, it marked a new record for the number of kerbals in space: 14 at the same time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control thought this would make a perfect time to celebrate! Chokolate cake and kookies were brought in for the celebration and video of the event was broadcast all over Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of day 500, both the unkerballed crew delivery mission to the new habmod and also the inspection team from the Duna Station were brought back to Kerbin\u0027s surface.

Once they got there, they took the Duna shuttle on an unauthorized mission to land on Ike. Although this mission was not approved by Mission Control, it still reinstated Bob\u0027s \u0027test pilot\u0027 status because it was the first time that a kerbal had landed on Ike. After the Ike landing mission returned to the Crew Transfer Vehicle in Duna orbit, Ludlong descended back down to Duna\u0027s surface and named the site \u0027Fort Ludlong\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown on the surface of Duna, Ludlong was settling in very well at \u0027Fort Ludlong\u0027. He had made several day trips to some local outcroppings of interesting looking dirt, gathered some up, and brought the samples back to his site. Every night before bed he would read stories about early space missions and kept his piloting skills sharp by practicing on his simulator. Every morning he would report any interesting findings back to mission control, where Bob took a special interest in reading them along with the other mission control team. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob had developed a whole new respect for Ludlong after discovering Ludlong\u0027s innate piloting skills. After Bob let Ludlong fly the Duna Shuttle up to the Crew Transfer Vehicle, Bob had looked at the flight profile that Ludlong flew and noticed that Ludlong had used less fuel on the ascent than the computers had reported was possible. Bob briefly considered deleting the log file from Ludlong\u0027s flight in order to avoid further embarrassment, but decided instead to tell Bill and Jeb about it and give Ludlong a pat on the back for the achievement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudlong was so excited about it, he made a printout of the flight log from his first and only turn in the pilot\u0027s seat and kept it pinned up in his small quarters on Duna. Every morning he would wake up and see it and remind him of his first 156 days on Duna and his new friend, Bob, the test pilot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring his morning walk around the area near Fort Ludlong, he happened to be looking up just as the Duna Orbiting Station was entering orbit above him.

Today was the first open-house for Kerbals to come and see some of the mission hardware used in the Duna Space Program. On the launch pad, an Antares Proton s\u002B was being prepared to launch a resupply mission to Duna.

It\u0027s great to be back here on Kerbin after our mission out to Duna and our Ike landing.

Take a bow, Bob..\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob stood up and briefly nodded and waved to the enthusiastically applauding crowd then sat down quietly. Bob liked the quiet of space and was not used to crowds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb continued, \u0022Yes, Bob showed great bravery and humility when he accepted his mission to the Duna surface after getting drummed out of the test pilot team. What is even more admirable is how he doesn\u0027t hold anything against Bill and me for causing the accident which destroyed the CDM 4 rocket, leading to his dismissal from the test pilot team. What a guy!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crowd roared with appreciation. As Jeb\u0027s confession to causing the destruction of the CDM 4 mission began to sink in to Bob\u0027s consciousness, Bob\u0027s eyes started getting bigger and bigger. His left eye began to twitch. He opened his mouth like he was about to say something, then closed it again, as if he didn\u0027t know what to say. Which he didn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECovering the microphone with his hand, Jeb says quietly, \u0022Hey, uh, Bob, you\u0027re not looking so good..\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob stood up and walked calmly over to Jeb standing at the podium. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, old buddy.. you aren\u0027t mad about the CDM 4 explosion, still, are ya?\u0022 Jeb asked with a hopeful grin, still covering the mic with his hand. The crowd began to murmur amongst themselves, unsure about what they were watching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb... what did you and Bill do?\u0022 Bob calmly asked Jeb, but clearly having a hard time restraining himself from reacting more to this revelation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, Bob, we\u0027re sorry. We just made a little change to the wiring on the command pod so that it dropped snacks on Macly and Hudsey. But, I think we might have hooked it up so that it accidentally triggered the \u0027abort\u0027 system instead. Gee, sorry, buddy. Shake on it?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb extended his hand to Bob, but Bob ignored it and instead calmly pushed Jeb aside. He looked back at Bill who was giggling to himself and Jeb who had already sat back down beside Bill and had a concerned look on his face. Jeb knew that Bob was the smartest and wasn\u0027t sure what to expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproaching the microphone and gathering all his strength to address the crowd, Bob\u0027s voice was clear and full of authority, \u0022Jeb.. Bill.. I thank you for putting me the position where I would spend 156 on Duna instead of being a test pilot back here on Kerbin. During my time on Duna, I learned a lot of things. I watched how our new recruit, Ludlong, dutifully completed his daily tasks. I watched how he kept the Habmod clean every day, even though I didn\u0027t have to ask him. I watched him turn into a skillful pilot capable of flying the Duna shuttle more efficiently than our best robotic probe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob paused again, the crowd waiting with anticipation about what would happen next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Today marks a new era in the KSC test pilot program. With my recent reinstatement to the test pilot team, and promotion this morning to lead test pilot due to my duration missions on the Mun and Duna, I have, in the last two minutes, started working on a plan to overhaul the test pilot team!\u0022 Bob\u0027s voice was gaining even more strength and excitement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There will be no more shenanigans! There will be no more silly pranks! There will be no more slovenly habits from the test pilot corps! Today, we start The New Way for the test pilot team! Thank you!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crowd erupted in applause and everyone threw their space helmets into the air. Bob really wasn\u0027t promoted, but he was pretty sure that Jeb and Bill wouldn\u0027t bother to check on that.

However, if their mission was perfect then they would only be backup crew for the second, duration test, mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob knew that Jeb and Bill had tried to rig his CDM 4 rocket to drop snacks on Macly and Hudsey, but instead accidentally rigged it to explode. Bob would never intentionally tamper with Jeb and Bill\u0027s rocket, but he was in the unique position to assign their missions and training duties. And adjust, he did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob assigned Jeb to the longest duration on the centrifuge that kerbal doktors would allow: 30 days. And Bill was suddenly bumped from flying test pilot missions to conducting kerbalnaut recruit-day rejection exit interviews. Every kerbal who failed their recruitment pre-screening test for the next 30 days would be granted 8 continuous hours with Bill where they could discuss why they failed their test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, Bill, who had begun writing \u0022I said the same thing 1,000 times today.\u0022 on his reports, and Jeb, who continually asked for \u0022moar boosters!\u0022 during his 30 day trip on the centrifuge, both demanded to be on a long, quiet duration mission. Bob was a reasonable kerbal, and put Jeb and Bill on the next two launches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, because of the pressure this caused on Jeb and Bill, they both failed quite miserably on their first launches with the latest Crew Delivery Mission vessel. Both vessels were destroyed but both pilots were successfully recovered. Eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s launch required a compensation in staging that was not compensated for in the countdown. As a result, when Bill got to \u0022zero\u0022 on the countdown and staged, his rocket dropped to the launchpad without igniting any engines. He immediately aborted and landed nearby, but due to budget kutbacks, he had to clean up the launchpad himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Jeb\u0027s test, the staging was perfect. However, due to a problem with fuel line installation, the new aerospike rocket engines did not have a supply of fuel! He was required to do an emergency re-entry with only his small pod, separated from the (comfortable and well-stocked) crew quarters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe spent several days perched on the outside of his mostly-submerged pod before mission control \u0027recovered\u0027 him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next two launches were required to be a duration mission of a joint orbiting laboratory. The first mission carried a small amount of extra fuel and the second carried a supply of 300 units of supplies and two kerbalnaut trainees. They were docked and sent on a highly elliptical orbit for 75 days. During that time, Bill and Jeb were required to log daily mission reports and post pictures of their perfectly clean rooms to mission control. Failure to do so, mission control advised them, would initiate launches of supply updates to extend their mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they returned to Kerbin, there was no celebration. However, the CDM Evolution Two was ready for Kerbin and Duna full-time use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBill asks, \u0022I have to clean this up?\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2gD2jiO.png\u0022 alt=\u00222gD2jiO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ELudlong looking down on Duna\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was day 720 of the Duna Space Program. Ludlong had been away from Kerbin for almost 600 days and as much as he liked being Duna Station commander, he was missing Kerbin\u0027s blue ocean and green fields. He would be leaving Duna orbit with Macly, Hudsey and Danlong on day 951. He would be arriving back to Kerbin 960 days after leaving, making him the most experienced long-term pilot in the Duna Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a fact he was reminded of when, on day 720 he got a call from Bob back at mission control. Bob had radioed Ludlong every day to go over any new discoveries Ludlong had made and also to keep Ludlong up to date on future missions. Bob had explained to Ludlong about the latest Crew Delivery Mission vessel, which would replace the one at Duna now. It would also replace the ones used in Kerbin LKO missions, making it the only vehicle that is designed for use with both Kerbin and Duna missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new version of the CDM vessel used aerospike propulsion and separate command and transport pods, which could land independently if needed. It could carry 5 kerbals to LKO or LDO and was 100% reusable. Ludlong asked Bob if he had flown it yet. He said that he hadn\u0027t yet, but that Jeb and Bill were on a 75 day joint orbiting lab mission with two of them right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the main reason for Bob\u0027s call on day 720 was to have Ludlong carry out a mission to one of the Duna transfer stages that was orbiting Duna. It was the stage that had delivered the 3-Kerbal Habmod which landed on the surface on day 588. The secondary role of this transfer stage was to delivery an additional 300 units of supplies to the Duna station. However, there was a design oversight: it didn\u0027t have a working command pod to fly by robotic control!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob explained Ludlong\u0027s mission would entail adjusting the inclination of Duna Station\u0027s orbit to match the transfer stage orbit. He would then have to pilot the station so that it was close enough for docking. He would then undock the transfer stage on Duna station and dock it to the Habmod transfer station and transfer all its fuel over. The really tricky part would then be to EVA back to Duna Station and dock it, in reverse, to the Habmod transfer stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounded like a challenge, but Ludlong knew it had to be done. The snacks on Duna Station were running low and the propulsion stage on Duna Station was flawed anyways because it was missing a fuel line. Bob had told Ludlong about the problems with Jeb\u0027s and Bill\u0027s launches with the staging problem and missing fuel lines. He would have to have a word with Quality Control back on Kerbin, he thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, while Ludlong was carrying out this mission, he saw something below him near Site Three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022This is Ludlong at Duna Station calling Site Three.. come in, Site Three\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, broadcast the radio in the Site Three cupola module. Gregry was in the cupola doing sky observations. At least that\u0027s what he always told Danhat and Edney he would be doing when he went up there. What he was really doing, however, was writing a script for a movie about the Duna Space Program and he couldn\u0027t wait to get back to Kerbin to film it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hi Ludlong, this is Gregry. What\u0027s up?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Well, I am! I\u0027m up over you right now. I flew Duna Station to match your transfer stage\u0027s orbit to dock with it and just finished transferring the fuel over. And, well, I was looking down where your habmod is and I see something very odd in the crater near you.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a brief pause, possibly for dramatic purposes, Ludlong continues. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022There\u0027s something down there.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose words hung in the cupola as if spoken from a prophet. \u0022Those words have to be in my movie!\u0022 he immediately thought to himself as he wrote them down. He read the words over again in his mind, is of spoken from one of those blockbuster actors like Tom Kruise, \u0022There\u0027s something... down there!\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative, Ludlong, that\u0027s what we were sent here to investigate. There was a satellite telescope photo from Kerbin that showed a very strange land formation in the crater. We\u0027re waiting for the rover to arrive on day 803 before we head over there, but I can tell you that the dirt we found near our site is very unusual. I can\u0027t say too much more, but our report will be ready soon and you\u0027re not going to believe what we found!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sounds great, Gregry. I can\u0027t wait! Your rover will be here soon! Duna Station out.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover, which landed successfully, was parked beside Site Three\u0027s habmod on day 820.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater that day, the first of the \u0022open launches\u0022 was launched to LKO. Mission control reported that it was a very difficult decision to make between sending to Duna either the latest Duna shuttle or a new module for Duna station. Eventually, the decision was made to send a new Duna Shuttle. However, a small docking module upgrade was also included in the launch. It will head to Duna on day 967.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis launch also completes the objective of launching all primary mission in the Duna Space Program.

Behind him, a screen quickly lowered and a hidden projector dropped from the ceiling.

The green dot, on Vall\u0027s orbit, might mean that whoever made this structure is from Vall. Based on this assumption and on the fact that we\u0027ve already had 5000 kerbal days on Duna, and not at all based on the fact that we\u0027ve lost four major spacecraft recently on the Duna Space Program, we are cancelling the Duna Space Program and introducing the ..\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob paused and pressed the button again.

The supply drops were completed and the new Duna Shuttle made its first Duna descent and ascent. With the cancellation of the Duna Space Program, it was decided that the Duna Shuttle would be used as a crew cabin and would remained docked to the crew transfer vehicle to bring back two more crew members.

During their short stay in Duna orbit while awaiting their Kerbin return window, the Ike landing mission earned no points in the challenge, but was successful all the same.

This second attempt at this challenge was intended to have a much higher score for Kerbals on Duna, but issues with how docking-port crossfeed (didn\u0027t) work meant that a second landing team was not feasible. Then, complications with the 0.21 -\u0026gt; 0.22 update caused the loss of the Duna return craft, requiring another one be sent out to Duna as a replacement. These problems caused the \u0027Mission Execution\u0027 score to be just \u00271\u0027, but did earn scores of \u00272\u0027 for both \u0027Crew Safety\u0027 and \u0027Mission Robustness\u0027, since everyone made it back despite losing two spacecraft and one rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, this was a good rehearsal for the mission profile of returning crews to Kerbin using different spacecraft which got them there and doing precise inter-planetary orbital insertions.
