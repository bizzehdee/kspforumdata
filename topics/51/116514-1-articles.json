Someone took my Poodle on MK2 body idea seriously and there are decent SSTOs that use Poodle as the \u0022intermediate stage\u0022.\n\nSo today I got the idea... what if I used SRB as the intermediate stage? Godly thrust, moderate weight, size - less than most of my \u0022intermediate\u0022 solutions.\n\nSo here\u0027s [BAAAC](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/BAAAC.craft). Another useless proof-of-concept that can be adapted into something useful - as it made it to the 80km orbit with no payload (other than Jebediah) but with 1500m/s left.\n\n![screenshot118.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot118.png)\n\nBAAAC is a run off the mill spaceplane, utilizing my \u0022dual propulsion\u0022 engines (essentially, NERVs clipped into LF fuselages with Whips at the end) and it would be perfectly capable of orbit without the SRB, if I put, say, structural fuselages or LF fuselages instead of it. Except this family of spaceplanes takes more than a little time to reach the orbit. Way more. They are meant for the \u0022Arduous climb\u0022 profile and make it really arduous, like fifteen minutes or so. So I made it into a \u0022fish jump\u0022 plane.\n\nIt flies moderately well. I\u0027d need to add canards to lift it before the end of the airstrip, but it climbs reasonably fast and handles rather okay.\n\n![screenshot79.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot79.png)\n\n1100 in horizontal flight, and we begin the climb.\n\n![screenshot82.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot82.png)\n\nFiring the nukes at 26km, when the jets die\n\n![screenshot83.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot83.png)\n\nThe nukes managed to pull me up to 50km but not much more. No lift, no horizontal speed to speak of, and TWR way below 1.\n\n![screenshot84.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot84.png)\n\nThis all changes the moment the BACC is fired.\n\n![screenshot85.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot85.png)\n\nIt takes only a moment and the situation afterwards doesn\u0027t look all that different at a glance. Still the same nukes, still good 400m/s short of orbit, still not even above 70km. Oh, at least the SRB is full so the TWR is a little better...\n\n![screenshot86.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot86.png)\n\nBut the truth is the 800 or so m/s of delta-V from when the SRB burned made a world of difference. The gravitational drag dropped so much that currently the nukes can keep up with it and keep pushing the apoapsis ahead of them. 80km apoapsis good 4 minutes ahead. Periapsis easily reachable. Oh, and hears deployed, whoops, forgot to fold them after launch.\n\nAt this point, 7 minutes after launch, orbit is just a formality.\n\n![screenshot89.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot89.png)\n\nWell, these are KER stats after I made it to the orbit.\n\n![screenshot94.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot94.png)\n\nAfterwards, it\u0027s a run-off-the-mill SSTO landing.\n\n![screenshot98.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot98.png)\n\n![screenshot108.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot108.png)\n\n(with obligatory three crashes until I finally didn\u0027t botch my approach.)\n\n![screenshot117.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot117.png)\n\nAnyway, the point is:\n\n**SRBs make decent intermediate engines.**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T19:58:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T19:59:44Z","Content":"we can use them as an engine that decouples, but then it woundnt be a ssto anymore ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T20:11:20Z","Content":"Oh, but why?\n\nNot to mention they are awesome structurally.

The weakness of a LF only design is the low TWR of Nukes. SRBs give you a good kick when you need it most and are pretty light once expended. (a BACC is 1.5 t a FL-T800 is .5 plus the extra engine mass) the bad ISP is offset by the efficiency of jets. I would light the SRB just as the jets flame out though.\n\nSuch a plane is less flexible than a liquid engine craft, but could be a relatively good way to get a nuclear space plane to orbit. Kickbacks would be the way to go because of their better Isp and dry mass ratio.\n\nI will need to experiment with this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T20:27:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T20:25:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E we can use them as an engine that decouples, but then it woundnt be a ssto anymore ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nTechnically: yes. The goal of many SSTOs is to reduce cost for repeated launches and I could see that working out since SRBs are cheap. Refueling might be tricky though. =P\nI wonder if it wouldn\u0027t be better to fire the SRBs earlier. Two reasons: You are shedding weight earlier which makes it easier for your NERVAs to finish the job and you can use the high TWR of the SRB to ascend steeper until you have left the thicker parts of the atmo behind you. At 35km you could point the nose back to the horizon and push your AP."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T20:35:23Z","Content":"Nice!\n\nNow I wonder if one using a replaceable booster could work.
