I saw everyone making mission reports, and after 250\u002B hours of blowing up rockets, figured I\u0027d start my own.\n\nI\u0027ll be breaking it up into different areas of operation, since I\u0027ve got missions ongoing in several parts of the solar system. I\u0027ll be updating them as I explore and develop there. Below will be a list of hyperlinks to the posts that pertain to said area of operations.\n\nAs of 6/2/15\n\n-Well, I made this first post! Will be updating later with more content, and plenty of pictures as I go along. My current mission is to send a salvo of probes to the Jool system, which I have never explored before, and hopefully recover science from each major body in orbit! Stay tuned!\n\n**KERBIN**\n\n\u003EMinmus\n\n\u003EMun\n\n**DUNA**\n\n**JOOL**\n\n\u003E\u003E*Mission 1: Scanning* [http://imgur.com/a/m86RY#0](http://imgur.com/a/m86RY#0)\n\n\u003E\u003E*Mission 2: One Way Trip* [http://imgur.com/a/axpO0#0](http://imgur.com/a/axpO0#0)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**Mission report 1: Satellite to Jool!**\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/m86RY#0](http://imgur.com/a/m86RY#0)\n\nAs shown in the pictures above (hopefully, assuming I did this right), I sent a SCAN satellite to the Jool system to start mapping out Biomes for an inevitable manned mission. I flew all around the system, gathering data from the inner three bodies, finally stopping at Laythe, because I ran out of fuel! Still got some pretty pictures, though!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T01:52:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Indy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T20:54:16Z","Content":"We all need more Jool in our lives. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhat\u0027s the gold-foil tank near the top of that satellite?
