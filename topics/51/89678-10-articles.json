The X-1 therefore had nothing to do with spaceflight history per se. It didn\u0027t even get 30% of the way to space. It\u0027s maximum speed is far, far below orbital or even a meaningful sub-orbital.

A decision I made (as you saw this last episode) is to have this and all future episodes be one and only one year each. The next episode will be 1963, and the one after that only 1964. At some point too much cool stuff will be in each year. I\u0027m not sure what I will do about that. Skip a lot? BUT! In the specific case of things like Mir, I have an idea of making a spin-off like I have done with my Shuttle-constructing.
