Well, Macfred, Thomlock and Gletrix did. Agake had crawled off to the nearly pristine lab module and was busy churning through a few quick experiments. (No reason to waste time when a perfectly working lab was on hand, right? Especially when it produced good numbers.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160404_ksp0461_pioneerlab.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022585\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160404_ksp0461_pioneerlab.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHallock meanwhile was good for conversation. First he wanted to know everything there was to know about the famous Thomlock Kerman. Sure, he\u0027d heard of him, who hadn\u0027t? One of the first kerbals to ever be launched into space, presumably long dead. For the old and white-haired farmer it was a bit of a shock to learn Thomlock was neither dead not lost. Strange new world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160404_ksp0337_pioneer.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160404_ksp0337_pioneer.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it turns out Hallock had been alone on the M\u00FCn for nearly three decades. Towards the end of their first tour the base lost contact with Kerbin. At first they thought it was due to equipment failure, but a quick drive over to Hudwin\u0027s old M\u00FCn lander (and its spare transmitter) disproved that theory. As far as they could tell there was nobody listening on Kerbin. The base couldn\u0027t support six kerbals long-term, so they waited until the last of their reserves were gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey drew straws to determine who would stay behind to keep the farm running. A simple task that should be enough to keep one of them alive indefinitely. Hallock drew the short straw, so the other five said their farewells and returned to Kerbin without him in the backup lander. And that was the last he\u0027d heard from any other kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, he could\u0027ve returned to Kerbin at any time using the original crew shuttle, but as he\u0027d lost all contact with the crew and Kerbin he figured something cataclysmic had taken place. Guessed that he might have even been the last kerbal alive. And so he kept farming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually he grew tired of maintaining all the different large plants in the greenhouse modules and switched to just growing their hybridized bananas. Normal bananas require a large tree to grow, so these were cross-bred with a few other strange fruits to produce something akin to a flowering banana-producing cactus. It was a strange fruit that _almost_ worked, but was just close enough to be annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for why his hair was so white? \u0022I was old when they sent me here. The years and the radiation and these strange yellow fruit probably haven\u0027t helped.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter they had all rested up and traded stories, Macfred telling Hallock of their Jool ship awaiting them in orbit, the elder kerbal suggested they take the two rovers for a drive to Hudwin\u0027s Landing and Ronton\u0027s Perch. These were the first two places where kerbalkind set foot upon the M\u00FCn, both very historic, though only Hudwin\u0027s lander remained. They were both located in the Crater of the First Kerbals, just a bit to the NorthWest of Pioneer Base. Less than an hour\u0027s drive if one was careful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred took a few minutes to report their status back to mission control, also informing them of the presence of their host. The Boss was insistent about bringing Hallock back to Kerbin with them, promising they would send up a replacement caretaker at the first opportunity. Hallock, however, was stubbornly refusing, suggesting he would never leave the base unattended, but would consider their offer while the other four were out on their trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they all climbed aboard the two Rothar rovers and rolled to the NorthWest in a small convoy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160405_ksp0344_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160405_ksp0344_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey made it about three kilometers from the base before Thomlock came up with a better idea. The two rovers individually would be difficult to control on the steep slopes of the craters. If they docked them together, however, they would increase their stability and possibly improve their traction on the loose regolith.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they hitched together the two little buggies and continued on their way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160405_ksp0353_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160405_ksp0353_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160405_ksp0361_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160405_ksp0361_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe descent into the crater was slow. One slip and the rover could easily get away from them, crashing down to the very bottom, never to be seen again. Thankfully there was an obvious gully they could drive through. Though it would come out somewhat lower than their first target, the reduced downslope was considered to be worthwhile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover was holding up well on even the steepest parts of the gully, but Macfred didn\u0027t want to challenge fate just yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160405_ksp0364_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160405_ksp0364_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually they reached the bottom of the gully and were forced to head out onto the crater rim itself. The transition was a bit... nerve-wracking, to say the least. And once they were over the edge there was nothing they could do to stop. It was all in the sure hands of Thomlock to guide them down to a place where the slope lessened and they could pause to catch their breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160405_ksp0385_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160405_ksp0385_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160405_ksp0396_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160405_ksp0396_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ancient one handled their descent with skill, and in no time they were climbing again, heading towards their goal. A goal that at first was indistinguishable from the other boulders in the crater. Yet soon the light of the Sun glinted of of various pieces of metal. (Macfred thought he saw an explosion, but blinked and the ill vision was gone.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then they were there. And thing looked very strange. Instead of resting on its legs, the lander appeared to be resting on its engine bell while its legs were stuck way up in the air and disconnected from the rest of the lander. Macfred radioed their findings back to mission control, and was told to hang on while they looked at a few things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160407_ksp0425_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160407_ksp0425_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, something was a bit strange. Back in mission control one of the techs had Gene run to the gift shop and grab a copy of his \u0022First Kerbal on The M\u00FCn\u0022 book. (Gene still had the only keys to the gift shop.) It was objectively a children\u0027s book, but it included the only known diagrams of the Mun Lander flown by Hudwin. Diagrams they had lifted from old, discredited history books, and which no one was certain were right. (The idea that kerbals had gone into space more than 90 years ago was not widely accepted as fact.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile poking through the book on his way back to MC-1, Gene decided to stop by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. After some discussion with the techs, who had met him there, he had Wernher whip up a quick mock-up. Sure enough, there were some strange changes at work between what was supposed to be and what was now. Structural changes having to do with a decoupler that wasn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanges were needed. Changes, and a system reboot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack on The M\u00FCn Macfred was busy poking around the old lander when the message was relayed up from Gene. \u0022Sulphur crew, be advised we\u0027re going to attempt to reboot the system. We think what you\u0027re encountering is another glitch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Another glitch? When was the other one?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The most recent one was just a few minutes ago. Nothing much to worry about, just hold on for a few seconds and everything will be A-OK.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160122_02_f9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160122_02_f9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd then they were there. And the thing looked amazing. Macfred was surprised to find the lander looked a bit different than in the old history books. Perhaps it had suffered from some recent impact? No way to know, really. He jumped off of the rover and bounded over to read the nearest flag. One strangely marked with the word RESCUE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently some kerbal named Jebediah had rescued the mighty Hudwin from this very crater some years back. Now all that remained was Hudwin\u0027s lander and one of the two rovers the experimental crews sent up to keep him company.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160407_ksp0426_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160407_ksp0426_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe others were already busy climbing over everything and poking their mittens into one of the oldest and most valuable sites in all of kerbal history - the first landing on the M\u00FCn. Thomlock was busy checking out the strange old rover while Gletrix was busy reading the plaques at the two flags. Agake was doing whatever weird stuff it is scientists do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeciding the lander was safe, Macfred climbed aboard. So strange to sit in the very first M\u00FCn lander, a thing that until a few munths ago had been pure legend. A legend so tenuous and impossible that every kerbal had thought it was fake. Even the World\u0027s First kerbals were shocked beyond belief when the newly formed space program had started finding artifacts in space, but this would absolutely floor them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe chronometer in the lander was still running and showed an elapsed mission time of 83 years, 391 days on the dot. He found it more than a bit odd that the lander\u0027s communications system was missing. There was an antenna just outside the cabin window, yes, and he could find where it appeared to have once connected to something in the cabin, but there was nothing there now. Very strange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe decided to take a look outside. Maybe the radio was rigged up on the roof? The upper airlock was easy to open, so he climbed out to look around. Gletrix began reciting Hudwin\u0027s First Plaque just as he emerged onto the top of the lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160407_ksp0430_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160407_ksp0430_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160407_ksp0429_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160407_ksp0429_rothar.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then he looked up and saw it. Kerbin, just barely over the rim of the crater. The Crater of the First Kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat a view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160407_ksp0431_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022583\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160407_ksp0431_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was still crawling over the old lander when mission control radioed up to ask him about the Sulphur 2\u0027s radio. Apparently they had lost contact with it five to six minutes ago, roughly around the time of the system reboot, and had been unable to reestablish a connection. And they were wondering if he\u0027d remembered to leave the telemetry radio turned on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did I leave the radio on? Yes, I think so. Gletrix?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t turn it off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And if she didn\u0027t turn it off, I\u0027m pretty sure none of the rest of us did.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few minutes passed before they called them again. This time it was The Boss on the other end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027d like you to wrap up your evaluation of the First Lander and head back to Pioneer Base to check on the Sulphur 2. We suspect, well, we have reason to believe something unusual is going on. Your new friend may be tampering with things.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Seems like a harmless old kerbal. Why would he do that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s been up there alone for several decades. He could be space crazy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that their short adventure to the Crater of the First Kerbals was over. Macfred rounded up the other three, got them all aboard their Rothar and made tracks up what appeared to be the smoothest exit. Except on the way up they spotted something else perched atop the rim of their smaller crater-in-a-crater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s just another flag?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix bounded off of the rover before anyone could tell her to stop. \u0022I\u0027ll check out the plaque!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160410_ksp0439_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160410_ksp0439_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother first landing, this time by one Lars Kerman. Nothing obvious was left except the plaque, so she hopped back aboard and they made their way SouthEast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the trip back to Pioneer base was relatively uneventful. In climbing out of the crater they first drove directly towards the rim, then angled so as to pass over the lip of it at an angle. They still caught a bit of \u0022air\u0022 when they fired over the top, but came down at an angle the wheels were more than capable of handling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160410_ksp0445_rothar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160410_ksp0445_rothar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing seemed particularly out of place until they got back within sight of the base.

All four kerbals instinctively pulled back from the window and hit the deck. Once the noises and the pinging had settled down and the floor stopped moving Thomlock looked outside again.

The psychologists were already constructing likely scenarios as to how it all had played out, as were a team from the local movie studio. (The cost for the filming rights was estimated into the millions.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now there were three kerbals with a good bit of free time on their hands. (The fourth, Agake, was busy with experiments in the lab. Waste not, want not.) They set about harvesting any RTGs they found while waiting for the ride from mission control to arrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully they had enough to keep them busy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile back at Kerbin, tests of the Sulphur LDAV were moving forward. The Jool mission was still a go, even without the Memory of Tomorrow, and they\u0027d already put too much energy into preparing both the aircraft and the Laythe lander to back down. The backup plan now was to use the LDAV as the interplanetary crew shuttle, outfitted with an environment module (and seven more years of food) along with a small, Tantares-built lab. Unlike the Memory this backup would only include enough water and oxygen to kickstart the system - everything else would have to be recycled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Laythe Descent/Ascent Vehicle therefore needed to be tested. Designed around the Sulphur lander, it included a heat-shielded lower stage, and would land under parachutes. The parachutes and landing legs would be jettisoned prior to returning to orbit, and the lower stage would propel them part of the way there. The upper stage was just another Sulphur series craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first test of the LDAV was to see if it could survive reentry and landing on rough terrain. Once landed the second test was to launch to Kerbin orbit. If the LDAV test article survived both, it would remain in Kerbin orbit and enter into service as just another Sulphur-series shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs with all such tests, this operation was to be conducted using automated routines. No reason to risk a kerbal\u0027s life just to see if this crazy plan worked. Officially the new heaviest thing ever, the Sulphur 3 LDAV Test Article was launched by three Mainsail-powered boosters, with three Skipper boosters as a second stage. The launch was mostly flawless, if a bit shaky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160414_ksp0013_ldav-test.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160414_ksp0013_ldav-test.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160414_ksp0018_ldav-test.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160414_ksp0018_ldav-test.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in orbit the craft was rotated 180 degrees, a heading it maintained until the reentry burn point was reached.
