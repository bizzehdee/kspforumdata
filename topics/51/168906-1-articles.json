However a combination of increased schoolwork and a poorly timed burnout caused me to slowly withdraw from activity here, and I dropped Kerbal Space Program in favor of other games that didn\u0027t require me to think quite as much. To me, there just wasn\u0027t anything I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efelt\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like doing in the game anymore. Having played the game since version 0.20, I had sent countless landing missions to the Mun, assembled several space stations, and built an endless fleet of aircraft and other miscellaneous ships. I had attempted interplanetary missions multiple times, but each one fizzles out, as I could not muster the concentration and persistence to follow through on any of them. But now I\u0027ve finished the tough classes that consumed all my time, I\u0027ve had plenty of time to enjoy other games, and now I feel that it\u0027s time to come back to KSP. This is partly due to the fact that I will be attending college to study aerospace engineering this coming August, and partly due to a realization that despite my many years of playing the game, I\u0027ve never actually sent Kerbals\u00A0beyond the orbit of Minmus. So, here I am, back after a year-long hiatus, with the intention of finally doing those things I\u0027ve never done before. To give myself a little extra motivation I\u0027ve decided to showcase my efforts here, for all of you to see.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 The main crewed spacecraft I\u0027ll be using is the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EScipio,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ea three-seat ship with a Soyuz-like assembly, with an orbital module to add extra living space and serve as an airlock for spacewalks. It is capable of making the round trip to and from the Mun, and will likely be used for any other stations I establish in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, as well as for any interplanetary missions I undertake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LZhtMtv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LZhtMtv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 The first part of my plan is the construction of a space station in lunar orbit, with the intention of using it to support a future series of bases on the surface. This station will have the ability to refine ore in orbit before being sent back to Kerbin, and will also be a waypoint for crews on the way to and from the surface of the Mun. It will house a minimum crew of three, with capability for up to six. This station is named\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMarius\u003C/em\u003E and currently consists of two modules, with more in development. At the left is the forward node, which has four docking ports to the fore, aft, zenith, and nadir. In the future, it will house a docking module to receive extra spacecraft and a storage module for minerals brought up from the surface. The center module is the station\u0027s core module, which currently serves as the main activity area for the crew. It has a set of engines for minor orbital adjustments, although with a Scipio docked at the station\u0027s rear the engines are rendered unusable. The four unoccupied docking ports around the Core Module\u0027s fore section will house a dedicated airlock, a truss section for the station\u0027s main solar arrays, a habitation module for temporary crewmembers on their way to or from the surface, and an observation module, which will also likely feature communications equipment for connecting with the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/N7LYddA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N7LYddA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost modules will be delivered to the station with a modified Scipio propulsion module, which will be crashed into the Mun afterwards.

I\u0027ve been swamped with work most of the time, and my spring break was taken up by a vacation to Hawaii (it was very nice, by the way), as well as a college visit and spring cleaning, but now I have some time and there isn\u0027t any other game I wanted to play today, so I got to come back to KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/l9nvqLc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l9nvqLc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI continued the\u00A0test flight of \u003Cem\u003EAurelian\u003C/em\u003E, the next phase of the mission involves sending up a crewed\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EScipio\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to tow it to the Mun. I\u0027m using a new, smaller and more efficient booster for the Scipio, consisting of three less powerful stages and no SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pUOjjdO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pUOjjdO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third stage is still concealed in a fairing, due to its smaller diameter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oBCkHHG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oBCkHHG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EScipio\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0rendezvoused with\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAurelian\u003C/em\u003E and the still-attached upper stage propelled both ships out of Kerbin\u0027s orbit and was then expended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oTN5T2A.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oTN5T2A.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EScipio\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0engine was used for course corrections en route, but the lander\u0027s engines were used for the orbital insertion due to the lander\u0027s higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E compared to the single engine on\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EScipio\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9J1DV1Q.png\u0022 alt=\u00229J1DV1Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne revolution after entering orbit, the crew powered up the lander and undocked for descent. This landing will be relatively simple compared to future ones, and is intended more as a test for the lander systems instead of a serious scientific expedition.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EScipio\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0will be controlled autonomously and will proceed to dock at the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMarius\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0space station, where it will be refueled and await the arrival of the crew, which will arrive at the station after completing their surface mission, where they will relieve the current crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cG6GbD7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cG6GbD7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/b54yeLt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b54yeLt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe descent and landing went smoothly, with no hitches. I was able to put it down right in the middle of a crater I picked out from orbit, and then hovered and maneuvered the craft to a precise landing on flat\u00A0ground, which I\u0027m quite proud of, considering how rusty I am at this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully, I\u0027ll have the time and inclination to continue this soon, but my schedule is still extremely unpredictable, and likely will be until mid-May.
