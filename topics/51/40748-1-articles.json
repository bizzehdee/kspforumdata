The ambitious aim of this program was no less than the first manned spaceflight to the Mun in Kerbal history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA whole week had been spent planning, engineering, building and testing, with moderate success, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I, the most massive Kerbodore64-controlled spacecraft ever built.

Only Bob seemed to be a little nervous, remembering the tragic end their predecessors Orfrey Kerman, Eroly Kerman and Neillong Kerman had found on an early test flight. Although KSP\u0027s rocket engineers promised to have \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctaken the results of those flights into account\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, Bob had astonishing difficulties to make out any differences between those early designs and the final M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I. Jeb excitedly reminding him that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthis thing under our butts is the biggest bomb ever built\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, didn\u0027t help at all.

As soon as the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers, the four liquid booster engines were shut off, the remaining fuel was pumped into the main tank and the 19-nozzle main engine was used to establish a stable circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cwoai7d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cwoai7d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as Bob realized the great reduction of the risk of falling back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and thus following their predecessors into their fiery death, he slowly let loose that handrail that Jeb Kerman\u0027s original Space Tape hadn\u0027t been able to hold in its designated place during the ascent when Bob in agony had been cramping to it. He, while being reminded by Jeb about the billions of other \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfun things that can theoretically still happen\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, wasn\u0027t able to reach the button to separate that machine of hell from the rest of the rocket before Bill had already smashed it multiple times. So no less than eight Sepratron I roared and hauled the massive launch stage off the rocket and back towards where it came from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YEoNUyI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YEoNUyI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA round-trip around Kerbin later, the three kerbonauts watched the trail of smoke caused by the launch stage burning up in the atmosphere, just when the first warm rays of light gently burst through the darkness, making the inner of the capsule glow in an almost golden color. Nearly breathless Bill and Bob agreed, while Jeb has been busy with an other bottle of Kerba Cola, that this had been the most beautiful Kerbol-rise they had ever seen. Sadly, no image can describe, what these three lucky kerbals had the unique opportunity to view with their eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vlj83XL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Vlj83XL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OSRjpdY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OSRjpdY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bill and Bob still have been stunned by that fantastic view, Jeb reminded them, that they would now \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbetter forget about that icky stuff\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 as they \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cstill can burn some rockets\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Mission control agreed with him, although they chose to use some slightly different wording, so, before anyone could say any word about the next steps to to, Jeb had already fired up the nine engines of the transfer stage, smashing the kerbals into their seats and launching the rocket into a transfer trajectory towards the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L9yRCYe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L9yRCYe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the burn had ended and while jeb has been in a sort of ecstasy, caused by the joy of the rocket\u0027s immense power pressing the blood out of his brain, Bob seemed to have an idea. The fear of death seems somehow to be always an inspiration to him, so he babbled something about \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cusing the Mun\u0027s gravity to slow us down\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. While Mission Control was insistently warning him not to make changes to the flight plan, not again after that ComSat disaster, he decided that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthe one who has the rocket\u0027s joystick in his hands is the one who flies the rocket\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and pulled off his small \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccourse correction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving some hours off until the crew would hit the Mun, it was time to unpack the equipment they would need later on the munar surface. Bob has been somewhat concerned about ejecting the escape tower that would\u0027ve hauled the MK1-2 capsule out of danger if something went wrong. Jeb however reminded him, with a surprisingly rejoice in his face, that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthis wouldn\u0027t help us now anyway\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. As soon as this was out of the way, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I command module was separated from the rest of the rocket, turned around by 180 degrees and then re-docked, nose forth, to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I Munar Exploration Module inside the rocket\u0027s payload area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T6UE41v.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022T6UE41v.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QNnfZCo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QNnfZCo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AbdXHqL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AbdXHqL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the fact that this presumably complex maneuver went on without any complications and within only a few minutes, as has been to be expected, many parties claimed their responsibility. While Bob always speaks of his \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csovereign rocket driving skills\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, Mission Control somewhat agrees with him, claiming to have assigned that task to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthe only kerbonaut who wouldn\u0027t blow up that thing into a giant fiery mess whenever he comes to fly a spacecraft \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 well, most of the time\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Wernher von Kerman on the other side insists into the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cobvious fact\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that his \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnew, improved rocket stabilization system along with the improved reaction control system of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 would be the real hero here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the short, unavoidable discussion on who was the most important person in the Kerbal Space Program, the payload fairings and the transfer stage were blown away, so the Munar Exploration Module has been seeing the light for the first time since its packaging down in the vehicle assembly building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wc10kKx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wc10kKx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uNoPVzP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uNoPVzP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all those separation charge explosions gone off, it suddenly became mysteriously quiet in the command capsule. Only the fizzling of Jeb opening another bottle of Kerba Cola shortly broke the silence while the three kerbals, watching Kerbin become smaller and smaller in the far, realized that they were now departing to a journey much further away from home than any kerbal had ever been before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6TU4XNI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226TU4XNI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tHf7MOD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tHf7MOD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next two hours, Jeb\u0027s continually been nerving the others with what he would do as soon as he landed on the mun. He seemed to have some very special affection to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s Mk1 Munar Exploration Roving Vehicle they were carrying alongside the landing equipment. In the middle of the tenth explanation of how far the rover could theoretically jump in the Mun\u0027s low gravity (Bill and Bob already were pondering how long a kerbal would survive outside the rocket), Jeb suddenly fell silent. Surprised by this unexpected reaction, the others both turned around to the command capsule\u0027s small window \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and immediately altogether lost their breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mfulp0J.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mfulp0J.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OJKyAq1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OJKyAq1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sight of the first Kerbin-Kerbol-eclipse ever witnessed, had even stunned Jeb - something that, like Bob remarks, doesn\u0027t happen very often. Jeb\u0027s been so stunned that he even dropped the bottle he had just opened, spilling thousands of floating bubbles of Kerba Cola all around in the command capsule. I will save you the decent discussion Bob immediately started while Bill was enjoying playing with floating bubbles of Kerba Cola. In the confusion of the mess, Jeb caught a glance to the flight computer\u0027s display in front of him, that just had beeped to announce the entry into the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence. It turned out that Bob\u0027s plan of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cusing the Mun\u0027s gravity to slow us down\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 had worked out pretty well. Maybe a bit too well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pVVT0ji.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pVVT0ji.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore Bob could even start his attack of panic usual in such situations, Jeb had already made the genius proposition of dropping \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Call that crap we are carrying\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and using one of his \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cpocket boosters\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to ride down to the munar surface. With Jeb waving a Sepratron I in front of Bill\u0027s face, the following few minutes of M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I\u0027s radio log got spammed by personnel of Mission Control nervously talking at Bill that choking kerbonauts was not a good idea while being three men in a three-men craft in space - and wouldn\u0027t help at all. Completely ignoring Bill\u0027s reactions, Jeb came up with his next glorious proposition. If they had to die anyway, why not have some fun in their last minutes? As he already reached for throttle control, Bob, just recovering from his downtime, saved his claim that his calculations were correct and the craft must have been slower than expected, as he realized that Jeb\u0027s wasn\u0027t a bad idea at all. A series of short, harsh pro-grade burns could make the craft fast enough to swing around the Mun in a short distance \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 better than attempting to swing right through it. Almost surprised by Bob not, as usual, disagreeing with him, Jeb joyfully pulled the lever up for the first boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4ZR5GlO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224ZR5GlO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the risk of crashing, now into the Mun instead of into Kerbin, out of the way, the next problem became obvious. With their current, now much too high speed, M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I would never be able to reach the planned stable munar orbit at an altitude of around 60 km that would be required for a safe landing and later return from the surface. At least not without burning an immense amount of fuel. Fuel that was needed for the return home. On the other hand, if they wouldn\u0027t slow down, they would be catapulted directly home to Kerbin, losing any hope to get to the munar surface in the near future. In short, a decision had to be made: would they now abort the mission, having to suffer Jeb\u0027s ranting about cowardly giving in for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnot even closely significant reasons\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 for the next hours of flight, or would they proceed the mission and risk never coming home again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Bill and Jeb were still ranting at each other, Bob, in an unusual flush of bravery, told Mission Control to continue the flight. The immediate discussion, which Bob opposed with that they \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Care \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E now, talking of flying home we can later\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, disappeared in the noise that came up when Jeb brought his \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cpocket boosters\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the benefit of everyone\u0027s mental condition, the craft now entered the dead spot behind the Mun and Mission Control suddenly fall silent. With the pretty weird feeling of all three of the crew agreeing, for what was probably the first time ever, the crew calmed down and enjoyed the glory of the giant silverish shimmering sphere in the middle of nothingness approaching them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5moWKPg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225moWKPg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile being in complete darkness behind the Mun, Jeb was dying to initiate the first of two burns that would establish their circular orbit. After Bob constantly reminding him that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cten minutes more or less\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 actually \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u003Cem\u003Edo matter\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, he almost ripped of the thrust control lever when he finally got Bob\u0027s go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/boiUDfO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022boiUDfO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dTHRl4p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dTHRl4p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kerbol, still with Kerbin in front of it, slowly rising above the horizon, the radio connection to Mission Control also came up again. This brought up the next topic of discussion, as now it had to be decided who would pilot the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I Munar Exploration Module down to the Mun. Additional complications were introduced by Mission Control admitting that the mission instructor forgot to inform the kerbonauts about that the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I Munar Exploration Module had only two seats, so one of them three had to stay up in the command module. You can imagine the enthusiasm when Mission Control announced that they had designated Jeb to execute the landing maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K57Lh26.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K57Lh26.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this decision being set, Bob volunteered to stay in the command module, in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ca safe distance to whatever mess those morons will produce down there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Before he could even transmit his decision to Mission Control, Jeb had already, and in an amazingly short time, made his way through a clutter of dripping fuel lines and cables hold together by Jeb Kerman\u0027s original Space Tape into what Bill likes to call \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthe sardine can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Soon after Bill had followed and after much less time than Bob had calculated it would take to go through the entire safe-start-up protocol of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9li\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s I Munar Exploration Module, the docking port was jammed shut and with a silent \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHUMM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the vehicle came loose, immediately starting its descent towards the silver, shiny surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aPwHtpJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aPwHtpJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aMOCoqu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aMOCoqu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PbZX574.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PbZX574.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs expected, the sardines soon lost contact to Mission Control, due to their can\u0027s short-range communication device. For the entire stay, Bob would be the only other kerbal they would have direct contact with. Sure Jeb hadn\u0027t payed any attention when the mission instructor had announced the exact coordinates of the landing site and sure he also wasn\u0027t paying attention when Bob now announced them again. He just decided to be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cspontaneous\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, as they would \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccertainly find a nice spot when coming down\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Bill, due to the roaring of the engines, didn\u0027t understand any of Jeb\u0027s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Creally important facts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 on \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chow much boom this baby has\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and what all \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccool stuff\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 you could do with it, which admittedly was conveyed by the fact that Bill actually didn\u0027t pay any attention too, Bob wondered over the fact that the Munar Exploration Module seemed to be descending much faster than he had calculated to be any good for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, Jeb was disturbed by the big alarm signal over his head howling up, tinting the can into a claustrophobic red light and even predominating the noise of the engines. Spotting the big, red, flashing fuel dispenser symbol on the flight computer\u0027s display, he informed Bill that the mission\u0027s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnow gonna be fun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.
