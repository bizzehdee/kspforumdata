The first mission was a success, but while my kerbal was on EVA, her jetpack decided to have too much thrust at the right time, and have too little thrust at the wrong time (she decided to crash into the ground at 89.1 m/s.) My second mission was with Bartfurt and it was fine until his lander fell over. Then I decided to goose it to see if it would go back upright, but, predictably, the side of the lander shredded. I\u2019m gonna try again soon, though.
