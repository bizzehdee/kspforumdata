Each connecting part has ladders so when you dock with the cupola, you can lower yourself into the capsules while the things spins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/3te2k4r29/sugoro_cling.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sugoro_cling.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/pz2ro66f5/sugoro_climb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sugoro_climb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/az5tml05d/sugoro_climb_0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sugoro_climb_0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason I can\u0027t get the accelerometers to work. They worked during the construction phase. Now they show zero force. I guess that\u0027s a bug. I\u0027m sure there was over 1 G on the edges during the first test because when I sent Tombles Kerman outside while the station was under spin, he was slowly slipping, and when I tried to move him, he detached and fell off the structure which was a bit scary because it was pretty fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/dj61ufd35/sugoro_fall.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sugoro_fall.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals don\u0027t slip from ladders even on Eve, so this must\u0027ve been quite a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station can be disassembled and more modular parts can be added in one mission because each end part is capable of limited mobility. Plug out, plug in. But I won\u0027t do it because my CPU will kill me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis took more than a week.
