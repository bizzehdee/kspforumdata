I would like base this play-through on plausibility. However, it\u0027s important to stress that this isn\u0027t in any way meant to simulate history. It\u0027s alternative history. I think it\u0027s fun to think \u0022what-if\u0022. It will make more sense when the \u0027series\u0027 begins. I\u0027ve been having trouble with my install, so I had to redo it, hence the delay.

Used as a testing site for Britain missiles, Australia and subsequently the CSRIO rode on the coattails of England\u0027s funding. Through the years of military funding, the government was able to grant CSRIO funds. Not a lot, but enough to carry out scientific and rocketry research. The time for Australian supremacy over the cosmos was now. \n\nThe Tall Tim (1957)\n\n![B54Rsfw.png](http://i.imgur.com/B54Rsfw.png)\n\n(Tall Tim pictured here, payload exposed)\n\nThe Tall Tim was the first sounding rocket designed by Australian minds to be launched. It consisted of an RF receiver with a parachute and battery, designed to be slow down impact, giving it enough time to transmit the findings of the many scientific instruments attached to the second stage. With a height of 3.7 meters and weighing exactly a single ton, the Tall Tim was used six times as a cheap way to discover the atmospheric qualities of Earth.\n\nScientific Gathering Research Rocket (1958)\n\n![VeBFMyz.png](http://i.imgur.com/VeBFMyz.png)\n\n(SGRRs\u0027 payload)\n\nThe SGRR was launched December 26th, 1958. It contained a scientific core based off the Sputnik launched a year earlier, a backup battery and a guidance system. Also on its payload were scientific instruments similar to one used years earlier with the Tall Tim. A navigation camera was also attached, with the intention of taking a photo of Earth in Space.\n\n![WjzE0NY.png](http://i.imgur.com/WjzE0NY.png)\n\n(SGRR on the pad)\n\n![A199aMv.png](http://i.imgur.com/A199aMv.png)\n\n(SGRR flying over the Australian deserts)\n\n![gqU3Z9Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/gqU3Z9Y.png)\n\n(SGRRs\u0027 payload is released from its fairing, soaring further into the atmosphere)\n\n![g38LwAx.png](http://i.imgur.com/g38LwAx.png)\n\n(Australia\u0027s first object in space)"}]}
