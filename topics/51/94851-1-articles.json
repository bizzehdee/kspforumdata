Most of these were sounding rockets which are an effective means of gathering early science. Two rockets are shown in the vessel summary below. Due to the size of the 6.4x Kerbin, and the strange aerodynamics of the sounding rockets, they have been limited to gathering science from only 3 biomes: shores, water and grasslands. This has still provided quite a bit of progress up the tech tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe other feature of Sounding rockets is that they are cheap and so do not require a lot of time to construct. By the time I was completing the third tier of rockets, they would require about 6 hours of construction time, but even that would be shortened by re-use of the experiments and nosecones. More about KCT strategy below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManned launches have occurred through the Proteus series of rockets. Due to the economical features of SRBs, these were used quite extensively. The Proteus Mk. 1 achieved multiple altitude contracts by only varying the amount of solid fuel at the time of launch. Most of these, however, lost the RT-10 SRB upon landing due to the 7\u002Bm/s landing speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter completion of the 33km altitude record (day 26), the 73km contract was spawned and this was accepted alongside breaking the atmosphere. The Proteus Mk. 2 was designed and put into the construction queue at this point. This was the first rocket to feature a liquid stage which consisted of an aerozine-powered LV-909. It was expected this would not be a difficult launch after simulations but at the time of the actual mission (day 37), a mid-flight abort was required. A gravity turn was begun too early in the launch and so the ascent trajectory was far too shallow. The stages were separated successfully and the pilot (Jebediah) was recovered safe and sound. Recovery chutes were also successfully used allowing recovery of 3800 out of 5970 funds. A second launch of the rocket occurred on day 40 and was successful. An astounding 5233 out of 5971 funds were recovered on the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Proteus Mk. 3 was designed at this point to send a kerbal into a stable orbit and return him to the ground. This, however, proved exceedingly difficult to accomplish due to the woeful state of the facilities. Instead, a new mission was devised to make use of the Stayputnik probe core recently unlocked. A new launcher, the Accolade Mk. 1, was designed and construction commenced on day 38. This is a three-stage rocket, the first stage consisting of the BACC SRB, the second stage, a kerosene-fueled Coxswain engine and finally, the upper stage using again the Aerozine-fueled LV-909 for a total vacuum delta-V of 7124m/s. Simulations showed that the launcher had just enough fuel if the pilot was careful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction was completed on day 51 and the vehicle was carefully rolled out on to the launch pad. The initial ascent seemed to be carried out quite well. The gravity turn seemed optimal, with a nearly 45 degree velocity at about 45km altitude, well into the second stage. The high acceleration of the LV-909 and slight imbalance of the satellite required careful management, but the mission seemed to be going well. By the time the engine had nearly flamed out, a 450km apoapsis was achieved - but the periapsis was only 80km! This is too low in 6.4x by about 11km and I thought all was lost. Then, I remembered that the payload fairing had one last decoupler available. The vessel was pointed toward Kerbin\u0027s center and the decoupler fired. Success! The periapsis was raised to 91.4km - just enough to be a stable orbit! Stages 1 and 2 were recovered providing 6221 out of 9232 funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WwiN9gf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WwiN9gf.png\u0022\u003Eorbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a chart of the progress of funds, science and reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ARPALjW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ARPALjW.png\u0022\u003Eprogress chart\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KCT strategy consisted of boosting the VAB level 1 and 2 to 0.65 and 0.6 respectively. This was done so that while a Proteus launch was prepped at 0.65 construction rate, many sounding rockets could be prepared in parallel and launched. The SPH is now getting boosted and is currently at a 0.2 build rate. The next few build points will be pumped into the SPH to support upcoming plane-based missions. Some points are put into tech unlocks, but it is still on 4 sci/day I believe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA race was made to aerodynamics (currently being unlocked) to get to planes as fast as possible. This is due to the fact that the more difficult part tests occur \u0022in-flight\u0022 which is far easier to control with a plane. So, getting working planes should help with the part-test contracts. It will also enable aerial survey contracts to be conducted which are quite lucrative. While I currently have 47 science and could unlock another 45-science tree node, I\u0027m saving up for landing gear to fully enable flight-based contracts. The current tech tree status is below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/31LtHH0.png\u0022 alt=\u002231LtHH0.png\u0022\u003Etech tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shania_L\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shania_L\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using Paul Kingtigers 6.4k, or Raptors original?

Magico is genius for putting that in when the vehicles cost so much in terms of time and money to build. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as for managing so many launches, the KCT system is pretty neat because the calculation determining how quick a launch proceeds is dependent on a bunch of factors. One of the obvious ones is how many recovered parts you have in inventory. If you\u0027re recovering and re-using, you end up saving, not just money, but time as well. The other thing you get is the more often you use a part, the smaller the amount of time needed to put it into the next launch. So, this encourages re-use, not just of parts, but of the rocket design itself. So by the end of my few dozen launches, my sounding rockets would only take a day or less because I\u0027d reuse the nosecone and science package and had already used the booster rocket and sticks dozens of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting launches so fast, I\u0027d run them parallel by loading my KCT points into VAB levels 1 and 2. Level 1 eventually reached 0.65 and level 2 was at 0.6 so I was always building two rockets in parallel. I\u0027d have a manned rocket at level 1, but these usually took several days to construct. The next sounding rocket would be built in parallel and depending on how big the next major launch was, I\u0027d be able to launch 4-6 sounding rockets. I had to play with KCT once or twice before I realized this was a good way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DivisionByZero","CreatedById":62591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T06:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMini-update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe age of aerospace has begun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have taken a very different approach to this career game than previous ones I\u0027ve attempted. Instead of working up the rocketry side of the tech tree, I\u0027ve pushed for controlled flight. The reason for this, which I mentioned in the previous update, is due to the large number of \u0022Part Test\u0022 contracts that require strange combinations of altitude and speeds as well as the survey contracts which require somewhat precise maneuvering. The strategy is looking positive right now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first opportunity for an airplane came from a parts test for a set of B9 aerospace engines turned into Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney JT8Ds. These engines have the nice feature that the air intake is integrated into the engine nacelle which reduces the part count. An image in flight is here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KBXb1m4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KBXb1m4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual contract called for testing the engines while splashed down. With a working airplane, I could also take on a visual survey mission! With only flight control unlocked and no landing technology, a vertical take-off scheme was used making use of the largest sounding-rocket motors to provide the initial thrust. Seeing as how the build-rate for the VAB is still much larger than that for the SPH, I launched form the pad instead of the runway. The system worked beautifully. A large number of parachutes were attached to maximize the chances of surviving splashdown, but I neglected to dump most of the kerosene before hitting the water. Most of the plane broke up, but I lucked out and one wing and engine remained attached. CONTRACT FULFILLED!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after this initial testing flight, the aerodynamics science node was unlocked providing regular access to the engine as well as several new wings. New contracts were also generated for additional advanced engines such as the Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney J58 and GE YJ93 engines. These exceptional contracts will both a combined 120 science, 70k funds and about 200 additional reputation for the part tests alone. A similar vertical take-off plane was designed for use with these experiments and is shown below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KTqgczt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KTqgczt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design features two Science Jr. pods as these were recently unlocked and haven\u0027t been used to obtain science data yet. The new jets have the range to easily reach the mountains and the parachute landing makes them ideal for gathering data while landed on the ground in this rocky terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome science and funds were spent on KCT upgrades and these went straight into the SPH (now up to about 0.4). This will become far more important once wheels unlock and I have to use the runway. Use of landing gear will eliminate the 2 sounding rocket motors and 8 parachutes which will free up those parts for the sounding rocket science components, mystery goo, 2 HOT thermometers and possibly even conversion to a 2-seater to include a scientist with the pilot! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll see how it goes from here!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
