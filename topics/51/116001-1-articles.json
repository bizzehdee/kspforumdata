Unfortunately, the groundbreaking of what would become known as \u0022KSC\u0022 was mired by budget overruns, laborer strikes, and a brief kerfuffle with neighboring Kermany. So while the agency was supposed to be, and would undoubtedly ultimately become, the premier space exploration operation and exotic vacation destination, its beginnings were rather humbler\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe spaceplane hangar was propped up with spare wood beams, the facility administration office was forced to be housed in a trailer home bought at a \u0022family discount\u0022 from the program director\u0027s Murikan in-laws, and the impressively-named \u0022Astronaut Complex\u0022 that would house both the leading facility staff and the glamorous guests lacked even the most basic amenities like a swimming pool or massage parlor. But one day, this picturesque seaside resort would become a global juggernaut of technology and relaxation.\n\nTo make matters more difficult, the ramshackle facilities were operated by equally ramshackle staffers who spent most of their time drinking wine. Despite a desire to whip these layabouts into shape, the agency was allocated a meager 15 \u0022upgrade points\u0022 by the Kerpublican Construction Teamsters (KCT), which were allocated 8:4:3 between the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB (for the agency\u0027s aspiring space exploration program); the Spaceplane Hangar, or SPH (for the resorts future sight-seeing tours); and the Research \u0026 Development Labs (for the development of higher-quality amenities and vehicle components). This yielded embarrassing production rates of 0.5 BP/s in the VAB and 0.3 BP/s in the SPH, and a Development Team capable of processing 4 Raw Science Ore Units per day.\n\nIn order to demonstrate its worth, not just to the Kerpublican government that occasionally deigned to give the agency with official funding, but also the general public who would be the agency\u0027s principal customers, the first and most imperative. To this end, the program director had accepted basic government contracts as a stipulation for receiving a small amount of start-up capital. While the initial technological resources of the agency were not impressive, consisting primarily of scraps found various alleys and stolen salvaged equipment from the Kermany Kerfuffle incident, it would have to do. Or, if it would not do, then at least the breeze off the sea would make for a pleasant napping atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - FASA 1.25m Redstone Launch Clamp\n\u003E - ER-7500 Computer Flight Unit\n\u003E - Kerbal Engineering System\n\u003E - MRS Guidance Nose-Cone\n\u003E - Probodobodyne HECS Probe Core\n\u003E - Aerodynamic Nose Cone\n\u003E - Small Nose Cone\n\u003E - Basic Fin\n\u003E - Z-100 Rechargeable Battery Pack\n\u003E - RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster\n\u003E - RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster\n\u003E - PresMat Barometer\n\u003E - 2HOT Thermometer\n\u003E - FL-A10 Adapter\n\u003E - Communotron 16\n\u003E - Illuminator Mk3\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This was truly a time for greatness, and a time for action!\n\n***UT Y1-D1-H0-M2***\n\nAs the program director opened his eyes from a short power nap and looked out from his office, he realized that if he didn\u0027t start getting some work done, he might soon only be able to afford the discount-aisle snacks, and greatness demanded better.\n\nUnfortunately for the fledgling agency, greatness would have to make do with limited initial means on both the scientific and engineering fronts. The assemblykerbs in the VAB had awkwardly chosen this historic moment to walk out in protest over only receiving three hours of break time in a six-hour day, so management was forced to press the facility\u0027s interns into service, and to these interns was dealt the momentous task of designing and assembling the agency\u0027s first rocket. While some critics pointed out that the KSA was relying primarily on parts left behind by fleeing Kermanians at the end of the Kerfuffle, and while accusations were made that these \u0022rocket parts\u0022 were actually Kermanian bombs that had failed to detonate, the program director defended the agency\u0027s decision to press ahead with the materials at hand, and further retorted that if the project did *hypothetically* include components of Kermanian bombs, the Kerpublic couldn\u0027t just *have* these things lying around, and that it would therefore be not just a stride forward for science but a *public duty* to dispose of them by shooting them into the sky.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Objectives**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Surpass previous powered flight records by achieving an altitude of 18 kilometers\n\u003E     - Transmit scientific data collected by onboard instruments\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]**Construction**\n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     - MRS Guidance Cone (scaled down to 0.625m)\n\u003E     - 2HOT Thermometer^1^\n\u003E     - PresMat Barometer^1^\n\u003E     - (2x) Z-100 Rechargeable Battery Packs^1^\n\u003E     - RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (scaled down to 0.625) (thrust limited at 24%)\n\u003E     - (3x) Basic Fins (scaled down to 50%)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Part Count: 11\n\u003E     - Height: 2.0m\n\u003E     - Weight: 543kg gross - Includes total of 352kg solid rocket fuel\n\u003E     - Stage 1: 1.58 TWR (69.8s burn) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 1,739 m/s (Atmospheric)\n\u003E     - Total Delta-V: 1,739m/s (Atmospheric)\n\u003E     - Construction Time: 5d, 2h, 36m\n\u003E     - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1861\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]**Crew**\n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     - None\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nA short simulation was run by the one engineer who forgot that there was a strike scheduled in order to gain confidence that the ***Maginot I*** design would be capable of reaching the desired altitude, and after assuring the program director that success was likely, he demanded four keuros as compensation and then joined his coworkers on the nearby beach.^2^\n\nConstruction was begun at UT Y1-D1-H0-M2 and completed at UT Y1-D6-H2-M38. Rollout was delayed until the following morning, followed by launch at UT Y1-D6-H4-M46.\n\nOnce set up on the launchpad, the ***Maginot I*** transmitted back several data recordings as a test of its systems, and then promptly lifted off. The craft followed a vertical ascent until reaching a speed of approximately 70-80m/s, at which it turned to a roughly 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angle of ascent and continued burning with the guidance cone\u0027s stability systems engaged to hold the heading, continuing to transmit data back to Mission Control.\n\nAbout a minute and a half into the flight, ***Maginot I*** surpassed the target 18km altitude and continued into the upper atmosphere, where it continued to gather and relay data back to the ground. After reaching an apex of 22.1km, the craft began its descent. When the program director asked Gene Kerman, the mission controller, when they would be able to recover the craft, it was pointed out that the ***Maginot I*** actually had no means of returning to Kerbin\u0027s surface in a survivable manner. Resigned to the loss of the first powered craft to leave Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere, the program director poured himself a glass of wine and sat back to watch the remainder of the descent until it struck the surface of the Sea of Kerlin at nearly 130m/s, destroying the craft instantly. Although a number of spectators wrote to the local newspaper the following day accusing the KSA of dropping bombs into the Sea of Kerlin, the overall response of the public was predominantly positive, and the government bureaucrats funneled a small stipend to the agency in order to lure the striking engineers back to their workstations.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Flight Time:** 3 minutes, 43 seconds\n\u003E - **Flight Ceiling:** 22.1km\n\u003E - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A711.64\n\u003E - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A10 (0%)\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Surpass previous powered flight records by achieving an altitude of 18 kilometers\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Transmit scientific data collected by onboard instruments\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Altitude Record of 18km!  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A17,200 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A72 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A612\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Temperature Scan from Launchpad \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.54\n\u003E - Temperature Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Shores \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Temperature Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Temperature Scan from Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.62\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan from Kerbin\u0027s surface \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.54\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Shores \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan from Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.62\n\u003E - Telemetry Report^3^ from Launchpad \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.18\n\u003E - Telemetry Report^3^ while flying at Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.42\n\u003E - Telemetry Report^3^ from Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.54\n\u003E - Probe Report^4^ from Launchpad \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.18\n\u003E - Probe Report^4^ while flying at Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.42\n\u003E - Probe Report^4^ from Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.54\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Thankfully, their absence did not adversely affect the ***Maginot I*** mission, and there was some speculation that the engineers might not even be necessary.\n\nWhile the engineering department was reacclimating to the concept of \u0022work,\u0022 the folks over at the R\u0026D facility were already hard at work performing their black rituals for transmuting the Raw Science Ore Units relayed from ***Maginot I*** into useful blueprints. The considerable success of the mission had generated enough RSOUs to allow simultaneous forays into the most fundamental concepts of any larval luxury travel destination (basic rocketry, simple engineering, and the core principles of aviation). \n\nUnaware of, or perhaps indifferent to, the fact that waiting on the findings of the R\u0026D lab, the engineers quickly set to work designing and assembling the ***Maginot II***, with the objective of surpassing the records set by the intern-designed ***Maginot I*** and sending a \u0022real rocket\u0022 into space itself.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Objectives**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Escape the atmosphere on a suborbital flight.\n\u003E     - Record and transmit temperature, pressure, and telemetry data from beyond the atmosphere.\n\u003E     - Record and transmit temperature and pressure data during an overland descent prior to impact.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]**Construction**\n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     - MRS Guidance Cone (1.25m)\n\u003E     - 2HOT Thermometer^1^\n\u003E     - PresMat Barometer^1^\n\u003E     - (2x) Z-100 Rechargeable Battery Packs^1^\n\u003E     - RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (100% scale) (thrust limited at 30%)\n\u003E     - (4x) Basic Fins (100% scale)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Part Count: 12\n\u003E     - Height: 4.0m\n\u003E     - Weight: 4,042kg gross - Includes total of 2,812kg solid rocket fuel\n\u003E     - Stage 1: 1.50 TWR (79s burn) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 1,984 m/s (Atmospheric)\n\u003E     - Total Delta-V: 1,984m/s (Atmospheric)\n\u003E     - Construction Time: 7d, 4h, 29m\n\u003E     - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,080\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     [\\*]**Crew**\n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     - None\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIt was not lost on the program director (or on the interns) that the final product handed over by Engineering was almost identical to *Maginot I*, only larger (the chief engineer was quick to point out the addition of a fourth stabilizing fin).

Brilliant!\n\nTragically, such brilliance would take almost four weeks to fully gestate, so attention was turned back to ***Maginot II*** as the finishing touches were applied at UT Y1-D12-H4-M38. Rollout was immediate, and the actual launch took place at UT Y1-D12-H5-M23.\n\n***Maginot II*** initially followed a very similar path to its predecessor, maintaining a vertical ascent until reaching approximately 100m/s (which occurred at an altitude of 850m), then turned to an 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA ascent angle. Unlike the agency\u0027s first flight, however, this turn was to a 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA bearing rather than a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA bearing, sending ***Maginot II*** towards the Kerpyrenees mountains to the west. The full-sized RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 thruster burned out at MET 01:19, with the craft having reached an altitude of 26.7km and traveling over 1,050m/s.\n\nAt approximately MET 02:15, ***Maginot II*** surpassed an altitude of 70km and became the first Kerbal-made craft to reach the vast emptiness of space. Fortunately, no Kerpublicans were on board to suffer existential or philosophical crises at the realization of their own insignificance, and instead the probe computer dutifully logged a variety of scientific data and transmitted back to Mission Control. The probe reached an apokee of approximately 89.6km before beginning its unguided descent, reentering the atmosphere at MET 04:42. ***Maginot II***\u0027s final transmission contained temperature and barometric data from just above the western highlands before it was destroyed on impact at MET 06:03 while traveling 554m/s.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Flight Time:** 6 minutes, 3 seconds\n\u003E - **Flight Ceiling:** 89.6km\n\u003E - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A79.84\n\u003E - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A10 (0%)\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Escape the atmosphere on a suborbital flight.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Record and transmit temperature, pressure, and telemetry data from beyond the atmosphere.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Record and transmit temperature and pressure data during an overland descent prior to impact.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Escape the Atmopshere!  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A115,000 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A76 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A650\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Temperature Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Temperature Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Highlands \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Temperature Scan from space near Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.80\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan while flying over Kerbin\u0027s Highlands \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.26\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan from space near Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.80\n\u003E - Telemetry and Probe Reports from space near Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.20\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

As the mounting interest from the Department of Tourism also resulted in mounting pressure of a demonstration that the program could in fact replicate its success with kerbaled flights, the program director requested that the warlocks focus on **Survivability**, as dead staff (not to mention dead tourists!) would be horrible for business.\n\nAs R\u0026D began the arcane refining process, the director located the engineering department celebrating in the resort\u0027s wine cellar and, after giving them several full seconds to sober up, tasked them with the next great step for the program.

The only pilot kerbal enough for such a task was a loud, brash Murikan by the name of Jebediah Kerman, who eagerly (maybe a little *too* eagerly) jumped at the opportunity to be strapped on top of two barely-controlled explosive devices and propelled beyond the pale.\n\nAn initial simulation (costing \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A135.9) revealed a minor potential staging error between the first and second stages which the engineers were instructed to correct before launch. The hope was that this correction would allow the craft to maintain sufficient velocity to escape the atmosphere, as its simulated counterpart had only mustered an altitude of 55.2km.\n\nConstruction on ***Lancer I*** was commenced at UT Y1-D12-H5-M32. While this was underway, the R\u0026D Lab reported the successful transmutation of RSOUs into fresh blueprints. Most of the pilots grumbled that perhaps they should have researched something called **Survivability** *before* beginning construction on the first rocket-propelled kerbal-guided craft, although it was later agreed that none of the proposed parts were likely to have been able to save the obviously doomed Jebediah.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Survivability (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A716)**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Small Escape Tower\n\u003E     - RealChute Radial Chute\n\u003E     - Heat Shield (0.625m)\n\u003E     - Z-200 Rechargeable Battery Bank\n\u003E     - Z-1k Rechargeable Battery Bank\n\u003E     - Fuel Cell\n\u003E     - Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Unit\n\u003E     - Universal Storage Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Bay\n\u003E     - Radiator Panel\n\u003E     - Telus-LV Bay Mobility Enhancer\n\u003E     - LT-05 Micro Landing Strut\n\u003E     - Illuminator Mk2\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n***Lancer I*** was completed at UT Y1-D24-H5-M43 in the late morning. Rollout was immediate, but as it took nearly an hour and a half the actual launch did not occur until later that evening at UT Y1-D25-H1-M11.\n\nAfter testing the new scientific instruments on the launchpad, Jebediah performed a perfunctory systems check (\u0022I don\u0027t see the snack dispenser...?\u0022) before Mission Control disconnected his microphone and remotely triggered the first booster\u0027s ignition. As with ***Maginot II***, Jeb had been instructed to hold a vertical ascent until reaching a velocity of 100m/s (which occurred at 880m altitude), then turned to a roughly 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA ascent angle. ***Lancer I***\u0027s flight path was set up to take it north across the Bay of Kerbay, and it fell into a bearing of about 343\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA north-northwest.\n\nThe Hybrid Rocket Booster that Jebediah himself had provided burned out at MET 00:41, having propelled the craft to an altitude of 5.3km and a velocity of 240m/s. The second-stage RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022, a more proven engine, took over, and at MET 01:27 ***Lancer I*** passed the 18km altitude mark. Jebediah flew into history as the first kerbal on a powered flight into the upper atmosphere. The RT-10 burned out at MET 01:49, 31.2km, 800m/s, and Jeb continued his ascent towards space.\n\nUnfortunately, while the staging flaw had been corrected by the engineers, it proved insufficient for penetrating the atmosphere. Much to Jeb\u0027s dismay, ***Lancer I*** was only able to coast to an apokee of 67.5km, just short of what ***Maginot II*** had identified as the boundary of space, before beginning its descent at MET 03:25.\n\nIs \u0022practice\u0022 for future flights, and to test the maneuver\u0027s feasibility, Jeb was instructed to hold the craft retrograde using the cockpit\u0027s built-in reaction wheels and descend engines-down for as long as possible before separating the booster and arming the parachute.

As appealing as this sounded to the program director, the fact of the matter was that the program in no way had the technological capacity to do such a thing, so the boffins at the R\u0026D Lab were cut loose on researching what they called **General Rocketry**. Nobody was sure who, exactly, General Rocketry was, and several senior staff suggested issuing a standing offer of surrender in case he should ever turn up, but despite these shadowy obstacles the program pressed forward resolutely, if uncertainly.\n\nWhile the R\u0026D rituals were under way, however, work elsewhere had to continue. Rather than try to use the program\u0027s existing arsenal of solid fuel boosters in another potentially failed attempt to put a kerbal into space, it was decided to focus on projects closer to home until the latest and greatest explosions were field-ready. The R\u0026D Field Research Team offered the program the proceeds of their Baked Goods \u0026 Wine Charity Sale in exchange for the development of a simple transport vehicle that could deliver reports and data around the resort grounds quickly.\n\nAs most of the Engineering department thought that the lack of rocket construction meant \u0022vacation\u0022 and disappeared, only the few remaining behind were tasked with developing a small staff car for transportation around the resort and efficient collection and delivery of that information between facilities.\n\nSince the P-1A \u0022Papillon\u0022 scout plane and the KSA Science Kart, as well as the Mission Control renovations, would all take over a week to complete, all non-essential personnel were given the week off. R\u0026D took off of their own accord unannounced after finishing summoning General Rocketry.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **General Rocketry (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A716)**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - RT-2 \u0022Grasshopper\u0022 Solid Rocket Booster\n\u003E     - BACC \u0022Thumber\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster\n\u003E     - SpaceY 05S SRB (0.625m \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 5m)\n\u003E     - SpaceY 06R Radial SRB (0.625m \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 6m)\n\u003E     - SpaceY 09S SRB (0.625m \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 9m)\n\u003E     - TT-38K Radial Decoupler\n\u003E     - TT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer\n\u003E     - FL-T100 Fuel Tank\n\u003E     - FL-T200 Fuel Tank\n\u003E     - FL-T400 Fuel Tank\n\u003E     - FL-T800 Fuel Tank^1^\n\u003E     - LV-T15 \u0022Dachshund\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E     - LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThe first of the projects to be completed was the ***P-1A \u0022Papillon\u0022***, a short-range, propeller-powered monoplane the agency/resort could use to conduct nearby survey contracts for prospective clients and guests. As it happened, the agency had partnered with a leading travel planner specializing in the most exotic destinations, the Anomaly Surveyor Group, who had identified the ruins of a former Kerpublican air base just a few kilometers off the coast from the resort grounds. This air base had been destroyed during the Kermanian Kerfuffle, but ASG believed it would make an excellent tourist destination and was willing to pay the KSSLTA for conducting a visual evaluation of the site. The newly constructed scout plane would be the perfect vehicle for such a job.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Objectives**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Locate the burnt-out space pod in the island airfield\u0027s hangar.\n\u003E     - Climb to the top of the control tower at the island airfield.\n\u003E     - Return to the KSA resort grounds intact and alive.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Construction**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Mk1 Inline Cockpit\n\u003E     - D-25 Radial Propeller Engine\n\u003E     - Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage\n\u003E     - Tail Connector B\n\u003E     - (2x) LY-01 Fixed Landing Gear\n\u003E     - LY-05 Steerable Landing Gear\n\u003E     - (2x) Swept Wings, 140% Scale\n\u003E     - (2x) Elevon 5\n\u003E     - (3x) AV-R8 Winglet\n\u003E     - (2x) EAS-4 Strut Connector\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Total on the Runway  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Flight Time at 100% Throttle: 42 minutes\n\u003E         - Length: 9.6m\n\u003E         - Width: 13.4m\n\u003E         - Weight: 5,968kg (2,000kg liquid fuel)\n\u003E         - Delta-V (Surface): N/A\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Time: 11d, 0h, 28m\n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A19,634\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Crew**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Test Pilot Valentina Kerman\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThe ***P-1A \u0022Papillon\u0022*** was completed at UT Y1-D33-H2-M26, but as this was in the middle of night and the scout plane had no landing lights, take-off was delayed a few hours until UT Y1-D33-H5-M0.\n\nOnce on the runway, Valentina conducted a quick systems check and status report before firing up the engines at MET 01:00. The generally poor condition of the runway made \u0022straight\u0022 takeoff difficult and resulted in much bouncing as the plane picked up speed, but the pilot was able to get the craft airborne with no serious problems or structural damage. After clearing the beach and barnstorming the sunbathing engineers, she took a heading of 135\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (southeast) towards the island destination. The ***P-1A*** leveled off at around 650m altitude for the flight, and reached a top speed in level flight just shy of 100m/s. Valentina reported that the plane was unusually \u0022twitchy\u0022 about its roll commands, and an engineering intern wandering through Mission Control at that moment surmised that the roll authority elevons had been placed too far from the body of the craft.\n\nAfter a flight time of just under seven minutes, Valentina executed a successful landing at the island airfield and absolutely did not roll the plane over and destroy the right wing due to assymetrical brake torque on the frontal landing gear. After taxiing to the hangars and control tower, Val quickly discovered another engineering flaw, namely that the buffoons had not installed any means for her to deboard the plane without falling to the ground. So Val fell to the ground.\n\nThe burnt-out capsule was identified, evidence of a young space program destroyed too soon as a result of a K-2 rocket attack during the Kermanian Kerfuffle. The loss of the island program had set the Kerpublic back months, if not years, in their mission to reach space and stay there. Val said a quick prayer in the form of a jingle from a snack commercial and then made her way to the derelict control tower, successfully scaling the tall structure and then descending it rather less gracefully.\n\nWith the reports completed, it was time to head home, but the lack of a ladder once more reared its head, forcing Valentina to improvise in order to reboard the ***Papillon***. This accomplished, she taxied back to the end of the runway and took off uneventfully, returning to KSC and taxiing to the designated parking spot by the space plane hangar.

Wizard Wernher claimed that this node\u0027s name was \u0022**Stability**\u0022, and since that sounded like rather a nice thing for KSSLTA launch vehicles to possess, the program director authorized the necessary ceremonies.\n\nNo further work was necessary until the contractors completed their renovations to Mission Control at UT Y1-D36-H4-M6, expanding the facility to accommodate the simultaneous management of up to nine contracts. (Mission Controller Gene Kerman had previously been forced to handle all such matters himself, and was only able to manage three at a time. Gene was, needless to say, very pleased to have enough desks for a couple of interns to delegate all the work to while he took a nap.) During this time, the Kerpublican Construction Teamsters Union delivered materials for an additional minor upgrade, which raised the VAB\u0027s sole production line rate to 0.8 BP/s.\n\nFollowing the hiring of Gene\u0027s henchmen college interns, contracts began pouring in. Many manufacturers wanted the official KSSLTA stamp of approval on their part designs, and many of these would require no more than a simple launchpad test without any actual mission. Some of the experimental parts, however, held promise in the goal of finally sending a kerbal to space. After a quick design period and a \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A153.1 simulation to confirm the likelihood of success (with no glaring engineering flaws, unlike ***Lancer I***\u0027s simulated run), production began on ***Lancer II*** at UT Y1-D36-H4-M6.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Objectives**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Put the first kerbal into space on suborbital flight.\n\u003E     - Observe Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 in near space.\n\u003E     - Transmit Magnetometer Scan from near space.\n\u003E     - Collect and recover scientific data from splashdown in ocean.\n\u003E     - Recover the craft intact.\n\u003E     - Recover the pilot alive.\n\u003E     - Test recovery of jettisoned stages.\n\u003E     - Test FASA Launch Tower on Launchpad.\n\u003E     - Test SpaceY 06R Radial SRB on Launchpad.\n\u003E     - Test arming of RealChute Cone Chute within contract parameters (1km-7km, 100-900m/s)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Construction**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Command Stage  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Mk1 Inline Cockpit\n\u003E         - RealChute Cone Chute (Nylon, Single, Main)\n\u003E         - Universal Storage QuadCore\n\u003E         - (2x) Universal Storage Science Bay\n\u003E         - 2HOT Thermometer\n\u003E         - PresMat Barometer\n\u003E         - Double-C Seismic Accelerometer^1^\n\u003E         - Universal Storage Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Bay\n\u003E         - Universal Storage Magnetometer Boom Bay\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Second Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - BACC \u0022Thumper\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (55% Thrust Limiter)\n\u003E         - (2x) RealChute Radial Chute (Silk, Single, Main)\n\u003E         - (4x) Basic Fin, 200% Scale\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]First Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - (2x) SpaceY 06R Radial SRB, 0.625m\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D6m (80% Thrust Limiter)\n\u003E         - (2x) RealChute Radial Chute (Silk, Single, Main)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Launch Supports\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - FASA Launch Tower\n\u003E         - FASA 1.25m Redstone Launch Clamp\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Total on the Launchpad  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 26\n\u003E         - Height: 17.5m\n\u003E         - Mass: 13,509kg (9,450kg solid fuel)^2^\n\u003E         - Delta-V (Surface): 2,307m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Command Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 11\n\u003E         - Mass: 1,376kg\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Second Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 9\n\u003E         - Mass: 8,015kg (6,150kg solid fuel)\n\u003E         - TWR: 1.49 (76.8s burn)\n\u003E         - Delta-V: 1,826m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]First Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 6\n\u003E         - Mass: 4,087kg (3,300kg solid fuel)\n\u003E         - TWR: 1.49 (28.7s burn)\n\u003E         - Delta-V: 482m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Time: 9d, 5h, 52m\n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A113,613\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Crew**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Test Pilot Jebediah Kerman\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOn account of being scheduled for nearly ten days of construction and with no other ongoing projects, once again all unoccupied staff (which is to say, everyone except the engineers and R\u0026D sorcerers) were given further vacation time.

As soon as the rocket was out of the VAB, the few engineers who weren\u0027t fast enough to disappear were put to work preparing for the surface testing of various minor parts in connection with some of the small contracts that were inundating Mission Control. Rollout took just over two hours, with launch at UT Y1-D47-H0-M1.\n\nAs was becoming customary, Jebediah burned vertically until reaching a velocity of 90-100m/s, then slowly turned the craft to an 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA ascent angle. It was noted a short while later that ***Lancer II*** had wound up on a 98\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA heading instead of traveling due east, and Mission Controller Gene Kerman made a note that upon return they would have Jeb work on his \u0022aim\u0022 to improve the ascent headings.\n\nThe first-stage SpaceY boosters successfully separated at MET 00:29 and parachutes deployed for recovery, with confirmation later coming from Mission Control that they recovery was successful. The second-stage BACC \u0022Thumper\u0022 took over, burning out at MET 01:47 with the ***Lancer II*** at 33.8km altitude and traveling 1,415m/s. At MET 02:37, Jebediah Kerman became the first ever kerbal in space as the ship passed the 70km altitude mark! Jeb was eventually persuaded to conduct the obligatory crew report and run the requested magnetometer and Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 experiments, and was also successfully talked down from trying to get out of the cockpit and \u0022see what space tastes like.\u0022 Mission Control made notes not to allow Jeb on future unprovisioned flights unless he had been well-fed in advance, and also to look into what improvements could be made to training and equipment to allow future kerbonauts to go on EVA in space.\n\n***Lancer II*** reached an apokee of 101km at MET 04:24. Jeb retracted the magnetometer boom and prepared for descent, separating the still-attached Stage 2 at MET 05:00. Atmospheric encounter occurred at MET 06:13 (total time in space: 3 minutes and 36 seconds), and Jeb was instructed to hold orientation \u0022nose up\u0022 during the descent unless it became a danger to the scientific instruments at the base of the command stage. Reentry heating was encountered at MET 06:58 with the craft traveling over 1,500m/s at an altitude of 36.7km, but the heating had largely subsided by the time the craft reached 9km altitude, by which point it had slowed to under 600m/s.\n\nThe command stage parachute was successfully armed at an altitude of 6.9km and a velocity of 280m/s, satisfying the conditions of its particular contract, and proceeded to deploy without issue. Splashdown occurred at MET 10:03, and Jeb spent a few moments running additional experiments and composing his reports in iambic penatmeter replete with food metaphors. Recovery was at MET 12:00, and Jeb was given a cookie.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A733.00\n\u003E - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A18,387 (61.61%)\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Put the first kerbal into space on suborbital flight.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Observe Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 in space near Kerbin.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Transmit Magnetometer Scan from space near Kerbin.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Collect and recover scientific data from splashdown in ocean.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the craft intact.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test recovery of jettisoned stages.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test FASA Launch Tower on Launchpad.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test SpaceY 06R Radial SRB on Launchpad.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test arming of RealChute Cone Chute in flight.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test RealChute Cone Chute in flight over Kerbin  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A112,857 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A72 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A66\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test FASA Launch Tower at the Launch Site\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,835 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test SpaceY 06R Radial SRB landed at Kerbin  \n\u003E \n\u003E - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,245 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Crew Report from space just above Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A73.60\n\u003E - Crew Report whiile splashed down in Kerbin\u0027s Waters \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.44\n\u003E - EVA Report from Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.44\n\u003E - EVA Report \u0022splashed down\u0022 in Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.92\n\u003E - EVA Report while \u0022flying\u0022 over Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A73.36\n\u003E - Magnetometer Scan from space near Kebrin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A73.00\n\u003E - Magnetometer Scan from Kerbin\u0027s oceans \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71.20\n\u003E - Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Observation while in space near Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A710.80\n\u003E - Temperature Scan from Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.72\n\u003E - Atmospheric Pressure Scan from Kerbin\u0027s oceans \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.72\n\u003E - Recovery of a vessel after a sub-orbital flight \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A74.80\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Jebediah Kerman  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - First Kerbal in Space Ribbon\n\u003E     - Research II Ribbon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC For collection of 50 RSOUs\n\u003E     - Splashdown Ribbon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC For a splashdown of a vessel in water\n\u003E     - Multiple Contracts Ribbon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC For completing five contracts\n\u003E     - G-Force V Ribbon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC For withstanding acceleration of 5g for three seconds\n\u003E     - Mach II Ribbon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC For flying horizontally at mach 2 below 30km in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere\n\u003E     - 10% Solid Fuel Booster Ribbon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Awarded for launching with solid fuel booster at 10% of ship mass\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Court Wizard Wernher von Kerman assured the program director that a mystical tech node called \u0022Basic Science\u0022 would serve this role perfectly, and would also offer a great number of additional benefits to the program going forward. This investment also persuaded the KCT Union to provide an additional upgrade point, which went to the engineering team in the spaceplane hangar in recognition of their work behind the scenes on the mission to the island airfield.^1^\n\nMission Controller Gene Kerman had received a number of contract offers, and while the VAB team was working to prepare a \u0022non-live\u0022 parts test for several major manufacturers, Kerbal Motion LLC had provided the agency with its own version of the 2HOT Thermometer and requested that it be tested at a particular site for calibration purposes. Since the site in question was fewer than 40km from the KSSLTA complex, this was a perfect opportunity to test the engineering tweaks made to the ***P-1A \u0022Papillon\u0022***, and work began on preparing the plane for its second mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACnot only was the thermometer to be tested added to the top of the fuselage, but the roll authority elevons were moved closer to the center of the plane in order to improve its stability, and two under-wing Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Units were attached in order to take advantage of the flight and collect more RSOUs for the R\u0026D team. The plane would need about six and a half days to prepare for the flight, largely due to these new Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 units.\n\nWhile awaiting the ***P-1A***\u0027s readiness, the program director used most of the agency\u0027s funds to begin construction on a more robust launchpad capable of accommodating heavier crafts. Although the KSSLTA had not encountered any issues yet, it was clear that as they sought to press further into space, the current arrangement of \u0022launching from a small hill of dirt\u0022 would be inadequate to accommodate the larger rockets such missions would require.\n\nAlthough this job drained the coffers, these were quickly replenished (in small part) by the completion of several small parts tests, which combined to earn the agency just over \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A114,000.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test TT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer at the Launch Site  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,835 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test TT-38K Radial Decoupler landed at Kerbin\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,835 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test RT-2 \u0022Grasshopper\u0022 Solid Rocket Booster at the Launch Site  \n\u003E \n\u003E - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,700 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test MRS Liquid Fuel Engine, 0.625m \u0022Sparkler\u0022 landed at Kerbin\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,949 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test Launch Escape System landed at Kerbin  \n\u003E \n\u003E - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,700 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A71 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A61\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nFollowing these successful tests, another Field Research Team baked goods and wine sale was held to finance additional studies around the resort grounds, and so work began to prepare the ***KSA Science Kart Mk.1*** for another outing.

The target site was about 38km SSW of the KSSLTA grounds, requiring about seven minutes of flight each way. Val arrived at the site without issue, performed the contracted temperature recording, and returned to KSC, opting for a return flight over land and an approach to the runway from the west. While the relocated roll elevons performed as expected, it was noted prior to takeoff that the rear landing gear had been configured to steer in the opposite direction as desired.

This resulted in far too steep an ascent angle, and a westward heading that the probe core was unable to correct. Despite these issues, the simulation suggested that the craft would just barely be able to circularize a stable orbit.\n\nThe simulation also suggested that the original design was \u0022part-inefficient\u0022 for its task, and that this (combined with the VAB Engineers Guild refusing to work with more than 30 separate parts at once) prevented the design from making use of more useful parts, such as additional reaction wheels or stage recovery parachutes. Modifications would be necessary before actually undertaking an orbital mission.\n\nThe decision was made not to attempt to perform any parts-testing contracts during this flight, partly in order to placate the VAB Engineers (the program director muttered something about forcing them to eat cake until they agreed to work with greater quantities of parts, but this idea was quickly abandoned as ridiculous) and partly to leave space for more essential components. While a future flight would have to be dedicated to the necessary in-flight parts testing, the redesign allowed the addition of recovery chutes and inline reaction wheels with enough torque to nudge the rocket in the right directions.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Timeline**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Construction Started: UT Y1-D60-H0-M47\n\u003E     - Construction Completed: UT Y1-D71-H3-M10\n\u003E     - Launch Time: UT Y1-D71-H5-M53\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Mission Objectives**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Put the first kerbal-made object into stable orbit around Kerbin.\n\u003E     - Conduct and return Materials Bay data from space near Kerbin.\n\u003E     - Conduct testing of flight computer for maneuvers outside Mission Control\u0027s communications range.\n\u003E     - Recover all jettisoned parts.\n\u003E     - Recover the craft intact.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Construction**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Command Stage  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Probodobodyne HECS Probe Core\n\u003E         - RealChute Cone Chute (Nylon, Single, Main)\n\u003E         - Service Bay (1.25m)\n\u003E         - SC-9001 Science Jr. Materials Bay\n\u003E         - Z-200 Rechargeable Battery Bank\n\u003E         - Small Inline Reaction Wheel\n\u003E         - TR-18A Stack Decoupler^4^\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Second Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - FL-T400 Fuel Tank\n\u003E         - LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E         - RealChute Radial Chute (Silk, Single, Main)\n\u003E         - AE-FF1 Aistream Protective Shell\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]First Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - (2x) TL-T800 Liquid Fuel Tank\n\u003E         - LV-T15 \u0022Dashchund\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E         - (2x) SpaceY 06R Radial SRB (0.625m \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 6m) (40% thrust limiter)\n\u003E         - (2x) MRS Decoupler, Radial Mini\n\u003E         - TR-18A Stack Decoupler\n\u003E         - (4x) RealChute Radial Chute (Silk, Single, Main)\n\u003E         - (4x) AV-T1 Winglet\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Launch Supports\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - (2x) TT-18A Launch Stability Enhancer\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Total on the Launchpad  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 29\n\u003E         - Height: 18.2m\n\u003E         - Mass: 19,110kg (3,300kg solid fuel; 5,500kg oxidier; 4,500kg liquid fuel)\n\u003E         - Delta-V (Surface): 3,779m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Command Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 7\n\u003E         - Mass: 402kg\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Second Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 4\n\u003E         - Mass: 4,121kg (1,100kg oxidier; 900kg liquid fuel)\n\u003E         - TWR: 3.80\n\u003E         - Delta-V: 1,546m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]First Stage\n\u003E \n\u003E          \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Part Count: 16\n\u003E         - Mass: 14,587kg (3,300kg solid fuel; 4,400kg oxidizer; 3,600kg liquid fuel)\n\u003E         - TWR: 1.54\n\u003E         - Delta-V: 2,233m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Time: 11d, 2h, 23m\n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A113,905\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Crew**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - None\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAs construction on the ***Clervoy I*** was ongoing, R\u0026D announced completion of its latest breakthroughs and that they would all be going on an extended vacation until the program was able to return enough RSOUs to make it worth their while.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Advanced Rocketry (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A745 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Completed UT Y1-D68-H1-M11)**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E     - LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E     - HGR FG-90 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E     - MRS 0.625m \u0022Sparkler\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\u003E     - SpaceY 10R Radial SRB\n\u003E     - Sepratron I\n\u003E     - SnubOtron\n\u003E     - 1.875m Stack Decoupler\n\u003E     - TT-70 Radial Decoupler\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n***Clervoy I*** launch occurred at UT Y1-D71-H5-M53.\n\nThe rocket executed the usual vertical ascent to 100m/s, then a turn to an angle of 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and a bearing of more-or-less 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. Unfortunately, this proved too steep an ascent angle for the ***Clervoy I***, which had apparently inherited its builders\u0027 attitudes towards work and showed no inclination whatsoever of executing any sort of gravity turn of its own accord. As was also necessary with its builders, direct encouragement (and eventually, force) was necessary in order to get the ***Clervoy I*** to lazily turn towards the horizon. By the time it reached 30km, its ascent angle was only down to 65\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA.\n\nThe LV-T15 \u0022Dashchund\u0022 driving the first stage exhausted its fuel at MET 01:49, having reached an altitude of 52.3km, but with a projected apokee well past 100km. As the ship passed into space, the on-board materials study was conducted, and then plans were quickly made for establishing orbit. Due to the lack of a communications array around Kerbin and the oversight of the design team that resulted in the probe relying only on its built-in, minimal-range transmitter, it was necessary to perform the orbital burn long before reaching apokee while the probe was still in contact with mission control. The burn began at 78km on a somewhat radial-in direction in an ultimately futile effort at circularization.\n\nAt MET 03:06, orbital trajectory was established, although a somewhat eliptical one (ranging from 75km to almost 120km). Only eight seconds later, the probe lost communications with Mission Control as it passed beyond its feeble transmission range. Contact was reestablished at MET 38:52 as the probe was passing over the Kerpyrenees, and the staff in the control room celebrated the completion of the first orbit around Kerbin.\n\nAs the assignment demanded forty minutes of stable orbit, however, the probe would have to make another pass before descending. This gave the team the opportunity to test the programmable flight computer, setting up a series of planned maneuvers so that the probe would, without manual control from KSC, orient itself retrograde, perform its descent burn, arm all parachutes, and separate from the orbital stage in preparation for landing. Contact was lost again at MET 40:51, and by the time it was reestablished, ***Clervoy I*** had just completed all programmed maneuvers and was on course for splashdown about 100km east of KSC. \n\nAtmospheric reentry occurred at roughly MET 01:19:00. Although the probe dropped below the horizon and lost communications again a couple of minutes later, its parachute had been correctly armed. No issues with deployment occurred, and after a safe splashdown, the recovery team retrieved the probe and quickly returned it to the resort\u0027s for-profit space history museum.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Duration:** 01:24:24\n\u003E - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A720.88\n\u003E - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A110,151 (73.00%)\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Put the first kerbal-made object into stable orbit around Kerbin for 40 minutes.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct and return Materials Bay data from space near Kerbin.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct testing of flight computer for maneuvers outside Mission Control\u0027s communications range.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover all jettisoned parts.\n\u003E - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the craft intact.\n\u003E - Contracts Completed]\n\u003E     - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Orbit around Kerbin!  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A137,500 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A79 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A675\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Orbit and Recovery!\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A121,000 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A73 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A615\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]Science Collected \n\u003E \n\u003E - Materials Study while in space near Kerbin \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A714.40\n\u003E - Probe Report while splashed down at Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.24\n\u003E - Telemetry Report while splashed down at Kerbin\u0027s Water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.24\n\u003E - Recovery of a vessel returned from Kerbin orbit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A76.00\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

From this point on, I\u0027m going to try to substantially shrink my non-spacey write-ups, particularly those that involve reusing the same fundamental designs. I felt like writing them up was getting too tedious, and if I\u0027m boring myself with them, I can\u0027t expect to keep readers occupied with them. The usual level of attention will still be given to actual \u0022progressing the mission\u0022 activity, but the grindy contract prostitution stuff\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACparticularly the grindy contract prostitution stuff that takes place below 70km altitude\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACis going to get shortened up. I already had all of the above stuff written up when I made the decision, though, so here it is!\n\u003E 3. Despite my historical fondness for the LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine made available by **General Rocketry** (unveiled in the ***Maginot III***), I\u0027m just such a huge fan of the LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 for orbital-insertion stages early in the game, which **Advanced Rocketry** unlocks. It also opens up the first 0.625m engine (the MRS \u0022Sparkler\u0022) and the first 1.875m engine (the HGR FG-90), and although I don\u0027t have fuel tanks for either of those yet, **Basic Fuel Systems** is next on my list and should help with that issue. That said, given the location of other 0.625m engines in the tech tree like the LV-T95 and Rockomax 48-7S Spark, I suspect that SETI-CTT would rather the Sparkler be another tier up the ladder in **Propulsion Systems**.\n\u003E 4. The KSSLTA has not yet unlocked 1.25m heat shields, and so the TR-18A Stack Decoupler is \u0022upside down.\u0022 This will keep it attached to the command stage after separation so that it can \u0022shield\u0022 the service bay and Science Jr. during descent, if necessary.\n\u003E 5. At this point, I jumped into CapCom for \u0022remote access\u0022 to my contracts without having to return to Mission Control. Now that the \u0022Orbit around Kerbin!\u0022 contract was completed, I could go back to Mission Control and pick up the \u0022Orbit and Recovery\u0022 contract and kill two birds with one stone by recovering the ***Clervoy I*** probe (which I was going to do anyway).

While the tracking station, launchpad, and mission control had been improved to accomodate the \u0022next generation of space exploration,\u0022 the VAB was so outdated and bereft of basic amenities like massage parlours that the engineers refused to handle more than thirty parts at a time.

However, such launches would not be cheap.\n\nPerhaps overly ambitious, the science director suggested that the agency drum up some hype and conduct some useful tests of its own at the same time by designing a test craft for a powered landing on Kerbin itself, as a purported prelude to doing the same on the Mun (which was widely speculated to lack the soft, gentle atmosphere of Kerbin that made parachutes work). Everyone agreed that this should not only be simple to accomplish, but would also be a useful \u0022trial run\u0022 and could use the opportunity to collect some low-atmospheric flight data for the R\u0026D team. As such, work was begun on the test landing craft at UT Y1-D75-H5-M25, and simultaneously a summer intern working under the program director snuck into the finance office and stole the paperwork necessary to authorize renovations on the Astronaut Complex.\n\nFinance Director Mortimer Kerman was in the hospital for a week as a result of his ensuing heart attack.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - H-400 1.875m Fuel Tank\n\u003E - H-800 1.875m Fuel Tank\n\u003E - H-1600 1.875m Fuel Tank\n\u003E - H-3200 \u0022Long Walk\u0022 Fuel Tank\n\u003E - 1.25m - 1.875m Adapter Fuel Tank\n\u003E - 1.875m Nose Cone Fuel Tank\n\u003E - 1.875m Sloped Nose Cone Fuel Tank\n\u003E - Radial Booster Tank\n\u003E - FL-R10 RCS Fuel Tank\n\u003E - Stratus-I Roundified Monopropellant Tank\n\u003E - Stratus-V Roundified Monopropellant Tank\n\u003E - Stratus-VI Roundified Liquid Fuel Tank\n\u003E - Stratus-VI Roundified LFO Tank\n\u003E - Stratus-VI Cylindrified Liquid Fuel Tank\n\u003E - Stratus-VI Cylindrified LFO Tank\n\u003E - Universal Storage LF10 Fuel Tank\n\u003E - Universal Storage M30 Monopropellant Tank\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nUnfortunately, VAB engineers in protest at the preference being shown to the astronaut complex upgrades, threw the craft for the powered landing test off the launchpad. The seasonal interns responsible for the launchpad were forced to remove it and spend a day and a half buffing all the scratches off before it could be retested. Even more unfortunately, it was discovered upon the second launch attempt that the engineer responsible for the design had failed to carry several zeros and then gone on a month-long vacation, and that the original design had a TWR of only 0.61. This lander was not going to get off the launchpad today. Not one to refuse making lemon pie out of lemons (or whatever the ridiculous Murikan saying was), the program director ordered the craft to scrape some RSOUs off the launchpad with its onboard science experiments so that the mission would have at least one element that wasn\u0027t an utter embarrassment.^1^\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E -

Test Pilot Valentina Kerman\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAlthough Val started out following the usual ascent profile, she was quickly forced to rely on manual steering rather than natural gravity due to the craft\u0027s tendency to \u0022nose up\u0022 for unknown reasons. Despite this minor inconvenience (which Val complained about for the entire ascent), the launch did not encounter any legitimate problems. At MET 03:50, Val executed the SnubOtron contracted parts test while flying towards the upper atmosphere. Booster separation occurred at MET 04:40, and primary engine burnout at MET 04:32.\n\n***Lancer III*** entered space shortly thereafter, and at MET 05:10, Valentina Kerman stepped out of her cockpit and into history as the first kerbal to walk in space! Or rather, float aimlessly in space. Fortunately, the new EVA-capable suits had been equipped with very small monopropellant thrusters, and Val was able to return to the cockpit without any trouble, which finally shut her up about the steering issue.\n\nHaving been somewhat overpowered for its mission, ***Lancer III*** reached an apokee of 233.7km at MET 10:52. Val separated from the lifter at MET 11:25 and prepared for descent, reentering the atmosphere at MET 16:52. Descent through the atmosphere presented no problems, and landing was normal.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Timeline**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Launch Time: UT Y1-D100-H6-M0\n\u003E     -

At the behest of the resort\u0027s finance manager, the program director issued a standing \u0022suggestion\u0022 that future missions please try to aim for landing closer to KSC, as distant landings were making the recovery team depressed and causing them to demand excessive amounts of overtime pay and subsequent paid leave.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I tried to fit the Powered Landing Test in with the \u0022minor mission\u0022 format, but this resulted in me not paying much attention to the engineering report. Didn\u0027t notice that the craft had a TWR\u003C1 until the second launch attempt. Whoops.\n\u003E 2. Okay, so. SETI-Contracts replaces the early stock contracts with different early contracts that are more interesting than \u0022Go X fast!\u0022 One of them amounts to \u0022In preparation for a munar landing, do a test powered landing on Kerbin.\u0022 The intention of the contract is \u0022Get up to 500m, then land without parachutes or aero parts.\u0022 As I inadvertantly discovered while parachuting down to the ocean, however, the way the contract is written, it only bans ***stock*** parachutes. Since I\u0027m using RealChutes, I still met all the criteria and accidentally completed the contract. Whoops.  \n\u003E The good news is that that\u0027s already on Yemo\u0027s radar and is on track to get fixed soon. The other good news (as far as this mission report is concerned) is that I\u0027m still going to perform the Powered Landing contract in spirit as soon as I have the means to, since 1) I think it\u0027s a great \u0022shows the growth of a space program\u0022 short contract and 2) Getting the rewards without doing the work feels cheap, so I\u0027m going to do the work anyway.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"GehringGame","CreatedById":145675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T15:48:10Z","Content":"I\u0027m enjoying this so far!

In order to pull together enough RSOUs to begin pursuing this objective, more of the field research team\u0027s extremely popular bake sales were demanded.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Results**^1^  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A79.00\n\u003E     - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A18,399 (98.01%)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Contracts Completed**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Perform experiments around KSC  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A113,535 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A62\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Science Collected**\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Telemetry Report from SPH \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.18\n\u003E - Telemetry Report from R\u0026D \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.18\n\u003E - Materials Study from Tracking Station \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A74.32\n\u003E - Materials Study from Astronaut Complex \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A74.32\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Crew Decorations Awarded**\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Bob Kerman  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Multiple Missions \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC For participating in five missions.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThis finally provided the R\u0026D cabal with enough RSOUs to begin researching **Early Command Pods**, the last major step before manned orbital flight.

The proposed solution was to develop a new model powered by jet turbines. However, the only jet engines available to the agency were too weak to be individually useful, much like the interns. Also like the interns, they could be useful in larger groups provided they were all tied together properly (not a figure of speech\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACyou should see the interns at work), and the new adapters would allow designs to make use of \u0022engine clusters\u0022 as compensation for their individual weakness.\n\nAnother incentive to developing a longer-ranged atmospheric flight option was KSSLTA\u0027s old business partner, Anomaly Surveyor Group. After the success with reconnoitering the island airfield, ASG had been attempting to get the agency to investigate reports of ancient kerbal-made pyramids in the great Kerbara Desert, far to the west. The P-1A Papillon would never have been able to make such a long flight, so the agency had been unable to accommodate ASG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACbut it was hoped that a newly designed jet would not only be able to satisfy the contract, but also fill in some of the rather large scientific data gaps KSSLTA had with regards to the desert regions.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Construction**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Mk1 Inline Cockpit\n\u003E     - Circular Intake\n\u003E     - Telus Mobility Enhancer\n\u003E     - Universal Storage Quadcore\n\u003E     - Universal Storage Magnetometer Bay\n\u003E     - Universal Storage SC-9001 Science Jr. Bay\n\u003E     - Universal Storage Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Bay\n\u003E     - Universal Storage Science Bay\n\u003E     - 2HOT Thermometer\n\u003E     - PresMat Barometer\n\u003E     - Double-C Seismic Accelerometer\n\u003E     - (3x) Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage\n\u003E     - (2x) Swept Wings, 140% Scale\n\u003E     - (2x) Elevon 2\n\u003E     - Small Delta Wing\n\u003E     - Elevon 1\n\u003E     - (2x) AV-R8 Winglet\n\u003E     - SM-3 Stack Triple Adapter\n\u003E     - (3x) LFI Basic Jet Engine, Small\n\u003E     - (3x) LY-10 Small Landing Gear\n\u003E     - RealChute Radial Chute (Kevlar, Triple, Main)^2^\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Total on the Runway  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - Length: 9.4m\n\u003E         - Width: 12.4m\n\u003E         - Weight: 10,878kg (6,000kg Liquid Fuel)\n\u003E         - Delta-V (Surface): 75,500m/s\n\u003E         - Flight Time at 100% Throttle: 2 hours, 23 minutes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E         \n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Time: 13d, 3h, 26m (131,918.42 BP at 0.45 BP/s)\n\u003E \n\u003E          [\\*]Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A124,685\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Results**^1^  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A72.88\n\u003E     - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A17,811 (98.00%)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Contracts Completed**\n\u003E \n\u003E      \n\u003E \n\u003E     - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Perform experiments around KSC  \n\u003E \n\u003E         - \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A113,018 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u2020\u00C2\u00A62\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Science Collected**\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Magnetometer Scan from VAB \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.90\n\u003E - Magnetometer Scan from SPH \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.90\n\u003E - Temperature Scan from Mission Control \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.54\n\u003E - Temperature Scan from R\u0026D \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A70.54\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  [\\*]**Crew Decorations Awarded**\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Bob Kerman  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - None.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - HGR 5PUD-N1k \u0022Spud\u0022 Command Pod\n\u003E - Kerlington Mk1 Command Pod\n\u003E - Heat Shield (1.25m)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAt last, the Kerpublican Space, Science, and Luxury Travel Agency had the components it needed to truly begin branching out into the space travel and tourism field, with crew capsules capable (at least theoretically) of extended space flight, not these nancy suborbital softballs.

Valentina, already miffed at being left out of the first crewed orbital flight, nearly resigned in a huff at her long-distance surveillance mission being put on the back burner and was ready to walk out of the program altogether. Thankfully, Mission Controller Gene Kerman talked her down with prolific use of snacks and an assurance that she would take off as soon as Jeb was back on the ground.\n\nLaunch occurred at UT Y1-123-H2-M40 in the evening. \n\nJebediah executed the usual vertical lift to 100m/s before beginning his turn to the east. For unknown reasons, significant bearing correction was required in order to avoid traveling at a 75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA heading instead of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (speculation in Mission Control was that Jeb had unstrapped himself and gotten his suit stuck on the controls). Nevertheless, the crafted ended up at between 87-89\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, which was deemed acceptable\n\nBooster separation at MET 00:00:40 was uneventful. Unlike the ***Lancer III***, this new design had no trouble with a natural gravity turn and minimal SAS was necessary until around 30km, at which point Jeb took over to steer the ship down from 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA ascent towards the horizon. Lifter burnout occurred at MET 00:02:22, but separation was not made until leaving the atmosphere at MET 00:03:43, by which point ***Lancer IV*** was on course for an apokee of just over 169km. After separation, the ship continued along its path and Mission Control relayed a maneuver plan for achieving orbit.\n\nMission Controller Gene Kerman took this opportunity to explicitly prohibit Jeb from going on EVA until *after* the orbital burn was completed in order to ensure all went according to plan. Test Pilot Jebediah Kerman took this opportunity to disregard Mission Control, going on EVA approximately four and a half minutes before the orbital maneuver node in order to collect data from the craft\u0027s orbital telescope and/or to par-tay.\n\nWhatever Jeb\u0027s reasons, he was back in the command capsule with three and a half minutes to go before the maneuver, and Gene Kerman was eventually revived with some smelling salts and a cold cloth.\n\nThe orbital burn began at MET 00:11:35, with Jeb firing the LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 at 50% throttle for about 22 seconds, a maneuver of just under 170m/s, resulting in a beautiful orbit of 169.3km by 170.7km. Jeb\u0027s task was not complete, however, as the next maneuver was planned to push the craft into \u0022high orbit\u0022. Jeb was instructed to complete one (and only one!) full orbit, then burn at the periapsis to raise his apoapsis up to 300km, requiring only 81m/s. As there was a delay of half an hour before the maneuver was scheduled, Jeb continued drafting crew reports and collecting orbital telescope survey data as the ***Lancer IV*** rushed around Kerbin.\n\nThe orbital raise burn was executed at MET 00:45:25, and Jeb entered \u0022high space\u0022 at MET 00:57:01, promptly fulfilling the requirements of the agency\u0027s orbital survey contract and performing other important data collection. Once all the work was done, Jeb made a final EVA to collect the remaining data, stowed all vulnerable instruments, and awaited Mission Control\u0027s instructions for atmospheric reentry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACa burn of about 96m/s that would result in an estimated landing in the ocean northeast of the KSSLTA resort campus.\n\nAtmospheric reentry occurred at MET 01:21:53, at which point the command stage separated from the orbital stage to descend on its own\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AChowever, the force of this separation caused a disparity in the landing projection, as ***Lancer IV*** was now expected to land in the hills on the western side of the Kerfrican continent. The new heat shield, while suffering virtually no heating effects, did an excellent job of keeping the module properly oriented throughout descent without the need for manual control. The capsule eventually landed in the highlands west of the Kerpyrenees, but due to landing on the side of a hill, rolled most of the way to the bottom before finally coming to a rest. Recovery was made at MET 01:33:00. Cleaning the interior of Jeb\u0027s snacks, which returned with a vengeance during the roll, is ongoing.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - **Mission Timeline**  \n\u003E \n\u003E     - Launch Time: UT Y1-D123-H2-M40\n\u003E     - Mission Duration: 01:33:00\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Mission Results** \n\u003E \n\u003E     - **Science Recovered:** \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A775.70\n\u003E     - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A120,396 (55.96%)\n\u003E     - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Launch a kerbal into an orbit around Kerbin, and return him safely.\n\u003E     - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct an orbital survey of Kerbin.\n\u003E     - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Return crew and EVA report from high orbit above Kerbin.\n\u003E     - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Return Materials Bay observations from high orbit above Kerbin.\n\u003E     - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the craft and crew intact.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E      [\\*]**Contracts Completed** \n\u003E \n\u003E     - **Complete** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Manned Orbit and safe return!

All of the Big Four have had changes made in the facial department, and all four have been changed so that their \u0022flight suits\u0022 are orange. Since Val is due up shortly for a[n attempted] flight to the Pyramids and back, you should get to see her soon. I plan to give the Big Four orange EVA suits as well, as soon as I actually remember to do so.\n\u003E - The in-flight screenshots were a lot brighter when I took them\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACnot sure why they show up so dark now. My apologies, as they looked a lot better last night when I was F1-mashing.\n\u003E - I love science. Science is the best. The KSSLTA now has about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A7101 in the tank as a result of Jeb\u0027s outstanding orbital mission. I was going to use this line to lay out some of my options in terms of where next to invest that science, but like an idiot I closed the game before I got details from the tech tree. Since it takes about 10 minutes for me to load the game, and I need to leave right now for work, I\u0027ll have to make another post this evening about it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Ever since upgrading the launchpad, can I just say, holy geezum crow. What a pain in the butt it is to use the launchpad for Kerbin rover launches like the KSC Science Kart. The \u0022grill\u0022 in the center of the launchpad is impossible for the RoveMax S2 wheels to navigate, so you\u0027re stuck in it indefinitely (and will inevitably break a couple of wheels trying to get out). Then I tried starting the cart \u0022off-center\u0022 (like I accidentally did with the original test lander) and inadvertently dropped it into the central chasm between the launchpad and the crawlerway. Third time\u0027s a charm, though, and I finally got it off-set so it isn\u0027t in the grill \\*or\\* the inescapable canyon.   \n\u003E Then I drove into the canyon anyway. but the fourth time! Fourth time we got it right! Then I broke a wheel on a shallow incline. But the fifth time! Good lord. This is why flight reverting is allowed in this career.\n\u003E 2. I\u0027m not the most skilled pilot even under optimal conditions, and I\u0027ve never been to the Pyramids before and don\u0027t know what the landing situation there is. Between that, and the possibility that the J-3 Epee Light Surveyor Plane might *not* have enough fuel to get back to KSC after reaching the Pyramids, a strong parachute was added as a safety precaution. Better to recover a whole plane a long way from KSC than to recover none of a plane and a potentially dead pilot.\n\u003E 3. Unfortunately, no recovery chutes on this stage. I was right up on the 30-part limit, and while I could have ditched the TT18-A Launch Stabilizers, I didn\u0027t want for for aesthetic reasons.\n\u003E 4. This is the first-available 1.875m engine. I like it, but it has its pros and cons. It\u0027s fairly cheap at \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A11,425, fairly light at 2.0 tons, fairly efficient at both sea level and in a vacuum, and has 2.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA of gimbal along with a fairly short profile. However, it\u0027s also not a legitimate first-stage lifting engine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACits 320kN of sea-level thrust is just barely more than twice that of the LV-T30 Reliant... but for tanks of the same height, the 1.875m engine is going to be trying to lift about 3.4 times more weight. The result is an engine that *needs* booster support just to get going... but once it\u0027s rolling along, it can carry you for a while. Fortunately, the ***Lancer IV*** is a pretty light payload (Command Stage is just under 1,500kg) and isn\u0027t going very far (high space), so I can get away with light boosters on this launch. For future, heavier-duty launches, it\u0027ll be time to break out the fun stuff.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T00:58:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Landwalker**\n  \nTypo Correction"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:24:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cleaning the interior of Jeb\u0027s snacks, which returned with a vengeance during the roll, is ongoing.\n\nHehehehe\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ever since upgrading the launchpad, can I just say, holy geezum crow.

I usually build rovers in the SPH anyway.\n\nClaw\u0027s Stock Bug Fix Modules has a cure for the \u0022sticky grating\u0022 of the Level 2 launchpad. This also helps with launching rockets if you don\u0027t yet have/can\u0027t afford/don\u0027t like launch clamps.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not the most skilled pilot even under optimal conditions, and I\u0027ve never been to the Pyramids before and don\u0027t know what the landing situation there is.

I won\u0027t spoil the suspense about landing for you, though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nThe main problem with early career airplanes is the crappiness of the new, light landing gear. Those angled, fixed wheels are springy and lack brakes so even though I build STOL planes that can float in a 20m/s or so, they still bounce and have a hard time stopping (only the small, steerable wheels have brakes). I find it necessary to put extra small, steerable wheels under the wingtips to avoid damage there, but disable both their steering and brakes so as not to cause cartwheels when dragging wingtips.\n\nThe worst problem with the long, angled wheels, however, is the way they make the plane bounce into the air every time physics loads. I\u0027ve had this cause planes to flip over on their backs the 1st time I put them on the runway for a test flight. If you survive that, then be sure to complete the whole mission without ever changing focus away from the plane. Do not leave it, such as by getting to the Pyramids and quitting the game, then flying home next session. When you load up the plane again, it\u0027ll jump even worse on regular terrain than it did on the runway."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:41:12Z","Content":"What mod is it that changes the look of the stock parts so much?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T13:13:21Z","Content":"Nice, really like the look of your crafts--congratulations on the orbit!\n\nWhen screenshots come out too dark, you can always put them through your machine\u0027s basic native photo editor and turn up the brightness a bit.
