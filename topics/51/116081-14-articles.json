What I can give you is a rough idea of what will update soonest over the next few weeks.\n\n--First I\u0027ll ease everyone back into D,OB! with a brief interlude sequence. \n\n--Then probably we come back to E:O0 for an interlude/epilogue to Ch3 which will unfortunately raise more questions about Bob\u0027s and Tedus\u0027s fate than it answers.\n\n--Then back to D,OB! and fast forward to Hummlebee\u0027s (attempted) return to Kerbin. This will finish that book.\n\n--And finally the Kerbfleet saga continues in E:O0 (likely including some events that occurred while Hummlebee was en route to Kerbin) where I promise the story which has had a Beginning and most of a Middle will have the rest of the Middle and an End. \n\nAnd that is all I am going to say about that. *J\u0027ai dit!*\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWell, it took longer than I thought it would--which one of you clowns voted for Gregmore? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI finally voted myself, for Tedus. My original intent in writing this was to make it all about Dilsby\u0027s struggles to command a doomed mission, but Tedus\u0027s banter with Bob got to be so much fun it gave him a larger role. In fact he grew on me so much it literally saved his life. (Yes, I was originally not even going to try to save him!) So Tedus gets my vote for exceeding the author\u0027s expectations and taking the story somewhere I wasn\u0027t originally going to go.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T17:24:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T18:17:01Z","Content":"Tedus bear FTW, and whoever voted for Gregmore is a hippie \u0022I voted for Gregmore before it was cool, and it will never be cool to vote for gregmore\u0022\n\nCONSPIRACY TIME!!!
