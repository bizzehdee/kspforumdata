If you are using RSS all the masses, fuel ratios and sizes need to be changed. Everything is modeled in 1:1 and then scaled to kerbal 64% and the masses are arbitrarily determined by what works best with the stock game. Also pioneer 0-2 is intentionally upside down so people wouldn\u0027t \u0022complain\u0022 that it was exploding their rockets because the antennas at the bottom were colliding with the fairings/decouplers. When you make something for the stock game you need to \u0022idiot proof\u0022 it. From what I heard though Nathankell is planning on doing realism overhaul configs for RSS use sometime in the future.\u003Cp\u003EIf you want the sizes to be scaled \u0022realistically\u0022 change the 0.80 in the scaling to 1.25. If the scaling is not 0.80 it means the model was contributed by someone else. For the weights I usually take the dry mass and reduce it to 64% of it\u0027s original mass. For really small probes though I often make up a mass as really tiny mass values have unintended consequences in regards to SAS/reaction wheels (although a lot of probes didn\u0027t have these this is a game and without them you can\u0027t position the probes for screenshots/respin them after timewarping etc...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, I showed in my latest video (Alex 3 linked above) how I do it. You might find it interesting. That\u0027s how most of my time is spent when making an Alex video. I empirically measure everything by hand in the game, and set the mass values by hand from wiki info, astronautix, braeunig, etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s cool learning why it was upside down.

This fixes the long standing MAJOR fps issues caused by the stock animation module on all parts that have them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
