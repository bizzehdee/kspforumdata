First, there was the giant Arch to avoid. Then, just to the west are two very tall crater rims, preventing launching upwards and turning directly to the horizon. The Arch was avoided by leaning to the south. The first crater rim was missed by a scant dozen meters, and the second by only a couple hundred. The Grand Arch might be an attractive site for a base, but the retrograde ascent left much to be desired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141209_ksp0436_hawk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141209_ksp0436_hawk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rendezvous occurred just at the edge of sunset, and Anny was glad the engineers on Kerbin decided to include a spotlight on the lander.

Still have to get them safely back to Kerbin. And then it\u0027s right back to the hustle. Hawk 2 should be ready in a little under two M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths time.\u0022 That would give them ideal lighting at the next set of coordinates. As ideal as could be asked so close to the south pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022About that. Gene, I was talking with Von Kerman here about our plans. This Hawk rocket is mighty impressive. Looks like it could lift a whole mountain out of a pile of gunk without breaking a sweat. Perfect for the Duna mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene glanced back and forth quickly between Wernher and the Senator. \u0022What Duna mission?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The one Wernher has all cooked up. Seeing as we\u0027ve been to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn now, and seeing how these rebels are taking aim at the Red Planet, we thought it best to accelerate the Osprey program. Get it ready to go so it\u0027s ready when we go.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher nodded, then pushed his glasses back up. \u0022We think we\u0027ve devised a configuration that will allow the Osprey to be launched by three Hawks. We can assemble all the pieces at the Falconaerie, which will itself be launched atop a fourth Hawk. Planning to build four more of these somewhat ironically makes them all less expensive....\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene interrupted. \u0022Why would we divert a Hawk we have ready for the next M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landing for some ship that isn\u0027t under construction yet?\u0022 Gene pointed at Wernher \u0022And what\u0027s this talk of the Falconaerie? I haven\u0027t even approved that yet!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve already started training the crews for the Falconaerie.

All I can say is, if you set to work on this Osprey first, and put the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn nonsense aside until next year sometime, then we\u0027ll gladly cover the costs.

A society of heroes that flew no flags but its own, honored no kings, and was tasked with the unimpeded exploration of our planet.

There was only a single entry point for the Hydra, the primary crew access hatch. From there one had to climb into their cabin and into their seat. Nothing too difficult for an acrobatic species such as the kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepgee stowed his bag in the beside-head compartment, sat down into his chair and strapped in for the ascent. There were only twelve of them going up, less than a third of the Hydra\u0027s capacity, so each of them had their own row and window seat. Shepgee glanced back to find Loald asleep. He couldn\u0027t blame him, having to wake up at Oh-dark-thirty just to prepare for the launch. \u0022The ship sets the time,\u0022 Milzer had said, \u0022not us.

The Hydra was designed for regular passenger transport to space, and Jebediah and his crews had built in a slick suspension system to lessen the shock of liftoff. Even the roar of the mighty Alnair Launch Vehicle was deadened by insulation. Really a top-notch craft, this Hydra.

Loald had managed to sleep through the entire ascent, awaking only when the Hydra fired its thrusters to match speeds with the Munlit Silence. So far the trip had been automated, but this last step would require the hands of a kerbal: docking. Shepgee made his way down from his seat to the crew compartment, glancing out of the window to catch a view of the Munlit Silence. Somehow it seemed smaller than the Hydra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141129_ksp0245_hydra.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141129_ksp0245_hydra.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe strapped into the pilot\u0027s seat and brought the RCS system online. Lots of shiny doodads and slick flat screens lit up, each with a different camera view. Shepgee would have preferred a window and a targeting sight to all this technowizardry, but figured Jeb knew best when it came to advanced controls. This was a considerable step up from Jeb\u0027s usual quality, such a series of old ropes tied to a pulley at the bottom of the capsule that usually opened the parachute but occasionally only opened the hatch. Shepgee oriented the Hydra to align with a docking port on one of the Munlit Silence\u0027s arms. Nothing to do now but wait until the Hydra had drifted into position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141129_ksp0247_hydra.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141129_ksp0247_hydra.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hydra had been designed to dock directly with a specially-aligned set of three docking ports. Such an arrangement would allow the shuttle\u0027s 24 passengers to disembark much faster. No such triple-docking ring existed on the Munlit Silence, so Shepgee chose one of the three ports at random to control from. He fired up the incredibly bright spotlights, cancelled his lateral motion, and pushed the Hydra forward with a quick jet of RCS. A soft welcoming chime sounded to indicate his distance from the target. He couldn\u0027t help but think he was flying technology hundreds of years more advanced than the simple lander he had used to touch down on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141129_ksp0256_hydra.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141129_ksp0256_hydra.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA soft bump and they were docked up with the Munlit Silence: Their home for the next six years.

He had the good fortune of sharing his with Haloly and Neilny, which didn\u0027t present many opportunities for peace and quiet on the long trip. He settled into his chair, pulled the new Agent Kirrim novel from his bag, and wondered how Blofeld Kerman and his minions would try to destroy Kerbin this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETowed-Antenna Array Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYear 77 day 1 - Lake Fortunate\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003ERebel \u002218th\u0022\u003C/span\u003E Space Agency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I was done with the launches for the Munlit Silence, then I started thinking about the mechanics of a space vessel that is always rotating. The intent for ships like the Silence is to rotate the entire vessel about the Z-axis, creating a scant amount of centrifugal \u0022artificial gravity\u0022. This reduces complexity by not needing to keep the rotational part attached to the static part of the ship through the use of a collar or bearings, and removes the obvious issue of getting between the two parts. It also reduces physical stress on the entire body. The one downside comes from things that need to stay pointed in a specific direction, such as antennas or solar arrays. I resolved the power issue by using only OX-STAT panels or a small amount of RTGs, but I needed another solution for the communications issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubmarines and other seafaring vessels make use of something called a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towed_array_sonar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETowed Sonar Array\u003C/a\u003E.

An integrated RTG allows for operation anywhere, though with its low power it prevents continuous high-bandwidth communications.

Haloly handed his notepad to Shepgee. \u0022We\u0027ve even got enough delta-V to complete a capture at Jool, possibly Laythe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Enough to make it home afterwards?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Assuming we leave the landers and the rest of the science package in the Jool System, yes.

Up suddenly became down. He dropped into the starboard common room, finding four kerbals trying to stand in the weird rotation. Neilny seemed to be having a particular amount of fun, bounding about like a superkerb. Shepgee smiled, climbed back up into the connecting tube, and went into his cabin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141221_ksp_munlit.gif\u0022 alt=\u002220141221_ksp_munlit.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe spent some time there, watching Kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn slink away in the spinning darkness. He thought how simple and serene Kerbin looked as it twisted away. None of the wars or squabbles or fights were apparent from up here. He thought of something Lem had told him once. How kerbals were not naturally violent, and had instead brought violence back with them from the heavens as a form of penance for their sin of leaving Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet of all Shepgee had seen in space, none of it had been violent. Silence, beauty, harmony, and the simple yet cold laws of physics were available in abundance. Space was peaceful to him, the emptiness of the void a reminder that even nothingness can be beautiful. If the violence found in the hearts of kerbals was something they brought from space, Shepgee had seen nothing of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet There was a certain loneliness to the sight of Kerbin slinking away. Every kerbal he had ever known was down there, on that small dot receding into the inky black darkness. All except the twelve of them, bound for the distant reaches of Jool. If something went wrong, there was nothing any of the several billion kerbals below could do to help. If there was some violent entity out amongst the dust and the void, they would have to face it alone. They were at the mercy of physics and its cold, harsh judgments now, slipping silently through the nothingness that filled everything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was glad to be among friends. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141214_ksp0653_munlit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141214_ksp0653_munlit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EEnd Kerbal Space Program \u0022Alpha\u0022 0.25\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T22:19:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T00:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBonus photo: An old-school \u0022All Helmets\u0022 meeting from when I was setting up the flag planting scene on an install without Texture Replacer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141213_ksp0506_allhelmets.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141213_ksp0506_allhelmets.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T22:19:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T02:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you officially been able to get your save file working with .90 yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T03:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RobotsAndSpaceships\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RobotsAndSpaceships\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you officially been able to get your save file working with .90 yet?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis save?

The transition to Beta hasn\u0027t been without small headaches, but all in all has gone well. The biggest problem I ran into was with KSCSwitcher in RSS, which now has a work-around that almost works... only crashes occasionally. (The code that repaints the terrain has a pretty big memory leak that I\u0027ve not tried to track down.) As a result the first batch of things I did in the new release were all from the traditional Kerbal Space Center, and thus part of the 19th KSA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the dual saves: I\u0027ve merged both persistence files together, adding up Funds and Science and copying all the ships from the 19th to the main save. Both had unlocked most of the same tech nodes (and mostly everything up to the top tiers), and I\u0027m at the point where every craft I launch will need to be copied over. So I decided to just save myself the headache and play from the same save again. This means contracts and funds are now shared, as well as tech tree unlocks, but oh well. I\u0027m assuming from here on out the two programs have the same tech-level, though parts restrictions are still in place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve lost a few satellites to failed / nerfed reaction wheels, one of them being the Towed Antenna Array for the Munlit Silence. I also decided to leave the fuel lines broken, and those two issues will be resolved in-story. Costs of using overly-advanced tech, if you will. Nothing can be done about the Silence now anyway, and upgrades for will have to wait until it\u0027s back home... in six years. It\u0027s a bit like using DangIt!, just with the stock game causing things to break instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew assignments weren\u0027t too far off from what I had guessed or had written them into, so I\u0027m going to leave everyone where they are. Pretty much what you\u0027d expect from random chance. Some statistics: Of the 29 crew members of the 18th (old) program, 12 saw a change in employment, most of those being raw recruits that were unassigned anyway. Notables were Milzer and Neilny, who are both now scientists. (At least Shepgee and Haloly stayed the same.) Meanwhile, of the 10 crew members of the 19th (new) program, 8 saw a change. Notably: Anny is now a BadS scientist and no longer a BadS pilot, Herhat is no longer a very timid Ing-gah-neer and has become a very timid Pilot (irony). Dudry has become an Engineer. Other changes are noted above in the second post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve reinstalled a bunch of mods I was using in the past: DMagic Science, SCANsat, a few other smaller ones; basically everything except the mods that require Module Manager.

I had used the SpaceY heavy launcher parts for the Kraken\u0027s Harvest, and I had considered using parts of it for the next mission, so I had left the mod installed. Except then a new \u0022Mostly Stock\u0022 fervor caught hold of me, and I decided to start cutting out as many mods as possible. The Kraken\u0027s Harvest was in orbit, and I don\u0027t really see myself launching another craft like that soon, so SpaceY was one of the mods I deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I went back to work for three days, went through the gunfire, fireworks and revelry of New Year\u0027s Eve, and didn\u0027t come back to KSP until 2015. So on a groggy New Year\u0027s afternoon as I crawled out of whatever counted as a bed the previous night, I fired up KSP and discovered the save was borked. It would load, but then it would NRE itself to death and the UI would lock up. First thought was that I\u0027d screwed up the crew histories, as I\u0027d spent some time on the Saturday after Christmas rebuilding the experience sheets of my crews from my records. So I spent some time digging through previous versions of the save on Dropbox to find one from before I started that change. No improvement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started cutting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo hours later I found the culprit. In the 2 weeks or so that I had SpaceY installed, a contract had spawned using SpaceY as the agent. Now, I\u0027m not honestly sure if NecroBones added the agents config or if I did, as I went on an agent-adding spree once I learned you could filter parts by Manufacturer in the VAB. That\u0027s not the issue though - this contract, added by the system, ignored by me, no longer had an entity assigned to it. That caused KSP to freak out, and in such a way that it wouldn\u0027t even properly log why it was freaking out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a problem. I can live without the parts filtering, especially since I can assign custom filters, so I\u0027m now flat out deleting any agents configs I find in the mods I install. I also scrubbed the save file of any other offending agents. I often remove parts mods when I\u0027m not using them - that\u0027s the primary reason I hold to my 100% stock rule for permanent ships - so having the save die from a missing Agent is... annoying, to say the least. Oddly this doesn\u0027t seem to affect the contracts the DMagic plugin adds. I\u0027m now wondering if this is a Squad or a FinePrint bug, and how long it\u0027s been around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn related news, I took this opportunity to swap out the Tantares/ALV fuel tank on the Munlit Silence for a Rockomax BigOrangeTank using a text editor (vim). Beale was in the middle of reworking those ALV parts, and it violates my own 100% stock rule for permanent ships anyway. Plus, it might be several IRL Months before I get back to the Silence or before it returns to Kerbin, and I wouldn\u0027t want to keep using an old version of Tantares for that long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow back to our regularly irregular launches....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProject ORTHO - Eagle-1 Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYear 77 day 71 - Cape Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003E19th\u003C/span\u003E Kerbal Space Agency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Vehicle: S/EFT-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiter: ORTHO-1 \u0022Wanderer\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeight: 37.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff Mass: 509.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 282,679\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know Gene, there is some irony in the fact that we built the Falconaerie to host Falcons, and yet today we send an Eagle.

It\u0027s be a shame to fly all the way out to Duna only to find they don\u0027t do something right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150103_ksp0288_arch5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150103_ksp0288_arch5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not as complete, capable, nor as Apollo-like as the first 4 Archimedes launches, but it\u0027s going to The M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn so it gets to bear the name. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150103_ksp0300_arch5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150103_ksp0300_arch5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall, cheap, and agile, the Dusters make for a good general purpose lander. Not quite the \u0022Toyota Corolla\u0022 of KSP as they seat 2, so perhaps these are instead the Camrys. The landing site for this mission wasn\u0027t anything specific, just a simple \u0022choose a spot and land.\u0022 With that kind of flexibility they didn\u0027t even bother with their inclination, and put the Archimedes into a highly inclined M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150103_ksp0317_arch5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150103_ksp0317_arch5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transstage was used to complete the deorbit burn and was jettisoned a short distance above the regolith.

Gersted was in a bit more of a hurry than Billy-Bobford, and even planted the flag before they were both out of the lander. Billy-Bobford wasn\u0027t too bothered though, and kept grinning through the whole thing. I can only imagine his internal monologue going something like: \u0022Heya, slow down bucko! What\u0027s the rush?\u0022 But in space, no one can hear you complain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150103_ksp0335_arch5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150103_ksp0335_arch5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were still a few outstanding contracts for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, such as plant a flag, so this mission managed to net a little bit of cash to work with, too. Score! Here\u0027s the crew photo for the mission, Gersted on the left and Billy-Bobford on the right. Or is it the other way around?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150103_ksp0337_arch5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150103_ksp0337_arch5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course they made their way over to the debris of the transstage to take a look. This thing was remarkably well preserved for the distance it fell. The slight tumble caused by the decoupling meant the stage landed on the decoupler itself, which seems to have absorbed most of the impact.
