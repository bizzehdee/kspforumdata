I thought I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d start a thread documenting my first interplanetary trip in KSP, not to mention give me a place to ask for advice along the way from the more seasoned KSP veterans out there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, my industrious little Kerbals just built their first space station and have already landed on Mun and Minmus. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to head out there and see what other worlds we can make it to. I was planning on going to Duna first, but the first planetary alignment is actually with Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a few modifications to my planned multipart craft, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see if I can send it that far out. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll modify the planned Duna surface base as a floating habitat. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll also ferry more fuel to the space station, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m hoping that otherwise my intended spacecraft design might be robust enough to accomplish this. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t plan on using any mods with the exception of MechJeb for the launches. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m only using that to get my ship assembled in orbit fast, since the Jool transfer window is in about 26 days and I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to miss it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a stylized representation of my intended mission arrangement (I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve only built the ascent stage so far):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2PvBeV8.png\u0022 alt=\u00222PvBeV8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll launch in three main parts- ICS, then OOMPA/KRASH, then the LLAMA/heat shield. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be assembled at the Kerbal International Space Station and Bar and Grill. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll launch and dock extra fuel tanks afterwards as my delta V calculations require. More on that later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ICS will drive the whole shebang to Jool with seven Kerbonauts onboard the KRASH, and enter orbit with an aerobrake. Once in a stable Jool orbit, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll launch as many probes as orbits allow- likely 2 per moon, maybe saving one for Jool itself. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll try to get at least one of each pair on a nice polar orbit to map the surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a favorable alignment presents itself, the craft will maneuver to Laythe, aerobraking as necessary. At that point six intrepid explorers will transfer to the LLAMA and undock. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll burn for reentry, aiming for somewhere in sight of land, but in the water itself. After max heating, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll ditch the heat shield and guide in the landing on minimal thrusters. Parachutes in the LAS (LLAMA upper stage) will assist as necessary. The goal will be to stay above 50% fuel, so I can launch back out with a full tank (leave one on the surface later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll explore the surface, go for a swim, repack parachutes, and generally give high fives all around. Next, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll draw straws to see which four saps are the ones to stay behind in the Laythe Ocean Base and Buffet. The other two will climb into the LAS, undock, and return to orbit to join up with the main spacecraft in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, the ICS, KRASH, and LAS will return. Depending on how short they are on maneuvering and transfer fuel and if they can handle the mass, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep the LAS attached as long as possible. If I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m lucky, I may be able to return all those parts to the space station, significantly reducing the number of launches needed for the next interplanetary mission. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll make the call then, and land whatever part makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the design, you may wonder why I have the KRASH module at all, since it never undocks from the ICS. I could just take six Kerbals and have them in the LLAMA the whole time instead. The thought behind it is that it isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t much additional mass compared to the fuel and lander, but it gives me an extra maneuver piece to react to any orbital rescue missions that might arise where it would be a pain to use the whole ship for- such as if the LAS reaches orbit, but runs out of fuel before it can complete rendezvous. Alternatively, the KRASH gives me a low mass return option if I run the ICS out of fuel on the way back- engines on the OOMPA may be able to help them return to Kerbin in an emergency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step will be calculating the Delta V required for each phase. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll give it a shot first, then throw it up here to see if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m on the right track.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T17:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, well that was fast.

The ascent stage is not intended to be a reentry vehicle, and is therefore not equipped with parachutes, but they must have really wanted to give it a shot.
