KAIJU has, thus far, met with some measure of success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAIJU\u0027s first goal was to establish a permanent presence in LKO. The result is Space Station Gojira:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5069296/KSP%20Photos/Space%20Station%20Gojira.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Space%20Station%20Gojira.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo Kerbin Return Capsules can be seen docked to small ports amid the East Docking Arm, while Orbital Tug Gojira-1 is docked to a large port at the end of the arm. Currently, seven Kerbals call Gojira home. With the two fully loaded Fuel Arms, Space Station Gojira will also serve as a refuelling station for interplanetary voyages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAIJU\u0027s attention then turned to the Mun. A successful landing resulted in the establishment of Gamera Base:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5069296/KSP%20Photos/Gamera%20Base.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gamera%20Base.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMundo Kerman poses proudly by the KAIJU flag. The two Kethane Extraction and Conversion modules of Gamera Base can clearly be seen in the photo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo facilitate trips to and from the Munar surface, Space Station Rodan was constructed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5069296/KSP%20Photos/Space%20Station%20Rodan.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Space%20Station%20Rodan.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree vessels are docked to the station. Planetary Vessel Destroyah, designed to transport Kerbals from Kerbin orbit to Munar orbit; and Planetary Lander Biollante, designed to take up to five Kerbals from the Munar surface to Munar orbit, are both docked to the Habitation Tower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutotanker Gorosaurus, capable of mining Kethane and converting it to fuel, is docked to the East Fuel Arm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAIJU scientists then turned their gaze to other planets, and a dangerous but ultimately successful voyage was dispatched to Jool.

Interplanetary Vessel King Gidorah, with its cargo of four Minya-type MapSats, orbits Kerbin in preparation for its journey to Kerbin\u0027s nearest planetary neighbor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5069296/KSP%20Photos/King%20gidorah.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022King%20gidorah.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
