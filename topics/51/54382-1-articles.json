Kerbal Engineer displayed 12,299m/s in vacuum but I did switch 3 aerospikes for the small Rockomax 48-7s. You have to attach the lander to the rest of the ship somehow... I probably wasted a bit with a suboptimal gravity turn, too. But every Kerman has 600m/s on his back which makes for a great Plan B if things go south - or down... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I deemed having a Kerbalnaut in the command seat during descend as too dangerous I send Shepsey down in a small spaceplane. I brought a spare to test the plane in Eve\u0027s atmo first but forgot to put a probe core on it - doh! Still, it worked well enough although I had hoped for more lift in Eve\u0027s atmo but you really feel the 1.7g. Instead of landing the plane and risking a crash I used a capsule with parachute and decoupled it over the ascend vehicle. The area turned out to be flat enough but you don\u0027t know that before you land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShepsey almost didn\u0027t make it. I waited too long to leave the ascend vehicle and was already entering atmo again before I had a clean orbit. Thankfully persistent holding of Shift\u002BW saved the day. When I picked Shepsey up with the return vehicle he was down to under 10% EVA fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is really an exciting place and I will be back but not anytime soon. And next time I\u0027ll bring 500m/s more! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-26T04:48:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2013 04:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Col_Jessep\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T03:18:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.

Poor, young Shepsey was supposed to drive to the ascend vehicle.
