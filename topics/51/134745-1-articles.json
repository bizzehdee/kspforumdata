It helps me to fairly compare the mass requirements among different designs, I\u0027m using a standardized MK I pod for the re-entry so all missions are designed around that. So far here are my lightest weights at launch:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLunar direct (entire vessel lands on Moon ) : 395 tons, 31 tons in LEO\u003Cbr\u003E\nLOR (separate lander and Earth return vehicle) : 295 tons, 24 tons in LEO\u003Cbr\u003E\nLOR, open lander (see below)\u00A0\u00A0 : 215 tons, 17.5 tons in LEO\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor comparison the Apollo -Saturn 5 was about 2900 tons at launch, and the Soviet N-1 about 2750.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBelow are the highlights of the 215-ton mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NEjKI/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might think that the open one-seat lander is insanely dangerous. You\u0027d be right. That didn\u0027t stop it from being actually considered though. Heck, mine is heavier than the\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmlhtest.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E Langley Lightest\u003C/a\u003E design, though that was to use H2/O2 and I don\u0027t know how they planned to deal with boiloff with those little tanks. Didn\u0027t they play KSP in 1961?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0I use all RO dependencies and all the difficulty recommendations except Remote Tech and saturatable reaction wheels, but I don\u0027t use reaction wheels anymore. I only use the RO configs for all parts with two exceptions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Lunar returns inevitably explode when hitting Earths atmosphere from the heat getting around the heat shield and destroying the occluded pod and its parts. I therefore turn off heat damage with the F12 menu. To play it fair I make the heat shield weigh 15% of the total weight it is decelerating, just like the Apollo heat shield did. As long as deceleration stays below 10 G\u0027s I call it a successful re-entry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) The solar panels got nerfed a couple of versions ago, my favorite panel went from level 3 energy per m^2 to level 2. I buffed it back to level 3.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe great thing about my lightest missions is that the mass to LEO is less than 24 tons, so these missions could be put on existing rocket designs. I\u0027m going to grab Necrobones\u0027 superb Real Space Boosters and try that next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 That little lander is a blast to fly. It amuses me that the ascent stage looks like some ultra-light Munar landers in stock KSP, but the basic design would work in the real world too. Six words I like to say in KSP: \u0022It works in NASA\u0027s space program\u0022. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Sorry Mr. Munroe)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-22T19:28:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2016 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PLAD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T20:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot just a really interesting and difficult mission, but a very insightful study of engineering puts and takes as well. \u00A0Now\u003Cem\u003E that\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E rocket science.

Its c.g. had to be within 30mm of the thrust axis or it wouldn\u0027t be stable...and the astronaut had to spacewalk to and from it to the Earth Return Stage. And they actually made three Earth-orbit test flights of it. At least the lander docked to the ERS before the spacewalk, with the small open lander designs you would have to jump across open space to get back to the ERS.\u00A0 Both sides came up with some even more extreme designs in the early \u002760s, before the Outer Space Treaty was signed and they no longer had to worry that the first nation to put a man on the Moon would claim the Moon as theirs.
