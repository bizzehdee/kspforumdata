I planned this with the intent that it would probably take two missions (not enough battery power to loiter around Kerbin orbit for days at a time to line up transfers) but designed it with the ability for it to be done in one mission if the opportunity presented itself. So there is enough battery power to reach Minmus (Just over 2 days) plus enough power to transmit twice (6000em per reading!!!). The probe it mounted on the old reliable Quebec launcher. I\u0027m still not 100% behind the second stage of the bigger Uniform launcher, while those Keel Haul engines are ok they are clearly a work in progress like the T15 was. While I might create a different heavy launcher soon (I did the numbers for a manned Minmus with my current tech, came up with 75 tons and that doesn\u0027t include a booster to perform the injection to Minmus) the Quebec launcher still works well for probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QmOV77m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QmOV77m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stop is the Mun. I keep trying to make adjustments to my course, both to try and keep the probe from being gravity assisted right out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and to see if I could pull it over to Minmus. During the approach I pulled the post-Mun inclination as compared to Minmus down to 4.5 degrees. Approaching the Mun I consider a course that would have flipped which side of the Mun the probe passed on, reversing the gravity assist but that didn\u0027t seem like it would provide the benefit I wanted. In low orbit a mapping scan was performed and 5 minutes where spent transmitting. During that time a new maneuver was devised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cGYpOtG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cGYpOtG.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7Ge0Zmy.png\u0022 alt=\u00227Ge0Zmy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to get intercepts with Minmus but with estimated arrival times that where too far in the future. All of those courses involved the probe going past the orbit of Minmus, slowing down and then coming back as Minmus was finally arriving. I eventually figured out the radicial course correction I needed to reach Minmus within the life of the batteries, a 1071 m/s burn as I came out of low Mun orbit that would make a direct intercept of Minmus that avoided the long \u0027turn around\u0027 at the AP of an orbit. You can see just how big a change this was. This course change would let me reach Minmus in 1 day 19 hours. The battery figures put it very close but since I still had the upper booster with its 3 T30 engines I would be able to generate some power for part of the burn, hopefully enough to make up any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MFaJOti.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MFaJOti.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s9rJjEM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s9rJjEM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the burn the final numbers could be checked. The actual time of arrival was just 10 minutes short of 2 days (48 hours). With 13725em of charge left (the booster was now discarded so no further recharging could occur), minus the 6000 needed for transmissions, I could now calculate that I had 51.5 hours of power, enough to reach Minmus and transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F5y0ywe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F5y0ywe.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wkG6zZK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wkG6zZK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon arrival the probe completed its last task and then before power ran out in 3 hours I made a small correction burn so that the probe would exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI instead of sticking around the local area as space junk.

I just took Victor 1 and exchanged one battery for a 2.5m heatshield. Then I removed the map scanner and configured the top of the probe into the same return capsule I\u0027ve used before with a decoupler. I then launched into orbit and immediately did a burn until it showed me exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Then it was time warping ahead 2 days to reach deep space where I exposed my goo container and then a burn to push back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI (staging to the probe\u0027s engine when the booster ran out of fuel). From there I burned back into orbit of Kerbin and lowered my PE to 35 km. I time warped a bit until my charge was getting low and burned in order to widen my orbit - keeping the same PE but pushing it out (which also lowered the AP). This was to cut down on my speed when I reach the atmosphere. From there I seperated and simply had to sit through the inert return capsule cruising through the atmosphere once (on the dark side), coming out and around in a 300km orbit, then going back a second time and landing in the ocean for recovery. I did get a small bonus for returning an object from Sun orbit but most of the mission was just sitting around waiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2455j2X.png\u0022 alt=\u00222455j2X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FvU2fjX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FvU2fjX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xo1zjCO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xo1zjCO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll make sure Whiskey is more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T03:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sciuris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sciuris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh, it\u0027ll be interesting to see how this choice will affect your progression.

By comparison I see the advanced solar panels as essential to long range missions along with the Advanced Field Science (one at the bottom with a wheel icon) since it adds seperate life support supply pods. Once I have those two techs I can consider an interplanetary mission. Nuclear engines would be nice to have but I have no idea how far down they are. They could be on the 1800pt tier just past those Rocketry techs I mentioned but the tech tree might have another tier beyond that. I\u0027ve have a better idea once I unlock the panels. I will likely unlock Miniaturization at some point too (maybe I should go ahead and do it) since that icon just above Specialized Electronics looks like it is related to power too. However I have doubts that it could be RTGs given that there are low efficiency solar panels at the same tier (which also makes me think there must be another tier beyond what I see).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FkOr7p0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FkOr7p0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T05:02:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little surprised you consider the solar panels such a priority man.

Whiskey is intended as my first interplanetary mission. It\u0027s goal would be to fly to Eve and perform a low orbit pass of the planet (no orbit) to gain insight as to how much more science I might be able to gain from orbital measurements of other planets (is the multiplier higher, or do all bodies give the same amount for orbital experiments; the Sun readings lead me to believe bodies may be higher but they may not be as high as stock). From there I\u0027ll have an opportunity to try a tertiary goal of flying by Gilly. That wouldn\u0027t be easy on a single pass of Eve so it will only happen if everything is lined up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second goal would be to try a gravity assist / burn to push my orbit out just a little farther the Duna\u0027s. I\u0027m not looking to reach Duna but to test the output of solar cells as I move out farther then Kerbin. That\u0027s why Eve was the first target, it is guarenteed to have the power I need. I was also testing on the launchpad effective solar panel layouts. For this to work I\u0027ll need to park my probe in solar alignment and I wanted to ensure that with about 80% alignment I\u0027d get enough power. I tested it but in the raw form and then with the instrument attached to confirm the shadow wouldn\u0027t affect power. The probe\u0027s weight has already been determined based on the Quebec launcher. It will carry 2 Elite batteries for data transmission / dark side passes and have a few redundent instruments to let the probe store data for future transmission. It will take many hours for the probe\u0027s batteries to recharge after use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GEV6OLR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GEV6OLR.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2cW2dnc.png\u0022 alt=\u00222cW2dnc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of reasons for jumping to solar tech (though the outcome of Whisky 1 could change them). The weight of the existing solar cells is not too big of a problem, as you said the newer ones only reduce weight by half. What I am working around is the panel\u0027s size and placement restrictions. Because of their large size there are limited ways to attach them to a spacecraft without looking silly/exploitive (panels floating at odd angles and somehow not being destroyed during launch) and ultimately getting a panel arrangement that maintains weight balance means either placing them on the top of the ship like I have, or doubling up along the sides (which still looks a little silly if you rotate them to maximize how many can fit on a tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also took a while to find a top side arrangement that didn\u0027t seem to clip. If you start with a fuel tank then parts of the tank seem to clip through the solar panel, I wasn\u0027t sure if that compromised their effectiveness. The same is true of any flower pedal arrangement (6 or 8 panels) where they clip each other. Using a battery as my platform I was able to place the panels without visible clipping and since I calculated a minimum of 4 for safety I started rotating and figured out the square arrangement mostly fit with only a little overhang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sun tracking panels are not only smaller, letting me place more without looking silly, because they are sun tracking I can place them on both sides of a ship (weight balance) and they will all face the same source, automatically too! That would be essential for a Minmus mission which is my next major goal. Those sun tracking panels would also make any probe lander easier - with the static panels any lander would need to carry enough battery power for all operations after it landed since there would be little guarantee I could get the panels lined up. The big static panels would also not be likely to survive any entry on Eve or Duna, the two closest planets (Moho is annoying to get to and Dres may be too far for solar panels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: That was my reason \u003Cem\u003Efor\u003C/em\u003E going for the solar panels, I guess I should also balance that by saying that while all the other techs contain at least one \u0027useful\u0027 item as I listed before, none of them contain an item that I consider \u0027essential\u0027 to exploring at my current level (that heatshield might be useful though). I basically see power generation as my main constraint to exploring for the moment, everything else I think I have the design and planning skill to work around until I reach the next stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T13:37:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 01:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sciuris","CreatedById":98369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T14:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause of their large size there are limited ways to attach them to a spacecraft without looking silly/exploitive (panels floating at odd angles and somehow not being destroyed during launch) and ultimately getting a panel arrangement that maintains weight balance means either placing them on the top of the ship like I have, or doubling up along the sides (which still looks a little silly if you rotate them to maximize how many can fit on a tank).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third option is to use the Rockomax HubMax to build an array, which is what I did on any mission requiring more than four panels on top as in your design.

My main goal is a flyby of Eve to collect science - not just to spend but to have an idea of how much I might expect to find out there. As secondary goals I\u0027d like to know if my solar panels would produce enough charge out at Duna\u0027s orbit and it would be nice (but unlikely) to get a flyby of Gilly. I\u0027m launching on day 25ish so I\u0027m not really waiting for an ideal launch window in 100\u002B days.

It will take a few weeks to reach Eve and in the mean time the solar array needs to be kept pointed at the Sun. That means a correction is done every 5 days (closer to the Sun the time between corrections can go longer as more power is being recieved). Arriving at Eve it\u0027s obvious that Gilly is out of reach and after burning a lot of fuel I don\u0027t see enough delta-v to kick myself out to Duna\u0027s orbit (Eve isn\u0027t providing much of an assist). Readings are taken and after passing out of Eve\u0027s shadow transmission begins. The multiplier in Eve orbit is 3, the same as the sun and Mun/Minmus surface. This means I\u0027ll get 531 science for passing through low Eve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LzjqnWz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LzjqnWz.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pus0fOp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pus0fOp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinishing up I do find one more possible use for the probe. I\u0027ve got a raw estimate that the probe has 600 m/s left but that\u0027s being conservative. For 895 m/s I can push myself into a Moho encounter. With nothing else worth doing I decide to make the attempt and it seems like I\u0027m going to make it until I run out of fuel less then 3 seconds before the engine shut off. 22.6 m/s remaining. I still have 33 units of monopropellent left so I start using that, completing the burn with 9 units left for the critical attitude adjustments needed to maintain solar power during the journey. The Moho encounter will be for less then 30 minutes (high orbit only) but I\u0027ll gain science and an idea of what Moho is worth.

From the data I\u0027ve collected so far I believe that Duna and Dres will probably be 3x in orbit too and that all 4 planets will likely share the same surface multiplier though I don\u0027t know what that will be. Following the Mun and Minmus it could be 6 but with only 1 data point it\u0027s hard to say. Gilly and Ike could still prove to have higher multipliers. At this point I still need some science (and having sun tracking solar panels would really help). I could risk a trip to Duna where it would be easier to swing around to Ike but that mission might end up producing no science at all if the solar panels fail. Alternatively I could go to Moho (not my first choice, I dislike reaching that planet) and with a lot of luck use it to get into a low enough orbit around the sun to take more detailed readings. Finally I could go the Mun and collect some more soil samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RkuGVw3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RkuGVw3.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZlokFxh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZlokFxh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I forgot to mention that I observed no biomes over Eve (Ocean/Land), at least using the GravMax.

A duplicate of Whiskey 1 this probe made an attempt to reach Duna. I knew that the solar panels might not hold out at that range (which was why it was a secondary objective of Whiskey 1 to perform a check after it had gotten some science). And that\u0027s exactly what happened at 17.7 million km which is about 3/4 of the way between Kerbin and Duna\u0027s orbit. I had to make adjustments more and more frequently until I stopped gaining back power. I tried to get it exact but with time warp on it showed a net loss instead of a net gain (at normal speed the net power difference was too small to be observed). So I let the battery run down and shortly before it ran out I push up the throttle (full tank) and let it fly off. When the probe expired the batteries started charging again but there was nothing to power. I was also able to cut throttle with X after losing the probe core but it had no effect on the engine (still running full). It did have an effect on the timewarp messages - they changed from warning about the throttle to warning about the ship being under acceleration.

But frankly those would require more time and work then just visiting the Mun. Uniform 4 makes minor modifications to the Uniform 2 ship that went to the Mun. The main change is the lander which now uses a one man pod. It also carries less battery power for itself which further cuts down on weight and increases range. To keep the weight balanced (I don\u0027t want to figure out if the launcher needs any adjustment or recalculate burn times and delta-v) I\u0027ve added an idea I had when I plotted out the weight of a battery only Minmus mission. On the tail end of the lander is a battery module (BM) which in addition to providing the required ballast also provides the roughly 3 hours of power it will take to reach the Mun. Once used up it can be ejected before the lander module detaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UgzhrWk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UgzhrWk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission will be flown by Merdun and Nedvan Kerman.

Using the tracking station and my previous mappings of the Mun (scans from Oscar 2 and 3 and the crew reports on Uniform 2) I already have a good idea what will be on the sunlit side (which is currently facing opposite from Kerbin). I can see two promising areas that will likely be in daylight when I arrive. At the time of launch the Farside Crater is very visible on the tracking station screen and it has an easy to detect Highlands region around it. There is also what looks (but is not confirmed) to be a canyon to the north. Another destination, just coming into daylight is the East Farside Crater that was first mapped by Oscar 3. It has a confirmed Canyon biome connected to its east side and to the west is a bigger then average crater that I think matches my readings for a Highland crater, which would suggest some Highlands nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArriving at the Mun the first proposed landing site is already receding into darkness. That\u0027s ok since the canyon at the first site would have required a large inclination change to reach. The second site is in clear view and while I can\u0027t for certain identify as many biomes (I was more sure of the canyon at the first site then of the Highland Crater or Highlands at the second) it will be easier to land at. Other sights include the discarded Uniform 2 lander on the right and at the far left you can see the first landing site as well just above the Twin Craters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DXEW0Lz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DXEW0Lz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower and life support is moved around and the extra batteries are ejected (the spacecraft is essentially fully charged at this point thanks to the extra disposable cells and the engine alternator). Merdun moves into the lander and as the landing site comes up he detaches and prepares for descent. I\u0027m aiming for the mouth of the Canyon for the first landing. This way if I come up too short I\u0027ll still be in the crater and can collect that sample, then move a little farther into the canyon and collect that sample. In hindsight if I wanted to visit 3 or more sites the ideal flight path would have been to start at the west side and work east, that way if I needed to abort I\u0027d be moving in the right direction. As it was I had a 90 L cut off at which point I\u0027d need to return to orbit for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0CpLEYL.png\u0022 alt=\u00220CpLEYL.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OLsB60j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OLsB60j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding in the canyon goes smoothly.

The twin craters are just too far away and I don\u0027t know and can\u0027t see any other obvious biomes.

It\u0027s a night launch so there is even less to see. It\u0027s a quarter new Mun so when I arrive my landing site is actually under/a bit before the capture point.

This is also the first time I used to right click display for the landing radar, in this configuration it is useful for tracking distance though at this point I\u0027m mostly used to just landing by sight.

I\u0027m surprised that I was able to complete it with the 3rd stage booster and still have fuel left. Once I\u0027m on my way I can see how effective the new panels are. The biggest advantage was that while I was checking in to ensure the panels where generating enough power due to distance from the sun I didn\u0027t many adjustments. With the ship laying flat and the panels extended north and south they can all track and follow the position of the sun. I make some minor corrections to make sure my Duna approach is level and entering Duna\u0027s SOI I can start taking readings. As I suspected Duna\u0027s orbit is worth 3x like Eve. Low orbit provides more data and I start off loading the mapping readings immediately. Since I only need to pass low orbit once (I can store everything until I have a chance to transmit) I end up with a unique \u0022capture\u0022 burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RFdw2YC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RFdw2YC.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EmHRP66.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EmHRP66.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9RZ7ftN.png\u0022 alt=\u00229RZ7ftN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll make a second capture burn to park in Ike orbit where I can recharge my batteries and offload all the Duna readings before working on Ike at my leisure. On the way there I work up enough charge to send back my minor readings. Compared to the mapping instrument everything else is small on power. My Ike capture puts me onto a steeply inclined orbit of Ike with a high AP and a PE that just dips into low orbit (once I collect readings I raise it just slightly so I don\u0027t hit the slower time warp). I made no effort to stop this since it benefitted me - the probe rarely passes \u0027behind\u0027 Ike so I can recharge at the maximum possible speed. I should also note that it is only now that the 3rd stage booster has finally run out of fuel, leaving me with an almost full tank on the probe (about 2200 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/29urZb0.png\u0022 alt=\u002229urZb0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hm2TRjR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hm2TRjR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes 4 days in Ike orbit to recharge the batteries so that I can begin transmitting again. Unfortunately Ike has a nasty surprise - Ike orbit is only worth 2x. So a temperature reading is only 16 science. After 4 more days of recharging I prepare the last part of the planned mission, a less then graceful landing on Ike (I\u0027ll just be trying to land without blowing anything up so I can transmit from the surface). Landing is soft but I\u0027m on a hill and the probe has no way to brake. All the solar units on one side are destroyed (not just the collectors but the storage bins too) along with one on the other side. Transmitting from Ike\u0027s surface reveals it is only worth 3x - Ike data is worth the same as data from the Mun. I don\u0027t think I like Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GEdrpYG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GEdrpYG.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tLq6qzH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tLq6qzH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing position and damage means that it is unlikely that I can complete one last task (which was made viable by all the extra fuel). That would have been to take off from Ike and fly back to Duna on a collision course, using the PresMat to take a quick reading in the upper atmosphere (even if just to get the science multiplier) before the probe burned up. Attempting to take off with the probe proves useless, the loss of the solar cells on one side has seriously compromised the center of mass and the already low monopropellent (9 units left) is reduced further when one of the tanks breaks off during the take off attempt. The probe flips and crashes, broken beyond recovery. Here is a single frame where you can actually see the fuel tank has exploded but the other parts have not yet reacted, though they are traveling at 34 m/s close to the surface so they won\u0027t last long (in the next frame everything is a fireball again and by the time the smoke clears nothing is left).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qlPHeLH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qlPHeLH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6pHh5Jm.png\u0022 alt=\u00226pHh5Jm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next steps at this point are to start filling in the tech tree tier I skipped. I\u0027ll unlock the nose cone sensor and do some testing on Kerbin to see what it costs to operate, what it returns and where it can be used. After that I\u0027ll unlock some of the engine nodes. I haven\u0027t been happy with the 2nd stage of the Uniform heavy booster and the Quebec platform is getting old. Having the booster stick around for so long on this mission proved a hassle so I want something that\u0027s a bit more predictable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally I want to use my engine tech (Mainsails replacing Keel Hauls) and structure tech (radial decouplers) to build a new versatile launch platform. It should be smooth and easy to control (man rated) and ideally will have at least 2 stages. Using both stages it would be used to put a heavier payload then the Uniform mission into orbit (so probably in the 45-60 ton payload range), while the upper stage(s) could be used alone, much like I did in Uniform 3, to put smaller payloads like probes into orbit. I will likely dedicate a series of missions to test and refine that system so that I can use it as a long term investment for the safety and good operation of future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat also means I\u0027ll be running out of names. The sensor cone experiments will be X-Ray, the booster development will be Yankee and a Minmus mission using the new booster would be Zulu. Any ideas for a future set of names?

I intended to make progressive designs and document the testing of this but I didn\u0027t. The idea was that both boosters could be part of the same system, the way I had reused the upper stage booster in Uniform 3. So the light booster would just be the medium booster with a part removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had some design considerations - to be useful as a quick and reusable booster it should be stable and easy to fly. That meant it should fly straight, carry and supplies it needed (with the exception of an SAS system) and the final stage should have enough delta-v so that it will have already started before the circulization burn is planned (this way the burn time will be known ahead of time). The light variant would need to keep clear of the payload area since it would carry shorter ships. The medium variant would need to keep some space around the payload but it would be desirable if it had some kind of stack to help tether the payload, the way that the Uniform launcher extended up to \u0027chest\u0027 height on the payload so that the lander could be tethered with struts. For payload I put it around 30 tons for the light and 60 tons for the medium based on my current ship and probe designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went through a few designs on paper and started building one in the VAB. This is the closest the unified booster got. It flew once and as a result the sepratrons where added. The idea was the medium variant would integrate 3 more radial boosters that where taller to provide the additional thrust and fuel needed and to provide the tethering points. I just wasn\u0027t satisfied with the radial seperation of those large boosters and it was becoming obvious that a booster that could operate in 2 modes safely was a big challange. I was wasting a lot of time on an engineering task with no specific reason for being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ks4SyrV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ks4SyrV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Everything above the big decoupler is a payload simulator)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back and much more quickly put together a light and then a medium lifter with the goal of making them simple and safe. Both are 2 stage launchers with the lower stage using control surfaces to avoid spinning (the gimbels provide attitude control) and the upper stage has an RCS system to cancel out any spin and to align for the circulization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe light variant is based entirely around Skipper engines. The first stage burns 6 radial engines which cut out once the ship is essentially out of the atmosphere and burning toward the horizon. They seperate and a smaller fuel tank and Skipper take over (the small size and decoupler placement ensures a clean seperation without any extra seperation thrusters). This 2nd stage is equiped with 2 radial monopropellent tanks and a set of RCS thrusters for orbital alignment. The light booster can also stand on it\u0027s own engines for launch, though I might update this to include launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7KE0nfs.png\u0022 alt=\u00227KE0nfs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe medium variant is composed of 2 nearly identical stages. The first stage uses 7 Mainsails (1 in the middle, 6 radial) to boost up to the gravity turn and have fins for spin stabilization. The second stage with the same amount of fuel then takes over, powered by 7 Skippers. The lack of radial decoupling is used to make it safer and easy to control (it can turn as fast as the payload can handle). The second stage has ample monopropellent and RCS thrusters for attitude control in orbit, and also has structural towers for tethering a payload (this helps when making the gravity turn, so tall payloads like the Uniform stack don\u0027t flex).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BTdVu0G.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BTdVu0G.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j0kXmPk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022j0kXmPk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T14:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EZulu, which is going to Minmus is already designed and in the VAB.

I\u0027m unable to find the Flats which are somewhere on the night side of Minmus and my orbit doesn\u0027t permit me to get the poles. As the ship comes around to the day side again Merdun boards the landing module and seperates. There is a brief time when both capsules are manned which causes the power usage to spike. Once the lander seperates Gusbin verifies that the CM is operating in positive electrical mode again (gaining charge). It takes a few moment for Merdun to activate all 4 engines and then he is descending to one of the salt flat regions a little north of the equater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/blbNWq4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022blbNWq4.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iuMgd9H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iuMgd9H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith landing radar, high thrust, low center of mass, plenty of fuel and Minmus\u0027s low gravity the landing is as easy as it could be. Crew and EVA reports are made and a sample is taken from the Lesser Flats. Walking on Minmus with no jetpack requires a bit of planning to avoid missing the ladder, the strides are very long in the low gravity. Traveling to some bodies without a jetpack could be dangerous. Back in the lander Merdun heads south east toward the high ground for another landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/le66HDq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022le66HDq.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dQ4mbSC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dQ4mbSC.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3UYptZ5.png\u0022 alt=\u00223UYptZ5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding in the Midlands another sample is taken. I had considered walking to the cliff edge to try and collect a slopes sample but on landing the edge is quite far away (probably 1000m or so) and I have very limited EVA life support (and the suit is using life support supplies much faster then my pod so I want to minimize waste). The next highly visible biome (another salt flat) is a considerable distance to the east. Between here and there is a bumpy region that I assume is a larger (and hopefully less steep) slopes region that I can visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IN2MHFf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IN2MHFf.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SGG98IO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SGG98IO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraveling east my cockpit instruments say I\u0027m over the Lowlands so I land 10 km from where I took off and take a sample. From space it looks a lot like a part of the Midlands but maybe gradient isn\u0027t as steep as between the flats and their surroundings. You can see the general direction I\u0027m trying to go, to reach the salt flats area in the east (right side) while making a stop over in the bumpy region just before it. At this point I\u0027ve already passed the mission requirements for science (I had it with the second sample) so I\u0027ll have enough to unlock the rest of the 360pt tier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qJib1Pq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qJib1Pq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I fly over the bumpy area which does register as Slopes. However as I slow down to land the reading changes to Midlands - I am forced to travel some more to find where it transitions back to Slopes which is a challenge as the area seems to be a patchwork of Midlands, Lowlands and Slopes. I finally find a place to land and take a sample. At this rate I can no longer see my original Lesser Flats landing zone, it being about 30 km away. All consumables are good and even with the landing radar usage the power is being consumed at a slower rate then life support which seems to be the limiting factor in this mission (I also have lots of fuel and monopropellent left).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ripUJq5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ripUJq5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dzkfodq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dzkfodq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the last and longest leg of my journey I fly to the Great Flats, about 70 km from my original landing. By my estimate I\u0027ve covered a little less than a quarter of Minmus\u0027s equater. Here I take a 5th surface sample to add to my collection. While I do have enough supplies to continue on I do have a problem and that is further east is the terminator into night. While I can make out another flats area from the orbital view I don\u0027t have lights on the lander and don\u0027t want to fly around blind with all the steep cliffs. While there is roughly enough fuel there isn\u0027t enough life support to fly back to the west of my original starting point (in additition to the time this would take it would also likely make me miss my docking window). So instead Merdun takes a quick nap while the command module completes the rest of its orbit and arrives overhead for a docking rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kDqxv1L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kDqxv1L.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z6jzHFt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z6jzHFt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VU8rhfY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VU8rhfY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T23:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EZulu 1 (Part 3)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the command module comes overhead the lander takes off to catch it. The latitude of the lander means it has to make a set of course changes and adjustments before it can meet up with the command module. I was afraid this might mess up the docking window but it worked out better then could have been expected. The initial interception was just 0.3 km about 270 degrees from the launch site. This made it easy to perform the docking with essentially one burn instead of the usual pattern of a 4 km interception followed by an orbit correction and then the closer interception followed by docking maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hVt0Lca.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hVt0Lca.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zAAHEsF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zAAHEsF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 320m the lander was able to make an extremely accurate burn to take it to the command module. The burn was so accurate that almost no further action was required beyond switching to the CM and turning it around so the docking port was facing the oncoming LM. The LM used a bit of RCS to slow down from 3.5 m/s to 0.5 m/s for the final docking, with minor translation burns to account for the change in speed (since both objects are moving in differing orbits, if you change the time of interception you also change the relative position they will be in). The docking port clamped on immediately and everyone was happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SGn3eOp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SGn3eOp.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w7HohwB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w7HohwB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PsN3ZYt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PsN3ZYt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/31PHTmq.png\u0022 alt=\u002231PHTmq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerdun transfer back with all of his samples - I\u0027ve managed to collect samples from 5 of 9 biomes in one trip - and then the process begins of stripping the lander of useful supplies like life support and monopropellent. With the ships monopropellent tanks full and the valves closed the landers remaining stores are using to set the craft in a spin so that the lander can be discarded in a fling maneuver. A check of consumables shows 5.5 days of life support for the crew of 2 along with plenty of fuel and monopropellent. The command module is stabilized and brought around to the exit burn orientation. The ship is then rotated along the center axis to best align the solar cells, though they are stowed for the actual burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/38Jm9KR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002238Jm9KR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn to Kerbin is a 25 km PE and will take just over 2 days.

It slightly reduces the power requirements to transmit but not as much as the dish I have now did over the antenna. With the use of regenerating power the power use becomes even less of an issue. It also a reaction wheel I might actually use. Other parts include the place anywhere RCS thruster and the larger radial monopropellent tank along with another tiny fuel tank (tiny fuel tanks don\u0027t have as much use in BTSM). Thanks to me unlocking the 3 nodes below it much earlier, and then unlocking those final nodes above in sequence I can see that it doesn\u0027t seem to lead to any future tech (I assume this is a limitation of the current tech tree modding as described by FlowerChild). For this reason I\u0027m going to hold off on unlocking it, for the moment that 360 science will provide a bump toward unlocking my next major tech (I have 927 science in the bank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mauq35R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Mauq35R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that covered I\u0027d like to talk a bit about my current tech tree position and plans. My previous tech tree jump to get solar panels was the product of 2 factors - the only techs where nice to have but in my view none where absolutely critical for getting my next batch of science. That was the second part, at that point I\u0027d opened up a large number of potential science targets so I wasn\u0027t starved for new missions at that point. Prior to that I was frequently in the position of seeing every tech as vital just to get a rocket into orbit and needed any advance that would let me reach new sources of science since I was always close to drying up my current supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter completing the Mun mission there was a bit of a breather - the science from that helped unlock the most useful looking 360pt items (the ones at the bottom) and I knew that I wasn\u0027t going to exhaust my sources of science in the near future. As I am now on the 1800pt tier things have returned a bit to normal. I\u0027m not as starved for new sources of science as I was in the early game though I\u0027m also not as guaranteed to find large quantities of it, which is important given the large cost increase which now means that I may need to complete multiple missions to unlock a single tech. Of the 1800pt techs they all seem useful thought there are some notable ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimental Rocketry has fuel lines which are very useful, the ion drive less so (though I\u0027ll admit I haven\u0027t checked to see if the stats are changed to make it friendly to use). Meta-Materials will probably be my first tech as it contains a nuclear reactor capable of powering a probe core. This will be required to advance exploration beyond Duna. Composites has the Science Jr though I think I\u0027ve been spoiled and suspect that it needs to be operated by a kerbal (this is actually how I assumed it worked when .22 first came out and it was only once I was in space that I found it couldn\u0027t be right clicked in EVA). Heavy Aerodynamics is the only item I don\u0027t have an interest in. After I\u0027ve unlocked the other items in this tier I\u0027ll see if it seems to be blocking access to anything that looks crucial (for example if there is a grayed out tech to the right of it with a nuclear symbol). If not it may stay locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Oi1JRST.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Oi1JRST.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CYdEFIA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CYdEFIA.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TjequtO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TjequtO.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KTMMGCT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KTMMGCT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypersonic Flight offers the inflatable heatshield. I don\u0027t really know what the specific benefits of it are. There is also a shuttle cockpit which has an \u0022Active Heatshield (directional)\u0022. There is no number of how much heatshield material there is and the nose cone sensor also has the same thing. I\u0027m not sure what kind of heatshield this is (maybe it\u0027s reusable?). I don\u0027t know if the heatshield terminology is covered somewhere in deadly reentry but maybe the descriptions for BTSM could include some clues for these later heatshields, the way the flat heatshields include subtle clues about what scenario they are good enough for (orbit return, Mun return, interplanetary braking). Advanced Unmanned Tech seems to have the final probe cores, with the same weight and energy consumption regardless of size. I don\u0027t have a strong priority on this one but I suspect it may lead to important end game tech. Not Potatos answers the question of where the stock battery models are. These seem to have the stock stats so they are very light. At this stage I\u0027m not entirely sure super light batteries are needed but like Advanced Unmanned Tech I suspect they may lead to something important like a light RTG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wMAe8dZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wMAe8dZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8cAVa5b.png\u0022 alt=\u00228cAVa5b.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b2QT6ez.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b2QT6ez.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Science Tech is something I won\u0027t unlock immediately but is high on my list.
