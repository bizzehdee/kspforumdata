She treated it for sixth degree burns, severe skin melting, and heat stress. \u0027Poor thing, must only be underground as it can\u0027t survive the surface temperatures\u0027 said Teddo, watching the now asleep Perry being operated on by Catla. Further studies revealed that Perry was a male Raptyl, an obscure hybrid of a cat body, but with a Lemming\u0027s\u00A0sense of smell and burrowing skills.
