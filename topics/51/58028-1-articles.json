However, the government was getting worried, as supplies of Kethane had been running low on their territories. They could open a deal with the Nothern Provinces to keep supplies of Kethane going on, although not for long because the prices would have been expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heads of the space program set up a reunion in the conference room, where they spoke with the president, who was unable to be present in there, but had an apparition with the conference room\u0027s large TV regardless. They were looking for a planetary body capable of hosting a self-sustaining colony, safe and yet within the reaches of the space program.

Wernher, you have clearance to put Project Genesis into practice. Don\u0027t disappoint me, and do it as quickly as possible.

It will inject itself into a direct aerocapture with Jool\u0027s upper atmospheric layers to achieve orbit, and then will intercept Laythe, where it will stay in a polar orbit to scan the entirety of the surface for Kethane pockets. After the job is done, it will stay there as a Communication Satellite between Laythe, Kerbin and Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPhase 2: Building the Base\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy Year 3, when Jool\u0027s second launch window opens, an armada of ships, namely the Habitation module, rovers, airplanes(?) and kethane miners \u0026amp; transporters will be launched from the space center(this phase makes the president cringe), where they will fly to Jool using the same aerocapture manuever on its upper atmosphere, and will each land on a chunk of land on Laythe possessing Kethane, with help from Mechanical Jeb\u0027s autopilot manuever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem with this phase is how the armada will be transferred. Some suggest just docking everything together, but such layout seems hard to make, not to mention the pilots are not experienced with rendezvous. Others suggest just sending everything as an armada, but the thought of juggling several ships at once terrifies the pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPhase 3: Crew Roster, Part One\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around Year 4, the rocket carrying the first three crew will be sent to Laythe. It\u0027s going to be the first manned flight to the Joolian system, but since it\u0027s only going to happen after the experience with Phases One and Two, nobody is particularly worried with it(except Archie Kerman, but he\u0027s always worried). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, using the MechJeb autopilot, the ship is going to land on the specified base\u0027s area, where the brave kerbonauts will head on for the habitation module. If the rocket lands too far from the destination, the rovers can simply drive to the landing site and carry the kerbals to the base. Afterwards, they will begin the mining operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EPhase 4: Crew Roster, Part Two\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, three crew is not enough to maintain an operational base, and is ridiculous for when the planned hab. module can support 14 kerbals. Another rocket, possessing 7 kerbals this time, will fly to Laythe, to finish the population in Jool\u0027s innermost moon, and marking the furthest space adventure the Southern Provinces ever had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, such an experiment needed a powerful transfer vehicle, but the engineers had alterady worked on the Jool-1 rocket, meant to transport light payloads such as probes. Packing 10,965 delta-V, that thing can go places depending on the payload, and it doesn\u0027t even use Rockomax parts!

Increased the Delta-V from 6k to 10k instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the rocket took off naturally. Since it used Asparagus Staging, the first two boosters were quickly deprived of fuel and ejected quickly, and the rocket resumed ascending, with less thrust but also less weight. At 10k, it began to make the infamous gravity turn. Unfortunately, the second two boosters ran out of fuel in that very moment, forcing the rocket to carry that dead weight along it while making the gravity turn. Fortunately, the rocket remained ascending quickly, and then ejected the dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it was time to wait until the rocket achieved apoapsis.

It told me that a 18.462km periapsis would yield me a 92km apoapsis around Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the result was wrong and Laythe tried to swallow me again, but thankfully I managed to keep a 72km apoapsis with assistance of the NERVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R1XtQlV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R1XtQlV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMallan Kerman:\u003C/strong\u003E *wipes forehead* \u0022Gosh...finally, I managed to circularize around this evil, evil thing you call Laythe...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBill Kerman:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022The job\u0027s not done yet, Mallan. Remember, KSC said that the probe should be in a polar, or at least mostly polar orbit around Laythe, so the entire moon can be scanned.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMallan Kerman:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022....God, please help me...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, like everything that happens to me on KSP, there was a catch. The probe lacked enough fuel to make it into a polar orbit. Ugh. Well, in this case, I guess the Southern Provinces better not think about mining Kethane on the nothern and southern regions of Laythe. On the bright side, the orbit now was quite inclined, and can scan a wide area constantly...assuming Kethane scanners can reach up to 325km. But even if it cannot, the probe can still scan on the periapsis\u0027 side. This is a shot regarding the main probe itself disattaching from the NERVA booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wu100Xd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wu100Xd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that concludes Phase 1 of Project Genesis! The only thing that stops the scanning is that the Kethane grid seems to be invisible, but once the issue is fixed, the probe will begin the scanning as soon as possible! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoral of the story:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Laythe is an evil, evil thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimMartland","CreatedById":68334,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T00:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat writing, and a very true moral \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E good luck with finishing your project thing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T01:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TimMartland\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TimMartland\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat writing, and a very true moral \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E good luck with finishing your project thing!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! I got Kethane to work, but unfortunately Laythe still had a truck under her sleeve; I can\u0027t seem to find any Kethane pockets on the islands. The only two kethane pockets discovered so far are located on the middle of the oceans, and I highly doubt kethane drills can work in the water, nor if the Southern Provinces have the technology to launch a navy boat to mine the Kethane in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T01:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood job getting to Laythe.

So the end result is they\u0027re about the same. Bop is also in a much more inclined orbit (15 degrees compared to 4 degrees).
