The rest of the crew were both taking a quick nap, curled up in seats at opposite ends of the shuttle. He had been working through the last week\u0027s worth of radio data, trying to find a signal from home, when Agake broke him from his trance.

The science gear on the Calcium 3 recorded several high-energy bursts, events that originated on the surface. Or just below it. I did a bit of math and every one of them map back to the same spot.

Macfred patted him on the shoulder, shook him a bit. A grumbling mass of slightly wrinkled kerbal stirred from its rest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t do it! Uhm. Oh, hey kid, what\u0027s up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Space. I was wondering if you could run some numbers on a landing site. Pretty far south, might be difficult to get to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure thing. I\u0027ll take a look.\u0022 He brought the lander\u0027s navigation system up from sleep mode. The computer was perhaps a bit more sluggish than Thomlock, and both seemed only half awake. A few moments later and it was online, happily blinking at them. \u0022You got the coords?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep. Sixty degrees, five minutes south by eighty-three degrees, forty-six minutes east. Give or take.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are we giving or are we taking?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Taking, hopefully.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm.\u0022 Thomlock punched the coordinates into the navigation computer and worked out a few different trajectories. More grumbling. He ditched the first batch of results and ran the numbers again, producing the same basic set of trajectories. \u0022Hmm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027ll be close. Not much wiggle room.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can we make it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, sure. Maybe, if we hit the landing right. Might need to leave somebody on the surface to make it back to orbit though. Or maybe cut off pieces of the ship and leave them there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Or, we could not do something quite that rash and instead use other Sulphur to come get us from a low orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well sure, if you want to go all logical on me. I figured this rock would make a nice retirement spot. Fly that other Sulphur down and build myself a little trailer home out in the hills.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Really.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope. There\u0027s another thing, too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Something real? Or just more sarcasm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. See we\u0027re not in an absolutely zero-inclination orbit. Close, well, no, not really. About twenty degrees off retrograde. If we use the most efficient trajectories, you know, those most likely to get us back to space, well, see kid, you won\u0027t see. It\u0027ll be dark when we land. And not just a normal, happy, regular old night kind of dark either. Dark dark. Really dark. Behind Jool dark.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wouldn\u0027t have it any other way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, well, that\u0027s just you. No easy task to drop a lander on an unknown ice patch in the pitch black, but hey, I think I can handle it. We\u0027ve got radar. We\u0027ve got spotlights. And we\u0027ve got some extra spring in our step. Just say when and I\u0027ll set up the burns.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As soon as makes sense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay.\u0022 He flipped a switch and the cockpit flared to life. \u0022Get saddled up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sulphur 5 needed an inclination change before it could land. Trigonometry tells us it\u0027s always cheaper to change you angle when you\u0027re going slower, so the first step was to increase their orbit. Even with an orbital velocity of 540m/s (give or take) it\u0027s still more efficient to climb and slow down first. And it\u0027s even more efficient if you wait until you\u0027re at your absolute periapsis before trying to raise your periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170103_ksp0313_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170103_ksp0313_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sixty degree orbit would place them over the landing zone once per day, all that was required thereafter was a bit of patience. So at apoapsis they spun up the remaining 40 degrees to bring them to their desired orbit. Following that Thomlock circularized, checked the map, and then went back to sleep until the landing was lined up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing a pilot in a kerbal space program is one of those jobs where half of the interesting things occur in the dark. And often, those dimly-lit moments of interest are also exceedingly complex and unbelievably dangerous. \u0022I may not remember every landing,\u0022 a pilot was once heard to remark, \u0022but I remember all the night ones.\u0022 Sometimes kerbals aren\u0027t given much of a choice though, as with the crew of the Sulphur 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they would land. In the dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock set up three phases for the descent: the de-orbit burn; the initial landing burn; and the final landing burn. The first two were large burns, consuming the bulk of the fuel set aside for the operation. Both of the first two burns also included monopropellant discharges, as had the plane-change maneuver, to buy as much \u0394v as possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170103_ksp0374_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170103_ksp0374_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred had the unlucky position of dangling from one of the upside down chairs during the descent. If his straps broke he would fall onto Agake, probably hurting her or himself quite a bit considering the 1.5G the shuttle could produce at full thrust. He could have, no, should have rotated his chair, probably still could in between burns, but there was little point. The surface gravity on Vall wouldn\u0027t be a problem. All he had to do was make it to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe watched the burning cloud of fuel expand away from their exhaust as they slipped towards the surface. Most times it was brighter than the stars, most often it was the only thing visible through the thick glass. When the second burn completed, all he could see was a dim reflection of the inside of the shuttle, a handful of stars, and a soft glow on the empty black plain below. A strange, bluish glow. He was going to mention it to Agake when the glow disappeared. Probably just his imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock\u0027s voice crackled across the shuttle\u0027s speakers. \u0022We\u0027re directly over the anomaly now, about four hundred meters up. I\u0027m bringing the engines up to make our landing. Hold on to something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170103_ksp0376_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170103_ksp0376_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred\u0027s stomach twisted slightly as the ship cancelled its lateral movement, pirouetted around, and started into the final descent. At first all he could see outside was the endless black plain and their exhaust cloud. Then, the closer they got, the more the light from the engines lit the scene. Small rocks or lumps of ice stood sentry as the smaller dust and fines were blasted out of the way. A small cloud of vapour spread out as frozen particles melted. The spotlights splashed onto the ice just as the engines roared their final roar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock must have slightly misjudged the distance, as the lander came down a bit hard. A short bounce and gut-wrenching slide and they were stopped. The engines cut out, the outside world cast into complete darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are we there?\u0022 Macfred heard Gletrix ask from the lower cabin. \u0022All I can see is Tylo.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred stared into the darkness, wondering what this nearby anomaly would turn out to be. He didn\u0027t remember any of the Forgotten talking about other missions to Vall, and so far they had not found an older craft orbiting the moon. Nor were any transmitting from the surface, no unaccounted for noise in his regular radio sweeps. Near as they could tell Vall was untouched. This seemed rather unlikely to Macfred. There were probably several craft they just hadn\u0027t found yet, such as the lander probes on Laythe. Or perhaps they had melted their way into the moon\u0027s icy crust, never to be seen again? Only time would tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe blinked as the cabin lights came back to full brightness, temporarily blinding everyone in the shuttle. Thomlock\u0027s voice boomed through the cabin once more as he slid down the ladder towards the bottom of the shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re here folks. Sorry about the landing, ground rose up a bit there at the last second. It may not be much to look at, but welcome to Vall. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m going to sleep until sunrise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanded. In the dark.

He spent the night as he usually did, scanning the frequencies for noise. A telltale noise, that of a signal from home.

Their anomaly rose from the darkness as a sunken city emerges from the waters that had claimed it. And so as sunlight filled the valley, Macfred\u0027s mind filled with curiosity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0002_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0002_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe woke the rest of the crew and set about preparing for the day. Agake had completed the immediate science tasks, reducing their list of \u0022must-do\u0022 goals to two: plant a flag, and visit the strange alien structures. Thomlock suggested skipping the flag planting, remarking that they\u0027d all forget about it anyway.

It would be a long hike across this very cold ice to reach their strange destination. Sure, they could use their jetpacks to dart over, but they were low on monopropellant and EVA fuel, and there was no reason to waste more of it. So hiking it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey stopped every 100 meters to check the ground and their surroundings. Agake remarked more than once about the smoothness of the ice. There were no large fissures or other breaks as one would expect from a body with an active ocean. There were also no craters, the surface seemingly as fresh as the day it was created. The dust and fines they slogged through were indicative of geysers, water having sprayed out, formed into ice crystals, and come to rest over the moon\u0027s surface. And yet it was so uniform, so pristine. Almost... unnatural.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far there had been no signs of the energy readings the Calcium had detected. Not since they landed, and especially not since they set out on their trek. They were more than a kilometer from the lander now, yet still some five hundred meters from the ice castle. They had clearly misjudged its size. Suddenly Thomlock stopped, faced them, and patted the side of his helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, kid, I didn\u0027t quite hear you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hear what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Didn\u0027t you just whisper something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three looked at each other and then back to Thomlock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No?

It was a soft rumble, more of a deep sound than a piece of ice moving. All four stopped regardless. Thomlock patted at the side of his helmet again, but didn\u0027t turn. Didn\u0027t ask. He pulled out a spacewrench and was appeared as though he was going to adjustment his radio pack when the anomaly suddenly sprang to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0064_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0064_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ball of plasma appeared above each of the spires, the tips of the pyramids glowing with a new light. They each stood motionless, quiet in their internal reflections on this new vision. In all their travels, of all the dead and empty ships and stations they had stumbled upon, this was the first that could not have been built by the hands of kerbals. This was truly and honestly alien.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred cleared his throat, took a sip from his suit\u0027s water tube, and keyed his mic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think it\u0027s safe to get closer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake shrugged and replied \u0022I guess. I mean, it\u0027s just light. The readings aren\u0027t even particularly remarkable. Nothing on the scale of what the Calcium recorded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on they marched.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plasma was throbbing, slowly, its rhythm increasing slightly with each step. Occasionally the ground would shake as a loud hum of energy pulsed through the ice. Thomlock was still behaving oddly, smacking at the side of his helmet from time to time. At first he complained of radio noise, of the energy of the anomaly causing problems. Macfred checked his own equipment but could find nothing wrong. He gave Thomlock\u0027s suit a quick look, but again came up empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time later Thomlock stopped, turned towards them and exclaimed \u0022Ok, you had to have heard that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred shook his head, he had heard nothing. \u0022I\u0027m still not hearing anything. Are you sure you\u0027re alright? Maybe we should head back to the ship and...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No way. I\u0027m fine kid, just... just don\u0027t worry about me. Let\u0027s go. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred could tell from his face he was lying, but there was no reason to press the issue. Thomlock waved at his helmet as though he was chasing away a bug, and then continued on. Except now Thomlock was moving at a much faster pace than the rest. He didn\u0027t appear to be running, but Macfred was himself at a jog, and Gletrix and Agake were trailing behind. Then he stopped again and looked rapidly from side to side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0079_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0079_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob? Bill? Are you here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey all stopped. Thomlock spun around, chasing some invisible ghost in much the same way as a cat chases its tail. He would pause momentarily, fixate on some point near or far, and then repeat the process. Macfred\u0027s stomach sank, and he wondered if his friend, if their pilot had succumbed to that illness which had claimed so many of the others. To space madness. They needed to get out of there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, folks, that\u0027s enough. We\u0027re going back to the ship and we\u0027ll watch the light show from there. Where it\u0027s safe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe started towards Thomlock and froze, suddenly unable to move. Thomlock was still spinning wildly, pointing, gesticulating, muttering something that only he could hear. The ground was thumping at a strong pace, the rhythm of the anomaly beating like a distant drum. A drum that matched Macfred\u0027s heart. He shook himself free of whatever fear had frozen him before and stepped towards his friend again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was little more than a whisper. Had he heard it? Or imagined it? Its effect was real enough, his body frozen again. Thomlock turned towards them and stopped, a broad smile on his face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0090_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022570\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0090_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I understand now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred shook himself free and turned to him. \u0022Maybe you could explain it to us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t. Not yet.\u0022 He smiled at them again. \u0022You probably shouldn\u0027t follow me.\u0022 And at that he turned and walked directly towards the ice castle. Macfred reached towards him as he left. He started to follow, walking in the same direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSTOP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a familiar voice. Was it real? Absolutely. Not more than a whisper, yet he was certain he had heard it. So, too, had Gletrix and Agake, as all three looked at each other just as the word was spoken. He looked back to the anomaly to see Thomlock\u0027s walk had become a run. The plasma was now brighter than ever, hundreds of lightning bolts crackled in the void between the balls of energy and the spires they hovered over. An occasional bolt would stream up from the ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, this was dangerous. He needed to stop his friend. He started again....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0100_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022597\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0100_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStop!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it was a real voice speaking real words. An all-so-strangely familiar voice and an all-too-powerful word. A commandment, delivered with silent force from some distant place. His body stopped where it was, his legs frozen still. All he could do was scream at Thomlock. Try to get him to...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stop!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the truth hit him. It was his own voice he was hearing. Every time. The earlier whispers, the commandment, the scream. How? None of this made sense. Had he been speaking without realizing it? Was the voice Thomlock had heard his own? Was he the one going mad? The pooled energy atop the ice spires arced, each sphere of plasma now connecting to the others in a beam. These dense rivers of energy caused incredible vibrations in the ice, the booming sound now throbbing heavily through his suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0106_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0106_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe waved towards the structures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You two are seeing this, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth replied yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it was real. The light show was real, the anomaly was real. Thomlock was in danger, real danger, and Macfred needed to stop him. Now. He shook his head, came back to his senses again, and broke into a sprint.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSTOP!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrozen again, muscles locked mid-stride, falling forward onto the ice. His helmet hit first, covering the visor in a thin layer of freshly melted dust. He brushed it off, got back to his feet, yet couldn\u0027t bring himself to walk. He wanted to follow, he needed to follow, yet his body wouldn\u0027t. His fists clenched and his teeth gritted as he fought against the strange force that was holding him. Stopping him. He growled, spat, wrenched his arms free and screamed into the dark sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022STOP!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was as though time itself had come unraveled. Macfred, screaming at himself; whispering to himself. He pushed with one foot, driving his body forward. His other foot fell heavy, but he pressed on. One foot at a time. Left. Down. Right. Down. Left. He could make it. He would make it. he must make it. Another foot, and another. His muscles burned with defiance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock had now reached the interior of the anomaly. As he came to a stop the outer ring of energy formed into a tight circle, a torus, pulses of energy echoing through it. The lightning grew more intense, streaking from ground and spire to reach the highest sphere. Macfred\u0027s radio crackled, his suit buzzed warnings, his lungs burned. And yet he pushed on. One foot at a time. Right. Down. Left. Down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170212_ksp0155_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170212_ksp0155_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock was little more than a tiny dot in the unreachable distance. Macfred watched as this distant speck was lifted gently off the ground, raised aloft by the endless energy. A whisper scratched its way into his mind, a message delivered not by radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stop. Everything will be ok.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170420_ksp0117_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022568\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170420_ksp0117_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flash blinded him. The balls of plasma became an endless stream, connecting upwards through the spires and pooling into the spinning torus. A shaft of light shot upwards. The ground buckled, bent, kicked Macfred off the surface just as the energy wave tossed him away. The last thing he saw was the stream of light piercing the endless night sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170420_ksp0150_thomlock.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022567\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170420_ksp0150_thomlock.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe awoke to see Gletrix and Agake standing over him. He blinked, looked from kerbal to kerbal, and asked a simple question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thomlock?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey shook their heads. No answer.

He was sure he\u0027d broken something, either in his suit or in his bones, and didn\u0027t want to aggravate it. His suit beeped a warning, his visor flashed a message. He had burned through an hour\u0027s worth of oxygen in the few seconds it had taken for Thomlock to run into the beam of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe structure, their ice castle, had returned to its dormant state. His radio was also silent once more, his breath the only sound inside his helmet. No trace of the show they had just witnessed, no scars on the surface, no residual light. Nothing. They searched the again and again, yet Thomlock was nowhere to be found. No trace of their old friend; no trace of his remains. Not even so much as a burned, cracked, empty helmet. Nothing. Nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing except the cold ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170421_ksp0107_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170421_ksp0107_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the distance a light blinked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a light in the cockpit of the Sulphur 5.

It was merely a computer, a messenger, a loyal servant. It never asked questions, it never asked why, it simply did. After several minutes it had recorded the simple message in its entirety.

If it disassembles you and places you together again in another place, did you really move or were you killed and replaced with an exact copy that took over your life? When you step in a transporter, do you appear at the other end or does your consciousness just end and die the moment you are dematerialized? Everyone else can see the same person, but are we all just procuring\u00A0a perfect doppelganger while killing the original? Can a consciousness be taken out and reinserted once the same atomic pattern has been assembled? Atoms are cycled through our bodies all the time, so it must not be the particular atoms that carry consciousness, but completely different ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s the issue of duplication. If your mind is scanned and a copy made, which does the chain of consciousness \u0022jump\u0022 to? I suspect the one that was scanned first, as that one will have more memories - I read on Wikipedia that there was an argument that a mind cannot be exactly duplicated, as the neurons will change as the mind is scanned. But then transportation is just equivalent to duplicating a mind then\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ekilling the original\u003C/em\u003E! Can the consciousness, the informational pattern / potential soul that carries your personality, realize that this body is earmarked for vaporization and jump to an identical one? Or a near identical one? If you allow both copies to live a while then dematerialize one, then can it take over the other body? Probably not, but there must be a brief delay between transportation and dematerialization. What if you are trapped in a body that everyone else assumes can be safely destroyed? You beg everyone not to kill you, but they will just think that the real thing is somewhere else and this is just a question/answer program babbling to them? But are people any more than question/answer programs? Consciousness is just a linked list of question/answer programs, so does it actually mean anything? Is everyone else just an empty shell that can\u0027t be self-aware of conscious at all?
