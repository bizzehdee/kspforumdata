Was told this is the place to show off screenshots...lol... and I\u0027ve got quite a few I would love to share. I\u0027ve been playing since 0.9, but started a new career when 1.0 was released, and I\u0027ve gotten way beyond anything I thought..... \n\n... but it all starts with a girl named Val T. Kerman, who wanted to go into space more than anything.\n\n![1sRqSDa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1sRqSDa.jpg)\n\nFrom the first day she was hired, Val was getting into trouble\n\n![Ivpk1wq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ivpk1wq.jpg)\n\nBut senior astronauts Jeb, Bob, \u0026 Bill knew she was something special, and she was soon promoted to gathering science on and around the space center.\n\n![xq0Mgzn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xq0Mgzn.jpg)\n\n![wz2aq2x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wz2aq2x.jpg)\n\nAnd after that she began taking tourists on sub-orbital trips. (This was before 1.0.4 came out)\n\n![fEOUVCS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fEOUVCS.jpg)\n\nHaving made a lot of money on tourists, the space center was able to fund manned missions to the Mun and Minmus\n\n![QteWUHk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QteWUHk.jpg)\n\n![aAh5KMf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/aAh5KMf.jpg)\n\nAnd launch large survey satellites\n\n![Zn8W8Kr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Zn8W8Kr.jpg)\n\nBut then came a contract for a large Mun base... which I will continue in a reply so this doesn\u0027t get too long.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nChapter 2: Munbase Tereshkova\n\nThe contract for the Munbase was huge, and many designs were considered before one of the biggest was chosen\n\n![XYkDBU5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XYkDBU5.jpg)\n\nBut how does one put a monster like this into orbit? Conventional rockets just turned into giant exploding bobble-heads. And the only thing that came close to working was a skycrane, originally intended for landing.\n\n![uURmebR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uURmebR.jpg)\n\nThen a junior engineer asked \u0022Why not just build a huge skycrane???\u0022\n\nAnd after many test launches, the Tarantula Skycrane system was born\n\n![EMwjfPa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EMwjfPa.jpg)\n\nAnd sunrise the next morning was launched\n\n![pqUGXgr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pqUGXgr.jpg)\n\n![FeKvq4E.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FeKvq4E.jpg)\n\n![zo6HebY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zo6HebY.jpg)\n\n![HHRVjIN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HHRVjIN.jpg)\n\n![467Y7og.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/467Y7og.jpg)\n\nThe biggest issue turned out not to be fuel, but overheating, and after 1.0.4 came out I had to add a bunch of radiators to keep it from exploding. But in the end, it got to the Mun in one piece, and landing was easier than I expected.\n\n![qOadYVM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qOadYVM.jpg)\n\n![CqvTT8w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CqvTT8w.jpg)\n\nthe problem came when I staged the last skycrane, and they went off course and exploded just a few feet over the base\n\n![kfqAQ61.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kfqAQ61.jpg)\n\n![TUZUWUJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TUZUWUJ.jpg)\n\nBut luckily they missed, and Munbase Tereshkova as brought online\n\n![SaOkiNP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SaOkiNP.jpg)\n\nTo be continued...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nChapter 3: Space Station Cristoforetti\n\nEncouraged by the success of the Munbase, the engineers began experimenting with different designs, including a potential seabase\n\n![snzwDTb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/snzwDTb.jpg)\n\nAnd they launched, Cristoforetti Station, our first heavy space station.\n\n![DkHsRFF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DkHsRFF.jpg)\n\nAnd began experimenting with different shuttle designs\n\n![8XJ7YgR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8XJ7YgR.jpg)\n\n![1mCuiyZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1mCuiyZ.jpg)\n\n![hYSrowm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hYSrowm.jpg)\n\n![iaKPH4N.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iaKPH4N.jpg)\n\nBut then 1.0.4 was released, and parts of my space stations started blowing up. But did my engineers quit? Absolutely NOT!!! They evacuated everyone off the station and launched Station Cristoforetti-B\n\n![OGdMm1g.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OGdMm1g.jpg)\n\n![MqxkBj0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MqxkBj0.jpg)\n\nTo be continued...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nChapter 4: Let There Be Landers\n\nSo after all the issues brought up by version 1.0.4 were resolved, the center landed a colony base on Minmus\n\n![xeb8m8Y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xeb8m8Y.jpg)\n\n![OEr8WWI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OEr8WWI.jpg)\n\nAnd the engineers began working on specialized landers for the Mun and Minmus. the first were the ore-miners, the workhorse of the fleet. These are meant to mine ore, process it into fuel, and re-fuel the space stations. Their success means never having to send up fuel from Kerbin again!\n\n![1mpz7uy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1mpz7uy.jpg)\n\n![NcCGpjk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NcCGpjk.jpg)\n\nAnd eventually a much larger version was designed, the Super-heavy ore-grinder, or SHOG\n\n![tQOaSPn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tQOaSPn.jpg)\n\nAfter that came tourist landers, meant to ferry tourists from a space station to the surface of the Mun or Minmus and back safely. Not the prettiest of my ships, but very easy to land and dock.\n\n![CrS4BGH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CrS4BGH.jpg)\n\nAnd finally the Advanced Science Lander, which found something amazing on it\u0027s maiden test flight\n\n![OZBtIUM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OZBtIUM.jpg)\n\nAnd wile all this is going on, Jeb, Bill, \u0026 Bob ran off to fetch a nearby class-A asteroid to play with\n\n![CxSegws.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CxSegws.jpg)\n\nBut now the space center is silent and deep in thought... we have just received contract offers to explore Duna \u0026 Ike\n\nTo be continued...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nChapter 5: Duna\n\nSo in one hectic day, the center launched a station bound for Ike, a colony base for Duna, and 2 survey platforms, lead by Val in a modified Oreship\n\n![VjdfGmL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VjdfGmL.jpg)\n\n![3N1pO3q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3N1pO3q.jpg)\n\n![qYjzxvq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qYjzxvq.jpg)\n\nLanding on Duna turned out to be much smoother than expected\n\n![zes7NFv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zes7NFv.jpg)\n\n![0JAXoGb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0JAXoGb.jpg)\n\n![rtSEP0t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rtSEP0t.jpg)\n\n![7r3DNrS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7r3DNrS.jpg)\n\n![M95GfeF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M95GfeF.jpg)\n\nBut while this was going on, Val discovered a weird, creepy black area while landing on Ike\n\n![gw4sPX7.png](http://i.imgur.com/gw4sPX7.png)\n\n![4WVOJZ3.png](http://i.imgur.com/4WVOJZ3.png)\n\n![kOBSbr8.png](http://i.imgur.com/kOBSbr8.png)\n\nVal named this area Kraken\u0027s Swamp, and planted a flag so our scientists can explore this further, and headed back to meet up with the space station\n\n![bd99Bsy.png](http://i.imgur.com/bd99Bsy.png)\n\nBut new orders have come in. The Worlds First Agency wants Val to return and land on Kerbin with that ship! This could get hairy... it\u0027s got 20 parachutes, but those were meant for Duna, not Kerbin. \n\nSo this is the end of my report for now. Will Val be able to land an Oreship on Kerbin and not turn into toast??? Will Jeb, Bill and Bob be able to turn an asteroid into a space telescope??? \n\nStay tuned... this saga is far, far from over.... ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T22:55:52Z","Content":"I really like your craft designs!

My lander designs were inspired by.... wait for it.....\n\nGodzilla vs. Monster Zero! 1965\n\nhehehe\n\nI\u0027m 52, and I still love old sci-fi and monster movies, and this was on a couple weeks ago, so I recorded it. And when I was watching that beautifully campy old-school rocket land on Planet-X, I thought to myself, you should build something like that in KSP. \n\nThe Oreship came first. I didn\u0027t know what to expect, except I didn\u0027t expect it to go this far. But it turned out to be a lovely ship to fly, and the widened base makes all of them very stable to land, even on shallow slopes. And the Mk1 inline cockpit IVA view makes them all super easy to dock.\n\n![HGCwppn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HGCwppn.jpg)\n\nSo thanks again for the nice comments...

She is now on course for her permanent assignment in orbit of the Sun.\n\nIn the meantime, the Langertrix Shuttle moved in to rescue the stranded capsule crew. The capsule had no liquid fuel, but did have a bit of RCS fuel left, so by carefully maneuvering the Langertrix over her, Jeb was able to use one last RCS thrust to attach the claw to the shuttle and transfer the crew safely, then return to Cristoferotti Station. And at the KSC, a VIP lander (complete with 4 VIP tourists) was dispatched to the station to take them back to Kerbin\n\n![FKc3WAL.png](http://i.imgur.com/FKc3WAL.png)\n\n![oVuiAZH.png](http://i.imgur.com/oVuiAZH.png)\n\n![hQzVO9P.png](http://i.imgur.com/hQzVO9P.png)\n\n![raqhdJG.png](http://i.imgur.com/raqhdJG.png)\n\n![qvKPQkS.png](http://i.imgur.com/qvKPQkS.png)\n\n![a2cUGbM.png](http://i.imgur.com/a2cUGbM.png)\n\n![sPK0yNe.png](http://i.imgur.com/sPK0yNe.png)\n\nAfter reviewing the data, our specialists tell us it was a near miracle Jeb and the crew were able to return with the asteroid. The capsule was terribly under powered and under fueled, and only Jeb\u0027s decision to not try and maneuver straight to Kerbin, but instead delicately tweak their orbit, wait a year and let themselves fall back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI naturally, gave them enough fuel to slow down into any sort of Kerbin orbit.\n\nBut all is well, Jeb, Bill, \u0026 Bob are back after a year.... time to re-group and plan our next move...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T22:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Just Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T02:42:18Z","Content":"Great stuff!
