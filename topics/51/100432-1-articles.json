I mean BIG. It took me whole day to get this beauty to orbit, part by part. Sometimes I even felt like I won\u0027t did it and I will give up. I am doing it in sandbox, but I have counted total funds needed and more statistical data...\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nNumber of launches: 6\n\nTotal starting weight: 3,110.858 tons\n\nOrbital assembled weight: 447.254 tons\n\nCost: 1,611,008 funds\n\n---------------------------\n\nBASE (Base)\n\n47,784 funds - 77.595 tons\n\nIn this module, Jebediah and Bill will spend few years and these modules are as comfortable as possible (which is not actually possible). It is smallest of all parts and it is connected to Main Engine and Tylo Lander.\n\n---------------------------\n\nLAYTHE LANDER (Laythe)\n\n121,896 funds - 192.198 tons\n\nIt has some chutes for landing, 4 jet engines with a little fuel, 2 rocket engines on sides and central fuel tank for these 2. It also includes some luxuries, such as ladder, solar panels and rcs.\n\n---------------------------\n\nTYLO LANDER (Tylo)\n\n156,056 funds - 307.085 tons\n\nI had some problems designing this. Most alerting fact is, that it has got just enough Delta V to get to surface from 20 km orbit and back. This will be close one...\n\n---------------------------\n\nTRIAL LANDER (Trial)\n\n97,292 funds - 180.260 tons\n\nAs very original name already says, this lander lands on 3 bodies. Yea, Bop, Pol and Vall. I might use it later after return for landing on Mun to make my mission even more... crazy?\n\n---------------------------\n\nMAIN ENGINE (Engine)\n\n1,031,836 funds - 2,058.340 tons\n\n7 Jumbo tanks, 14 nukes and still very slow acceleration.

I hope it isn\u0027t suspicious.\n\n---------------------------\n\nADDITIONAL FUEL (Fuel)\n\n156,144 fund - 295.380 tons\n\nBecause of different final design of main engine, I have sent this to compensate removed fuel.

The beauty of a screenshot album is that everyone can go through it at their own pace. I also find it harder to concentrate on a video, but that is just me.\n\nSecond, if your fps goes too low for a video recording, but you still want to make a video - record it anyway, speed up the footage and do a voiceover.\n\nAs to the design and flying, pretty straightforward and without many complications. I like how your ship looks, especially after bringing in the droptanks. I am not sure about your choice of simple jet engines for the Laythe lander - unless you need the takeoff thrust, turbojets are (imho) better (I am open for discussion).\n\n**2nd part - Transfer Burn**\n\nIf your craft tends to wobble, try controlling it from somewhere closer towards CoM - the SAS will register less wobbling and will not overcorrect as much.\n\nIs there any reason for multiple orbit boosts and circularizations? I mean whatever does the job, but it takes a big chunk of extra deltaV to transfer like this, and it also diminishes any gains from the Oberth effect. Just building your orbit at Pe is much more efficient.\n\nOther than that, I don\u0027t have any objections.\n\n**3rd part - Course corrections**\n\nIf you want to establish an orbit around Laythe first, it might be better to just go straight for Laythe from interplanetary space and aerobrake there. It might not always be possible, and if you play with DRE or something like that it would be a suicide... But with a bit of playing around with manuever nodes (and ignoring the G-forces), you can save some (in your case the ~600 m/s to raise Jool Pe and get Laythe encounter) deltaV. Not that it\u0027s terribly relevant, as you have tons of fuel left.\n\n**4th part - Laythe**\n\nCongrats on your first Laythe landing!\n\nI have a question regarding the orbit - why polar? Easier to pick a landing location? Is it worth the extra deltaV needed for inclination corrections before and after?\n\nThe reason why it was so hard is probably the simple jet engines. Looking at your lander, you would have had enough takeoff TWR with just two turbojet engines... Leave the four shock intakes on and you can ride those beauties all the way to space! They would probably have enough oomph to get your Ap all the way up to randezvous altitude just on liquid fuel, with circularization and randezvous taking less than 500 m/s rocket deltaV.\n\nAnyway, interesting approach and situation well handled.\n\n**5th part - Vall**\n\nWow... So much deltaV on that lander. Maybe even excessive (Vall shouldn\u0027t take more than 3k from low orbit), I think you could easily do with less. Nevertheless, very nice design and flying. You seem to fly without SAS a lot - do you use keyboard or a joystick?\n\n**6th part -** **The Destroyer of Landers** **Tylo**\n\nJudging from [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/MJ006Rd.png) picture, your Tylo lander stage must\u0027ve had over 6k deltaV and surface TWR of about 3.0 on it\u0027s own. That seems reasonable and landable enough to me - what went wrong with it? I can\u0027t figure it out from provided screenshots.\n\nI also think that using the Trial lander as ascent stage only would have provided you with more deltaV to work with (it would make the landing harder though).\n\n Also, why did you tug the empty Tylo lander stage all the way to the randezvous? You were leaving it behind anyway.\n\nLanding on Tylo (and living to tell the tale) is no joke though, so congrats, nice work.\n\nAlso, I think there\u0027s a mistake in the description of the third picture - either that or Vall has put on a few kilograms ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**7th part - Bop and Pol**\n\nThis part was pretty straightforward. You could\u0027ve probably saved some fuel by not filling the lander so much, but that\u0027s about it.\n\nI have one question though, as Bill doesn\u0027t know how to SAS, you gotta have a probe core on the Trial lander. I cannot seem to locate it just by looking at pictures/videos (and I\u0027m too lazy I don\u0027t have enough time to test your craft), mind helping me out?\n\n**8th part - Return**\n\nAgain, you could\u0027ve probably made a more efficient return burn by using Tylo or Jool for a slingshot, but with 3k3 m/s deltaV remaining... Who cares ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nI have no real questions or objections regarding the return.\n\n**TL;DR version:**\n\nI have reviewed this mission as part of the experimental peer review judging program and found **NO** traces of cheating or suspicious stuff. The report itself is well made and clear in most parts. I give it a **POSITIVE** review and nominate it for completing the Jool 5 challenge on **1st level** ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nik333","CreatedById":138436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T17:04:01Z","Content":"Deutherius:\n\nThank you for review.
