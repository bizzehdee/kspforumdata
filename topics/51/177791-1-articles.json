What you should do instead is fly what\u0027s called a gravity turn. This is where you gradually turn over during the launch, starting the turn at 100 m/s or so, and slowly leaning over during the rest of the launch, so that you reach horizontal just as you\u0027re reaching the highest point in your trajectory.

Third, you didn\u0027t give yourself any good sources of control authority with either your boosters or your first liquid stage - neither the Kickbacks nor the Reliant you used had any control authority. Either pick engines that do gimbal, add vernier thrusters (Twitch engines work decently well) for attitude control, or add some control surfaces.

One, it\u0027s somewhat inefficient - you generally want to have your stages smaller as you go. You should consider a more vacuum optimized engine like the LV-909 for the second stage. Two, things you should add for quality of life - fins on the first stage to aid in control, and struts so your boosters aren\u0027t flopping around so much. Third, for this sort of mission, even without modification, your launch vehicle looks pretty overpowered. You had half a tank of fuel left in orbit, more than that even. Extra margin is a good thing to have, but I\u0027m guessing that you could probably use that same rocket to put that same satellite in orbit of the Mun. If you fixed the ascent profile and optimized it a bit, it could probably put the satellite around Duna or Eve given a big enough antenna. If you want to shrink the vehicle to the point where it can just accomplish the mission, make the top stage an FL-T200 and an LV-909 and keep the first stage as is.
