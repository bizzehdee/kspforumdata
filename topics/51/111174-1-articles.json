I had not achieved orbit yet, just suborbital flights, and I wanted to achieve it this morning. I managed, using a two-stage liquid fuel rocket with the first stage engine being the \u0027Swivel\u0027, and the second stage engine being the \u0027Terrier.\u0027 I appointed Jeb as the pilot, firstly, because he is a true BadS, and second, because who else can you trust to be first in orbit? After a long, suspenseful, climb I made it to orbit, with fuel to spare. The Ap and Pe were there, and all was well. I started orbiting, doing some experiments and more on my Mercury II craft, the first one being the suborbital model. Then, as Pe was nearing and I was in full sunlight, I decided to make Jeb do an EVA, which would hopefully be like any other. That is where I was wrong. Very wrong. When he exited and let go, he accidentally hit the craft and sent it gyrating out of control. It wasn\u0027t too fast, nothing like the real life mission Gemini 8, but it was still bad. Activating the jetpack, I tried to get back, but did not manage, and soon, there was no more EVA propellant left. Thankfully, the Pe was higher than the re-entry point, so Jeb and Mercury II are in no danger. I have paused it now, being a little busy, but later on, I will heed some of the suggestions given to me and I will send an unmanned craft up with a module for Jeb to go in. With no RCS and everything, it will be difficult, but it can be done! I will make this a challenge later on. Stay tuned, updates will follow! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s Jeb, a little too calm..\n\n ![screenshot1.png](http://s8.postimg.org/elw594ntx/screenshot1.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:59:33Z","Content":"Haha, you have to love kerbal escapades. I had a similar problem orbiting the Mun, I had accidentally set the trim, so when I went EVA the craft started spinning really fast. Threw me off, I paused the game to figure out what was wrong, figured out how to kill the trim(I had a probe module on the craft as well), and managed to get Bob back, but it was pretty scary.\n\nBest of luck ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:20:09Z","Content":"Yes, you do!
