Not content to simply send my crew on EVA to dock with the station (and miss out on completing a science contract due to instruments on my capsule), I tried to think of other ways I could dock. I still had a decoupler. I aligned the docking ports using reaction wheels, and decoupled. After a short wait, the command pod and station docked.\u00A0Great success!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VelocityPolaris","CreatedById":101162,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-02T20:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost excellent use of equipment, mate, that\u0027s a pretty impressive feat!
