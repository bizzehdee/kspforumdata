It\u0027s time to solo! So now I\u0027m going to Mun in a ship of my own design. And no more just landing, planting a flag, and going home. No, this time I\u0027m taking a rover. After spending several days of unsatisfactory experimentation with different ways of attaching a separate rover to a lander and trying to solve the \u0022vertical-to-horizontal\u0022 problem, I noticed that some kind soul has graciously tweaked Damned Robotics to work in 0.20, so I decided to go with a roving lander with DR components. Rather ambitious for a noob like me but that\u0027s what happens when you give a bonobo (my main hobby is flint-knapping) control of a space program with unlimited funding \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I spent the next day tinkering with the roving lander design until I got something I liked. The basic concept is that the lander\u0027s main wheels are on rotating arms that are parallel with the fuel tank for flight and swing out for roving. The thing lands vertically on 4 legs as normal. Then, I swing the arms out and retract the legs on that side, causing the lander to fall over onto its wheels. Retract the other legs, adjust the angle of the arms for stability, and away I go. When I\u0027m ready to go home, I extend the top legs, then pivot the arms to angle the body up more than 45^, then extend the legs on the bottom to stand back up on all 4 feet. While roving, the lander is a 3-wheeler using a Firespitter Fighter Tailwheel at the rear. In fact, I put such a wheel top and bottom and the arms can rotate 360^, so the lander can roll with either side up and can flip itself from 1 side to the other if need be. Also has solar panels on both sides in case 1 side\u0027s break off in an accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander is controlled with a combination of all the stock plus the 10 custom action groups, the DR GUI, right-clicking on various parts, and the keyboard. The action groups are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Wheel brakes on (for parking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Retract/extend tailwheels. When retracted, acts as tailskid (additional parking brake, important when tipping the lander over).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

This was a bit tricky because I use Ferram Aerospace and that roving lander is hardly aerodynamic. So first thing I went to Fairing Factory, only to discover that 1) it can\u0027t make a fairing to fit around the lander and 2) even if it could, it doesn\u0027t seem to have been updated to 0.20 yet. Thus, nothing for it but to launch the thing naked and hope for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the nice things about Ferram Aerospace is that if you put nose cones on your side tanks, the delta-v requirement goes way down (provided you can satisfy the OTHER requirements, which can be difficult). Instead of the standard ~4500m/s to reach LKO, you only need ~3000m/s. So, it really wasn\u0027t that hard at first to build a working rocket, which I did yesterday afternoon. Directly under the lander was a long, narrow tank with an atomic rocket. To this I attached a single pair of the 3-section fat metal tanks, each with a Skipper beneath and a nosecone atop. With this configuration, I did a test launch to orbit and back down to make sure it would fly and the staging worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all that worked perfectly. But re-entry failed. See, up to that point, Ferram Aerospace had a problem with B9 Aerospace and the fix was to use a DLL from the Deadly Reentry mod. Rather than just pull out that DLL, I had installed the entire mod while dinking around with aircraft. But I hadn\u0027t done any rocketry with it, so now I discovered that the 1-man capsule tumbled totally uncontrollably. While the capsule didn\u0027t burn up, the parachute did so the thing fell like a stone and killed the test pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I had go to a meeting 100 miles away. When I got back, I started looking for how to use the Deadly Reentry DLL without installing the full mod, and discovered that Ferram Aerospace 0.9.5.11 had just come out and no longer needed Deadly Reentry at all. So I knocked Deadly Reentry out, put in the new FA version, and tried another test launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now my previously successful rocket was a total failure. All went well until I started trying to lean it over, at which point it would tumble uncontrollably. I tried all sorts of ascent profiles and adding more and more tailfins to no avail, so it was back to the drawing board. The README of FA says that long, tall rockets work better than short, fat ones so I redesigned the ascent stage with that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI eventually came up with this configuration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jIWgqGW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jIWgqGW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs before, the transfer stage is still a nuke with a single long tank. The ascent stage however, is 4 double stacks of long tanks with the vectoring engines under them. 8 tailfins in total, 1 on each booster and 4 on the nuke. Note the long asparagus fuel lines now required when trying to make your rocket as long as possible. Also note I forgot to turn the lander\u0027s wheels down before launch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. And actually, Bill is just the test pilot here, but given the high likelihood of failure I took his picture in case it was needed for his funeral. Jeb gets to do the actual mission because he never complains \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this thing can achieve LKO on the 4 side tanks, leaving the nuke tank full with WAY more delta-V than needed. However, all this fuel will let me tweak my Munar orbit in case I want to land in a particular place. Note, however, that it DOES NOT like to fly straight with that naked lander, so the ascent through the atmosphere is rather intense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now it was time to \u0022Locate Jebediah Kerman\u0022, stuff him in the can, and do it for real.

I aimed to come down in a big crater on the light side, which I\u0027d heard made for a decent place to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NkQJIsL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NkQJIsL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the de-orbit burn with the transfer stage, then dumped it. It still had like 3/4 fuel. Later, I would discover I needed that fuel in the lander. So, back to the drawing board there. It would work on Minmus as-is, but for Mun weight needs to be shifted upstairs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it happened, I did come down on the light side but behind the crest of a hill, so it was pretty dark. Still, all nice and safe, although only 1/2 a tank of lander fuel left after burning during landing. BTW, the \u0022ASAS hill trick\u0022 I used on Minmus doesn\u0027t work on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pcMIPE6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pcMIPE6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I swung out the arms, retracted the bottom pair of legs, and toppled over just as intended onto the wheels. But then I extended the tailwheel so it would roll, and this had enough force to toss the whole vehicle up into the air and it came down on its side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/azO3yXI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022azO3yXI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, I\u0027d planned for this sort of thing with all the action groups for the legs so with them, swinging the arms around, and using the roll, pitch, and yaw keys, I managed to work the thing upright. And nothing broke off in all this, so I was pretty happy. So then off I went across the surface heading for the sun, with the intention of just crossing the ridgeline so I could get a better view of the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DelJmgr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DelJmgr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as I kept the speed at 10m/s or less, I had absolutely no problems controlling, staying upright, and controlling direction. However, between me and the highest ridgeline on the horizon was a smaller ridge I didn\u0027t see coming. When I went over the top of it and started down the other side, my speed shot up and before I could slow down I flipped over, breaking off the top solar panel. And with no real prospect of ever getting to sunlit terrain, I decided I was in a good enough place for Jeb to plant the flag. So, with some more squirming around with the arms and legs, I managed to get the thing rightside up again so the ladder would work (I suck at EVA and didn\u0027t feel up to using it to get back in the inverted hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xtkfLBE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xtkfLBE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so now to get off this rock. I debated staying on the ground or going to orbit, but I figured I had a better chance of getting close enough for a rescue in orbit than on the ground, so opted for that. I was unable to get completely back up on all 4 legs--it kept flipping over backwards--so I did the aforementioned back-up takeoff method from the \u0022howitzer position\u0022. And I couldn\u0027t even get that as vertical as on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vmyCwuj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vmyCwuj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe takeoff was pretty hairy and I almost crashed, but I managed to get up and into orbit.

So, I needed 1) to learn how to refuel with KAS, 2) learn how to rendezvous, and 3) learn how to fly in EVA, all while designing a refueling ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 1st thing was the winch so I created a couple of rovers and walked back and forth between them with the winch cable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bwhpyms.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bwhpyms.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this operation, I learned several important things. Most importantly, the dismountable port can\u0027t be attached to the connector on the end of the cable like the hooks and magnet. So, this means 2 round trips, 1 to take the port and stick it on Jeb\u0027s ship, then go back and get the cable over to the port. OK, I think I got that, so now to try it in space, along with rendezvous and EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this had all be going on, the boffins had been working hard and unveiled the newest creations from KW Rocketry. Not only did this include the fairings I\u0027d ordered but also a collection of cool new tanks and engines. So I slapped the spare roving lander atop a KW SSTO lower stage, and shot it into the best approximation I could make at Kerbin of Jeb\u0027s Munar orbit. The fairing REALLY helped launching the roving lander in the FAR atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lNxvKYm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lNxvKYm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I built a refueler, also using KW parts. The actual refueling vehicle is a 3-man capsule with 1 seat emptied via Crew Manifest. This covers Plan B. And I\u0027ve got a spare Kerbal aboard in case the 1st EVA goes horribly wrong, so that\u0027s Plan A.5 I guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E. Anyway, the stock 1440 tank with a nuke under it, balanced RCS about this stage\u0027s CG, and finally and the winch on top with 2 ports (in case I fumble one accidentally), all within reach from the hatch. All this sitting atop a big pile of KW parts that\u0027s considerably overkill on the delta-v, but I don\u0027t want to have to send another rescue mission after this tanker \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fhKUHvJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fhKUHvJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4RpR6Di.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224RpR6Di.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: This isn\u0027t the original configuration of the winch, but the final version. Originally, the winch sat flat on the top of the capsule, and thereby hangs a sad tale. See, I got this thing into HKO to simulate coming down to Jeb, manually matched up orbits with the target lander, used MechJeb to synchronize the rendezvous to 100m, managed to RCS my way within 15m, grabbed one of the ports and set off for my 1st EVA flight. After flailing around hopeless for a long time learning to fly, so long that we passed into Kerbin\u0027s shadow, which made everything much worse, and using 25% of the jetpack fuel, I finally got the port on the target. And the game instantly crashed. So I restarted from an autosave only now I knew better how to fly EVA so got the port on and went back to the tanker for the cable. And there wasn\u0027t any connector on the winch!?!?!?! Did I drop it somehow? AARRGGHH!!! I KNOW I put it on there in the VAB, having to rotate it around to make it stick. Anyway, nothing for it but to deorbit and fix the vehicle. So I go to the VAB, take the nosecone off to see the winch better, and I see this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OXZA16i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OXZA16i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently when I thought it had stuck, it had actually just dropped in the air behind the ship. It\u0027s rather difficult to tell when you do it right because the green balls totally hide the part and by now the rocket\u0027s CG was down near the bottom a long way away. So I fixed this and this time decided to test it on the ground and even though there was now a connector, the winch wouldn\u0027t work, for several different reasons, each of which had to be discovered individually. Glad I was doing this on the ground \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I finally had to put the winch atop the circular girders to make it work. But I couldn\u0027t test actually moving the cable anywhere because before a Kerbal can grab it, it has to be released. And with the tanker on the pad, releasing the cable makes it fall all the way through the length of the ship and even through the grating below, totally out of reach. Still, everything finally appeared functional so I decided to test it in space by itself before giving the rendezvous part another go. And yup, it worked there, too, because there cable doesn\u0027t fall when you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SWJCOYv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SWJCOYv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now I\u0027m set to give Plan A a final test before taking the show on the road to rescue Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** TO BE CONTINUED ***\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T21:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPART 5: Saving Private Jebediah\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a successful refueling test in Kerbin orbit--er, um, well, PARTIALLY successful. The whole KAS thing finally worked as intended and the target lander got refueled. However, I deorbited both it and the tanker what I thought was far enough apart in time that I could switch back and forth, with the idea of taking a cool pic with both of their parachutes as they came down on the island in the big crater bay. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t switch fast enough so while Bill and Bob came down fine in the tanker, Doodle plummeted to this death in the lander. This put the kibosh on the press conference and photo op planned for the occasion, especially because Doodle\u0027s widow hadn\u0027t packed a black dress for the trip out to the crater.

I did that part, then let MechJeb2 set up the synchronization and get within 100m, after which I RCS\u0027d my way into 15m at 0 relative speed and waited for the sun to come up before sending the redshirt out to face horrible death aka EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is where Redshirt Bob bungled the job. Always before in practice, he\u0027d jumped out the hatch as soon as the ships were close so did so out of habit and grabbed one of the ports outside the hatch. He was just about to shove off for Jeb\u0027s ship when Bill told him to wait a few minutes, so he went back inside with the dismountable port still on his back. When the sun rose, he jumped out again and the 1st port was gone, so was glad the KSP boffins had thought to provide 2 of them. So he grabbed the 2nd port and jetting over to Jeb\u0027s ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r9LNKpz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r9LNKpz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd he managed to get there without kicking it spinning all over, which he\u0027d done several times in practice.

He did so, noticing it had drifted about 150m away, but he\u0027s gotten good at EVA flying with all the practice so this wasn\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Plan A in a shambles, it was time to try Plan B, having Jeb abandon ship. So Bill nudged the tanker back to 15m from Jeb and off he went.

Both right-click and normally do the job but once the 2nd port was on Bob\u0027s back, it was totally dead, even unable to be dropped. I\u0027m assuming was this because he ended his 1st EVA with the 1st port on his back. Very annoying.

I\u0027ve noticed the reported times in the End Flight report get thrown off if you do an EVA in the middle. Also, switching from Kerbal to ship tends to make the EVA-ing Kerbal let go of any ladder he was holding at the time of the switch. Like when in practice I got the cable connected, I had Bob hanging onto the target ship. But when I switched to the docked ships to transfer the fuel, Bob came loose and was adrift about centered between the ships during the transfer. This was highly annoying because he\u0027d kicked the target into a wild gyration when he put the port on it, so catching it was a major pain, and he had to catch it again to disconnect the cable from the port when the transfer was done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I keep telling myself it\u0027s just an alpha game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T00:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of the \u0022transformable\u0022 lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T03:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pipcard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pipcard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like the idea of the \u0022transformable\u0022 lander.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027s been done long before now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m not too happy with this design.
