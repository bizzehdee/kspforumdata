In the recent years, there has been tremendous push for crewed missions beyond \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Several architectures have been designed for our return to Mun and Minmus, and Duna-Ike exploration. Some are practical, some are in the realms of fantasy. But all of them suffer from one major roadblock: Cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHERAKLES aims to overcome this constraint through reusability and increased reliability, as opposed to competing mission architectures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EWhat is HERAKLES?\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHERAKLES is a multipurpose reusable space vehicle concept which can be used for regular payload delivery to and from the surface of Mun and Minmus. It started out as a study to develop reusable upper stages to deliver payloads to GTO and Trans Munar Orbits but soon evolved into a complete Kerbin system exploration package. It has the potential to land a significant payload to the Mun\u0027s surface and return back to Low-Kerbin Orbit for refueling and inspections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EWhy is it necessary?\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the recent advent of reusable 2 stage boosters to launch payloads to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, it started making less sense for the upper stages to be expendable. Reusablity coupled with rapid turnaround and Munar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E would dramatically reduce expenditure for missions beyond \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. On validation of the Herakles Upper Stage in Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, this has the potential to become the space transportation vehicle of choice for Duna exploration and within the Jool system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith much more flexibility and less complexities involved as opposed to competing designs, HERAKLES promises a safe, reliable and cost-effective alternative to the present trend of space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n******\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was.. alright, I suppose.\u0022 Mortimer took off his glasses. \u0022But do you think it\u0027s enough to fire everyone\u0027s imagination? I mean, most folks out there who would rather support researching and utilizing\u00A0 \u0027Reliable and proven\u0027 technology. How you gonna convince them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s the exact reason I have used \u0027reusable\u0027 and \u0027reusability\u0027 5 times in this little presentation.\u0022 Linus replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have got your priorities right! Your proposal is accepted!\u0022 With the sound of the gravel and chuckles all around the auditorium, the HERAKLES was formally adapted by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as one of the competing architecture for Duna exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
