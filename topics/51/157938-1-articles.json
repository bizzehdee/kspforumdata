The room became silent as vacuum, and then he spoke, \u0022As you know, 36 Years Ago, in December 2020, we launched the Etna space probe at the Stellar System of Trappist-1. Today, the Etna Probe reached its destination, Trappist-1-d, successfully in an orbit of 4,350,000 at its periapsis, and 14,250,000 at its apoapsis. We\u0027re also proud to announce,\u0022 He cleared his throat, clearly nervous about the news he was about to report, yet he grinned, \u0022that we have discovered radio transmissions, two space stations, and various satellites in orbit of the Planet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore any journalist could ask him a question, he walked out of the room, along with anyone with the answers they wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbit around Trappist-1-d\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002219b5af9791c1fc0e0751e81a64566fdd.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.gyazo.com/19b5af9791c1fc0e0751e81a64566fdd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EPicture of Etna, back at Earth.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Why did I have to be sent alone?
