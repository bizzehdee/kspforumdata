It took several sols for the orbits to align in such a way that we would have a constant uplink from \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E all the way down to landing. \u003Cem\u003EG-Seven\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s primary mission would be to rove from wherever it landed in the southern hemisphere of Mars (and we held no illusions about our ability to land it anywhere near a pre-selected target) to the southern polar ice cap, inspecting the different geological formations and terrain on the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe landing would also have to take place on the day side of the planet.

And if all the conditions were met except for Angun\u0027s, well that meant I would just have to fake a failure in our relay equipment or command station in order to scrub the landing and wait for things to line up correctly. As the lottery of orbital mechanics would have it, this happened twice and the second scrubbed descent earned me a message from API Bartdon back at Mission Control screaming \u003Cem\u003E\u201CDamn and blast, boy.

Before Bartdon had a chance to put his threat of suspending my pay into action, Angun gave me a green light and we were good to go. Now, all that remained was for Jonnie to stick our first landing on the Red Planet, and if anyone could do it, he could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter the de-orbit burn at apareion, \u003Cem\u003EG-Seven \u003C/em\u003Ecame screaming through the thin atmosphere like greased lightning; an atmosphere that alarmingly failed to slow down the rover, still encapsulated in its fairing and attached to its spent transfer stage. Things started going wrong immediately. The airbrakes designed to pull the vessel into an attitude where the lander\u0027s retro-thrusters would face the ground utterly failed to do so, and so \u003Cem\u003EG-Seven\u003C/em\u003E plunged transfer stage first towards the Martian surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZYets6K.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZYets6K.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen Jonnie finally popped the fairing at fifteen thousand metres from the ground, I breathed a momentary sigh of relief as the ship finally flipped round and pointed the right way. This renewed optimism was short-lived, however, as when Jonnie ditched the transfer stage and activated the drogue chutes, red lights popped up on the console telling us that something else was wrong and chutes weren\u0027t gonna happen.

We\u0027d touched down somewhere in a region of Martian highlands called Terra Sirenum, at just over 64\u00B0 South.

At least now we knew what to expect for our two other landings. I drove away from the lander for a few hundred metres, but the light was fading rapidly and so we decided to halt for the night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QR0a73h.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QR0a73h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOver the course of the next few days, our rover headed south towards the smaller of the planet\u0027s two ice caps. Froemone had been eager to find out if there was water ice there, as well as frozen carbon dioxide, or anything else that could potentially be made into fuel. He needn\u0027t have worried, as G-Seven\u0027s sensors detected plenty of H20 locked up in the first few metres of Martian soil, even at this latitude. The atmosphere was full of CO2. Refueling here would be just a matter of having a decent power source, and we should be able to make hydrolox or methalox fuels for a shuttle vehicle to bring us to and from orbit. The far greater challenge would be mastering Mars\u0027 slippery atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhile \u003Cem\u003EG-Seven\u003C/em\u003E kept on trucking, the stars aligned for \u003Cem\u003EG-Eight \u003C/em\u003Eto come hurtling down for a landing close to the equator. With the experience from his first attempt, Jonnie managed to keep her upright and \u003Cem\u003EG-Eight \u003C/em\u003Edropped sprightly onto the surface just after local sunset. We shut the rover down and would move it later, as Angun was determined to see \u003Cem\u003EG-Seven\u003C/em\u003E reach the terrain anomaly before our ship \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E caught up with Phobos and we put our roving on hold until we had returned from its surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zCbmlAh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zCbmlAh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd finally this morning, after two hundred kilometres of driving across endless red sand dunes, an unusual shape appeared above the horizon, clearly visible through the hull-cam.

I had seen the encrypted image emitted by Angun\u0027s Monument, but despite being prepared for what I saw, the close-up view of an almost perfectly triangular mountain on the surface of another world was ominously creepy and I squirmed in my seat as I operated the rover\u0027s controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was just like the rock arch that Margaret had discovered on the Moon.

No opening was visible, and the Pyramid\u0027s sides blended perfectly into the rest of Mars\u0027 surface, covered in the same red dust.

Jonnie and I have spent hours running our little ship through its extensive check-list. I must admit that from a technical point of view I\u0027m now feeling much better about this whole landing-on-Phobos thing than when I first clapped eyes on \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E during ground testing back at Omelek. She is a much lighter vessel than the one that got us down to Luna but couldn\u0027t get us back up, and will probably handle the low gravity just fine.

I was informed by some scientist back at Mission Control that the gravity will be so low that I won\u0027t notice the difference from zero-gee. It\u0027s funny how these people are so sure of themselves, as if they\u0027ve been out here themselves already to try it when they assert this sort of thing oh-so confidently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNot that anyone will feel like sleeping. We\u0027ll be hopping across the surface several times if all goes well, spending most of our time on EVA plundering samples and data from as many places as possible in a frenetic forty-eight hour scientific binge. We intend to try and determine the true nature of Mars\u0027 moons and where they came from, a matter that is that is, as of yet, unclear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou see, for a long time it had been thought that Phobos was a captured asteroid. But despite the fact that from a distance it looks quite like a bog-standard main-belt body that was captured into orbit around the Red Planet at some point, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, gravitational data from our \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E probe had shown us that the interior of Phobos was highly porous. The moon was perhaps even a rubble pile, with significant voids that may or may not be filled with ice. Secondly, Phobos, like Mars\u0027 second moon Deimos, orbited its parent body in a rather neat, circular orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen presented with the problem a couple of years ago, Steledith had scoffed at the idea of a rubble pile being captured into a perfectly circular orbit by atmospheric drag without completely breaking up. When pressed to offer a hypothesis of her own, she had simply told us in one of her characteristically vague strokes of genius \u201CWell, it\u0027s obviously left over from an impactor that grazed the parent body and blasted material into orbit where it later accreted. All you have to do to be sure is find out if it\u0027s made from the same stuff or not. A bit like what we did with Luna. Do want me to see if I have a sample? Which planet were you talking about, again..?\u201D before wandering off to stare into the sky at something only she could see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs well as finding out where Phobos had come from, Froemone had rather predictably requested we look for the water, if it was there hiding between the gaps in the rubble pile. He reckoned our best chance of finding it was drilling a deep hole at one of the moon\u0027s poles. I remember staring at my colleague intently as he explained to me that his best estimate for the average depth of ice at high latitude was twenty metres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSo you want us to dig a deep well into the regolith of Phobos..?\u201D I\u0027d wanted to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CUhm... yes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C...wearing spacesuits and working in half a milli-gee...?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, uhm...yes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C...to a depth of twenty metres?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWell, thanks for your input, Froe.

Besides, someone has to stay and make sure that the moon\u0027s puny gravity doesn\u0027t lose hold of our mothership.

Get the camera rolling please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun despised pomp and ceremony with a passion, and I must say I shared his feelings on this matter, but he knew how valuable the symbolic image of our landing here would be to keeping the money for our venture rolling in. So, as Jonnie checked that \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E was still in good health and we prepared to depressurise our capsule for what would be the first time of many during our stay, I fired up our camera and grabbed the tripod, ready to capture our first steps on a distant world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOur Principal Investigator was the first to squeeze through the little hatch and grab onto the ladder, and then I pushed my upper body out to film him from above as he pulled himself down, rung by rung, until he was almost touching the surface. He looked back up at me and into the lens of the camera, although his face was barely visible through his faceplate. As I peered through the viewfinder, I couldn\u0027t help but notice that there was a thin coat of dust already settling all over our ship, our suits, and everything else in the vicinity. We had encountered such dust-clouds after lunar landings, but here they apparently took much longer to dissipate in the negligible gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vxqwnSg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vxqwnSg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun dropped off the lander onto the surface, turned, and took a first tentative step. Despite his best effort to make it a small one, he managed to float several metres into the air and landed some distance from our ship. He engaged his KMU, and succeeded in controlling his drift across the surface. So much for the first step on Phobos, we would have to use our jet packs if we wanted to get anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222qB9xyZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2qB9xyZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI followed him down onto the surface to set up the tripod, with Jonnie just behind me. Together we stood in front of the flag that Angun had planted, trying to look like brave, solemn space explorers whilst our head scientist gave a short speech about how important it was to all our kind for us to reach out and explore new horizons. I wasn\u0027t really listening, as I was glancing over at the hilarious sight of Jonnie trying to appear solemn. Remind me to put in a request for a totally opaque faceplate for our next crewed mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uwkHSOh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uwkHSOh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter a mercifully short monologue, Angun was done and turned to us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CKill the camera. Let\u0027s get to work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun began his sample collection, I busied myself with setting up the surface penetrating radar we had brought with us to take up Froemone\u0027s quest for finding water ice without resorting to digging deep wells into the surface. We immediately realised that it would have been impossible to dig, drill or otherwise burrow into Phobos\u0027 surface anyway. Trying to work manually in such low gravity would have been a non starter; those of you who have ever tried to tighten a nut, hammer a sample from a rock or push anything in space will surely agree. The Third Law of Motion, always glancing over the shoulder of any Kerbonaut with its unblinking, merciless gaze, will just shrug and say \u201Cnope.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTo make matters worse, the top layer of fine, powdery regolith on the moon\u0027s surface was estimated to be several - perhaps many - metres thick. It would take some pretty heavy-duty equipment to get through that, and parking something like our \u003Cem\u003EPadirac\u003C/em\u003E rover down here wasn\u0027t going to happen anytime soon. Angun was having trouble finding anything to put his hammer to in the first place. There were quite a few small pebbles and small rocks scattered around, but he had to float some distance away to find anything bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOur first three-hour EVA was over in a flash and we boarded \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E to stow our samples and equipment, and beam up the first results to \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E. Margaret would then send the data on to Earth using our mothership\u0027s powerful hi-gain dish, allowing us a better bandwidth than if we\u0027d used \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s own folding long-range antenna. And if we didn\u0027t make it back for some reason, at least part of our data would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs soon as the capsule was pressurised again, Jonnie powered up the tiny thrusters and took us up on a short hop to a site to the North-East of Stickney, about half way to Drunlo crater. I tried to relax and settle back to gaze through my view-port, sneezing out regolith for most of the short journey. This damned dust was so irritating. The next stop, Angun assured me, would be a short one. We would stay put, while he visited a specific boulder that had been spotted from orbit. All he needed to do was to chip off a sample, and we would be on our way again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u0027s so special about this rock?\u201D I wondered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAngun was smiling again, but enigmatically this time. \u201CMaybe nothing,\u201D he replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe consistent inability of Phobos to drag us back down to its surface without taking ages to do so played havoc with our schedule, and landing took longer than expected. Jonnie actually had to thrust towards the ground a little to bring us down where we wanted before the terminator plunged our target into darkness. With the cabin depressurised and my helmet on once more, I watched from the capsule as Angun made his way back down the ladder once again, and started floating down a steep slope into the darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZcjMe3o.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZcjMe3o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere is no twilight on an airless world, and as a consequence, he was in pitch black shadow once he\u0027d gone just a few metres from \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E. His suit light flicked on and cut a swathe through the inky vacuum, allowing me to follow his progress until he disappeared over a small ridge. \u003Cem\u003EDamn you, Angun,\u003C/em\u003E I muttered to myself. His radio link cut off immediately, and there was no way for us to reach him or for him to talk back to us. Going against the most basic of our EVA regulations, Angun had crept away into the darkness on a solo jaunt. \u003Cem\u003EDon\u0027t make me come looking for you. Perhaps I shouldn\u0027t anyway... Maybe she is right. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221fgcdy9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1fgcdy9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMinutes passed as if they were hours and even Jonnie who was sitting a few feet below me in his tiny cockpit began to get jumpy. Through my headset I could hear him drumming his gloved fingers against the instrument panel and muttering \u003Cem\u003Ec\u0027mon buddy\u003C/em\u003E in a low voice to no-one in particular. I waited, peering out through the capsule\u0027s hatch into the gloom for any sign of our scientist, with Margaret\u0027s words ringing in my head. \u003Cem\u003EI hope you like eating fish, deep in the safety of your caves, Cam...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a beam of light reappearing from behind the ridge and moments later, Angun climbing up the ladder with a particularly bulky sample bag attached to his belt. As soon as he was inside and the hatch closed he requested Jonnie to take off and head for the next site. Meanwhile, he was already stowing his newly obtained samples in the locker under his own seat. But not before I caught a glimpse of the contents through the transparent heavy-duty plastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe exposed part of the rock was almost black and space-weathered, just like everything on the surface of Phobos. But the fresh surface beneath, where Angun\u0027s hammer had broken a sizeable chunk away from the boulder, was as red as rust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIs that what I think it is?\u201D I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, let\u0027s put it this way,\u201D said Angun with his characteristic evasiveness, \u201CSteledith\u0027s hypothesis on the origin of Martian moons may just have gained significant weight within the scientific community.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOur next stop was on the edge of one of the many deep grooves that criss-crossed the terrain of Phobos, cutting indifferently through ridges, mounds and craters. The one we planned to examine was near the moon\u0027s south pole and was about a hundred metres across for a depth of thirty metres. It was just one in a group of similar features that stretched for several kilometres along the surface and, when viewed from a distance, suggested that a team of space-faring giants had once stopped off here to perfect their bowling skills, leaving perfectly parallel gashes cutting deep into the regolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTo our Investigation Team\u0027s disappointment, none of the giant boulders they might have used to make these grooves could be spotted, which discredited the space-faring giant theory, but Froemone suggested we might find ice (if it was there, indeed) closer to the surface if we scanned the bottom of one of the grooves situated at a relatively high latitude where the sun\u0027s rays were less harsh. After taking turns to rest in the cramped space of the ridiculously small crew quarters, we ploughed through the dust for another four hours with the ground penetrating radar and gathered more samples. This would be our last halt on the sub-Mars hemisphere, so I boarded the capsule last and paused to gaze up at the Red Planet looming ominously above the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dW6Y9pX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dW6Y9pX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe Kerbals are not often bothered about confined spaces, most of us having grown up many fathoms beneath the surface of our planet, but I was starting to feel uneasy after 24 hours in this tiny tin can. But there was one last place for us to go to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E probe, our first envoy to Phobos, had stopped talking back to us just a few hours after landing. This had been more than three years ago, and we wanted to try and find her. I had requested this short extension to our mission, as I was interested in witnessing the effects of nearly four years in deep space on one of our craft with my own eyes. Or maybe I was just sentimental, and felt guilty for strapping something I had designed onto a pile of explosives the size of a tall building, and blasting it into deep space, never to return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou know, these probes we build do all the \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E crazy, dangerous things that we would never consider attempting with a crewed mission, and we gave them no choice in the matter. For once, I had a chance to pay my respects to one of our true gonzo explorers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJonnie fired our thrusters once more and took us back round the anti-Mars side, back to the ridge named Kepler Dorsum where \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E had come to rest. Although it had been impossible to spot our probe from \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s high orbit, Jonnie identified it easily from more than a thousand metres away, the foil-wrapped fuel tank of the probe standing out brightly against Phobos\u0027 dark background. We drifted down to the surface one last time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ic3Ufe1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ic3Ufe1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAs quick as you like, SE,\u201D said Angun, who was obviously not convinced by the scientific value of this final stop. But seeing the venomous look I shot at him as I put on my helmet, he did not insist. \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s cabin was depressurised once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E remained upright and intact, but her deployable long-range dish had folded shut, which suggested some sort of power failure. I floated over to inspect our old probe more closely and noticed a very fine layer of dust covering the hull, fuel tank and solar panels. In a futile gesture, I brushed some of the fine powder from the solar arrays and the avionics bay, but \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E was long dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ydqQ7ud.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ydqQ7ud.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI pulled my power tool from my belt, selected the right socket, and bracing myself on the fuel tank, unscrewed the green navigation light we superstitiously fitted to all our probes to guide them through the eternal nights of the great black desert. I whispered \u201CGoodnight, \u003Cem\u003EEscamps\u003C/em\u003E. Well done.\u201D And, taking the light with me, made my way to our lander without looking back, and came there never again as a living Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E took to space once more to rendez-vous with \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E, I reclined in my jump-seat and gazed out of the window, watching Mars rise above the horizon. I rubbed a grubby sleeve across my filthy face, blackened by dust from Phobos, some of which probably came from the Red Planet. I was too tired to care. Saying goodbye to my space probe had been such a profound moment. We would catch up with them, eventually. All of them. It might take a few lifetimes, but we could follow them out there into the void. I felt elated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThen my gaze caught something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJust above the limb of Mars, a glint of sunlight reflecting off... something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tFoAaTV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tFoAaTV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI squinted for a moment, trying to estimate its size and distance, which was always a difficult thing to do in space.

It was definitely not that far away, and it was not \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E, as our mothership should be in a totally different area of the sky. Maybe it was Deimos?

Earth has one Moon, Jupiter has four (large Galilean) moons, so astronomers believed it was logical that Mars should have 2. (See \u003Cem\u003EGulliver\u0027s Travels\u003C/em\u003E, or Voltaire\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EMicrom\u00E9gas\u003C/em\u003E...\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Deimos, then Phobos were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall working at the Naval Observatory in Washington DC. They were difficult to observe (particularly Phobos) due to their proximity to Mars and the glare from their parent body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Phobos orbits Mars in 7h39min (well below stationary orbit), Deimos in 30h (well above). Both orbits are equatorial (unlike in KSP RSS) and nearly circular. This means that Phobos is in a decaying orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-In 1945, Bevan Sharpless calculated the orbital decay rate of Phobos at 5cm/year, based on a number of observations. This would put impact with Mars in 100 million years. A Ukranian astronomer Iosef Shklovsky (mistakenly discounting tidal friction) suggested that the only possible explanation for Phobos\u0027 decay was atmospheric drag and therefore the moon must be very light and hollow. \u0022We are led to the possibility that Phobos (and possibly Deimos) may be artificial.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Given the present orbit of Phobos, it can\u0027t have been there for more than 500 - 1,000 million years (much shorter than the age of the solar system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEXPLORATION\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-There has been no successful mission dedicated to the Martian moons, although many of the probes sent to Mars have made opportunistic observations of Phobos and Deimos. These observations allowed the main surface features to be mapped: in particular Stickney crater and the grooves on Phobos. The origin of the grooves is still debated. They may be deep (fracturing due to tidal forces), as Phobos is already within its Roche limit. They may be superficial and have been caused by impacts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The Soviet probes Phobos 1/2 and Phobos Grunt were all failures, although Phobos 2 did make it close to Phobos and return pictures before contact was lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has sent very good images of the moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EORIGIN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhobos and Deimos could be 1) Captured Asteroids 2) Remnants of Mars\u0027 formation 3) Re-accreted impact ejecta (like our Moon). Are Phobos and Deimos even related?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery low bulk densities. Phobos: 1.88 Deimos 1.47\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery porous (up to 55% for Deimos). These voids may or may not be full of water ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhobos and Deimos look very different and have different cohesion (Phobos is still intact despite being inside Roche limit, it has craters, grooves, etc... Deimos has a much smoother surface, no craters or grooves, could be a rubble pile). Could water be a cement for these moons?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are very dark (low Albedo). Colour ratio images show that Phobos is made up of two units, a redder one and a bluer one. Deimos is all red. The spectrum of Deimos is similar to a D-Type asteroid. (These asteroids are found in the outer part of the main belt, and contain a lot of water). Phobos\u0027 redder unit has a D-Type spectrum as well, and is similar to Deimos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the bluer unit of Phobos the true native material, and red material is being transported from Deimos to cover part of Phobos\u0027 surface, via dust transfer? A case of \u0022Spectral Tampering\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blue unit on Phobos is limited to the rim of Stickney crater, where the red unit has been blasted away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis spectral data only pertains to the top few microns of the regolith. We need more information about the composition of the moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... what are they?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Captured Type-D asteroids? (PROS: D-Type spectra, low density. CONS: We can\u0027t explain the capture process. The blue unit of Phobos is not D-Type)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Remnants of Mars\u0027 formation? (PROS: Circular Orbits, Low density, CONS: Phobos should no longer be there, decaying orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Reaccreted impact ejecta? (PROS: no water in spectra, Phobos blue unit. CONS: Decaying orbit. When did this happen?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of these hypothesis should be favoured or discounted with our present knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom line is that there are plenty of things to discover by going to Mars, even if we don\u0027t land there. If the moons are captured type-Ds, this gives us easy access to an outer solar system body. If they are remnants of Mars\u0027 formation then there are things yet to be learned about the process of planetary formation.

We were still moving slowly in relation to the creature and it was about to drift past beneath us. Jonnie kept rotating the capsule so that we could track it, but it was getting harder to make out against the dark backdrop of the night side of Phobos. I struggled to catch it in the viewfinder. Then, after passing just a few metres from \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E, it began to drift away into the glare of the distant sun. After a futile attempt to shoot some footage that almost left me blind, I gave up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OP5nxib.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OP5nxib.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COpen the dish, SE.

This was unusual, as Earth would usually talk to \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E via \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s dish, the signal relayed by our short range omni-directional antenna.

Since Jonnie had realigned our ship once more, I couldn\u0027t even watch as the strange creature faded out of view behind us. The final proof of alien life in the universe, returning to oblivion once more less than five minutes after it was discovered in the face of some new crisis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mKDxSrl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mKDxSrl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E was clearly visible ahead however, having risen above the horizon of Phobos just a few minutes previously. Getting there fast with our present fuel budget meant a thirty metres per second burn that would allow us to rendez-vous in twenty minutes. Twenty endless minutes that Angun spent near the view-port, glaring angrily out towards mothership, as if his eyes were tractor-beams that could reach out and pull it towards us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI spent those awful twenty minutes trying to imagine what had gone wrong on \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E or, to be more precise, trying to think what Angun imagined had gone wrong. What were our options if something had happened to the only ship within 100 million kilometres that was remotely capable of taking us home to Earth? We had, like, four days of life support at most on \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E. Perhaps a week if there were volunteers amongst us to take a permanent walk in space... \u003Cem\u003ECome on, Cam. You\u0027re freaking out. It\u0027s just a blown fuse in the antenna array. Margaret is fine.

She was clearly intact, solar panels still deployed, and with no visible signs of damage of any kind. Her high-gain antenna was folded away though, and we still couldn\u0027t get a reply from Margaret. A blown fuse it was, then. Jonnie\u0027s final burn brought us almost to a halt, but alarms blared before he had even completed it, telling us that the last of our fuel was about to trickle out of our thrusters into the void. We were now coasting very gently towards \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s midships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022I26MfYK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I26MfYK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAlmost dry, buddies.

For a fraction of a second, relief at the sound of her voice. Then a kick in the stomach hearing what she had to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m sorry, Jonnie. I can\u0027t do that.

You won\u0027t convince me with threats.\u201D On any other day, Angun\u0027s scornful tone would have carried absolute conviction. But today it did not. How could it, having seen what we had just seen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe tone of Margaret\u0027s voice did not change at all, she was serious about this. \u201CThis is not a threat, this is a decision and I\u0027m not going back on it.
