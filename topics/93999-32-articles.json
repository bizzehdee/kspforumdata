Sarnus has a 304K atmosphere compared to Jool\u0027s 138K atmo. This simply means you can\u0027t go in as deep as you\u0027re used to with Jool and come out alive on the other side (gas giants are not meant to descend in safely, so don\u0027t be surpised if your ship is destroyed while deep in one of their atmospheres). I\u0027ve done some tests with the latest stable DRE and OPM 1.5.2, so the only difference could be the updated Kopernicus 0.0.4 which you haven\u0027t been using with DRE yet. Seeing as that Kopernicus update didn\u0027t manage anything about atmospheres, I think you all have been approaching Sarnus the wrong way. Here\u0027s an album which shows you how to safely aerobrake. If you have been experiencing high G and excessive heating up with DRE at the periapsis I\u0027ve used, then let me know because then it\u0027s a real bug.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ebCyi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/ebCyi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t work for me.
