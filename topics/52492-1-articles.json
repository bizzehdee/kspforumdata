From Kerbin to Eve you will leave Kerbin retrograde and arrive at Eve traveling prograde relative to Eve (probably with some radial and normal velocity too). An ideal fly-by of Eve will convert all the radial, normal, and prograde velocity into retrograde velocity relative to Eve, which will give you the lowest possible solar periapsis.

Either way, a Bi-eliptic transfer will probably be the most efficient way to do it if you\u0027re aiming for really low orbits from kerbin. Start by raising your solar apoapse up high (like you\u0027re going to Jool), then when you get there burn retrograde to lower your periapse as low as you like.
