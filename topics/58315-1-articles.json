It works the same way as any other planet, you have to kill your horizontal velocity and then get your landing speed low enough for your legs.

I quickloaded 3 times before finding a proper periapsis for atmospheric braking. Just in case anyone is wondering, that was 12500m at the first try. It was not quite enough, but on my second try (11000) I got stuck in the (already very low/thin) atmosphere and crashed... In fact, my chutes riped off : ( BUT! there is a \u0022butter zone\u0022 there, and it of course depends on the speed with which you are entering that thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did use engine braking the time I landed successfully, not a lot of it, just enough to make sure the chutes don\u0027t rip off when they open. I also had a bad luck of landing in a high-elevation area, several km ASL (as if there was any S there, hmm). The chutes worked well, and I didn\u0027t have to use the engines after the chutes were fully deployed. Those were 8 side-mounted stock ones. Cannot figure out the weight, but it was I\u0027d guess about 4 tons, give or take a ton.

The gravity means that it will be hard to keep the ship to a safe descent speed, and even if you do, more weight will be trying to compress/damage the landing gear upon contact. It can be done, but you\u0027d probably be better off practicing engine landings in the more forgiving gravities of Mun and Minmus before trying it on Kerbin. However, if you want to practice landing on Kerbin, don\u0027t leave Kerbin. Just build a lander, put it on the pad, and practice lifiting it a few meters and letting it come down again. Expect many crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
