I\u0027m trying to make it as cool as possible, and I was wondering if there was a mod out there that allows me to repair damaged spacecrafts and other things. Please help me out because I haven\u0027t found anything yet\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T01:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know, nothing out there can do such a thing. However, I DO know that KAS lets you attach fuel lines and the like to spacecraft, maybe that could work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also: The devs have also said they\u0027d like to increase EVA functionality, so maybe patience will pay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit #2: Welcome to the forums, I notice this was your first post!

Haven\u0027t tried it yet but it sounds useful, just keep some spare spacecraft parts on the ship and use KAS or an orbital tug to maneuver them to the damaged craft, then weld.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
