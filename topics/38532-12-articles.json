First, raise your hand if you know what the letters S.A.S. stand for. It\u0027s stability augmentation system. What does it mean to augment stability? Usually such systems are effectively dampers designed to suppress unwanted oscillations and not autopilots. Historically KSP SAS \u0026amp; ASAS were exactly autopilots which instantly starts everyone off on the wrong foot in terms of expectations. We\u0027ve departed traditional vernacular at right angles already months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrevious versions were a motley collection of controls, control channels, and controllers. \u0022SAS\u0022 parts were controllers only available to the control channel used by the \u0022T\u0022 SAS controller. The manual controller actuated all available controls except the SAS torque which was reserved for hands off input. The ASAS simply expanded the set of controls that the SAS controller had available to it beyond pod torque and the exclusive SAS wheel parts. To top off the confusion you could have multiple controllers in operation simultaneously with manual control channels operating one set of controls and the automatic SAS channel(s) operating a partially overlapping set.
