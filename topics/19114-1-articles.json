It is designed to have a lot of fuel for orbital maneuvering, more than you need. It might come usefull as new planets are on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander is designed to be able to land on Mun and on Minimus in the same flight - althought I\u0027m not sure if this would work, as for now I dont really know how to transfer for one moon to another (but I will figure it out!). Fuel tanks are in radial position, becouse engine looks damn sexy just under non-fuel-tank parts. Also, it improves stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital stage might be hard to maneuver, thats why there are 2 rcs tanks above it. I recommend to do all decouples while having some thrust, becouse decoupled parts might decouple some of the engines as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere might be few bugs, right now some boosters wobble despite struts, orbital stages tend to spin sometimes, etc. I\u0027m still working on this ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate your suggestions, especially about ascent stages. I dont really know which boosters are more efficient in such construction - solid or liquid fueled, more shorter boosters or fewer longer ones; what launching sequence is better; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any suggestions and support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harvzey","CreatedById":22857,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T07:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Program is about always having a lot more fuel then you need \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Anyway, nice design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whatshtisthis","CreatedById":42775,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T08:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hillstache","CreatedById":47444,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T15:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it looks pretty good, you\u0027ve got fuel lines and lots of boosters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid Rocket Boosters are going to give you the most bang (thrust) for your buck (weight) but they are all or nothing.
