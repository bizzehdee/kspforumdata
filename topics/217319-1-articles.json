The vanilla parts are also pretty well balanced around this scale too, which you can tell because at this scale with vanilla parts, your rockets start to look the actual size/shape of real life rockets for their payload size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing this, you can refer to these parts and balance accordingly if it is easier to do this way.
