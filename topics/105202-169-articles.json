But since I use every other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mod I decided I may as well give the LS a try.

However \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E may be abstracted but it does cover all these needs in it\u0027s abstraction.  \n\nso far I am not unhappy with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E it is just a different way of looking at things.  it does basically replace TAC and Keepfit /Kerbal health in a single package so that is always good, and the interaction with the entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E lineup is a very big bonus.  so unless something drastic comes along later in the career to really break it for me, I may be switching to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E for all my future careers as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-14T16:08:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2017 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Bit Fiddler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T16:06:12Z","Content":"Sorry, new Post, as I do not want this to get lost in the previous wall of text.\n\nI have run into a snag.
