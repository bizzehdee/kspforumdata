This is a little micro SSTO that I made... It\u0027s based around one FL-T400 fuel tank, and can take two satellites to orbit. It can also dock, if you can time everything right, and I have a two man variant. The ascent profile on this thing is pretty simple, go up until about 20KM, then level it out into a very small climb. from there, keep gaining speed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING: I HAVEN\u0027T TESTED THIS WITHOUT FAR!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing works with deadly reentry too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./?8zkbnk14bby5wk1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www./?8zkbnk14bby5wk1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
