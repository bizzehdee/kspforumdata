For decades since early Kerbal kind first laid eyes upon this gas-giant. Many have wondered how it was formed, why it\u0027s in our System and possibly give clues on how the Galaxy was formed. Then the moon of Laythe is called in to question. Many Kerbals have wondered could Aquatic life could exist on Laythe despite it\u0027s extreme cold just like on Kerbin (minus the cold.). For decades, these questions have been asked with no clear answers by the Kerbal Astronomy Society. Now, independent and national space agencies (you.) are finally getting a chance to explore the Jool System. Below, you will find various contracts to undertake to finally answer the question; Is Kerbal-kind the only species in the known planets? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELong Range Observation (Optional)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E1.
