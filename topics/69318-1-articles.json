I\u0027m sure many of you will have seen this diagram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what usually happens to me in the game is that I leave Kerbins orbit on the right hand side but also enter the Muns orbit on the same side (unless something goes wrong). In fact I almost always enter an SOI in an anti-clockwise orbit. Is there a reason for this? I actually do want that orbit so its not a bad thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on this?

IIRC, a free-return trajectory (the figure-8 path you mentioned) takes a bit more delta-v than a typical hohmann transfer on the initial burn, but the reward is that little to no further course corrections will be needed to complete the flyby and swing back around to reenter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what you want to do is make a maneuver node and at least get an encounter of some kind set up with the Mun. After that, click on the Mun and click the button that says focus view. The camera will change to be centered on the Mun, and you\u0027ll also see your path relative to the Mun now instead of Kerbin. Try adjusting your maneuver node some more until you see that you have a retrograde flyby around the Mun. Keep checking both Kerbin and the Mun until you\u0027ve got a path that both gives you a good flyby but also sends you happily back home afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T10:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile its possible to have a figure of 8 shaped shaped free return trajectory it is really tough, this is because KSP works on a sphere of influence based system rather that true n-body physics which would take into account the moons influence even if you\u0027re simply in a parking orbit above the earth (wherever that place is) so as soon as you even begin to approach the moon the moons gravity starts to pull the orbit towards it allowing a nice gradual curve and a perfect figure of 8 shaped trajectory, the only way to do it now is to have the moons SOI effectively throw you around the back side of the mun, which means a very slow approach to the muns soi and a low pass across its surface (less than 10km) basically meaning you\u0027re actually treating it as two separate highly elliptical orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helped\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T10:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it has been said, you need a free return trajectory if you want the 8 shaped trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are a bit less efficient than pure hohmann interceptions, but are safer in case of an engine malfunction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are a bit tedious to setup in KSP, but I usually start by planning a burn that brings me to a ~14500 km Kerbin apoapsis, then mess around with the node until I get an encounter with the Mun and the trajectory I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Free_Return_Trajectory\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis\u003C/a\u003E helped me a bit with my first free return trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T10:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with free return trajectory is, it is not \u0022fuel saving\u0022 trajectory.

Instead of figure-8 where you enter the Mun SOI from Kerbin, you enter it \u0022towards Kerbin\u0022, i.e. after you turned around at your apoapsis. This allows you to set up the Mun periapsis on Mun side facing Kerbin. The advantage of this approach is that you can perform ejection burn on Kerbin day side, land directly from low periapsis on Mun on day side, and return to Kerbin on day side as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-14T11:42:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2014 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T12:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rus-Evo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rus-Evo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... it always looks like a figure 8 ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason Appolo used that type of orbit, was for the apollo 13 scenario.
