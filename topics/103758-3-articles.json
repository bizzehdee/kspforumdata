Oh and Copenhagen Sub-Orbitals.One of the things I am planning on doing is to attempt a Mars Direct style exploration and colonisation of Duna. Before that, though, I\u0027m intending to try out the MKS gear at one of the polar regions of Kerbin, rather like the Mars Society\u0027s missions in Earth\u0027s Arctic regions to emulate a working Mars base. Whilst various mods make that possible now, it\u0027d be great to see official verions of SpaceX and Bigelow gear (say, the Falcon Heavy, Dragon 2 capsule, BEAM330, and maybe a SpaceX sea-landing drone?) in the game. \n\nSome kind of nod to CSO in KSP would be neat because they\u0027re an amateur outfit determined (and making very good progress towards) to send someone into space on a sub-orbital flight, and whilst unlike Kerbals they\u0027re extremely safety-conscious, they otherwise exude an adventurous spirit that I think is very Kerbal-like."},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T00:14:47Z","Content":"They ought to get a voice actor for one of their trailers, like Kevin Brighting (from the Stanley Parable).
