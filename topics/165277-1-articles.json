In my opinion, they have to be reusable AND that resuability - the ability to return to space - must be cost effective in an industry where time is money. If refitting and reusing a spacecraft or launch vehicle takes a company too long, they will lose out on revenue from space companies utilizing the much cheaper disposable single-use launch vehicles. There has to be a sense of value\u00A0 and cost effectiveness in the return given for reusable vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComparing the space shuttle and falcon 9 is wrong is far more way than its correct.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimilar Falcon 9 and space shuttle launch stuff into space and is partial reusable.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifferent: pretty much everything else.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace shuttle was designed by an large governmental committee with conflicting demands.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was manned so landing fails was not an option, SpaceX can live with 5% crashes on landing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt reused upper stage only, upper stage add an 5-10X mass penalty over reusing first stage.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesign was so performance optimized it was an hangar queen, this increased launch cost a lot, this again\u00A0reduced number of launches making each far more expensive as you needed the 2K staff anyway.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes it was cool and had lots of nice features, so has the presidential limo or the beast, and you don\u0027t want to use the beast for your commute.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpaceX thought outside the box then it comes to reuse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-08T18:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223168132\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504893623\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Physics Student\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n34 minutes ago, Physics Student said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still a big fan of the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dumb_booster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBig Dumb Booster\u003C/a\u003E.
