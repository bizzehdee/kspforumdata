And a lot of electric capability for a ship without science instruments or an antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick rebuild of the lander says that it masses just under 22 tons wet. LKO to low Duna orbit is approximately 1700 m/s; using a single LV-N and its 800s Isp, you\u0027ll need a little under 7 tons of fuel to achieve that, bringing the mass up to about 32 tons. With liquid-fuel boosters and good piloting, you should be able to put together a booster that squeezes under the 140-ton limit of the level-2 launch pad and puts the above into orbit. Solids are probably too mass-intensive to make that limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you need to rethink your lander. Why does it need the rockets if it\u0027s not expected to bring Valentina back?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T03:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher of the stock craft Kerbal X should be good enough, with a few added fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T04:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rknj9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you go a smaller lander. You probably will need 6000dv taking off from Kerbin and reaching Duna orbit. You do need to aerobrake at Duna tho. After that get your ship into 60km orbit and decouple for landing. After takeoff just meet up with your main ship at orbit and dock. After everything decouples that small monoproplent tank with rcs can actually give you 800dv so meeting up and precision movement shouldn\u0027t be hard at all. Normally 4000dv total for lander would be more then enough but i just give it alot of margin of error. You will lose alot of weight so your main ship should have alot of spare dv now. 1000dv would be more then enough for your return and you can aerobreak at Kerbin atmosphere. Keep in mind i gave you alot of margin of error with these numbers it is possible to do the trip with alot less dv. (Oh and just a side note; you don\u0027t need ladders in Duna.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T04:36:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T04:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that you can click the orange wrench in a circle and it will tell you the total mass.
