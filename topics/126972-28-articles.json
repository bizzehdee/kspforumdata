Those ill-meaning kerbals ran off and completely forgot about their space program. There was a global crisis. The workers were upset. The party elders demanded strawberries. The Great Powers took notice. Nobody remembers because the thought police made sure to erase those that did. Space? Yes, we always have space for more members of the Glorious Kerbal Worker\u0027s Party!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so years pass. Eventually one of The First Citizen\u0027s Opinion Reinforcing Units stumble on the ruins of the long forgotten program. Trailers. Sheds. Laboratories stripped of all their worth. The common housing blocks and factories of the great Kerbal Union had encroached on the site, blanketing it in ash and soot. Large barrels of fleas had been stored there, awaiting use by the nearby reeducation centers. A few quick tortures and a property seizure later and The Party Boss became the operator of the most glorious space program on Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s when the fun ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGLORY TO KERBIN!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Party Boss was surprised to learn they had captured a small band of counter-revolutionaries when they liberated the space center. This group had been working to develop armaments, no doubt with the aim of supporting the villainous Enmore Kerman in his never-ending bid to overthrow The Party and assassinate the First Citizen. Despite their obvious treachery, the small band had continued to deny knowledge of The Party and were refusing to answer any questions. Even interrogation failed to uncover their secrets, so The Party Boss came up with a better idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would become cosmonauts for the glory of all working kerbals. Through their sacrifice they would be cleansed of their transgressions and welcomed back into the ranks of The Party as full peers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGLORY TO KERBIN!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t take long for The Party Boss to convince The First Citizen to reassign their weapons expert, Wernher Kerman, to this new space venture. And Wernher had more than a few insightful ideas. Glorious ideas. He had been working on designs for accelerating travel of his fellow kerbals, and now those designs would help spread the glory of The Party to the heavens themselves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd these malcontents would be his guinea pigs. [Wherever Guinea is and whatever pigs are....]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s \u0022Project Unity\u0022 would not only cleanse the waters of the Glorious Kerbal Worker\u0027s Party, it would also help to bring all kerbals together. To unite them towards one goal. One purpose. One end. This simple project would place a brave and glorious kerbal into orbit, where they would sing the praises of The Party to all who would listen and all who would follow. And all would listen and all would follow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first to reach these glorious heights would be their new comrade and former leader of the counter-revolution, Rosuki Kerman. A kerbal who fashioned herself as The Boss of these malcontents, who had thus far refused to disclose the identities her co-conspirators, she would now lead them to greater glory atop a mighty barrel of burning fleas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGLORY TO KERBIN!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look, all I\u0027m saying is we could reach orbit if you make a few small changes... Ow!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Party Boss slapped Rosuki\u0027s hand with the Truth Strap. She had been cooperating with Wernher and his design team for several days, more out of her desire of self preservation than a willingness to help these... kerbals... advance their goals. Yet every now and then she\u0027d say something that disagreed with the Glorious Kerbal Worker Party\u0027s worldview and would get a slap on the hands to \u0022train\u0022 her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It isn\u0027t supposed to work this way. I know what I\u0027m talking about. The rest of my team knows what they\u0027re talking about. If you just change... OW!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You will listen to and obey fellow citizen Wernher Kerman. No! More! Questioning!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher raised his hand to stop The Party Boss from further education of Rosuki. \u0022No, I think ve might be on to somethink here. Please, let her continue.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you. As I was saying, these flea barrels are useless individually. But if you...

Drop the spent stages off as the rest climb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022... to glory....\u0022 said The Party Boss, almost under his breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. \u0022Genius. Und obvious. Yet ve do not have such a tool.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiving these madkerbs explosive decouplers was not a good idea, but judging by their present design Rosuki was absolutely sure it was her only chance of survival. And she certainly wasn\u0027t going to show them how to make liquid-fueled rockets. They had blown up munths worth of research when the space center was captured just to keep that secret safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, if she didn\u0027t help, and this \u0022cleansing\u0022 launch turned out to be as fatal as she expected, then who would look after the rest of her team? What would happen to those still in orbit? Elite was nowhere to be seen, their contacts to the North suspiciously quiet. No, she had to make this work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so she did. It wasn\u0027t hard to scrape up \u003Cs\u003E[magic science points]\u003C/s\u003E engineering know-how from the area surrounding the space center. In a short time Wernher had all the pieces he needed to build what Rosuki hoped would be a working orbiter. It was an insanely complex craft, beyond what this new Wernher should yet have been capable of understanding, but he was proving to be a very fast learner. Rosuki could see why Elite and Jonbald had been so insistent on using Wernhers. No matter the background he always got up to speed quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0004-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0004-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short time later and Unity was ready for launch. It had proven to be even more insane looking once all of the flea barrels and hammers were stacked and strapped together. They forced her to climb the side of the rocket and enter the capsule on her own after the team of hundreds of kerbals had carried it (by hand) to the launchpad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thick smog of this Kerbin was enough that Rosuki could barely see beyond the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and she wondered if the mist itself wouldn\u0027t ignite when the rocket lit. The first stage, a small kick stage intended to just lift the thing above the launchpad, ignited while the craft was falling from its launch clamps. A half second of freefall and then a strong pull backwards. The mist did indeed appear to be burning as Unity climbed into the unseen beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0031-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0031-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf her design worked as well as she had planned, the falling debris from the first two stages would damage the launchpad, meaning The Party Boss would be unable to send his goons to recover her. At least not before she reached one of the stations she hoped were still in orbit. The stars at night were non-existent, and she had rarely seen a blue sky since... since the event.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket continued its bumpy ride into space, cutting through the thick soup of Kerbin\u0027s polluted lower atmosphere and into the thin, blue band above it. She rolled the ship around to get a view of the ocean, sad to see it too was choked with the thick, yellow haze. At least some part of the sky was still blue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0033-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0033-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0039-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0039-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch devastation. How had Kerbin come to this? How could kerbals be twisted so? The aggression displayed towards herself and her team was entirely unlike any of the previous Kerbins. This government was, no, best not to even think about it. Every Kerbin from here to eternity would be entirely unlike her Kerbin. \u0027You can never go home again\u0027 could never be more true. All she could do now was survive, or die trying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then she was in orbit. Here she was supposed to recite some speech penned by The First Citizen and then play a recorded message for all who could hear. She knew they knew she was in orbit, they\u0027d stuck enough transponders in the ship and her suit to track them from another galaxy. So if she failed to start the broadcast they would know she hadn\u0027t been reformed and \u0022joined\u0022 their endless party. (She wondered why anyone would go to a party where the snacks were a swift kick and a strike from a leather belt. What a terrible party.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, there would be no propaganda from her, not this day. She pulled the hatch\u0027s locking bolts free, kicked open the door and tossed the tape recorder and its vile message into the inky void.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0044-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0044-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe scanned the sky before climbing back in, hoping to catch a flare or two. If she was lucky she might have just launched into an orbit that was near one of the large stations. If she was really lucky, she would be near Kelgee Station. If she was really, really lucky, they would come out to get her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out she was only really lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer suit\u0027s radar was limited, and showed only a blip in a 130km orbit, but there was no mistaking the outline of Kelgee. Her ship, if an orbiting piece of propaganda could be called a ship, had four as of yet unused kick motors for deorbiting. Fired in two bursts this would net her somewhere near 175m/s. Not enough to set up a proper rendezvous with Kelgee, but it would get her close enough to close the gap with her EVA pack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe had never been the best at orbital mechanics, a behavioral scientist by background, and spending the last several years running a space agency hadn\u0027t helped. Thankfully the adjustment needed to set up the Kelgee rendezvous wasn\u0027t particularly complex. The amount of \u2206v to be spent was known, all of it to be spent in one or two burns, so all she needed to do was find a vector where burning said \u2206v would result in a close-approach to the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce she had it set up, she dialed both burns into the primitive flight computer and took a nap. The jolt of the two motors woke her from a nightmare of her imagination into a nightmare turned real. The second burn followed shortly thereafter, bringing her closest approach to half a kilometer. It would have to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0049-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0049-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intercept was estimated at some two-hundred meters per second, well within the capabilities of her (admittedly overpowered) EVA pack. Rosuki waited until the ship was some five kilometers from the station before she kicked open the hatch, pushed off from the ship, and made her way towards what she hoped would be an island of sanity in this maelstrom of madness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0053-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0053-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe started to panic when Kelgee came into view, its many pieces tumbling end over end, having seemingly come unglued. Unglued. Unglued. Just like her mind. Unglued. Unhinged. Unattached. All she could do was laugh. Ha. Ha ha. She let go of her EVA controls and cackled madly. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then something pushed her from behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe jolt of the two motors woke her from a nightmare of her imagination into a nightmare turned real. Kelgee Station\u0027s disintegration had all been a dream. A horrid, horrid dream. She had dozed off after the first of the two course alignment burns, her tortured mind playing terrible tricks on her. No, that couldn\u0027t happen to Kelgee. If it was going to fall apart it would\u0027ve done it years ago, in the decades while it was hidden from the radar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe waited until the station was some five kilometers away before she left her capsule behind. She had to turn away from the station to complete most of the rendezvous burn, her relative velocity brought down to a more manageable twenty meters per second. A second burn and her intercept was at zero with a relative velocity of almost nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick blast from the EVA pack turned her towards the station. She closed her eyes as the edge of the station came into view, not opening them again until she stopped her rotation. Relief. Sanity. All there. Thankfully. Glued. Attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0907-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0907-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll there, plus an extra shuttle that hadn\u0027t been when they lost contact. One of the Sulphurs from the M\u00FCn, obviously, but which one? Had all five of the crew come back? Why? For food and oxygen, no doubt. Were they still here? The Titanium was still docked, but nothing was ever certain from one cycle to the next. Chaos had reigned supreme until she and Elite had implemented Jonbald\u0027s plan. An optimistic plan that clearly didn\u0027t account for hostile governments. A plan now in tatters, with even more kerbals scattered across the solar system than had been when they started. Failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe made her way to one of the airlocks along the station\u0027s spine, checking its small window before cycling the atmosphere just in case someone was inside. Empty at first, and then holding one kerbal: her. The pressure equalized over the course of minutes, slowly. With that done she removed her helmet, pushed open the inner hatch, and hoped to see a friendly face waiting on the other side.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0911-unity.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0911-unity.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead raised space tools and angry looks greeted her, wrenches held firmly and with intent by Rozor and Tetris. One of them pulled her quickly out of the airlock, the other yanked her helmet away and tossed it across the cabin. Rozor was checking inside the airlock for more invaders while Tetris pushed her against a wall. A look of recognition quickly appeared on both their faces.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Boss?\u0022 Rosuki tried to nod. \u0022Hey! It\u0027s The Boss!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOthers slipped into the cabin from the lower decks, nine in all, each carrying an improvised weapon. Wrenches, hammers, water bottles. Rondous, Edsel, Elkin, Barbara, Verly, Mardi, even the half-awake Steve, all came to greet The Boss. The first contact they\u0027d had from the ground since the radios went silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss smiled, happy to see them all still alive. She motioned towards their wrenches and hammers. \u0022Expecting someone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRozor grinned and worked his wrench into a loop of his suit. \u0022Yeah. Queen Sieta has a lapdog, some raider calling himself Captain Hallock. Keeps coming around demanding supplies and parts, threatening to vent the station\u0027s atmosphere if we don\u0027t play along. Real jerk. Flies around in a tiny lander can but claims to have an entire fleet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sieta? Queen?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe nodded. \u0022Queen of Space. You didn\u0027t know? We thought she was the reason everything went silent. Says she was crowned by the Ghosts of Kerbin under full authority of The Great Powers and all that nonsense. We kind of hoped you were her pirate, Hallock, though sneaking up to the station in an EVA suit isn\u0027t really his style.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTetris came bounding back into the cabin, having ventured into the upper decks to do something. \u0022What happened?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Later. Right now I need a radio. Do any of them work?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, not unless you want to talk to our Queen. The entire network went down at the same time, more than a year ago now. We fixed a few of the stations and satellites here and at the M\u00FCn, but Sieta changed something and now they\u0027re all scrambled. Same threats of ashyxiation from her dog if we try to bypass it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok. In that case we need to get a broadcaster into an orbit that can see the North Pole. Any of these shuttles still...\u0022 An alarm sounded across the station, loud and shrill. Rozor darted to a control panel while the others scattered back from where they had come. \u0022What\u0027s that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Proximity alarm. The radar picked up a blip, small contact approaching from towards the planet. Friends of your\u0027s?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe hoped not, and said as much. Most of her team was still on the surface, and there was always a chance those lunatics had sent another of them up. Unlikely after her defection. She felt ill when she realized none of them were likely to still be alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0914-unity5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0914-unity5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s coming in to dock at the port docking arm.\u0022 Rozor unsnapped his wrench while watching the console, Tetris moved to a position adjacent to the airlock. \u0022Transponder identifies it as the \u0027Unity 5\u0027.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Five? What happened to the other three? Wait, wait, wait... dock? How did they develop a docking port so fast?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfused looks from Rozor and Tetris. \u0022Huh?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t have time to explain, but the Kerbin below us isn\u0027t the Kerbin you were born on. The kerbals that run it aren\u0027t friendly, they aren\u0027t nice, and they\u0027re not\u00A0coming to sell us life insurance. They sent me up here to spread their lies, probably hoping I\u0027d die in the process. Whoever climbs out of that ship isn\u0027t here to make friends.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160604-ksp0918-unity5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160604-ksp0918-unity5.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey opened the outer door of the same airlock The Boss had entered, hoping to entice their new friend to use it. It worked. Minutes ticked past as the hatch closed and the\u00A0pressure equalized. Rosuki realized she didn\u0027t have anything to fight with, if it came to that, but stayed in the cabin with Rozor and Tetris anyway. And then the hatch opened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Party Boss pushed his way into the cabin, still wearing his full EVA suit, a small pistol held firmly in his left hand. His attention was immediately taken by Rosuki, the other two kerbals in the cabin dismissed as non-threats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Malcontent! You failed to make your speech and play the message! And the message, oh that message is the most important part. You might say it had a very, explosive, yes, explosive ending. The First Citizen is most disappointed.\u0022 He shifted around, using short blasts from his EVA pack to stay oriented. The cabin quickly became hazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss spit at him. \u0022You don\u0027t belong here. Go back to your labor camps and your poisoned world. Your kind has no place here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Party Boss wiped his faceplate clean and grinned sharply. \u0022Your reeducation is complete, comrade, and I\u0027m happy to report that you failed.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe raised the pistol towards Rosuki just as Tetris brought her wrench down hard on his left arm. The scream from inside the suit was barely audible over the sound of the gun, the reflex from his arm breaking having forced him to pull the trigger. A cloud of sparks and smoke were spreading into the cabin as Tetris and Rozor grabbed the invader and pushed him against a bulkhead, the gun knocked free from his grasp. Both looked up to see The Boss staring blankly into the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe round had misfired, its precise chemistry disrupted by the near infinite heat and vast absolute cold of the vacuum during its travel to Kelgee from the Unity 5. (That, and it had been manufactured by malcontents hoping to sabotage the Glorious Kerbal Workers Party in the name of Enmore Kerman.) Or perhaps the ghost of Kelgee had stepped in to save a friend he had never known, none could say. The bullet had separated from its casing, the reaction of its powder delayed enough that it exited the muzzle at a leisurely pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGradually a shot rang out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRosuki was mesmerized, this lethal mass spinning rapidly about its axis and perfectly stable in its flight. She tapped it as it approached her chest, the soft contact causing its spin to deteriorate into complete chaos. End over end, now spinning about many axes. Chaos. It settled into a pattern, spinning mostly about one axis as it occasionally flipped to another. She tapped at it again. More chaos, yet it settled once more. A pattern always forming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, its perfect flight was disrupted, never again to return. An accident and an act of malice had sent it flying, but curiosity had been its final undoing. It could never go home again, the round having been spent, the empty shell equally lost. Would the lead rather be back in its casing, potential unspent? Or was it happy here, lost in the chaos, its purpose interrupted? Such questions were meaningless to spent lead. All it could do now was survive, or die trying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss reached out and grabbed the bullet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnd Kerbal Space Program Version 1.1.0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E[*]\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E[*] Some scenes filmed on location at KSP v1.1.2 because coming unglued isn\u0027t the path of sanity.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EGradually a shot rang out: All\u00A0Credit to Charles Schulz\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENavigation:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126972-forgotten-space-program/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2649348\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENext Post\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-04T06:27:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2016 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T02:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome!

The Rosuki Boss seems to be one such, along with Elly and several contemporaries, plus apparently really old-timers like the Jonbald mentioned above. \u00A0Thomlock just figured the changes were natural after being away 90 years, although I can\u0027t figure out why everybody remembers him being famously dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, as part of the effort to do something about the changes, Rosuki et al tried to leave something behind so the Kerbals of the next world wouldn\u0027t have to start from scratch. \u00A0Kinda like the Moties and their nuke-proof museum bunkers \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 That\u0027s what this seems to be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222554205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462142769\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/1/2016 at 5:46 PM, Cydonian Monk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So it worked...\u0022 The Boss looked at the box and then around the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it occurs to me that some of the Kerbals aware of what\u0027s going on might take a different approach. \u00A0Such as using their superior knowledge and technology to achieve positions of power in the new civilization. \u00A0And it would not surprise me if The Party Boss was one such. \u00A0For instance.... \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222618380\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465178392\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Cydonian Monk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did they develop a docking port so fast?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only a docking port, but an apparent lack of RCS or anything but SRBs, and was still able to dock. \u00A0And knew where to go. \u00A0And took a docking port instead of a parachute so had every expectation\u00A0of success. \u00A0That\u0027s not just Wehrner being quick on the uptake, that\u0027s somebody who\u0027s done this before. \u00A0I suspect that the unmasking / de-helmeting of The Party Boss will reveal a familiar face \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am tickled to see that Sieta and Hallock fulfilled my prophecy, too \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, all very curious. \u00A0Great story!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T03:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222618457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465184399\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only a docking port, but an apparent lack of RCS or anything but SRBs, and was still able to dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, it had RCS.
