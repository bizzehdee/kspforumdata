The RAPIER has a strong \u0022ram effect\u0022. If you get going fast enough the thrust starts climbing sharply and you can really pile on the speed. But if you climb too high too slow, or just have too heavy a plane for the number of engines on it, you can end up unable to get into that zone without descending.
