For the Mun, having 3 of \u0027em orbiting at about 250 km would allow one of them to get a signal from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the rest pass the signal around to the far side of the Mun allowing for coverage everywhere except for about 30 degrees around\u00A0the poles (if you deposit another three in polar orbit, then the poles also get covered completely). Same applies to Munmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you have that in place, you need to make Kerbin a reliable transmitter and receiver. I think that 5 relays can handle that all the time fairly cheaply. First, you want a little trio of relays in equatorial orbit capable of always seeing Kerbin and relaying the signal among themselves with\u00A0100% signal strength. Not sure if an HG-5 is capable of doing that, pretty sure that a RA-2 can handle it. The purpose of those three is so that a signal from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is always visible for your main relays. They are a\u00A0pair of extremely powerful relays in polar orbit 90 degrees out of phase when each other. That way at least one of them is always visible either above or below Kerbin\u0027s poles. For those two relays, you\u0027re going to eventually want them to be\u00A0RA-100\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s assume you wish to do a lot of research near Duna. Place one or two\u00A0high powered relay(s) in the Duna system in high polar orbits. Their purpose is to pick up a signal from Kerbin. Then place a few constellations of cheap HG-5\u0027s around Duna and Ike. The result will be near complete coverage of the Duna system (unfortunately, you won\u0027t be able to communicate when the line of sight between Kerbin and Duna is blocked by the Sun). Either deal with it, or perhaps setup another relay in another system. You may even eventually setup some powerful relays in a solar orbit unassociated with any planets. The idea is to have a few powerful relays pass the signal long distances and the forward those signals to cheap constellations of lower powered local relays to handle probes, rovers, and bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that KSP 1.2 is going to cause quite a few players to study up on resonate orbits..... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
