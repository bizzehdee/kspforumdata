The KSP mods are literally the nicest ones I\u0027ve seen so far.\n\nLet\u0027s take the *\\*shudder\\** ROBLOX forums for example... most mods stay quiet and ban every once in a while. While there are some mods who will join the conversation, and those mods are well-liked, you practically never see the rest of them. In some subforums, complaining about the game will get your post deleted, and sometimes filed as \u0022inappropriate content\u0022. It\u0027s practically the North Korea of the internet in there ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNow let\u0027s look at the KSP forums... the mods make sure not to overuse power. They join and contribute to conversations. They actually care enough to move your thread to the right spot. They lock threads when they get bad (instead of straight-out deleting them like North Korea- I mean ROBLOX). They\u0027re more or less normal users, just with admin.\n\nIt\u0027s amazing how much of a difference it can make to just *talk* to your users every once in a while, and KSP\u0027s team excels at it.\n\nThank you guys for everything!"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:04:32Z","Content":"Well, shucks, you all ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) Glad to be of service."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T12:20:39Z","Content":"It doesn\u0027t matter who we are.
