Hola! And Hello!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this game after Northernllion expoed it on youtube and have since fallen in love, quickly \u0027donated\u0027 the $15 to get me the full version, an amazing game. Of which I have a few questions, how does one move their planes to the airstrip instead of the launch pad? I tried manually moving but my plane keeps falling through the planet. Also is it normal with larger rockets causing the altimeter to blank out and go wild? With my largest rockets I am essentially flying blind becase the altimeter blanks out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T06:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EZdorovo! To move the craft, move it from VAB to SPH folder. You might have to rotate it afterwards, don\\\u0027t remember. As for altimeter blanking out, this only happened to me when I was using certain mod part, got rid of it, all back to normal. Some say altimeter might blank out with a heavy rocket on a weak computer - not sure about that. Anyways, it is a known bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T13:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like KSP is too heavy for your computer.

What I do is I use the altimeter position to get my bank, then use the map to watch my apoapsis.
