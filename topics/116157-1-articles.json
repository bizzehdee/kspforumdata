The most effective way, though annoying, still is to make a text list (with version number for each add-on). Some users like to show the subfolders in their KSP GameData thinking that be enough, but many add-ons don\u0027t have a dedicated subfolder so they would not be recognized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the guide I linked above makes clear, there are a number of instructions to be followed to report an issue. Those instructions allow who works in support to try at reproducing your issue, and get an idea of what the cause could be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe list of add-ons is one (very important) item, but also the reproduction steps (either from a brand new game, or with a savegame of yours that you must then provide, you make a list of each single action required to arrive at the issue you experience) and the logs (those alone are often enough to get what\u0027s happening under the hood). Finally, you should try on your own to find if the issue is reproducible in a clear environment, or with one specific add-on: please note who provides help here has to spend hours of his own (unpayed) time to find what combination of add-ons would reproduce the issue, so would be the minimum if you also did try to find following those instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
