The nav computer is quick to belay instructions, and Riptop only missed the thrust vector by a couple of degrees, and left the engines firing for a little too long. 135 days, give or take ten days, and the crew are restless. Shepfreds ever worsening breath continually contaminates the air scrubbers, while Melsey has been spending more and more time in the fuel tank getting high on fumes.
