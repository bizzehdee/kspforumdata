The reason it was there is because I wanted it the mod to have some limitations and not be another infinite fuel generator. When i wrote the plugin i had it on 1 degree which more than fine around Kerbin, never had any issues and I tested the **** out of it. I was even going to put it to 0,5 but then I feared this would create issues around low gravity objects like Minmus, so i drastically increased it to 5 which appeared to give more than enough room around Minmus. The last thing I wanted is for people to really have to watch their step. So I was really suprised to get Ultraturbopanda and your reports. Initially I believed there would be something wrong else with the logic exactly because the allowed deviation was so high but I couldn\u0027t find anything. Then through rigorous testing after receiving your report I stumbled on the bug mentioned above, which, to be clear, was really a design oversight on my part. My testing never had inclinations so close to zero so it never reared it\u0027s head, it would require some luck to get it close enough to matter unless \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E of course the station wasn\u0027t maneuvered there by a human but by a machine, like mechjeb, which, although i never use it, probably does exactly that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could set it to 10, but from your reports I just know its something else and I of course hope this was it.

It could check if there are vessels landed on the planet and then check if they contain Kethane, but such a mechanic would break realism when the Kethane patch was depleted, or the particular Kethane was actually shipped in from elsewhere. Taking all that into account would require more complicated code. It might be a better idea if Kethane users wanted such functionality to have some dedicated relay system where you would deliver fuel to a ground station which would then with delay be delivered to an orbiting station. It\u0027s much easier to make something like that from the ground up and it would integrate better with the Kethane game mechanic than to try and squeeze it in the current mod in a somewhat acceptable way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the cheating, I think its just what you think is reasonable and permit yourself (in a single player game).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T17:43:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PrivateFlip\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T09:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of the new model \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/member.php/62882-KhaosCorp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKhaosCorp\u003C/a\u003E also added an extendable port.

In the vanilla game/real life there is little point to arrange for regular fuel supply missions from Kerbin to Duna just to allow another ship to refuel there. Since all fuel is sourced from kerbin it would make much more sense, both economically and the amount of hassle for the player, to have the other ship bring the necessary fuel itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can however imagine a somewhat different fuel supply mod like you suggest, which functions as a deep space supply station and requires a base to be established on the surface; the story being that the station is being supplied by the base below. It could for instance measure the dry weight of kerbal assets on the planet surface and count this amount towards a minimum for activation of the station. A Kethane light so to speak. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no technical difficulties to make other conditionals, like having a base on the planet, a factor for activation of the module.

For example, saturn\u0027s moon titan has methane \u0026amp; ethane clouds, organic compounds, and lakes of hydrocarbons. Maybe we can get a \u0022robotic fuel skimming\u0022 station that consumes a certain amount of fuel each go, before paying it back with a bit extra. It\u0027d be relatively small amounts of fuel at high cost (maybe 1/4 the fuel the current part delivers, requiring 25%-50% of what was delivered for another run, high electrical cost, small chance of losing a skimmer) but it would certainly be useful to get even small amounts of fuel out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine a part that houses 4 skimmers, and the fuel used for each launch, the skimmers themselves looking somewhat like NASA\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43-main.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EX-43 hypersonic scramjet\u003C/a\u003E. Set it to active and every orbit it will send one down (model disappears) while consuming a large quantity of power (remote guidance control computers, right?). If power runs out, you lose the skimmer. If it makes it back, it resupplies the part outputs the excess (maybe variable?) and sends another. When you set it to inactive it will still consume power until the current skimmer is back and it\u0027s load is accepted, it will also set itself to inactive if there is no tank space left to fill. It would also be possible to bring and store extra skimmers in a separate skimmer bay in case you lose one, as well as running multiple control stations to double your resource rate as long as you have the power for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for setup, I imagine it would be much more particular about its positioning (specific orbit range per body, such as between 200km and 225km), and would require a few orbits of running at full power to scan the planets atmosphere. Afterwards, the same button can be used to start and stop the skimming operation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomatoSoup","CreatedById":59394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T01:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PrivateFlip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PrivateFlip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can however imagine a somewhat different fuel supply mod like you suggest, which functions as a deep space supply station and requires a base to be established on the surface; the story being that the station is being supplied by the base below.
