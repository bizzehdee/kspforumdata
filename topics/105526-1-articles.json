I see the monolith best aligned with the terrain on the \u0022Low\u0022 setting.\n\nTo explore this I manually fiddled with the maxSubdivision setting for Kerbin in the terrain section of settings.cfg, setting value from 6 (same as the \u0022Low\u0022 preset) through 12 (two above the \u0022High\u0022 preset). Results shown in the image gallery below.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I don\u0027t know about other Easter eggs."}]}
