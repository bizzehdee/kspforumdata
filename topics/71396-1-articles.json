I\u0027m planning to build a colony on Minmus, and I was wondering what mods would be recommended for doing such. I\u0027d like the colony to have some purpose, but also to be versatile and structurally sound.

Parts for Extraplanetary Launchpads. Those are the basics that would allow you to start on a colony with a purpose. I would also recommend getting the Hooligan Labs SQUID mod as Minmus has low gravity and things like to fall over if you\u0027re not careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Porkjet\u0027s inflatable habitats are useful, and KAS is very nice for connecting all of your base modules together. HOME 2 could also work, but it takes some editing of some part.cfg files to get it working with .23.5 (NuclearFuel resource for powerplant does not exist, I would suggest changing the powerplant module to run on Kethane if you have it installed)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-04T16:06:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2014 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mike9606\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ethought of more useful mods.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T16:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78441-Best-Habitation-module-mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78441-Best-Habitation-module-mods\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for habitation at least\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T16:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane maybe?
