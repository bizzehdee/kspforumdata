I already have a drill planned and rovers to bring the Kethane to the transfer rocket thing. The issue is the skycrane method of getting the drill onto the Mun. The stage BEFORE the skycrane works as it should, but then when the skycrane stage is activated, the thrust of its rockets makes the drill go DOWN instead of up (the thrust is backwards) So, naturally, I thought \u0022Let\u0027s just flip the engines upside down! For science!!\u0022 (well, actually, I was thinking maybe the thurst is reversed, so if they are upside down it will slow it down) That really didn\u0027t work, but it made pretty fireworks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m stuck. I want to start mining soon, but I cannot figure out this engine thingy..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T14:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the engine exhausts hitting your payload or other parts?

Rotate your payload 90 degrees, so tha if it were a car it would be sitting on its\u0027 trunk with the wheels sticking out to the side. Next, put two weaksauce rocket motors up near the front/top of it. Make sure the rockets point towards the wheels. Now, land it normally, then use SAS to tip the lander over. As it tips, use the two tiny engines to keep the tipping at a gentle speed. When you land, decouple and drive away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
