It seemed to install just fine. When I enter the game the life support monitor shows up but when I enter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E non of the parts are there. I am in science mode so I thought maybe I hadn\u0027t unlocked the parts but the parts don\u0027t show up in the tech tree either. I checked the GameData folder and all the parts show up there so I am very lost as to why the parts aren\u0027t showing up in game. Maybe its because I am using venstock revamp?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-25T22:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E install the dependencies correctly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure you have the CommunityCategoryKit, CommunityResourcePack, REPOSoftTech, and ThunderAerospace folders under GameData.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jared Smythe","CreatedById":180643,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-26T01:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was missing community category kit.
