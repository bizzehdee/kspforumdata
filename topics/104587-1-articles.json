Your TWR seems to be very low. You can\u0027t just follow retrograde. You have to try to kill horizontal first while keeping vertical speed under control (less than 100m/s).

Now drag retrograde all the way back so that you have a burn set to completely cancel your velocity. (I recommend using your low thrust RCS ports for these setup maneuvers, to get that fuel out of the way when a high TWR doesn\u0027t matter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a note of the estimated burn time. Divide that by two. If the burn time is 120 seconds, start burning at 60 seconds to the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming constant acceleration (its not, it increases as fuel burns off), your average velocity (since you go from starting velocity to 0) will be half of the velocity that the game is using to compute your time to the maneuver node (you should have placed the maneuver node on the ground, or nearly so), so it will take roughly 2x the time to reach the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats why a 120 second burn can be started 60 seconds away from impact (that impact time assumes no burn). As your TWR roughly doubles throughout the burn, it should leave you with a good safety margin. In fact... don\u0027t divide by 2... multiply by 0.4... that will result in less dV waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should stop you from smacking into the terrain because you didn\u0027t give yourself enough time to decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter piloting might save this - it certainly could if you backup to the transfer to tylo, and get a low equatorial PE for the capture burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BenHR","CreatedById":58402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T23:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoly crap, that\u0027s alot of words.

That\u0027s no hitchhiker can, it\u0027s a couple smaller fuel tanks. No science things, those are all monoprop tanks. As for the parachutes, this is a multi-use rocket, and I couldn\u0027t be bothered to rip them off for this mission.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith those more accurate numbers, I\u0027m not sure its worth trying (unless you can go back to a save before you enter tylo\u0027s SOI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back and looked at a screenshot I had from my one successful SSTO tylo lander... it got down to the surface of tylo, and then back to orbit (55x60km) with 16 m/s left in the tanks (While it worked, it used a lot of fuel, and I decided its easier to haul new, small landers, than tons and tons of fuel to Tylo, for repeated landings)... anyway, my orbital velocity was 2090 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure if I lowered the orbit to be just scraping the mountain tops, it would be over 2100 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour lander has less than 2249 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This is assuming you\u0027ve emptied the monoprop to find the dry weight, because Kuzzter\u0027s calculations assumed everything is at 390 Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour two cylinder monoprop tanks hold 1.2 tons of monoprop, the capsule, 0.16- \u0026gt; 1.36 tons of monoprop total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your lander delta-V would be: 9.82* ( 260ln(18/16.64) \u002B 390 ln (16.64/10) ) = (20.426\u002B 198.60) *9.82 = 2151 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means if you lose more than 50 m/s due to gravity drag, you run out of fuel... and you don\u0027t have high stength parts that can survive impact speeds of 60 m/s or so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 m/s is 6.3 seconds of thrusting against Tylo\u0027s gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new mass number, it seems your TWR doesn\u0027t even exceed 2:1 when full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18/10 tons full/epty means your initial deceleration will be 12.2 m/s/s and your final acceleration will be 22 m/s/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say you average 17 m/s/s.... the burn is going to take you 2100/17 = 123 seconds...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the start of the burn you\u0027ll be thrusting parallel to the surface, by the end, you\u0027ll be at a significant angle, and you\u0027ll lose more than 50 m/s to gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ll probably lose closer to 500 m/s to gravity drag... which is why my initial estimate of 2700 m/s was cutting the dV budget pretty tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I know the lander is even heavier... it just can\u0027t make it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat lander simply cannot make the landing on its own, when released even in the lowest possible orbit.... the only way that lander is going to successfully land, is if the stage below it can put it into a very low orbit, and then do a burn to put it at something about 300 m/s under orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the video, your LV-N stage ran out of fuel before you even got to a low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry... but this just isn\u0027t going to work...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*maybe* if you have an older save, and can do the transfers more efficiently, and arrive at low Tylo orbit with more fuel in your LV-N stage...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from where you start in your videos.... trying to land is an excercise in futility, it can\u0027t be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWay too little dV for such a low TWR. If your TWR was infinite, it would still be pretty tight as far as piloting the suicide burn, because... you know... the only 6 seconds of fuel you\u0027d have to fiddle with the throttle and descend assuming you didn\u0027t just time the burn perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back and looked at how you arrived at low orbit for Tylo. You start your burnat Perapsis, and lower your apopasis down to just above the surface (somewhat, I\u0027d go lower than 30 km) - turning the old perapsis into the new apopapsis, then you bring your new apoapsis down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that it is much more efficient to start your burn at apoapsis, bring your perapsis down below 30km, then from perapsis, bring your Ap down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a highly eliptical orbit, small burns change PE a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new way- your first burn won\u0027t use much fuel at all, and the 2nd burn won\u0027t use much more fuel than your first burn from the old way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich if that is then used to deorbit your lander before detaching it... could get you annoyingly and frustratingly close to pulling off the landing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes ~1100 m/s to go from capture to a 10km orbit, or a 10km orbit to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour first burn is 615 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour second burn is 530\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou use more than this getting into a higher orbit, from well below escape...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would still be much better if your capture was done with a lower perapsis....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T09:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T09:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn his last attempts, BenHR was very close : he crashed at 100m/s (IIRC). It may be doable just by optimising the descent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is not the vertical velocity, it\u0027s the horizontal. You must kill all of it WHILE keeping vertical under control. With high TWR, it\u0027s quite easy and efficient : burn rerograde as near as surface as possible (suicide burn) or not so near if you have more fuel. But with low TWR, you can\u0027t do it because you loose a lot of time while killing horizontal and your vertical velocity goes uncontrolled. You usually crash in a cliff or ground. You must do a less efficient manoueuver as many described by keeping vertical velocity controled around 100m/s. But this manoeuver is less efficient on delta-V (but more efficeint in survivability).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as BenHR is so close to land, trying different altitude or selecting higher landing spot or retry manoeuver to burn closer to ground COULD do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I managed to survive (ship intact and steady) a 30m/s hit on Tylo ground, so vertical velocity can be a bit forgiving. Horizontal is not... if you want to take off later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother advice (I think it was already given) : try to burn monoprop first to get to orbit. You can do a lot with RCS.
