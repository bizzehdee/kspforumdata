Instead, combine your descent burn with your burn at periapsis to bring your apoapsis down.

If not, post the mass with full tanks, mass with empty tanks, and we can show you how to calculate the dV you will get with your Poodle descent engine.\n\nA perfect descent from orbit to Tylo surface costs about 3000 m/s delta V, and the same is true for the ascent. I suggest we start with the numbers and go from there. Depending on the dV of your craft and its *thrust to weight ratio (TWR)* we can make some suggestions of landing technique (i.e. vertical descent vs. constant altitude)\n\nETA: thanks Yukon for correcting, we need TWR not TMR when in Tylo SOI\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T14:44:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T14:42:20Z","Content":"Some says that with high TWR it can be done with 5500m/s.

Your TWR seems to be very low. You can\u0027t just follow retrograde. You have to try to kill horizontal first while keeping vertical speed under control (less than 100m/s). You should use KER to display those figures. To do that, start quite low (under 30km) ; you must aim above retrograde, not on retrograde. The more you slow down, the more to must aim above retrograde. \n\nBut I\u0027m bothered that your TWR could be too low.

I hope you have an earlier save, where you can fine tune your trajectory so that your perapsis is much much closer to tylo. You are wasting so much dV on the capture burn and then lowering your perapsis (plus with that intercept... that is why you aren\u0027t equatorial)\n\n\\* Third: your de-orbit burn is way too high -\u003E get your perapsis even lower. You\u0027ll want to start your deorbit burn below 10 km (depending on terrain, it does go up to 11km on tylo, but you\u0027ll want to be even lower if it is 6km), not above 30\n\nNow how to squeeze mor dV out of that thing...\n\nYou decouple a LV-N stage.\n\nLV-Ns have 800 Isp, whereas the poodle has 390 Isp. In terms of dV per unit fuel, you\u0027d get more keeping the dry mass and running the LV-Ns longer, until the dry mass of the upper stage is 390/800 x the total mass - ie when the LV-N stage is 410/800x the total craft mass.\n\nI can\u0027t tell exactly what you have there, but I see:\n\n1x empty orange tank: 4 tons\n\n4x LV-Ns: 9 tons\n\n1x hitchhiker module: 2.5 tons\n\n1x 400L quad adapter: 0.2 tons\n\n1x decoupler: 0.4 tons\n\n= 16.1 tons\n\nSome monopro? did you use all the monoprop before discarding the stage? make sure you have the monoprop drain from the stage you discard first\n\nYou upper stage has:\n\n1x 2 person landercan: 2.5 tons (2.66 full of monoprop)\n\n1x full 200-16 tank: 9 tons\n\n2(?) x large battery packs: 0.4 tons\n\n4x large landing legs: 0.4 tons\n\n1x large probe core: 0.5 tons\n\n1x poodle: 2 tons\n\n2x monoprop tanks (or is it goo?): 1.5 tons full\n\nSomething else, guessing a large reaction wheel? 0.2 tons\n\nparachutes? (WHY?!) I\u0027m guessing 0.6 tons here\n\n2x extendable solar panels: negligible (0.035 tons)\n\nTotal: 16.9 tons I\u0027m guessing...\n\nThat is more than the weight of the stage you discard... and the stage you discard has over double the Isp. You\u0027ll get more dV if you pump some fuel into it, and use the LV-Ns some more...\n\nYou want to transfer x tons of fuel into the lower stage,\n\nwhere:\n\n(16.9-x)/(16.1\u002B 16.9-x) = 390/800\n\n(16.9-x)/(33-x)= 0.4875\n\n16.9-x = 16.1 -0.4875x\n\n0.8= 0.5125x\n\nX= 1.56\n\nYou want to burn about another 1.5 tons of fuel through your lower stage - thats about 135 units of LF, and 165 of Oxidizer.\n\nBut you\u0027re carrying over 1.2 tons of monoprop...\n\nTo maximize dV, you want to use your lowest Isp fuel first... and you can get a max of 260 Isp with the monoprop on that craft (with the O-10 monoprop engines, you can get up to 290)\n\nUse all your monoprop on the lower stage, then decouple (or transfer ~0.2 tons of LF\u002BO to the lower tank, and burn the LV-Ns for a little extra dV).\n\nThen use all the monoprop from the upper stage, and onlly then fire the poodle.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the empty weight of your upper stage is about 7.8 tons.\n\nx 8m/s/s... you need 62 kN to have a TWR of 1 when it is empty.... 128 kN when its full\n\nThe poodle delivers 220, your TWR is less than 2 at the start of the burn, but it should be adequate.\n\nKeep in mind every second you spec thrusting down costs you about 8 m/s of dV.... and I don\u0027t think the little tricks to tweak a bit more dV out of that craft won\u0027t get you more than a few seconds.\n\nWhen it is full, you\u0027ve got an acceleration of 13.6 m/s/s, when empty: 27.2\n\nThus if you\u0027re orbiting at 1,800 m/s, it should take you about 100 seconds to stop.\n\nMass ratio: 2.06... 390\\*ln (2.06)\\*9.8 = 2,762 m/s\n\nBut that is an overestimate... as its assuming your monoprop fuel is getting 390 Isp.\n\nThis is cutting it pretty close on the dV budget, but its doable.\n\nNow for the piloting....as soon as your PE barely touches the ground, place a maneuver node where it intersects the ground. Now drag retrograde all the way back so that you have a burn set to completely cancel your velocity. (I recommend using your low thrust RCS ports for these setup maneuvers, to get that fuel out of the way when a high TWR doesn\u0027t matter)\n\nMake a note of the estimated burn time. Divide that by two. If the burn time is 120 seconds, start burning at 60 seconds to the maneuver node.\n\nAssuming constant acceleration (its not, it increases as fuel burns off), your average velocity (since you go from starting velocity to 0) will be half of the velocity that the game is using to compute your time to the maneuver node (you should have placed the maneuver node on the ground, or nearly so), so it will take roughly 2x the time to reach the ground.\n\nThats why a 120 second burn can be started 60 seconds away from impact (that impact time assumes no burn). As your TWR roughly doubles throughout the burn, it should leave you with a good safety margin. In fact... don\u0027t divide by 2... multiply by 0.4... that will result in less dV waste.\n\nThat should stop you from smacking into the terrain because you didn\u0027t give yourself enough time to decelerate.\n\nBetter piloting might save this - it certainly could if you backup to the transfer to tylo, and get a low equatorial PE for the capture burn."},{"CreatedByName":"BenHR","CreatedById":58402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T23:45:04Z","Content":"Holy crap, that\u0027s alot of words.

If your TWR was infinite, it would still be pretty tight as far as piloting the suicide burn, because... you know... the only 6 seconds of fuel you\u0027d have to fiddle with the throttle and descend assuming you didn\u0027t just time the burn perfectly.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nSo I went back and looked at how you arrived at low orbit for Tylo. You start your burnat Perapsis, and lower your apopasis down to just above the surface (somewhat, I\u0027d go lower than 30 km) - turning the old perapsis into the new apopapsis, then you bring your new apoapsis down.\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure that it is much more efficient to start your burn at apoapsis, bring your perapsis down below 30km, then from perapsis, bring your Ap down.\n\nFrom a highly eliptical orbit, small burns change PE a lot.\n\nThis new way- your first burn won\u0027t use much fuel at all, and the 2nd burn won\u0027t use much more fuel than your first burn from the old way.\n\nWhich if that is then used to deorbit your lander before detaching it... could get you annoyingly and frustratingly close to pulling off the landing ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIt takes ~1100 m/s to go from capture to a 10km orbit, or a 10km orbit to escape.\n\nYour first burn is 615 m/s\n\nYour second burn is 530\n\nYou use more than this getting into a higher orbit, from well below escape...\n\nIt would still be much better if your capture was done with a lower perapsis....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T09:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T09:32:45Z","Content":"On his last attempts, BenHR was very close : he crashed at 100m/s (IIRC). It may be doable just by optimising the descent. \n\nThe main problem is not the vertical velocity, it\u0027s the horizontal. You must kill all of it WHILE keeping vertical under control. With high TWR, it\u0027s quite easy and efficient : burn rerograde as near as surface as possible (suicide burn) or not so near if you have more fuel. But with low TWR, you can\u0027t do it because you loose a lot of time while killing horizontal and your vertical velocity goes uncontrolled. You usually crash in a cliff or ground. You must do a less efficient manoueuver as many described by keeping vertical velocity controled around 100m/s. But this manoeuver is less efficient on delta-V (but more efficeint in survivability).\n\nBut as BenHR is so close to land, trying different altitude or selecting higher landing spot or retry manoeuver to burn closer to ground COULD do the trick.\n\nBTW I managed to survive (ship intact and steady) a 30m/s hit on Tylo ground, so vertical velocity can be a bit forgiving. Horizontal is not... if you want to take off later.\n\nAnother advice (I think it was already given) : try to burn monoprop first to get to orbit. You can do a lot with RCS. It\u0027s just slow and inefficient.
