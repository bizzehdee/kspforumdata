Playing around with a vanilla KSP install earlier, showing off for friends. Basic munshot and landing. However, I encountered a strange issue after botching the landing. When the flag was clipped by the lander as it rolled around trying to right itself, the flag EXPLODED. After apparently striking the surface of the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on takeoff, the second flag exploded. I was nowhere near it at the time, and it exploded after striking the surface of the mun. I\u0027m pretty sure (about 60-70% sure) the rocket exhaust wasn\u0027t pointed at it. Despite it being a horizontal takeoff after I gave up righting the lander and just floored it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my question is simple: What the \u003Cem\u003Efrak\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was my first attempt at the latest edition, so is this a known bug, or is it just because I screwed up the first time and clipped it?
