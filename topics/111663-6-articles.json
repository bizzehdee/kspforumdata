Its a game you can pour hundreds of hours into. But it still doesent feel right to cost $40 bucks for some reason. I am surprised to see that it is among the top sellers on steam. Congrats to squad i guess. I will now go take a look at the reviews. Maybe people get disappointed considering how much they paid. Who knows.\n\nUmmm, hundreds of hours? \n\nLet\u0027s assume 400 hours. So you don\u0027t think that it\u0027s worth 10 cents an hour?\n\nWhen I buy a game, I expect to get at least as many hours of enjoyment out of it as the price, so a $40 game should give me 40 hours of enjoyment. \n\nI think this is well worth the price"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T17:05:41Z","Content":"Too expensive?

Poor game balance, placeholder graphics for most things, missing audio, poor UI, barren planets, not to mention that we still have significant memory leaks.\n\nBasically, we\u0027re being asked to pay full release price (and then some given the going price for indie games) for what is still really an unfinished early access game. That fact right there makes it overpriced right now IMHO.

It has very little exposure, and can (practically) only be obtained on-line, through steam. In fact the only way you probably heard about it is over steam or any of the \u0022speciality\u0022 youtubers (which only us overly interested people watch anyway).\n\nCustomers have low price sensitivity: We will pay for it either way, because we are especially interested. People with lesser interest would most likely not pay for it no matter what the price is. We most likely already bought it in Early Access which leaves even less people to buy it now. And as many of the previous posters indicated, we are still willing to pay more...\n\nVirtually no competitors in the same genera: What other games let\u0027s you build spaceships, use close-to-simulation game mechanics, land on other planets and all the other ridiculous stuff that is being done? And probably not much substitutes as the customers have special interests.\n\nSo, with a low demand, low price sensitivity, limited availability, only appeal to certain customers, no competition, limited substitutes and limited exposure, you punch up the price.\n\nEveryone here already bought it, and would probably do anyway at some point.\n\n(this also is probably the reason for such a great community : D)\n\nEdit: Not to mention, the average age of possible customers is probably higher, making it the price sensitivity even lower.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T15:36:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kimiko**"},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:50:36Z","Content":"Think i paid about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A312 around $20 when it was 0.23. \n\nTotally worth it, and they did say throughout developement, get it before release and dont pay full price.
