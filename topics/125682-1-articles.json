Now that we have to pay for launches the \u0022cost per ton to LKO\u0022 is becoming very important. In your experience what method of putting payload in orbit nets you the lowest cost per ton?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve tried a fully recoverable, aerospike powered SSTO rocket that can put a 10 ton payload into 75km x 75km orbit, payload fraction just under 10% . If I\u0026#39;m very accurate with landing and get it near KSC it costs me about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A17000 to recover, refurbish and refuel the launch vehicle, so that\u0026#39;s \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1700 per ton. Is this a good number? It seems in 1.04 version of the stock payload fraction challenge people are getting upwards of 40% payload fraction with SSTO spaceplanes.

The main drawback to planes such as KerikBalm\u0026#39;s is, obviously, the huge initial investment and the single-point of failure (as Slashy said). A SSTO rocket for any payload will cost considerably less than a comparable spaceplane, so you have to ask yourself how many times you\u0026#39;re likely to use a particular model. I\u0026#39;ve found that a typical spaceplane (if there is such a thing) pays for itself after 3 - 5 flights. For that reasons most of us only use spaceplanes, if at all, for fuel and crew to orbit, as you suggest if interested in economics. Note, however, that with ISRU (ore mining) in particular it is quite possible to make a Single Stage vehicle to anywhere and there are a number of people who specialise in such things.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T16:49:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T18:57:54Z","Content":"\nWell, a *single point of failure* can be mitigated by in orbit construction.
