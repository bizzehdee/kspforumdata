The livestream and actual game play drops June 10th. I can\u0027t wait to build a 1-1 scale Death Star in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-07T20:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda annoying that they literally stole the same name. Terrible for consistency and decency to the older game. By using the same name your acting like it doesn\u0027t exist. Kinda shameful since everyone agrees it was one of the best Star Wars games of all time- you\u0027d think they\u0027d want to ride on it\u0027s coattails rather than just steal the exact same name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t be able to play it anyway so call this pointless whining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T02:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why you\u0027d hype a game that\u0027s more than ten years old, unless it\u0027s an HD release.

It doesn\u0027t seem like that long since they released BattleFront either. I was disappointed with that one since there was no single player campaign. I will be ignoring this, like I try to ignore most EA games. My kids insisted on blowing their money on the last BF, and I had to let them get NHL 2017 since it\u0027s a welcome change from combat games.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
