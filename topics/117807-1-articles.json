So using 16 megajoules of energy you get 8/9 of a kilo of oxygen. This means 16*(9/8) = 18 megajoules gives 1 kg of oxygen. As a rough estimate take the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://members.shaw.ca/tfrisen/how_much_oxygen_for_a_person.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eamount of oxygen someone needs in 24 hours as about 1 kilo\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now for the weight of batteries.

Then to provide the 18 megajoules to get 1 kilo of oxygen you would need 18/1.8 = 10 kilos of the lithium batteries. I\u0027ll assume the weight of the system will be dominated by the weight of the batteries since electrolysis can be done simply by placing electrified wires in the water. So at 15 kilos of the batteries, the same weight as the scuba tank for 1 hour of breathing time, you would actually get enough oxygen for (15/10)*24 = 36 hours, a day and a half. Or said another way, to get enough oxygen for 1 hour would only take 10/24 = .42 kilos, less than a pound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Practical problems of course are for one how efficient is the electrolysis procedure?

You would need to have nitrogen or an other gas in the loop \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor space suits I think they use rebreathers, they however don\u0027t have the pressure problem, running pure oxygen at 1/5 bar is just an benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Yes. A major problem with this is normally scuba divers don\u0027t use pure oxygen. Usually it is compressed air with a normal mix of oxygen and nitrogen. In fact pure oxygen at too much of a depth can be toxic to divers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Scuba Tank Gas Mixture do Divers use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPosted by Sandro Lonardi | October 05, 2013 | \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.elitedivingagency.com/articles/scuba-tank-gas-mixture-divers-use/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.elitedivingagency.com/articles/scuba-tank-gas-mixture-divers-use/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, as you stated astronaut\u0027s spacesuits do use pure oxygen So instead of using heavy tanks to hold the compressed oxygen it might work to carry water which would be electrolysized to produce oxygen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bob Clark\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
