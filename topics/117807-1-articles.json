The metabolism is slower, they do not need to waste energy to cool down (such as sweating) and for freshwater fish they simply dump ammonia into the water rather than process it to something less toxic. They also breath through their skin.

This is at 100% efficiency. I don\u0027t know what the best efficiency actually is now but we\u0027ll see the amount that can done be using batteries is so high that likely it can be better than using scuba tanks for the same weight.\n\n The ratio of oxygen to hydrogen in water by mass is 8 to 1. So using 16 megajoules of energy you get 8/9 of a kilo of oxygen. This means 16\\*(9/8) = 18 megajoules gives 1 kg of oxygen. As a rough estimate take the [amount of oxygen someone needs in 24 hours as about 1 kilo](http://members.shaw.ca/tfrisen/how_much_oxygen_for_a_person.htm).\n\n Now for the weight of batteries. See this table for a list of energy densities per weight:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materialsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materialsy)\n\n The best energy density among the commonly available batteries is the lithium battery (non-rechargeable) at 1.8 megajoules per kilo. Then to provide the 18 megajoules to get 1 kilo of oxygen you would need 18/1.8 = 10 kilos of the lithium batteries. I\u0027ll assume the weight of the system will be dominated by the weight of the batteries since electrolysis can be done simply by placing electrified wires in the water. So at 15 kilos of the batteries, the same weight as the scuba tank for 1 hour of breathing time, you would actually get enough oxygen for (15/10)\\*24 = 36 hours, a day and a half. Or said another way, to get enough oxygen for 1 hour would only take 10/24 = .42 kilos, less than a pound.\n\n Practical problems of course are for one how efficient is the electrolysis procedure? Also I believe the lithium batteries catch fire when wet. You would need to insure the battery casings are super-waterproof.\n\n![346px-Lithium_batteries_9v_AA_AAA.jpeg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Lithium_batteries_9v_AA_AAA.jpeg/346px-Lithium_batteries_9v_AA_AAA.jpeg)\n\n Then there is the weight of the electrolysis components, and the weight of the tank to hold the oxygen as it is being produced. You would also need to dispense with the hydrogen in a way to insure it does not combine with the oxygen to catch fire. It might be sufficient for this to mix it with surrounding water."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T03:58:09Z","Content":"Land animals also need to expend energy holding their bodies up with muscles, whereas fish are effectively weightless.
