An over-long pennant flopped forlornly over the car roof, twitching in the occasional snatch of breeze to reveal the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E tilted rocket logo trailing a longer than usual stream of fire. Passengers leaned out of the back windows, raising their drinks in salute. Judging by the colour of the cans, Leland was fairly sure that they weren\u2019t drinking sapwood.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe lifted a hand in thanks and drove on through the slowly moving carnival of traffic. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E logo fluttered from dozens of cars and vans, along with clusters of grey balloons and an eclectic profusion of homemade flags sporting an equally eclectic range of slogans. \u201CDestination: M\u00FCn!\u201D seemed to be a popular choice, closely followed by: \u201CPioneer 4 - All Systems Go!\u201D Leland snorted with laughter at the \u201CBring us back a M\u00FCn Rock, Jeb!\u201D banner rippling from the roof of an ancient electric bus, that was crammed to bursting with eager kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the side of the road, a crowd had gathered around a truck; it\u2019s owner cheerfully dispensing drinks and snacks from atop the trailer. Music blared out from a radio and a hastily scrawled cardboard sign declared the truck to be an unofficial mobile launch party. Inspired by this eminently sensible example, other drivers had followed suit and the number of vehicles crawling along the road to the Space Centre was very nearly matched by the number of vehicles parked on the verge. Sunlight twinkled from hundreds of binocular lenses, all trained on the distant rocket standing alone on its launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThudding music drifted through the air, growing steadily louder as the KBS van wound its way towards the Space Centre. The closer they got, the more Leland became convinced that the drummer was making a spirited attempt to murder one of the guitarists with his own instrument, or possibly vice-versa. He glanced over at the kerbal sitting in the passenger seat next to him, tapping his feet and nodding his head in time, a distant look on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can let you out here if you like, Don?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon shook his head. \u0022Sorry? Oh right, the music.\u0022 He grinned. \u0022They\u0027ve picked up a trick or two since Moho 1, haven\u0027t they? Nah, if we pull over here, you\u0027ll never get to the commentary box before the launch. Definitely going to get some interview footage down by the stage though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland swung the van round a bend and pulled up at a pair of heavy bollards blocking the road ahead. He wound down the window and held out a bundle of press passes for inspection by the serious looking kerbal standing by a booth at the side of the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022KBS?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland decided not to point out the large logo on the side of his vehicle, contenting himself with a nod and a scrupulously straight face whilst the guard peered in through the back windows at the rest of the KBS team, comparing faces to photographs and ticking off names on his clipboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hope he lets you through,\u0022 murmured Don under his breath. \u0022And doesn\u0027t ask any questions about the much younger kerbal on your pass.\u0022 He grunted as Leland elbowed him in the ribs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guard walked around to the driver\u0027s window and handed the bundle of passes back to Leland, who accepted them with a smile. It was not reciprocated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please keep to the left, sir, and follow the signs for parking area C. The VIP and Press spaces are in the smaller park to the right as you go in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the corner of his eye, Leland saw Don open his mouth. \u0022Keep to the left and take a right at the entrance to area C,\u0022 he said hastily. \u0022Thank you very much.\u0022 He wound up the window and watched the guard walk back to his booth. The bollards sank smoothly into the road and Leland cautiously edged the van forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo which are we - Press or VIPs?\u201D said Don cheerfully as they drove off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland sighed, \u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D he replied, \u201Cand I don\u2019t think our friend by the booth was in a mood to joke about it either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, he didn\u2019t seem the type for small talk,\u201D said Don, He spotted another, equally officious looking, kerbal standing by the junction, waving them through to the left. \u201CKerm, they\u2019re laying on the security today.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland lifted his hand politely to the second guard. \u201CNot surprising,\u201C he said, \u201CThere\u2019s going to be a lot of disappointed kerbals sent back to Barkton to watch the launch on the big screens, and I\u2019d be at least a bit worried that some of those roadside parties are going to get spirited later on.\u201D He glanced over his shoulder before swinging the van into the car park.\u201DNow where\u2019s our\u2026 ah, right.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA large KBS logo was painted on the road inside one of the parking bays. Leland drove over to it and switched off the motor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEverybody out!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon and his camera team began hauling equipment out of the back of the van. Leland pulled a spare headset and a cardboard folder stuffed with notes from the shelf under the dashboard and climbed out of the van.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal at the Press entrance was no less thorough about checking passes than the roadside guard had been but was considerably more cheerful about it. Leland spotted him surreptitiously tapping his foot in time to the latest drum-and-guitar extravaganza from the entertainment stage, and grinned to himself as Don joined in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the Space Centre the stands were full to bursting, with long queues stretching back from all the many concession booths. The aromas of grilling meats, spicy vegetable and mushroom skewers and hot \u003Cem\u003Edjan\u003C/em\u003E chips filled the air; carried aloft on ragged blue tendrils of smoke from portable barbecues. The music from the stage played on over a din of excited voices and Leland began to feel the familiar launch day flutters in the pit of his stomach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe field leading down to the stage was almost as crowded as the stands. Kerblets hurtled past, bumping into everyone, clutching model rockets and trailing large grey balloons behind them on long, brightly coloured ribbons. Near to the KBS team, a kermol couple watched their children playing, patiently holding two of the, temporarily forgotten, balloons. Leland studied them curiously for a moment, then burst out laughing at the familiar mottled pattern of dark and light greys and the the prominent flag-of-all-Kerbin, pointing to a spot in the middle of one of the dark grey patches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CM\u00FCn balloons! I like it!\u201D He tapped Don on the shoulder and pointed \u201CSomething for your two?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon eyed the queues at the Kerlington booth. \u201CIf there are any left by the time we\u2019re done.\u201D he grumbled. Then he grinned, \u201CI\u2019ll get one for you too. We can tie it to the van on the way home.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland chuckled. \u0022I\u0027d better get to the commentary box,\u0022 he said. \u0022Make sure you get some decent footage - and try not to spend all your time at the stage.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon signalled to his camera team, who picked up their equipment. \u0022No promises there!\u0022 he said cheerfully. \u0022Enjoy the launch - and try not to lose your voice again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, Leland gazed out of the commentary box window, collecting his thoughts, savouring the atmosphere, and taking in the panorama of crowds, futuristic Space Centre buildings and the distant launchpad with its waiting rocket. Then he walked over to the commentary desk, plugged in his headset and, glancing at the single sheet of scribbled notes in his hand, listened intently to the latest update from Mission Control, occasionally underlining a word or two or jotting down additional points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good afternoon everyone. I am Leland Kerman and this is KBS News, broadcasting live from the Barkton Space Centre. We are just ten minutes into the planned countdown hold at T minus thirty minutes, with the flight control team waiting for the expected confirmation of the KDS-4 launch. KDS-4 of course, is carrying the Munar lander together with the rocket stage that will boost it, and the Pioneer 4 capsule and service module - or CSM for short - to the M\u00FCn. The countdown to the CSM launch is progressing smoothly, with no other holds reported at this time. This is Leland Kerman at the Barkton Space Centre.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the next hour, Leland paced up and down the commentary box, listening to the quiet chatter from Mission Control and alternately staring out of the window or relaying such news as he had. Outside, the crowd had quietened, with any kerbal not responsible for kerblets, keeping a watchful eye on the countdown clock. Then, distantly, he heard the long awaited jangle of a telephone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good afternoon to everyone who\u0027s just tuned in. I am Leland Kerman and this is KBS news , reporting live from the Barkton Space Centre, for Pioneer 4\u0027s historic Munar landing attempt. We have just received confirmation from the Rockomax Crewed Spaceflight Centre that KDS4 has launched successfully and initial indications are that all vehicle systems are functioning nominally. KDS4 consists of the Kerbin departure stage, from which it takes its name, and the Munar lander. Once on orbit and docked to the capsule and service module, the Kerbin departure stage will boost the completed spacecraft out of Kerbin orbit and onwards to the M\u00FCn.\u0022 Leland paused. \u0022This is Leland Kerman at the Barkton Space Centre.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDown on the entertainment stage, a lone kerbal stepped forward and unplugged his guitar from the mass of equipment at his feet. The sound system popped and sputtered before sounding out a quickly strummed scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, Barkton. This is our last song of the afternoon so we\u2019re gonna take it down a notch and play you something a little different.\u0022 The singer stared at his feet for a long moment, then looked up at the immense crowd of kerbals in front of the stage. \u0022As some of you will know, Fire in the Sky have had the great honour and privilege to play at every crewed launch from the Barkton Space Centre since Jebediah Kerman\u0027s first journey into space.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe singer settled his guitar strap around his neck. \u0022We wrote this next song especially for this flight and we\u0027d like to dedicate it to the space program and everybody who made that happen. This one is called: \u0027You Never Know.\u2019\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single, pure chord rang out over the crowd, followed by another and then yet another. Shorn of all electronic effects, the sweet, deceptively simple melody sparkled in the air like cut glass before the entranced crowd. It spoke to them of the trackless void between the stars, of being far from home on a winters night and of the importance of having a hand to hold in the dark.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drummer picked up her sticks, laying down a muted but insistent percussion line. The bass player picked up the rhythm, adding subtle overtones to the building music. Then the second guitarist stepped up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe melody shifted up a key and suddenly, the lingering melancholy of the opening bars became a banner defying the night, a symbol of comradeship and a clarion call to the power of hope over adversity, that called on everyone at the Space Centre to never let go of their dreams.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...you never know till you try. Try to walk - ohhhh they\u0027re gonna walk. Gonna walk. Gonna walk on the M\u00FCn...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you Barkton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb broke the silence. \u201CWell that was\u2026where on Kerbin did they pull that from?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No answer here, Pioneer,\u0022 Geneney replied, \u0022but Bob is asking me to remind you, and I quote, \u0027I always told you there was more to those guys than three-chord overdrive.\u0027 \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well that\u0027s fine for him to say,\u0022 grumbled Jeb, \u0022He\u0027s not sitting here all suited up. Do you have any idea how hard it is to blow your nose in a space helmet, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s an image I \u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E need, Pioneer.\u0022 Geneney paused. \u0022OK, time to get serious, people. KDS4 is on orbit, all systems online and nominal. We\u0027re Go for countdown restart at T-minus thirty minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Flight,\u0027 Jeb said briskly. \u0022Malmy is standing by for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and SME pressurisation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus six minutes and counting. The pad team is clear and all gantries are at launch stations. Flight Director Geneney Kerman has begun his poll of the flight controllers and we are seeing no further holds as we approach the five minute mark.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSitting at his desk, Leland fidgeted with his headset microphone, clicking it back and forth on its pivot as he listened intently to the rapid-fire status reports from the flight control team.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus four minutes and counting. The spacecraft is just about to go to internal power and all flight controllers are reporting a Go for launch. From Commander Jebediah Kerman: \u0027We\u0027re feeling fine - tell the band we\u2019re gonna give it our best shot.\u2019\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus two minutes and counting. The flight team have transferred power to the booster and everything is looking good. Launch control confirms we have a Go for engine start.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFamiliar adrenalin pounded through Leland\u0027s veins and his voice began to shake in anticipation. \u0022T minus sixty seconds. Guidance is internal, autosequencer is Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus forty seconds. We have a launch commit on Pioneer 4. T minus thirty seconds and counting!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus twenty seconds\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus twelve...eleven...ten...nine...eight...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside in the Space Centre grounds, all eyes turned towards the launchpad. Fingers pressed \u00A0earplugs firmly into place; parents lifted kerblets onto their shoulders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Seven...six...five...four...three...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire blossomed over the launchpad. Leland surged to his feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ignition... and liftoff! We have a liftoff!\u0022 His voice soared exultantly over the watching crowds. \u0022Twenty-two minutes past the hour and liftoff on Pioneer 4!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe raw sound from the rocket engines hammered against the commentary box windows, making it difficult to think, let alone talk. Down below he could see even the older kerblets racing around in circles, shrieking with excitement. A roiling inferno of smoke billowed out from the launchpad; from it\u0027s centre, the rocket climbed skywards on a painfully bright spear of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tower clear! Next stop - M\u00FCn!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4\u003C/em\u003E thundered past the launch tower, the river of fire pouring out of its engines still washing over the pad. Leland was dimly aware of somebody shouting \u0022Go! Go! Go!\u0022 into his headset but fortunately nobody else seemed to be able to hear it over the noise battering at them. The booster marked twice its own length in flame above the launchpad and then its own length again, the ragged trailing edge of its exhaust plume finally clearing the tower too. Leland watched the rocket accelerate towards the clouds, the incandescent trail behind it curving out over the Great Tranquil Sea and tearing the sky asunder with furious noise and fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland pushed his headset back into place.\u0022Pitch and roll program complete,\u0022 he said hoarsely, \u0022and dear Kerm above, I\u0027ve watched every launch from the Barkton Space Centre since Moho 1, but let me tell you - you just never get used to the sheer raw \u003Cem\u003Epower\u003C/em\u003E of those machines.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Decouplers A through C armed. Go for T20 shutdown and detach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAboard Pioneer 4, Jeb struggled to turn his head against the mounting g-forces shoving him into his couch. Squinting out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malmy\u2019s finger pointing at the control panel. Three lights winked out on the instrument panel and he just had time to register three muffled bangs far below him before the sudden drop in acceleration flung him forward against his harness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COoof. Flight, Pioneer 4. T20 detach confirmed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Pioneer. We see them gone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first time since lift-off, Jeb allowed himself to relax a fraction and for a moment his thoughts turned faintly melancholy. If Lodan was right, the space program was set to become bigger than even he had ever imagined - but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E would only be one small part of the whole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis gaze flickered around the capsule, resting briefly on each of his crew and then returning to the instrument panel in front of them. He snorted at himself in disgust. \u003Cem\u003EJeb - you\u2019re flying to the M\u00FCn in a spacecraft in which every last nut, bolt, rivet, bulkhead and circuit board owes its roots to six kerbals working out of the back of a junkyard.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd nobody will ever be able to take \u003C/em\u003Ethat \u003Cem\u003Eaway from us.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned, melancholy forgotten. Above his head, the altimeter raced past thirty thousand metres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe are now just over a minute and a half into the flight. Pioneer 4 is a little over thirty kilometres high, travelling at one point three kilometres per second. Downrange distance from the launchpad is just under twenty eight kilometres.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, the crowd silently waited for the, now traditional, affirmation from Mission Control. Leland glanced at the clock, twisting his headset cord between his fingers. Then, right on schedule, the public address system popped to life, Geneney Kerman\u2019s measured tones rolling over the Space Centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThirty-six kilometres. Pioneer 4 - your trajectory and guidance are Go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland clenched his fists exultantly, the sudden roar from the crowd drowning out any reply from Pioneer 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENext stop - M\u00FCn. And may they have the strength to follow their course.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other side of Kerbin, wherever the skies were clear enough, kerbals braved the chilly evening air in their thousands to send Pioneer 4 on its way. Observatories offered guided tours and a chance to watch the departure through their telescopes. Professional and amateur astronomers alike offered their services to friends, family or, more often than not, impromptu groups of strangers. Some had telescopes of their own, others watched through binoculars. Those that had neither simply stared up at the sky and crossed their fingers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Pioneer 4. Our board is green; requesting telemetry check.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u2019s voice crackled out from countless radio sets.\u00A0 Gloved fingers twisted dials, trying to tune out the worst of the static.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 4, Flight. We copy your board is green. Stand by.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radios fell silent. The sky-watching crowds milled around anxiously, hands tucked under heavy outdoor ponchos, stamping their feet to work some little warmth back into frozen toes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTelemetry confirmed.

KDS ignition in twelve minutes and counting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOlder kerbals reached under their clothing to retrieve ornate timepieces from around their necks. Notebooks fell open to well thumbed pages. Astronomers handed out photocopied star maps, identifying constellations, pointing out where \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4\u003C/em\u003E was due to appear in the night sky and occasionally took a map from a confused-looking kerbal, turned it upside down and gently handed it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 4, Flight.

Thirty seconds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar away from Mission Control, all eyes turned skywards. Binoculars swung up, hunting for the right stars. Telescope owners made last second adjustments to focus and angles with fingers that trembled even inside their gloves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...three\u2026two\u2026one\u2026Ignition!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new comet burst into view over Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwestruck kerbals shook their companions by the shoulder, pointing wordlessly at the sky. One telescope owner reluctantly lifted her head from the eyepiece and stared up at the sky blinking water out of her eyes. A huge smile lit up her face as she saw the glowing trail pointing the way from the last sliver of setting sun out to the starry skies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEight dot two kps.

Clear telemetry links through primary and backup channels.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor several long minutes the crowds watched in wonder, frozen feet all but forgotten. Then, as abruptly as it had appeared, the comet vanished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ten dot two kps. Ten dot... and shutdown! We\u0027re running the numbers, Pioneer but that looks like a good burn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the days that followed, schools across Kerbin sprouted \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4 \u003C/em\u003Eposters and activity charts from every classroom wall. Final year students - and their teachers - struggled with equations and proudly marked off distances and velocities. The youngest kerblets, with no less pride, coloured in pictures of Kerbin and the M\u00FCn and filled in boxes along stylised flight paths with the days of the week, written in big, careful letters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStudents of all ages, whether Doreni, Wakiran or Kolan, put the finishing touches on model rockets and M\u00FCn landers that ran the gamut from lovingly constructed, glue-smeared assemblies of cardboard boxes, empty plastic bottles and tinfoil, to replica spacecraft that, in the words of Ornie Kerman to one delighted, final year class: \u201Cyou could fill up with fuel and I\u2019d fly it myself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the fields and Groves, the surest way for a kermol to make him or herself popular was to bring a portable radio along for the day\u2019s work and keep it permanently tuned to KBS Space News. A close-run second way was to bring a spare set of batteries for somebody else\u2019s otherwise defunct radio. Lunchtimes saw groups of kermol gathered together, perched on whatever impromptu seat came to hand and listening to the latest news or broadcast from \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4\u003C/em\u003E. In the evenings, kerbals crammed themselves into packed village halls to watch the evening KBS bulletins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear a bleak mountain range bordering Firesvar, Wakira and Kolus, a lone soldier set out across the tundra, carrying a pair of fabric wrapped poles. In full view of the border forces of all three Regionalities, he, or possibly she, laid down their weapons, took thirty-seven measured paces and planted both poles in the ground. Before long, two makeshift banners flapped in the wind, one daubed with the flag of all Kerbin and the other with a tilted rocket streaming fire. A gloved hand retrieved a radio from a field pack and presently Leland Kerman\u0027s tinny voice drifted over the tundra.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn time, the other sides sent out their own volunteers and they too put down their weapons and sat down beneath the flags. More soldiers came to join them and then still more. One squad rigged up a portable field shelter, another produced water bottles, kettles and camp stoves. Rations were shared out and, regardless of origin, commiserated on by all. One sergeant unearthed a bottle of distilled redfruit juice from his pack and neither his squad mates, nor the suddenly much cheerier kerbals around them, felt inclined to point out the numerous standing orders that he was breaching. Teams were dispatched to fetch additional supplies, tents and, most importantly, extra radios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlong border after disputed border, kerbals of all Regionalities came together under the twin flags and, for an all to brief handful of days, Kerbin was reunited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the towns and cities, enterprising cinema proprietors began running regular \u2018M\u00FCn Matinees\u2019 for their customers to watch the latest, often shaky, film footage from space. Queues quickly became legendary with especially keen kerbals bringing sleeping bags and snacks, the better to wait through the night for the first morning show. Kerbals walking to work in the morning treated the queues with tolerant good humour, some making impromptu coffee runs for waiting friends or family, others hastily booking a quick day off and joining the same queue that evening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the drive-in cinemas, long the exclusive haunt of young kerman couples, were as likely to be showing starscapes and spacecraft as the latest date night movie. To the delight of local news outlets everywhere, more than a few young kerman unexpectedly met their future in-laws for the first time at the local outdoor screen, introduced to them by a blushing, stammering partners.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the Capital building, seven huge screens were hastily erected between its rearmost arches, and semi-circles of temporary bleachers set up in front of them. By the second day of \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es flight, construction workers and the occasional curious tourist were camped out on the bleachers, watching the latest news from space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the end of the third day, the bleachers were full and by the end of the fourth day they were mere islands in a sea of green faces. Those with seats gradually gave them up for the elderly or parents with the youngest kerblets. A handful stayed where they were, unfocused eyes staring unseeing through the crowds. In their minds eye, they too were strapped into a space capsule, Kerbin behind them, M\u00FCn to the fore; living vicariously on the very edge of kerballed experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing this well, their friends simply smiled understandingly and gently led them away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the morning of the fifth day, the crowds watched in astonishment as a troop of kerbals hurried out from a side door and set up a lectern and set of twelve ornate chairs in front of the centre screen. Other discreetly dressed kerbals fanned out through the bleachers, murmuring into radio microphones clipped to their lapels. Then, amidst a sudden hush, the back doors to the Capital building opened and a group of figures emerged. Bowing to the crowds as they went, the Council of Twelve Pillars took their seats and like countless other kerbals across the world they sat in silence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nListening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWaiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlight Elapsed Time - 4 days, 3 hours, 42 minutes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMunar orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn board \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRadar is tracking.

Swiftly, she slotted the replacement circuit-breaker into place, twisted and pushed\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe warning light blinked off; the computer display flickering for a second as data flooded in from the landing radar. Jondun stowed the broken circuit breaker and hastily tapped out a command. \u201CFlight, Pioneer.

For a second, Pioneer 4 dropped away from underneath him and then came to rest with a firm thud. The two kerbonauts waited tensely for a moment then, satisfied that they weren\u2019t about to tip over, flashed each other a quick, triumphant grin before starting the post-landing checklist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbort stage override to auto.

He mopped his brow with a sodden handkerchief and summoned up a wan smile before visibly pulling himself together. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe flight control teams will be working with the crew right now to check over the lander systems.

Flight director Geneney Kerman has just given the crew a Go for the extended stay and surface EVA! They have quite a lot to do before then, so we\u2019re going to take a break before bringing you the latest updates from the Barkton Space Centre and the Rockomax Crewed Spaceflight Centre. Then - and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this - in a little over four hours time we\u2019ll be going live to the M\u00FCn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a hundred thousand television screens across Kerbin, white noise and static abruptly gave way to an alien landscape of sharp-edged craters, stark grey plains and a midnight sky. The view shifted, the unseen camera panning past an expanse of crinkled metal foil, before focussing on the foot of a spindly ladder and behind it, the end of a jointed metal leg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMission Control confirms - both kerbonauts are suited up and the hatch is open.\u201D Leland\u2019s voice rang with barely suppressed excitement. \u201CCommander Jebediah Kerman is on his hands and knees\u2026backing out of the hatchway\u2026and he\u2019s on the ladder!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn orange and grey boot came into sight, followed by a heavily padded spacesuit leg and then the corner of a bulky backpack. Millions of watching kerbals caught their first glimpse of an orange, fabric-clad shoulder and then finally the reflective visor of a spacesuit helmet. Holding firmly on to the ladder rungs, the suited figure paused for a long minute, then took a step back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb took another cautious step, letting the ground beneath his feet take his full weight before letting go of the ladder and walking out onto the Munar surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd there it is! Jebediah Kerman takes his first steps onto the M\u00FCn! We appear to have lost the sound - hopefully that\u2019s just a temporary fault with our transmitter and not a problem with any of the spacecraft equipment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb turned to face the lander hatch, head unseen inside his mirrored helmet. The camera tilted up to follow Jondun\u2019s white and grey figure as she too climbed down the ladder and stepped out onto the M\u00FCn. She paused for a moment and then bounded away from the lander, camera tracking her as she went.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd kerbonaut Jondun Kerman joins her commander. We still have no sound at this time but clearly that is not a problem at Mission Control and is not affecting this historic moment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb retrieved a thin aluminium tube from one of the ladder rails before walking over to join Jondun. Before the puzzled eyes of the world, both kerbonauts turned their backs to the camera\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh my. Would you look at that. Would you just \u003Cem\u003Elook \u003C/em\u003Eat that.\u201D Leland\u2019s voice caught in his throat. On the screen in front of him, two mirrored helmets faced one another across a landscape of grey. An orange glove clasped a white glove. And between them, in the background, the flag of all Kerbin flew proudly above the Munar plains.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orange suited figure turned towards the camera:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COn this day we - voyagers from the planet Kerbin\u2026 first set foot upon the M\u00FCn.

They watched in awe and then delight as tentative jumps turned into increasingly confident rolling lopes; two figures bounding foot to foot across the Munar plains. They laughed aloud at the orange-suited figure\u2019s exuberant leap, soaring high and then floating, unnaturally slowly, down to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor nearly an hour, Jeb and Jondun held an enthralled world in the palms of their gloved hands. Their high-technology suits, the harsh, ethereal beauty of the landscape around them and the disconcerting nearness of the horizon, all served as potent reminders of exactly where they were. In turn, that knowledge added weight to their every least action: walking, talking, climbing back up the lander ladder to retrieve equipment boxes, taking photographs or just simply standing next to the flag for a moment to catch their breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E----------\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb opened the largest equipment box and carefully unpacked a pair of delicate looking instruments and two spools of cable. He plugged one cable into a socket on the descent stage and carefully unrolled it over the ground, propping it up on a pair of small clips to keep it clear of surface dust. The camera zoomed in to watch him work, treating the watching kerbals to a view of two wooden clothes pegs, of the kind to be found on washing lines all over Kerbin, resting in the Munar dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb bounced back to the lander, retrieved his instruments and, stepping slowly and carefully, made his way back to the end of the cables. He plugged in the larger, boxier instrument, laid it carefully on the regolith and pressed a button on its lid. Two photovoltaic panels popped free from its sides, there was a brief pause and then a green light glowed brightly from one corner. The second cable fitted into a socket near the opposite corner connecting the box to what appeared to be a bundle of rods, wrapped in gold foil at one end.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the touch of a button the rods sprang open, unfolding into a gold foil umbrella mounted on a tripod. Jeb planted it firmly into the dust, bending over to inspect a panel attached to one of its legs. He straightened up, gave a thumbs up to the watching camera and loped away out of view. The camera panned right, zooming in on Jondun whilst the voiceover from KBS News busily explained that the boxy instrument was the first in a planned network of Munar seismometers for subsurface mapping, and that the golden umbrella was a combined radiation counter, thermometer and solar wind analyser. A different voice commented that the risk was low for Pioneer 4 but that the radiation data would be invaluable for planning longer stays on the M\u00FCn or even permanent bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the camera zoomed in on Jondun, who was picking up a small chunk of rock with a pair of tongs and placing it in a plastic bag. She closed the bag and pressed one end against a fabric patch on her upper arm, where it joined the two other bags already fastened in place. Methodically, she worked her way around the landing site collecting samples as she went. From here, a scoop of dust and rock fragments; from there, a trowel load of smaller pebbles; from elsewhere a single, larger rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, all too soon, it was over. First Jondun and then Jeb climbed up the ladder and disappeared into the lander cabin, closing the hatch behind them.

One hundred metres, closing at point five.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two spacecraft drifted closer together, brief pulses of flame jetting out from the lander thrusters as Jeb made tiny, last minute corrections to their course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, slowing up. Point three\u2026point two. Twenty metres out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander bumped gently into the capsule\u0027s blunt conical nose, thrusters pulsing in response.

We\u2019ll open the hatch, let the overpressure blow all the dust to the bottom.

Cabin pressure holding nicely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJondun felt the faint clunk of withdrawing bolts through the lander hull. Air rushed through in a gentle blizzard of swirling dust particles. She waited for the cabin pressure gauge to settle and then, with a sigh of relief, she twisted her helmet free of its locking ring and lifted it over her head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMmm - fresh air. Fresher air anyway.\u201D Jondun disconnected her suit from the lander systems, peeled off its grimy outer layer and wriggled through the open hatch.\u00A0 Silently, Jeb passed her the surface sample box before removing his own helmet. He took a last, long look around the lander cabin, shucked the outer layer of his suit and pulled himself up and out into the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy was waiting for him. He held out a hand then, laughing at Jeb\u2019s expression, gripped his commander by the shoulders and hugged him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou made it, boss - you finally made it!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb coughed. \u201CWith a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of help from Rockomax.\u201D He grinned at the startled, hastily hidden, look on Jondun\u2019s face. \u201CGuess we owe them a hug or two as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJondun raised an eyebrow. \u201CI think I\u2019ll settle for just walking on the M\u00FCn,\u201D she said dryly. \u201CAlthough right now, I\u2019d settle for getting out of this pressure suit too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E----------\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHours later, trans-Kerbin injection behind them, the \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 4\u003C/em\u003E capsule and service module climbed away from Munar orbit on a homebound trajectory.

The M\u00FCnwalk was\u2026busy. Lots on the checklist and not really enough time. Downtime by the flag though\u2026looking at that weirdly close horizon, no good way of judging distance\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo dust clouds,\u201D said Jeb. \u201CFunny, but even more than the gravity, that\u2019s what really got to me. I\u2019d scuff a boot through the dirt and all these little particles would shoot straight up and out and disappear. Makes sense when you think about it but\u2026 yeah, I think that\u2019s when I finally realised where I was.\u201D He eyed the radio. \u201CI wonder what they made of it back home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAccording to Gene, the Capital came to a complete standstill,\u201C said Malmy, \u201CThey had a set of big screens up around the Capital Building itself - folks came to watch the launch and just stayed right through. They\u2019re probably still there now. Seems that you can\u2019t buy a radio for love or money these days either - anyone who couldn\u2019t be near a screen bought themselves one to keep up with the KBS broadcasts. KBS are still trying to work out the listening figures but apparently they gave up counting in real numbers and switched over to using percentage of total population instead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb blinked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpeaking of the Capital,\u201D Jondun murmured. \u201CI wonder what the Council are doing right now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was wondering that too, \u201C said Jeb. He shook his head. \u201CStill figuring out how to sell the Duna program I imagine. Kerm knows how that\u2019s going to work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio squawked in the sudden silence. \u201CPioneer 4, Flight.

One that may force us to re-learn what it is to be kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But here we can take consolation from another great philosopher. One who taught us that the mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be lit!

To understand why the Kerm are led to fight amongst themselves and learn whether we kerbals can help them to live together without conflict or Blight.
