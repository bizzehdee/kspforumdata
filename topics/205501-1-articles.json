I downloaded Jnsq for better graphics but i think i did something wrong while modding. I checked the version and its correct. The loading screen is from jnsq but the main game textures didnt change.

It alters planets\u0027 characteristics, including the scale of the solar system, and makes the game more difficult. Depending on how new you are to KSP and how much challenge you like, it may or may not be too soon for JNSQ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022the main game textures didnt change\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJNSQ has dependencies on other mods for graphics.

I\u0027ve used JNSQ with and without TweakScale and they aren\u0027t dependencies of each other. It looks like you might have multiple mod installation issues, since JNSQ dependencies are missing, and something unrelated might be happening with TweakScale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what is \u003Cstrong\u003EModuleManagerWatchDog\u003C/strong\u003E?

Get to grips with the stock game first, understand how things work, and then once you have a bit of experience add some mods in. All those shiny mods seem very tempting but can easily become too much too fast; my first attempts at modding KSP made it balloon out of control with too many parts to deal with and too many systems to try and understand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you understand the basics, add a few mods if you want- some visual improvements e.g. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer, a few parts mods to plug some gaps in the stock lineup or add something new (engines, power systems, ship/base/station parts\u2026) and some quality of life mods such as MechJeb or Bon Voyage which can make things easier- and also help you understand some of the more complex aspects of spaceflight by watching how it should be done and copying it. There are more layers you can add- part failures, life support, crew health and more- but again it\u2019s better to ease yourself in rather than jumping in at the deep end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJNSQ is a great planet pack and very rewarding, but it\u2019s also more than double the scale of the stock system- orbital velocity around JNSQ Kerbin is higher than escape velocity for stock Kerbin- so is noticeably harder in terms of the delta-V needed to go anywhere. I don\u2019t recommend jumping right into it without first getting to grips with the stock system, but once you have some experience it\u2019s definitely worth a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
