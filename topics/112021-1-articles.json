It has sent up many other payloads (notably for the military) ever since its debut launch in 2004.\n\nIt\u0027s very stable and rather simple to control, especially with SAS on (For some odd reason.)\n\nIt comes in two versions - it\u0027s conventional layout (Fill it with a payload of your choice), or an Orion EFT-1 attached on it (Different fairings, different payloads.)\n\nDelta IV Heavy - Conventional\n\nWith a normal layout and conventional fairings, this doesn\u0027t come with a payload, although it can be flown as is.\n\nIt should be able to take up to 7.5 tons without modifications to the launcher itself. Be careful though - Without payload, it\u0027s slightly wobbly!\n\n![EqWWl8T.png](http://i.imgur.com/EqWWl8T.png)\n\nAs a test, let\u0027s launch it with a tiny fuel tank to LKO.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Although slightly more stable, it needs a very precise ascent.\n\n![aK9vDxW.png](http://i.imgur.com/aK9vDxW.png)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
