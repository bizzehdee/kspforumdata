Currently there are still a few outstanding issues - music\u0027s muffled too, the audio clicks that KSP makes are somewhat more noticable, and it sometimes turns itself off. Also, if you\u0027re on speakers or something with minimal low frequency reproduction, you won\u0027t hear much of anything (it\u0027s utterly silent by the end on my laptop speakers). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few more issues are fixed, I\u0027ll set up a config file for it, that allows you to specify how much you want the audio muffled, whether you want it active at all, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelease time TBD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T21:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds awesome!
