Back in 0.90 I had created a nice orbital Minmus base with a core that was a Class-C asteroid. I would tug up fuel from Kerbin and use that to refuel a lander that was going down to the surface base, visit various biomes or complete various mission on Minmus. The base had a lab for resetting the science instruments on the lander and several docking ports for docking other vessels. Worked pretty well and was a lot of fun. Now with resource mining this sounds like an even better idea. Since I could mine and refine the ore right on the asteroid for use. I assume the amount of ore is somewhat proportional to the asteroids mass? Is there a percentage range of ore you can expect from an asteroid? What does the various scanners return when you scan an asteroid?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had thought asteroids had a 90% ore rating, or thereabouts.
