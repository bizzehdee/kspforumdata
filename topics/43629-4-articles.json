Here\u0027s the behavior I currently see: Once apoapsis reaches the desired altitude, the engines cut off (other than small burps to overcome drag). The ship remains pointed prograde until it clears the atmosphere. At that time, MJ plots the circularization maneuver and turns the ship to face the node. Post-circularization, the MJ disengages and the ship typically tumbles a bit because the maneuver nodes drifts during the last little bit of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is different about the proposed behavior (\u0022just to keep it steady\u0022)?

I use an 8km/60km/-5*/50% curve, since I find that leaves more fuel in my 2nd stage once the orbit is circular. I aim for a 90km equatorial orbit. My first stage is spent around 21km/2min, leaving stage 2 to finish the job. MECO is just shy of 54km and 5min after launch. The ship is prograde in a 91x48 orbit. I see occasional puffs from the engine when drag pulls the apoapsis below 90km, and the three control input axes show tiny twitches to pitch (I roll 90 degrees during vertical ascent, so the ground is \u0022down\u0022 on the navball). The ship coasts for about 4 minutes before it clears the atmosphere and MJ plots circularization. While in atmo, if I tap a button to induce yaw or pitch, I see a counter input once I release the key, and the ship goes back to prograde (with a brief oscillation once it is there). SAS is not on. This leads me to think something is actively managing my facing.
