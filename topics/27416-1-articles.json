Not eccentricity, not inclination. As long as your satellites are in nearly circular, nearfly 0^ inclination orbits, if they have a 6:00:00 period they\u0027ll be fine. Not being totally circular or 0^ inclination will mean they wobble about a fixed point in the sky by a very short distance, like Ike does at Duna, but it won\u0027t be enough to break an RT connection. Of course, it\u0027s nearly impossible to get precisely a 6:00:00 orbital period, but as long as you\u0027re off by no more than 1/2 a second, you\u0027ll be fine for a decade or so, then will only need a slight nudge to get back where you want to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you focus on orbital period, you only need 3 kerbostationary satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T00:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Geshosskopf said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I put Comstilation (My name for com sat program) sats up I follow the following process. First I launch to a curricular 100k orbrit. Then when I am on the opposite side of KSC, I raise my apoapsis to 2868.7 KM. When I get there I am 1/4 turn away from KSC. I then raise my orbit until its period is 4:30. I can usually hit this within a second or so. Then every time I get to apoapsis I am 1/4 turn ahead of last time. I release a sat and have it raise the orbit until a 6 hour period. I normally can get within 1/2 a second. This produces a perfect square that lasts many days. You need some sort of thruster on the sat, or simply releasing it introduces enough error to limit your sat network life it about 100 days. Also if you have a thruster on the sat itself you can then leave your deployment craft on its 4:30 orbit for the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis setup will release 4 sats instead of 3 but this only means that they can drift longer before it becomes a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t be that hard to modify for 3 sats. From 100k you boost 1/4 ahead of KSC. You will reach apoapsis above KSC. Boost for a 4 hour orbit instead of 4:30. Release a sat and extend for 6 hour period.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T00:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scorpians\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scorpians\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESignal can be patchy from remote tech due to my satalites going out of geosynchronous orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just want to be clear on the issue: The problem is maintaining the link from KSC to your orbital satellites, right?
