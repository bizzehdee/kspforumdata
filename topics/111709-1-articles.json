The system says I have 38 flights in progress but I have only 6 vessels flying about and I\u0027ve been, I thought, very good about terminating anything I\u0027ve left lying about. During my last launch, using one of those \u0027O so purty\u0027 fairings, I noticed an unidentified object crossing near my vessel. It was not listed on anything and I could not click on it to get any data. Looking through my save file, I found many entries for [Vessel] Debris.\n\nRealism is fine and dandy but not when it destroys system performance. Is there anyway, other than manually, to clear out all of the vessel entries for just debris? If not, I will have to create another profile and start over (and stay the heck away from those darned fairings)."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:56:04Z","Content":"Have you tried lowering the max persistent debris in the settings menu?"},{"CreatedByName":"MLWostal","CreatedById":134330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:05:06Z","Content":"Sorry but I do not see any setting for max persistent anything in the settings.
