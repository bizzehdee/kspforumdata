Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427. Employee Number 427\u0027s job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley. Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No-one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say Hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened - this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, I\u0027ll start the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStanley wandered through the office, searching for some clue as to where his coworkers had gone\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__________________________________________________ ___________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-07T07:42:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2014 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Icarus_Vice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IcarusBen","CreatedById":173604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T22:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShameless bump.
