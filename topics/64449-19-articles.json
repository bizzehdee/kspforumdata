The editor limitations and how to overcome them are hard to grasp for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- good handling in atmospheric flight - I think this is important for stock craft as mostly new players will try these.

Pretty cool design and it has a ton of range. It\u0027s a little on the advanced side as far as construction goes. The intake stacking isn\u0027t something a beginner should be shown in a stock design, but it\u0027s pretty useful for advanced SSTO designs.
