I can see the very obvious reason for this, with the lack of thermal energy venting. However, I don\u0027t think the addition of heat mechanics contributes to good gameplay.

Nor am I seeing working examples of any kind of ship. That is pretty telling in and of itself but let\u0027s go back to the jets. You would think a jet powered by an antimatter reactor would be able to reach at least mach 2 speeds in the lower atmosphere but that seems to be a stretch right now. Before - on .5.something the turbojets would put out a few thousand kn of thrust on one of my designs and it would seem to be a good amount of thrust but I really was not impressed even then. Now it seems like the engines have been nerfed further and they are 100% useless now, putting out only a few hundred kn of thrust. If there is a combination with high thrust now, it is certainly way too large to fit on a fighter craft.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only think you must be doing something wrong if you think this to be the case.

It was a pretty dart-shaped aircraft, not a lot of lift to it. Loads of air intakes jammed on. Basically after clearing about 15-20km I\u0027d drop the nose to 5 degrees above the horizon and just burn like hell. I needed to throttle the jets back as it climbed to avoid a flameout, but by keeping on as much power as I could with the nose just up a little bit it would accelerate to about 2,200m/s, at which point the jets would stop producing thrust (their exhaust velocity now matching the airspeed). They were each producing newtons of thrust, not kN any more when I lit the ion engine. It\u0027s easier to do with Mechjeb handling the throttle as it can jets right up to the absolute razor\u0027s edge of flaming out so you can get a lot more from them doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at work at the minute but I\u0027ll see if I can find the craft file when I get home if you\u0027d like?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
