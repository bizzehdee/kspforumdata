Prior to this, SpaceX had not lost a Falcon 9 rocket (18/18).\n\nAbout 1 month ago, SpaceX was granted permission to launch Department of Defense (DoD) payloads. For the past 10 years, only ULA (joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing) have been allowed to launch for DoD, and have been charging $200-$500 Million each flight. SpaceX has stated they will do it for $90 million, and would be able to win every open bid again them.\n\nULA fought against this as hard as they could, paying some very powerful congressmen against this. ULA\u0027s only argument, and hope to continue their monopoly and win bids was to make a case that SpaceX was not safe enough. The only problem is that the Falcon 9 has the best track record yet.\n\nI believe ULA directly caused todays Falcon 9 rocket failure. I believe they did this using Lockheed Martin\u0027s new anti-rocket laser.\n\nFalcon9 explosion: *Obs: take a look at the second stage.* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czvv1uoKKew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czvv1uoKKew)\n\nHere is a demonstration video of Lockheed Martin\u0027s (ULA\u0027s) new anti-rocket laser:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dL9_Tldmrhs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIf you watch the Falcon 9 rocket at the moments before it is destroyed, you will see smoke/vapor coming out of the 2nd stage. Compare this to the demonstration video of the laser. They look remarkably similar."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:17:52Z","Content":"Laserbeams can\u0027t melt jet fuel !!!!1"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:19:41Z","Content":"No. Just... stop it.

But the risk is untenable, to attempt the specific OP scenario defies logic. It would be an all-or-nothing gamble. A rocket launch of this nature is observed, tracked, logged, dissected, and analyzed by incredibly smart folks. \n\n This idea has been discarded on the main SpaceX thread: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is sci-fi unlikely. It\u0027s hard enough targeting a camera at a flying rocket, but aiming a laser with such precision that it can burn through the rocket is orders of difficulty harder.\n\u003E  If there \\*had\\* been a laser targeting the rocket, then on infrared we would have seen the rocket itself light up ahead of the exhaust trail for several seconds before it went boom. This is because it would take time for the laser to heat up the skin of the rocket sufficiently to cause structural failure. There might have been atmospheric heating effects, but we would not have seen them because the laser would be sweeping rapidly through the air, never heating any bit of air for long enough for us to see it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Adding to what softweir already said, we have indications of faulty readings in the second stage (= we know that something went wrong inside the rocket), so there is no point in even investigating if the launch could have somehow been sabotaged.
