For the past 10 years, only ULA (joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing) have been allowed to launch for DoD, and have been charging $200-$500 Million each flight. SpaceX has stated they will do it for $90 million, and would be able to win every open bid again them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EULA fought against this as hard as they could, paying some very powerful congressmen against this. ULA\u0027s only argument, and hope to continue their monopoly and win bids was to make a case that SpaceX was not safe enough.
