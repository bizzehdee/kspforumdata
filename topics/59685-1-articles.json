You see, unlike in KSP, there isn\u0027t really much reason to put a man in space aside from saying \u0022we did it!\u0022, because we don\u0027t need a person to pick up a rock, we have robots to do that. I mean sure, there is a bit of medical science to be gained, but this is at the cost of trillions of dollars, years of work, and risking human lives. The biggest reason to land a man anywhere nowadays is for the P.R. Think of how much money a private company could get (Like SpaceX) if they landed the first man on Mars. The media would go wild, and every contractor in the world would be lining up to get their signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in the long-term (decades to centuries from now), space colonization will be a great way of (as Michio Kaku adequately put it) keeping all of our eggs out of one basket. Right now, if something happens to Earth (like a giant meteor), the human race as we know it would die (and yes, something that large would surely throw enough debris and heat into orbit to destroy the ISS, not to mention the fact that the ISS would be out of a food source if they did somehow survive). Colonizing Mars would allow the human race to continue if Earth were destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the long-long-term (millions to billions of years from now), space exploration will be vital to the human race, because the Sun will go into the red giant stage, and the Earth itself will either (at best) have it\u0027s atmosphere stripped away, and have a molten surface, or (at worse) be enveloped by the Sun\u0027s expanding surface, and be destroyed completely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T01:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont really get concept of farming in space.

The Earth\u0027s population is still increasing, up to the estimated 10 billion person carrying capacity of the planet. Most of these people are in developing nations where the crude birth rate greatly exceeds the crude death rate, leading to a population increase. When we reach carrying capacity, those people will no longer be able to sustain themselves, and will (how do I put this softly) die off. This increases the crude death rate to meet the crude birth rate, thereby stabilizing the population. We (you, I, and most of the people on the forums) are lucky. We live in developed nations with more than enough money to import crops from elsewhere, despite the increased food cost. As cruel as it sounds, our nations may just sit back, accept the temporary increase in food costs, and ride the famine out. Once enough people (unfortunately) die, the population will have dropped significantly below the planet\u0027s carrying capacity. This in turn will cause a decrease in food prices and the population will begin to rise again. The cycle will continue to repeat itself until it reaches an equilibrium. And it is possible to reach equilibrium. Look at Japan, in which the crude death rate exceeds the crude birth rate. Their population is decreasing due solely to the fact that people are willingly reproducing only once, or not at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as water is concerned, we have absolutely NO shortage of it. The planet is 75% water. Developed countries can afford massive desalination plants on the cost to supply them with water.

Land locked nations are a different story, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, given the time frame of 41 years, I fear it is too late to avert such as disaster.
