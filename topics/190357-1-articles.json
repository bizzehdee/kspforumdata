Others will be able to do that.

Sure you could use one of \u0027dem \u0027der fancy new fangled word processing softwares, but I could never get \u0027em to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you will want to do is write a script, and plan. There is a saying that for every fifteen minutes spent planning your video you save roughly three hours of shooting. Of course there is an upper limit, but moving from no script to a moderate amount of script you will save yourself a lot of reshoots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLearn about storyboards. They will help you to frame each scene in the video. And, let you order the shots for the best flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, you could do it without any of that if you are skilled, lucky, or both. But, when the skilled, lucky, or both do it, that\u0027s when the great videos happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-14T19:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to Fan Works, where the video makers hang around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_AZ","CreatedById":201849,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T22:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done my last couple of videos in DaVinci Resolve and really like it.\u00A0 I use OBS to capture game footage then drop it into DaVinci.\u00A0 I run pure stock with DLC in the game so I can\u0027t really recommend any mods but from those that I\u0027m aware of camera tools would probably be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
