I don\u0027t really care about the difficulty of locating biomes with resources and such, so is there a\u00A0way I can edit the game files or install a mod to make the entire Minmus surface covered in recoverable ore or make the drill always dig up ore anywhere at the fastest rate possible?

In the save the only value that matters, is the GameSeed value of ResourceScenario section. So you can\u0027t fine tune anything in save - only throw the dice again for all the distribution in the whole solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr - if you\u0027re allowed to mod the game itself rather than only the save file, then you can go to GameData\\Squad\\Resources\\Ore.cfg. It\u0027s pretty self evident - you can probably achieve what you want by just changing (poor man\u0027s method: directly change the file; preferred method: write your own \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch) the MinAbundance value to be equal to MaxAbundance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
