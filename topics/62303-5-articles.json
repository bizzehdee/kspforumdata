This helps keep FOSS commercially valuable, and though a KSP plugin isn\u0027t likely to make-or-break the FOSS movement, it\u0027s important to remember that people who use your software to make money aren\u0027t necessarily out to exploit, often they recontribute and make everything better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like to make explicit restrictions, that\u0027s okay too, you can say, \u0022This Code is licensed under the MIT License, except where noted in the source, and so long as it is not redistributed on pay-to-download sites similar to ad.fly, such similar sites are determined at the discretion of the author or those he empowers to make those decisions.\u0022 This covers all your requirements, but also puts you on a much more solid footing in terms of clarity of licensure. It\u0027s not likely to ever be a big problem, but it\u0027s good to get this stuff right, so in the off chance it could, it won\u0027t come and bite you in the butt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENB.
