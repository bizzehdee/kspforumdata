The thing is: KSC will be approximately at the highest-latitude point of the orbit, 90 degrees away from the equatorial AN/DN, and you will want your transfer apoapsis to be near the equatorial AN/DN, because the Mun/Minmus have very low inclinations (and thus your transfer AN/DN will be near or at the equatorial AN/DN). A little bit ahead is probably preferable, both so you can wait until the optimal transfer, and so that you encounter the AN/DN before you enter the lunar SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: AN is ~90 degrees behind the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitial KSC location is approximately underneath the target, as it will be the highest-latitude point of your orbit (and thus 90 degrees away from AN/DN).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDN, and the transfer apoapsis, is 90 degrees ahead of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunar encounter is approximately 90 degrees ahead of the target\u0027s current location; it\u0027s a bit of a rule of thumb for lunar transfers (although if I did the math right, one would start about 116 degrees behind for a very small moon very far away from the parent body).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, what you could do is a dog-leg; launch high and southeast to an apoapsis above the equator, drift until you\u0027re near the equator, and then burn northeast into an equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T03:12:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lurkoholic","CreatedById":115664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T04:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shania_L\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shania_L\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow did you manage this?

It looked nice from the air but practically impossible to land on anywhere without having to pop chutes. So I played with the pqs settings and got something that is a bit more reasonable - a mix of low rolling hills with flattish areas. That allows for landing in the grasslands biome to complete survey contracts but you can\u0027t just land anywhere easily, you have to look around for decent spots. That seems to me to be the sweet spot. Highlands and Mountains are still not for the fainthearted though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also been playing with the Mun a bit, trying to restore some of the \u0022verticalness\u0022 that is lost when the bodies are expanded by 6.4x. For the smaller procedural craters, it\u0060s easy to tweak PQSMod_VoronoiCraters to get what you want. But the only way I\u0027ve found to to make the big craters have more depth and a decent slope to the sides is to raise the terrain deformation in PQSMod_VertexHeightMap. Doing that though also means all the mountains and highlands get higher, which impacts how low an orbit you can maintain over the Mun without performing involuntary lithobraking. But just as I write this it occurs to me that the lowest terrain on the Mun is the bottoms of craters and the northern basin so maybe I can do what they do on Kerbin to make ocean depths - use heightMapOffset to lower everything down - essentially have the crater bottoms below \u0022sea level\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;edit - I took a look at the Mun on Kerbalmaps and in stock KSP (assuming those maps are still accurate) it looks to me like the floors of even the deepest craters are actually 3-400 metres in altitude, the northern basin is 1-1.5 km high, midlands are 2-3 km high and so on. I don\u0027t know why that would be but I bet I could pull the base terrain height down a couple of km to leave more room for increasing the terrain deformation. \u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;second edit - I looked in the 64K_Kopernicus_Stock_Planets.cfg file and noticed that the heightmap offset entry is odd...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPQSMod_VertexHeightMap\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003E {\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003EheightMapOffset = =371.9\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003E heightMapDeformity = 25591.5\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E }\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if it was meant to read \u0022heightMapOffset = -371.9\u0022?
