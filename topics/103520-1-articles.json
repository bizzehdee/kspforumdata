Never really used any resource mod myself. But I also think there needs to be a step forward. \u0022Alright! We got that base standing there. Should we do some more than just drive around it with the rover? How about placing a refinery nearby, giving the rover a drill and a storage tank to go around, and gather stuff, and visit it from time to time for some extra gas?\u0022\n\nI also think it\u0027s kind of educational.

On the scale of simply refueling a craft even in the real world the equipment is pretty small. There was a study done re: a nuclear-powered probe refueling itself from planetary ice stating that the entire refueling apparatus would come in around 750kg. Depending on the fuels you are using you could even get it as a by-product of your life support reactions.\nNow, building craft on other planets is definitely a bit \u0022out there\u0022, even for KSP, but refueling is a fairly simply proposition depending on what fuels you\u0027re using."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T15:24:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No worries ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) And difficulty sliders are amazing things.\n\nWas really glad to hear about that."}]}
