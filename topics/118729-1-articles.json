Is it supposed to be the same as (or approximate) the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_center\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaerodynamic center\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) On the KSP wiki, center of lift is described as \u0022...the point where the sum total of all lift generated by parts -- principally by wings, control surfaces, and aerodynamic fuselage parts -- balances out...\u0022. What does \u0022balance out\u0022 mean in this context? Does it have something to do with a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant_force\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eresultant force\u003C/a\u003E? If so, a resultant force identifies a line of application, not a point. How is the point defined?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Does the lift of a part depend on the craft\u0027s orientation? For example, does a wing provide a different lift when the nose is pointing prograde than it does when the nose is pointing radially? And if so, then how is KSP able to show you the center of lift while designing a plane in the hangar? Does it make an assumption about your craft\u0027s orientation relative to its velocity through the air? For instance, does it assume your craft will be moving in the direction defined as forward by the root part, and calculate the center of lift accordingly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) What is the difference between lift and drag? The wiki says \u0022Lift is contrasted with drag, the force directly opposing an object\u0027s motion through the air.\u0022 By this definition, lift vectors must always be perpendicular to the direction of motion, because any component of aerodynamic force parallel to the axis of motion is regarded as drag, right? But then why does the blue arrow in KSP\u0027s center of lift display sometimes tilt fore or aft? (When I trim a wing, for instance.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Why make a distinction between lift and drag anyway? If I understand correctly, players use center of lift to understand the torque that will be caused by lift-inducing parts. But drag-inducing parts also cause torque when they aren\u0027t in-line with the center of mass, so wouldn\u0027t the center of lift \u002B drag convey a more complete understanding of the torque than the center of lift alone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- CONCLUSIONS --\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter receiving several replies, I think I understand center of lift now.

That defines a line. Then find the point on that line which remains unchanged after incremental perturbations in the craft\u0027s orientation.

As a result, the center of lift shown on the screen can be significantly off. For instance, the drag of parts on a front-loaded rocket should result in a center of lift in front of the center of mass, but you won\u0027t see that in KSP\u0027s center of lift display. Also, increasing the incidence of a wing increases lift both in real life and in KSP flight, but you won\u0027t see that increase reflected in the center of lift display.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2) KSP\u0027s center of lift does not take into account the orientation of lift-inducing parts relative to movement through the air. Thus, if you attach a lift-inducing part at anything other than the default orientation, you\u0027ll get an inaccurate center of lift. This particularly affects any craft with wings attached at an angle of incidence or trimmed control surfaces\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe bottom line is that the center of lift display can be inaccurate for all but the simplest of designs.

(No implied criticism here -- Squad\u0027s accomplishments are still A\u002B in my book.) During my research, I came across a comment from someone at Squad which said that to do lift properly, they would need to add a wind tunnel to the space center. So, it seems that the developers have already thought about this with an eye toward making it better. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI mention this because I saw comments which suggest that what I\u0027m calling inaccuracies are actually intentional differences which make a valuable distinction between \u0022lift\u0022 and \u0022drag\u0022. I believe that is not the case. There is no need to make any such distinction, and a center of lift calculation without the inaccuracies described above would in all ways be better than the one we have now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWe need to be careful not to let our understanding of drag and lift be defined by KSP\u0027s modeling of those concepts. Drag is any aerodynamic force acting parallel to the direction of motion, and lift is any aerodynamic force acting perpendicular to the direction of motion. KSP uses those terms slightly differently. It tends to use drag and lift to refer to different aerodynamic modeling techniques, where drag corresponds roughly to air resistance and lift corresponds roughly to Bernoulli effects. KSP\u0027s terminology isn\u0027t really kosher, so be aware that when KSP says \u0022drag\u0022, it may be talking about a force that includes a component of lift, and when it says \u0022lift\u0022 it may be talking about a force that includes a component of drag. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TC\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T16:59:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T.C.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T02:44:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny collection of forces on a rigid body is equivalent to a single force exerted to a certain point.

If you attach parts normally in the SPH, then they will be oriented in a way the provides proper lift. If you try to rotate wing parts, then that can make them no longer provide lift. I think for wing parts they can be normal or rotated 180 degrees (backwards) and still function, but anything in between will provide less than optimal results.

Technically, a resultant force can be exerted anywhere along a \u003Cem\u003Eline\u003C/em\u003E. That is why in Question 2 I said \u0022a resultant force identifies a line of application, not a point. How is the point defined?\u0022 I think I know the answer now. The center of lift is the point on the resultant force line which remains on the resultant force line after an incremental change in the angle of attack. This comes from the definition of the aerodynamic center, which Gaarst assures me is the same as the center of lift, and can also be inferred from your suggestion that the center of lift is similar to the center of mass.

Rather, I think lift does depend on orientation during flight, but the center of lift calculation doesn\u0027t seem to take orientation into account, except for some broad assumptions about whether your airfoil is up or down. The bottom line is that the center of lift just seems wrong unless all lift-inducing parts are oriented the way KSP expects. Also, FancyMouse raised the possibility that center of lift doesn\u0027t refer to lift per se, but just a specially modelled type of lift. In other words, even though the KSP physics simulator would let you get your lift from a barn door attached to the fuselage with an angle of incidence, it might not consider that lift in the center of lift calculation. If true, that makes the center of lift in KSP a much more limited thing than I thought it was, and renders Questions 4 \u0026amp; 5 moot. (Also, who knows -- maybe the specially modeled lift that goes into the center of lift calculation doesn\u0027t depend on orientation even in flight, which would make the center of lift calculation correct for the limited thing it is trying to do.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TC\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T07:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems you do know more than I do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPure torque - fine degenerate case, and I completely agree with your details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the point or line - right I haven\u0027t thought too much about that when I first wrote them.
