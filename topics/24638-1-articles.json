Except the world doesn\u0027t consist of blocks, but is a regular 3D terrain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Storymode is the \u0027campaign\u0027 of the game and follows the stranded survivor storyline on a pretty big gameworld with different biomes. Through the storyline you\u0027re eased into the game, learing it\u0027s aspects as you go along. It features NPC\u0027s that give you quests and from whom you can buy/receive the scripts to replicate items like food, medical items, tools, weapons (swords, bows and guns) and even automated turrets to defend from the animals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can even freely design your own swords, guns and even vehicles with the editor. Those designs can then be crafted in the game. Many awesome designs have been created by the community (Like Zelda swords, real world weapons and cars etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the latest version is completely free!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosed alpha testing will start soon, though, and you\u0027ll have to pay to gain access to it ($10 minimum, $20 minimum for multiplayer alpha too). That will also be the first version with Multiplayer if I understand correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you liked minecraft, are into space exploration (if you\u0027re not, what are you doing here?!) and open sandbox games, I\u0027d definitely recommend you try this game. The animals can be very tough, though. The only way to deal with those is to use technology to your advantage. Expect a fairly hard time fighting the larger animals (large can mean up to 30 meters high)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T06:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott manley brought this too us.
