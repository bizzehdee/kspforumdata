No problems getting there. Areobrake #1 at Duna, no problem. Aerobrake #2 put me straight into a collision course with Ike. SO, we landed on Ike. Planted flags. Took off, only to realize that we had underestimated how much fuel the lander needed to achieve orbit. Barely made orbit with the help of RCS tanks. Flipped to mother ship, had it make the rendezvous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooked like enough delta-V left to still visit Duna. Aerobrake #3 and #4 and we were in orbit. Detached and headed for landing. Huge landing botch - chose a 7 KM high landing site and the parachutes were near useless. Finally managed to safely land, planted flags. Took off, and once again realized we were shy of fuel to achieve orbit. Once again drained monopropellant tanks and got into something resembling an orbit, and flipped to mother ship to make rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point it was looking a bit shaky for a return home. Detached the middle (empty) fuel tank to save weight. Threw caution to the wind and headed home. Suddenly realized one of the 4 landing legs was broken. Had to do an EVA to fix it - and DIDN\u0027T wind up losing the Kerbonaut into the void!!! From there it was very routine, Aerobrake #5 and #6 in Kerbin atmosphere, wound up circular @ 200 KM with a teaspoon of fuel. Sent up a refuel tug, de-orbited, and came home safely!!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOVE this game (pant, pant) !!! Was a great Friday night, albeit involving a few too many beers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T19:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd some pics, and this could be a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/55-Mission-Reports\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emission report\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James_Eh","CreatedById":95163,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T19:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops.
