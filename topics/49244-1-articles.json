Not only did it take less dV to get to, but landing was a breeze, and of course escape velocity just involved Jeb kicking off to push his ship into orbit. (Not that I want to get into this discussion but the science values should probably be equivalent for the two rather than Mun being less, I lost a lot of hardware trying to land on Mun whereas Minimus was a one shot deal). The only issue with Minimus is of course the inclination adjustment to line things up - more science, less skill based.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have some questions about landing on other stellar bodies and a general where-to-next question. Given my difficulty landing on the Mun and looking at this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C1UgE3O.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexcellent gravity well infographic\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027m thinking that I won\u0027t be landing on any other planets without a parachute (or a space plane), is that reasonable?

It\u0027s got a huge gravity well so it\u0027s not too difficult to encounter. Do all the high and low orbit science. You could even parachute in a probe module with all the scientific instruments and a transmitter to grab the ground experiments. Although if you choose to land a kerbal there I wouldn\u0027t plan on getting them off again!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a great graphic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEither Eve or Duna are pretty easy to get to.
