The point about playing a stock game is that anyone familiar with KSP parts can tell at a glance the capabilities of the parts you are using.

When the clearly buggy updated version of the landing legs came out in a previous version (and ships would just sag over), I continued to use the previous version of the part until Squad fixed the legs so that the suspension could be locked. And now I don\u0027t need to keep using the old leg files. I made an exception in that case because my GasStations simply would not work at all for refueling my BirdDogs with saggy legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if Squad decides to stick with the torque-crippled OKTO2 probe cores, then that\u0027s what I\u0027ll deal with. I can replace all my dead comsats...and limit what the Laythe kerbals may choose to do until they get new comsats for better communication coverage. It won\u0027t kill me. All my other important ships that use OKTO2 probe cores have other, more powerful reaction wheels installed, so those will keep working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was always under the impression that the variety of probe core shapes were to give players more options in building vehicles with different symetries and asthetics. I never once used a HECS core, for example, because I never made probes with 3- or 6-fold symmetry. The variation in probe core capabilities does not thrill me...and the loss of all torque from the OKTO2 is especially sad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T03:22:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 03:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T04:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tw1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tw1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done Jumpster!
