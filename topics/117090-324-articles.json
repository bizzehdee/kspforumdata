I would recommend against using it.  Even when it -did- work, it was terribly inefficient  from a propellant usage viewpoint.\n\nI\u0027ve only done manual docking since KSP 0.90 though, mostly for that reason.  Well, \u0027mostly manual\u0027.  Instead of letting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E control all of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust/etc, I just use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E to do \u0027target hold\u0027.  Get into a close RV range (\u003C1km), and the following steps work for me 100% of the time.\n\n1.)  \u0027Control from here\u0027 on the docking port on the spacecraft.  Target docking port on the station.  Set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E on the \u0027spacecraft\u0027 to \u0027target hold\u0027 mode.  Optionally put in a rotation/roll offset value.  \n\n2.)  Switch to the station.  \u0027Control from here\u0027 on the docking port on the station.  Target the port on the spacecraft.  Set the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E on the station to \u0027target hold\u0027 mode, with optional rotation/roll offset.  \n\n3.)  Now that the two craft have their docking ports pointed directly at each other, and are at the proper roll/rotation, simply provide some small forward thrust to the spacecraft (~1ms if \u003E100m away, otherwise ~0.5ms is plenty).  \n\n4.)  Wait for things to get within ~20m separation.  Might have to make very minor course corrections on the spacecraft by using the translation controls (IJKL) to keep the prograde vector pointed directly at the target.  \n\n5.)  Once within ~20m of separation, set BOTH vessels to \u0027orientation hold\u0027 / \u0027stop rotation\u0027 mode.  If you leave them in \u0027target hold\u0027 mode, they can get into some sort of fighting oscillation.  Leaving -one- in target hold is okay, but not both.  \n\n6.)  Wait the final 20-30s to close the last few meters.  If you did 1-5 properly, you should already be at a perfect approach angle, and at a proper docking speed.  Just take your hands off the controls and let it coast in.  \n\n7.)  You should already be docked at this point..., or just coming back from getting coffee or something....\n\nYes, this even works when docking multiple ports -- you just need to set up the roll/rotation offset stuff properly in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E.  If you don\u0027t have/use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can still do this same setup using the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0027target hold\u0027 setting, though it doesn\u0027t have any roll control.  If you\u0027ve done it well, this docking method should use a total of \u003C 5m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E worth of propellant, and usually \u003C2m/s once practiced."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T18:51:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E KSP really needs a radial docking port.

For the docking problems a year ago or more I installed and tried the Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod. Now I have it at all times too.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7662057266\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/40423-131-docking-port-alignment-indicator-version-670-updated-053117/\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nFirstly, when MechJeb is behaving perfectly well you can sit back and watch what it is doing on the indicator and quickly learn what things should look like on the indicator when approach and docking is proceeding well. Next, when you encounter a docking job where MechJeb is struggling then you can jump in manually (yes you can still have attitude hold assistance from MechJeb if you like) and get it done efficiently by hand. Added bonus is you learn to dock efficiently for yourself (eventually, even with the indicator off!). For general docking tasks I find \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E is 3 or 4 times faster than I am and so for straight-forward simple docking jobs I often just leave it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E. On the other hand, if I do take the time to do it manually I generally use only 10-20% of the monoprop / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel that MechJeb uses! So for odd shapes, odd docking angles or when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel is getting very low then do it manually with the DPAI .\n\nps. If you have mastered taking a spacewalking kerbal out to 500 meters from your ship and then bringing her back with the jetpack to a nice smooth and slow rendezvous with the crew hatch (and I bet you can do this) then in fact you already know how to dock ships well. The principle is essentially the same. \n\npps. I can also highly recommend [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\u0027s 7 step \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E assisted method as he describes a few posts back.

You have to do this on the RECEIVER craft more than the Docking (controlled by Mechjeb) craft.   it even worked with my rescaled DP docking ports (1.5m and 0.9375m)\n\n[@Kaa253](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/68628-kaa253/)  NavHUD (maintained by [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/)) does an even better job because it is graphics on the screen instead of just the attitude indicator, and you don\u0027t have to worry if a pro-grade or retrograde symbol is being occluded so you can\u0027t tell which one it is.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, Starwaster said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@StickyScissors](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144204-stickyscissors/) [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Having trouble with docking then give this a try please (assuming KSP 1.3.1)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/9swbqvqrhxfjptq/MechJeb2.dll?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9swbqvqrhxfjptq/MechJeb2.dll?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Added another safeguard to move away from the dock if it\u0027s too close and hasn\u0027t yet lined up.\n\u003E \n\nStarwaster, Actually it is an OVER-correction on the Controls (lets say you need 1 degree of pitch Mechjeb goes for 2 for the sake of argument.)   I have seen this with all the 1.3x builds including the latest dev build.  Figured it was a mod on my end but obviously others are having issues.    I had a Rocket launch under accent guidance to 8000km with a 180degree roll through out the flight (to keep the poor Kerbals from Redding out you know,) and it took from ~180m to almost 26 km for the 90 degree roll to complete because it was constantly oscillating left to right with FULL control deflection \u002B full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E roll.   If removed movable controls and kept \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E off Mechjeb gives a perfect control but add either/both to the built in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Mechjeb over-controls.   \n\nCurrently Mechjeb is causing MJIO (MechJeb Induced Oscillation) when more than one control system is concurrently in operation. (in my experience.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/16/2018 at 1:51 PM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003C\u003C I\u0027ve actually written a special \u0027multi-docking-port\u0027 module for exactly this purpose -- orbital assembly.  Includes two docking modules in a single part, both with specific dock types and snap angles to ensure that it will only dock in one orientation.  While it wouldn\u0027t help you actually dock the thing, it -would- ensure that it only docked into the proper orientation, and supply \u0027multi-joint\u0027 stability with multiple docking nodes in use (though unsure on the utility of that, as the docking port part itself only has a single attach point to its parent part....).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But alas, I have not had time to create any models for it.  Require a new model as it needs two docking port transforms, with unique/different names.  Not even really sure what it should look like... probably some sort of rail/beam assembly.\n\u003E \n\nSo since I continued the derailment of the thread with my last post (SORRY!) let me ask a question that is apropos to this thread.   A Rail?  I assume no passage over this port would be allowed?  If you don\u0027t mind an opinion on the subject, I think you would be better served with 2 circles of different sizes.  one is for \u0022resource transfer\u0022 and the other is for \u0022Crew Transfer\u0022  It still forces the strict orientation, but gives you a plausible way to have an internal crew transfer.  So model wise you could easily use the DP-0 \u002B an off centered DP-1 port with a single point of docking and being Gendered would have only one way to dock (game wise would only dock at one point but it will LOOK like two separate docking connections have happened.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-17T23:55:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2018 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**"},{"CreatedByName":"StickyScissors","CreatedById":144204,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T03:42:04Z","Content":"~~-snip-~~\n\n~~Fixed i think~~\n\nEdit: Nope, still borked.
