If you haven\u0027t added patches to fix that, then the mod pack is pointless.\n\nAlso have you gotten permission from the mod authors? Not all of those mods have very distribution-friendly licenses. And telling people to ignore incompatibility warnings is a bad idea.\n\nFurthermore, this shows several redundant mods (Interstellar and Alcubierre Warp Drive) packaged together. Are you new to KSP? If so I advise you not to take up modding yet. I advise you to read the links in this posts as well.\n\nFinally, I don\u0027t even think you could run all this on 64-bit OpenGL Linux without crashing.\n\nI advise you to do modpacks on KerbalStuff. This way, you\u0027re just telling people to download xyz. It also works with CKAN and the whole pack will be downloadable in one click on there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T12:40:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\_Augustus\\_**"},{"CreatedByName":"Borisbee","CreatedById":91794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T13:22:21Z","Content":"Easiest way to make a modpack is to use CKAN and give out the .ckan file. Redistributing all mods like you are trying is a huge no no.\n\nFeel like it\u0027s worth saying that it also seems a bit pointless to make a modpack for no reason. If you have a balance/tech tree progression like SETI, or if you are a popular youtuber that has a following and you want to give your viewers an easy way to get all the mods you use so they can follow along, then it makes more sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T13:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Borisbee**"}]}
