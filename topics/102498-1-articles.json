You don\u0027t have to be totally direct about what you want from the get go, but don\u0027t embark on some month(s) long journey of trying to ask someone out or hinting or whatever. This usually ends in one of two ways. The first is that the object of your attention never catches on, because hints are only obvious to the people making them. Alternately, you\u0027ll just weird people out until they feel like they have to confront you, or start avoiding you so they don\u0027t have to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Her friends are useful resources. If you want to know if someone is interested in you, or you want to know if someone is trying to drop you hints and you don\u0027t feel you can ask that person directly, then talk to their friends. These are the people next most likely to know what\u0027s up. There is no universal girl code, so asking your guy friends, or people on the internet if they think some girl is interested in you, or what she means when she says ____ is literally about as productive as consulting a magic 8-ball, so don\u0027t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Middle School is awkward. This is just a fact of life at the age middle school happens to encompass. Everyone is learning new social skills, exploring new types of relationships. Be at peace with this fact, and don\u0027t sweat it if you can\u0027t become mister confidence. Take a deep breath and do your best. This is how we learn if nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t going to apply perfectly, but my typically approach is this. When I find a girl I think I might like to have a relationship with, I find a reason to talk to her. This is a good time to express interest by the way. Ask direct questions about her that invite more than a yes/no answer. Hobbies/interests are a good place to start, and with any luck this will develop into further conversation. If she asks you questions, try to avoid simple yes/no answers or short answers that don\u0027t invite more conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit of socializing, if I still think I want to pursue a relationship after getting to know her a little better, I invite her out to some future outing. For me, that usually means coffee which combines simplicity, further social interaction, and is a fairly well accepted code for first date where I live for people my age. This is the part I can\u0027t help you with. When I was in middle school, asking someone out to coffee was instead inviting them to go see a movie. Maybe it still is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the \u0027date\u0027 goes well, then I make plans for us to do something else, ideally something a bit more romantic. A pretty easy one for me is dinner and a movie (or dinner then a movie if I don\u0027t feel like cooking), but I\u0027ve also used public gardens and sporting events. Especially if you have gotten to this point without making anything officially a date, you would ideally want to get at least a hug in at the end. This is part of being clear and not playing the long/creepy game. Failure to do more than hang out and talk typically means you are just interested in being friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully something in all that is of use to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T15:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMiddle School is the toughest time for everything.
