Revert to VAB and just after the VAB loads, BAM, crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tested out with a quick and ugly rover that doesn\u0027t have part cropping to check if that was the issue and the kinetic pop still happens. Also, the reason that I have a landing leg on top of the rover is because that\u0027s my attempt at a mechanism to flip the rover back over if it ends up flipped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8.1 64bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.90, running 32bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS (no KAS parts on either craft)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb plus extension for FAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENereids S.A.V.E. backup system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHangar mod 2.0.2.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace (one of the structural pieces of the rover and the headlights are from this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock Part Revamp (textures only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock Bug Fix Modules*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedural fairings (not used in the two crafts used)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The specific ones that I have are Anchored Decoupler fix, chute quickload, crew roster freeze, EVA ejection fix, and kerbal debris fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrashlogs with the needed craft files, both of which are in the VAB \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sta.sh/01w2m5ukhxv2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sta.sh/01w2m5ukhxv2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T07:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody? I know it would be better if the author of the hangar mod looked at it, but could someone look at the crash logs and rule out whether it\u0027s a hangar problem or not?
