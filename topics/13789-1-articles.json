It is possible to fit more than one parachute to a lander if you choose. there are many different mods out there for extra chutes such as the novapunch pack I believe has radial mount parachutes. The part about them breaking off, it simply could be you are deploying too soon, the load causing a structural failure and the mount to break off.

But even after using my remaining fuel to reduce Ap to 1.1 million meters, it took another 10 orbits to finally reach the surface of Kerbin. It was days of simulated time. Since then, I have found that it is much faster to set Pe to just under 30,000m. Even starting from the Mun\\\u0027s altitude and using the full lander, the crew experienced only slightly more than 2 G\\\u0027s of deceleration.
