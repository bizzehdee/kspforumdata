I just tried to put my Sky Crane out there while I load in the next piece and when I return to the space center, the ship has vanished. This is getting really annoying as I have also lost several very expensive base pieces trying to do this as well. None of my other ships are being lost, just the ones near the Runway. I haven\u0027t tried to put any anywhere else around the VAB, so I don\u0027t know if it is local to the runway or Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my sfs file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ehmrqj02os5qu8/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9ehmrqj02os5qu8/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T19:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the vessels moved off of the runway completely?
