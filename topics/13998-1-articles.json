That is where once you have established your Munar Injection from Kerbin, you do absolutely nothing else. If you established the right course, you will swing around the Mun, and come back to Kerbin in line for a landing. Even with the independent SOI system, it is still possible and can be fun seeing how well you can nail the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for actually getting to the Mun, during launch establish a easterly orbit (90 degrees on your Navball), and make one orbit. You want your rocket pointing directly at the horizon on your Navball when the Mun first shows itself upon the horizon. As soon as said Mun shows itself, begin your burn and continue until the orbit is just past Munar Orbit on your map. If you get it at just the right distance past the orbit, then a Free Return Trajectory is yours. If not, then you will either swing back into a full Kerbin orbit, or be slingshotted into Kerbol orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo establish Munar orbit, you just wait until you are in the Mun\\\u0027s SOI, and then do a retrograde burn until orbit is established (around 400-500 m/s depending on your altitude above the Mun). Will leave landing up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of other ways for TMI(Trans-Munar Injection), so that can be other things to keep you occupied.
