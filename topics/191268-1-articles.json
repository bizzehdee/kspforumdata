I have been playing this game since 2013, but I have rarely left Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E except for establishing a small colony on Duna or visiting the Jool area. This time, in a career save, I thought \u0022eh love it\u0022, mainly because the game wants me to visit Eve before Duna. Glad I am not a newb who would probably be shaken deeply by the realization of a proper there-and-back Eve mission. Anyhow, I have rambled enough, let\u0027s go right in medias res and see what\u0027s going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Bnb5qHi.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Bnb5qHi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the Eve lander/ascender. It has almost 200 parts (mainly lots of auxilliary stuff like the landing struts, science stuff, separatrons etc.) and weighs 144 tons. And that\u0027s EMPTY! Correct, this is to be hauled to Eve completely empty and then refuel itself by mining lots of ore. Sadly I never did much testing besides \u0022yeah it survives the descent and makes it into orbit\u0022, because it is missing a crucial component which I only realized when it was already too late. But more to that later. The thing is this big because I always send three dudes at once for the world record stuff and I don\u0027t like abusing service bays with command seats - also then it wouldn\u0027t have been possible to build these nice elevators - Kerbal goes in at the bottom and then simply transfers to the capsule on the very top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ecm4lDT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/Ecm4lDT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the transfer stage, the \u0022pusher\u0022.

Here, the return stage was jettisoned and the Command pod put in the front. The original idea was that it would be more stable, but I could just have used more struts. Also since I had to do adjustments before descent, but not knowing how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E I would have ACTUALLY left after ascent, I didn\u0027t want it to park in a higher orbit, so I transferred some of the fuel in the big stage between the return and lander to the lander and fired up the Vectors - which of course yielded much less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than it would have otherwise.

NOTHING in this mission has worked as well as the descent and landing. After landing I set up the ground science, did experiments and set up flags. This was where I cheated for the first time: Because walking up a hill apparently makes Kerbals walk into the hill and eventually die. Glad I could quicksave Jeb. After that I was a bit mad and just hacked gravity and used the jetpack. TAKE THAT GAME!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext I realized my second, much, much worse mistake: NOT BRINGING RADIATORS. Especially on Eve, mining crawled to almost a halt. That way it would take DECADES to fill up. I fought my dark side, but in the end it won. Infinite fuel and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E filled up the lander in only a few days (or even hours? Doesn\u0027t matter). I am still feeling a bit bad about it, but I would probably feel bad too. You can make or make not a mistake and still fail, that\u0027s Kerbal life. Eventually I was ready for liftoff.
