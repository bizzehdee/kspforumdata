It was too late and I didn\u0027t have the DV so I just did high above Kerban science (for the 3rd time) for a few points. Got out recovered the science and continued on to my aerobraking at home. I set the alarm in KAC and did some quick local missions. On one of these I realized my spacecraft was already several days past Kerbal on its way out. KAC defaults to the SOI change and it normally picks what I want so much I forgot to set it to Periapsis. So I thought well that is OK, I can do my high above sun science after all. Got all the way out there and realized I already removed the science from the experiments. Ultimately returned ok, 33 days late and a few hundred science points short.
