I think it\u0027s time to talk in more depth about gradual failures. What I think this idea means for the future is a subclassing of FailureModule that allows for realistic degradation (linear or exponential) of attributes of parts. Short of updating the stats of complementary PartModule\u0027s every logic frame, it might be best to implement some kind of granulated failures. Maybe every 2 hours your RTG would lose 0.2% Efficiency, or something similar.
