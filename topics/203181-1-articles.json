The movie take place shortly after the Kerbal\u0027s find their first exoplanet which is Puff. They decided to send a large ship to go an explore and colonize it.\u00A0 However, another variant of Kerbalkind already lives there in secret. However, before we continue there is some history we must cover. A very very very long time ago Kerbalkind had some sort of, Civil War. The war ends\u00A0at that one group left Kerbin forever and where exiled. The exiled group moved to Puff and started new lives. But they were still angry at the kerbal that exiled them and wanted to take revenge. Then thousands of years later they decided to invade Kerbin and take it back. Coincidently at the time Kerbalkind starts to head to Puff. I wont spoil the rest. Thats it.

It was a time where Kerbalkind was divided on the idea to colonize Laythe. Half of Kerbal Kind wanted to colonize the entire solar system while one half disagreed. Soon debates and small fights became protests and battles. Kerbalkind was at war with each other about colonizing Laythe. After 10 years of fighting the non-colonizing Kerbals won. However the war had destroyed many parts of Kerbin, almost whipping out all their technology. The non-colonizing Kerbals however did not want to exile the colonizing Kerbals. So they decided to banish them to a faraway planet called Puff in a whole new solar system. They agreed that they would be so far apart that another fight between them was very low. So then all of Kerbin\u2019s colonizing Kerbals left Kerbin on a ship headed to Puff. The ship did arrive at Puff safely but a growing anger at the Kerbals on Kerbin rose.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A01,000 years later and the Kerbals that opposed colinzation were now interested in space like crazy! They had been to every planet in the solar system, built bases, flew SSTOs, rockets, built space stations, and much more. However it was around the time that the Kerbals discovered Puff. And it was also the time where the Kerbals on Puff were so angry that they began building warships to take back Kerbin. While on Kerbin they were building an interplanetary ship to explore Puff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A02 years later the kerbals had just launched their mission to Puff.

The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E learned of this shortly after and had actually spotted several warships. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, confused and not wanting to be annihilated, also built war ships.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0When the enemy warships arrived at Duna the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E sent their warships to attack but they had lost the battle. Puff\u2019s warships were just too strong. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was using missiles while Puff was using lasers and antimatter based weapons. This fleet of warships by Puff was commanded by Julius Bodekam (all kerbals on Puff have the last name Bodekam).

He wants to help Kerbalkind defend themselves as Julius is a madman and will destroy them anyways (surrender or not). Ho hands them plans and laser cannons form them to use and replicate and make more. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E understood the plans and made a huge fleet of warships with laser matching Puff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Then a big space battle happens (like the one in StarWars).
