From there, just fly out past the runway towards the ocean or the mountains, turn around, and then glide in for landing.

In general you need to be descending at less than 10m/s and want to be going as slowly as possible horizontally. Ideally you land just above stall-speed so the first thing to find out is how slowly the plane will fly without falling out of the sky! You now have the approach speed... Knowing the approach speed you\u0027ll also have found out what the descent rate is at that speed. \u0022Normal\u0022 landings call for a \u0027flare\u0027 just before you touch down - pitch-up to reduce descent and stall onto the runway - so the plane stops flying. If you can\u0027t flare to a comfortable landing you\u0027ll want to come in \u0027hot\u0027 - that is, use a bit more throttle for a shallower approach so you land a bit faster but don\u0027t have to pitch-up so much to slow down your descent. (Too hot and pitching-up will just make you climb again). This can all be practiced from takeoff and flying around and around KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparately you\u0027ll have to find out how the plane handles de-orbit and transition to normal flight. The only thing I can suggest there is picking an initial impact point about 10-20km before your target and then pitching-up in flight to avoid the impact and fly to the intended destination. DREC will force a more shallow re-entry trajectory but in any case don\u0027t attempt to control the plane in atmosphere but anywhere near orbital speed - the drag will either flip and spin it or destroy it outright. Wait until you\u0027re 10km or lower altitude and 200m/s or less velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavUtils is a HSI/ILS system mod that might make this easier for you.

So here\u0027s what works for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, hit V to get the camera into FREE mod. Some folks recommend CHASE instead but FREE works better for me. Then rotate the camera until it\u0027s directly behind the plane far enough away that the wingspan is about 1/2 to 2/3 the width of your screen, and slightly above the axis of the fuselage. This is so you\u0027ll be able to see your shadow on the ground easily, as that shadow is your main thing for judging your vertical speed and distance from the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, turn the lights on. If you\u0027re using the normal Small Gear Bay landing gear and have attached them in the default orientation, they\u0027ll have landing lights shining down and forward when the gear is down. In addition, I recommend attaching Illuminator Mk 1 floodlights under the wings, facing forward and rotated upwards 3 ticks of the SHF-W key so they\u0027re almost, but not quite, pointing straight forward. The lights are very handy even in daylight to tell you when you\u0027re getting near the ground, especially if you can\u0027t see your shadow yet (as is often the case when landing N-S out in the field or on another planet, or landing E-W when the sun is low in the sky).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s just a matter of spotting and lining up with your landing site (runway or otherwise) from as far away as possible and throttling back, flying the plane to the ground. What you do is once you\u0027ve spotted your landing site, throttle back as far as you can without stalling so by the time you get to the runway or a bit before, you\u0027ll have slowed down as much as possible. Then guesstimate the angle from your plane\u0027s altitude down to the landing site and adjust your elevators as needed so your prograde marker is that far below the horizon. This will put your on a glide path that will intersect the ground in the vicinity of the end of the runway (or whatever else you want to land on). Then just sit back and let the plane drift on down, only making occasional adjustments to pitch and throttle as needed to stay on the glide path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should now be near the end of the runway just above your minimum flying speed. You should be starting to see your lights shining on the ground ahead and below, and might be able to see your shadow as well. If you haven\u0027t already, chop throttle to the absolute minimum to prevent a stall or shut it all the way off. Then make your final adjustments to the controls to make sure you hit the runway where you want to (you should be aiming for some striped bars or the numbers). As you get very close to the ground, you\u0027ll definitely see your shadow so can easily tell exactly how high you are and how fast you\u0027re descending. Flare just before you wheels meet your shadow, make sure all wheels are on the ground, then hit the brakes (and zero throttle if not already). That\u0027s pretty much it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T14:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take what I teach with my real life students for final approach (no, I don\u0027t fly space planes, but I am a flight instructor) and try and modify it a little for KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up for a long final approach and you only need to worry about 3 things\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 Runway alignment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 Approach path (glide slope)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 Approach speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike Geschosskopf, in KSP I prefer chase mode, and I set up my camera so I am just above and behind the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith runway alignment, just make sure the runway is a straight line in front of you. It doesn\u0027t angle left, it doesn\u0027t angle right. The ends of the runway should be vertically aligned in your sight picture.

If the far end is right of the near end you are right of approach and need to turn left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce lined up with the runway, the trick with the approach path is to pick out a spot on the runway to use as your aiming point - usually the numbers or the aiming markers (the large white blocks) - and keep it in the same spot on your screen. Maybe an inch (2.5cm) or so above the nose of your plane. If the aiming point starts to rise up in relation to your plane, you are starting to get below your approach path. So you need to climb a little (add a little power when you do). If the aiming point starts to sink in relation to your plane, you need to descend a little (reduce the power a little here). If you keep that point stationary on your screen, you are good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow fast should you be flying your approach?
