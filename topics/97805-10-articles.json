However, I personally would not like to have procedural fairings versus fairings that are made of parts a la KW fairings. Most rockets irl have the same fairings for each mission. It is a nice challenge to get something to it in a fairing.

Procedural fairings are a great 1st step, but until at a bare minimum wings and fuel tanks become procedural in stock game, i highly doubt we can deal with teh biggest issue KSP now has: performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural does 1 thing that the game badly needs: cuts down on part count and physics calculations. My relatively high end rig cant handle much more then 600 parts at any one time (without slowing the game to a crawl), and aside from those with supercomputers, i think less parts is always better for everyone (\u002B its not like you cant use many procedural parts if you insist on making a wing out of 10 different wings). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also never understood why anyone would want to impose more limits on the game, creativity and thinking outside the box is half the fun. Yes getting things inside a preset fairing is a challenge, but if you want a challenge, then give yourself artificial limits to say mass, size, profile, ect. I dont feel these limits should be mandatory for all, especially for those that dont find cloning 100% realistic craft, or replicating real world vessels to be the main goal. If you guys that are against procedurals want limitations, they limit yourselves, and dont impose those limits upon everyone, you can post a challenge with limits of say volume the fairing has, or specify a specific size of the fairing, but let those that wish to have a non standardized fairing still have it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T21:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate to be blunt, but you could just install the procedural part mods and let people who prefer the stock game do their thing.

Both of you are presenting valid views on creativity; however, you seem to not understand that you\u0027re advocating your view on creativity just as Jouni is advocating his. The game will have one approach or the other, but \u0022just impose the limit yourself\u0022 is not actually equivalent to \u0022here are the constraints, do wonderful things with them.\u0022 You\u0027re trying to force your view on creativity as well, you\u0027re just acting like you aren\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u0022restrictions make a game a game,\u0022 I don\u0027t think anyone here seriously disagrees with that. KSP already restricts you rather substantially - for instance, you have to build your rocket with lots of fuel in order to orbit, you will find it extremely hard to go from Moho to Eeloo in a day, you have to either launch your craft at around the right time for a transfer to a planet or build a very, very, very powerful craft, etc. Those are all constraints. Everything there is a rule the game imposes on you, and what distinguishes the game from a 3D modeling program. So stop pretending \u0022no limits\u0022 has anything whatsoever to do with KSP or how it should work. KSP should have limits. Building a ridiculously wide rocket should be hard, because it should have a lot of drag with a decent aero system. You shouldn\u0027t be able to lift a 50-ton station into orbit with a single small engine and fuel tank (the rocket equation? That\u0027s a constraint). If you don\u0027t think fairing limits are a good constraint, that\u0027s one thing. If you don\u0027t think constraints should exist at all, your imagined game has little to do with KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T22:43:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T22:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOption 3: You can be creative and build something that doesn\u0027t require those wings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m pretty sure planes need wings.
