This is a bit hand-wavey, but basically, the Nth order RK is going to be \u0022seeing\u0022 a polynomial expansion of your potential. Unfortunately, expansion of 1/r around some r=R is given by a series (-1)\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003Ex\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003E/R\u003Csup\u003En\u002B1\u003C/sup\u003E. This is geometric convergence, which isn\u0027t the worst thing in the world, but it still means you have to fight for each digit of precision. What\u0027s worse, when x/R is small, such as slow moving object far from source of the potential, the series converges quickly, and you can get away with low order RK anyways. When you start seeing RK giving poor results, it tells you x/R is large, and higher order RK method is going to give improvements that much slower.

Of course, as R gets smaller, velocity increases, so the time step would have to get very small close to sources.

This is a bit hand-wavey, but basically, the Nth order RK is going to be \u0022seeing\u0022 a polynomial expansion of your potential. Unfortunately, expansion of 1/r around some r=R is given by a series (-1)\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003Ex\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003E/R\u003Csup\u003En\u002B1\u003C/sup\u003E. This is geometric convergence, which isn\u0027t the worst thing in the world, but it still means you have to fight for each digit of precision. What\u0027s worse, when x/R is small, such as slow moving object far from source of the potential, the series converges quickly, and you can get away with low order RK anyways. When you start seeing RK giving poor results, it tells you x/R is large, and higher order RK method is going to give improvements that much slower. So going to higher order RK ends up giving you least improvement where you need it most.\u003Cp\u003EVariable time step is a good idea. It\u0027s going after that very x/R term. Since x is roughly proportional to time step and velocity, you can actually keep it constant and have the same quality of integration everywhere. Of course, as R gets smaller, velocity increases, so the time step would have to get very small close to sources. And you\u0027ll have to figure out how to keep track of different time steps for different objects in simulation. So it\u0027s still not trivial, but definitely something to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been wondering whether it\u0027s possible to build a set of collocation points for a 1/r potential to integrate it exactly. I haven\u0027t seen anything like that in the literature, so I\u0027m guessing that even if possible, it probably goes really bad when multiple sources are present.
