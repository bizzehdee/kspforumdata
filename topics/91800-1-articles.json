There are others, but those are the only mods I can think would cause the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the name suggests, whenever I right click an aero surface (wing or control surface, but not speed brake) from stock, or procedural, the game slows to about 2 FPS. This is even just trying to pan/zoom/rotate without trying to change any of the values. When I left click any other part (including other B9 parts, engines, intakes, cockpits, etc.), or don\u0027t have any menu selected, the game works perfectly fine and I get 30 FPS\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only think that FAR or something else is trying to dynamically update lift/drag, or at least that is my best guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any of you ran into this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T08:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, and without a log, there\u0027s no way to know what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tracker","CreatedById":104189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T08:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure how to add a log as the game isn\u0027t crashing.
