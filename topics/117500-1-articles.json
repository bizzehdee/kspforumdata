I want those sides to be there so you can attach things to them, and everything is good and well until you try and stick something inside it (like an engine that it was meant to house):\n\n![6RzoNhZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/6RzoNhZ.png)![ca9kiva.png](http://i.imgur.com/ca9kiva.png)\n\nAs you may have guessed, this is not the intended orientation of the engine. I initially had a single collider and assumed that Unity/KSP was assuming it was representing the top of the object (which it sort of is). So, I added a second collider just beneath it. Same thing. I\u0027ve since redone the entire thing from scratch, including all 26 colliders, and got the same result. I checked the normals of the colliders, they are correct. I tried unparenting them from the mesh object, same deal. I even tried changing the origins, no joy. \n\nFrom fiddling around with it, I can gather that if the face of the collider you\u0027re trying to attach things to is above the center of the object, objects snap on to the \u0022top\u0022. Same for below the center, they snap on to the bottom. Presumably it works the same way on either side, because the outer faces work fine. From this I can safely assume that Unity/KSP uses this method to determine outward facings, and now understand why cargo bays are such a pain in the butt.\n\nSo, I suppose I basically need to know if anyone has found a workaround for this, or am I just going to have to resort to a flat plate?\n\nEdit: I did have an inkling of an idea about maybe being able to set orientation via node\\_collider, but I can\u0027t find any useful documentation on it that tells me something other than \u0022defines the collider\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T03:56:35Z","Content":"Is that engine surface or stack-attached to the underside of the part?

Moving it back up to where it should be results in the above behavior. \n\nI believe I may have to just start again on this one.

Moving the origin of the object in Blender didn\u0027t have any effect on it\u0027s center for some reason, yet moving the mesh itself in edit mode while leaving the origin in place did. I don\u0027t know what the functional difference is there. It still had issues with angle snap then wanting to put the engines out the outside facing of the sides rather than the plate facing, even when trying to place in the center of the plate.
