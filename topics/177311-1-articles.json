One of these is disabling quick loading. By default, hard difficulty has quick loading disabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mission also appears to have quick loading disabled. Maybe it is possible to edit the mission. I don\u0027t know. But if you did that it would no longer be the Munar 1 mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust tried it (my first MH mission ever) and scored 10188. Used my last drop of fuel to splash down in the right area. I didn\u0027t even know there was a scoring system but that would help to explain why quick loading has been disabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-05T15:06:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2018 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mystifeid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
