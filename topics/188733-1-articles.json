Why don\u0027t they use low tech things and do it with light itself. Why not use color or EM bandwidths and mirrors or other things that effect the light and make it process information. Why do you need something external?! On top of it why not use ambient light to power it? Can we not make mirrors that are pure optical. As in there is no power till you hit the monitor. If not the monitor itself is also powered similarly. We could get different display types that fit this best. It seems like they are trying to make optical computers based on electronic computers. It\u0027s a whole new material and medium. It should be done from the ground up using only thing from the related fields already existing from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor gods sake, you can amplify light with a mirror... You could even have absolutely no electricity involved!!!(Besides a light bulb at night to power it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you change medium you should completely rework based on the new materials. Not translate things. That is the stupidest way possible to do it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should be investing in small or cheap ways to make mirrors in an accurate or other needed manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have got to be a million ways to use light to process information. Probably way beyond what we are thinking. Any quality of the light. Anything quality of anything attached to it. All methods of processing. Simple and redundant is the best option with light potentially. Nobody should be remotely referenceing terms from modern electronic computers when working on it. Or they are not thinking outside the box enough to fully utilize it or optimize it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd from that perspective we only need a CPU and HDD equivilant to make an optical computer. And those can both be done on a path. You do not need a single device. You can have each of those things functions broken down into infinite pieces and use. I mean you could easily make a unary computer for each program. or for each function along the way. And that is still way too close to reference electronic computers and fundementally still narrowing the view too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan the light itself be used to process? Even without mirrors and whatnot? What about instead of actively effecting the light you passively detect it in way that process info.

All you have to do it basically have a stream of light. Especially if you use the light in certain ways. The original stream could be the program. If it\u0027s stored in a wide array of light to start and different wavelengths are holding different code in a way you could simply take modifications of the original down the path and have the entire program in the original light or lights. Not sure where the problems start though or how much data could be held. I wonder how much data you could get out of the light stream. Color atm is about 16million at 24 bit... I would imagine there are ways to advance this. If you go beyond visible spectrum and more than just light as a quality how much data could be represented? Pulling out code could be interesting too.

all without external reaction (people reacting to \u0022telegraphs\u0022 sending lights).\u00A0 One thing you seem to be missing is that computers simply need an amplifier *somewhere* in the operations or the signal will be lost.\u00A0 When nerve cells either fire or not depending on input, they can\u0027t be driven directly from input: they have to be able to create (or at least amplify from the input) the signal output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltra-high-tech ways don\u0027t appear to promising (although I\u0027ve heard of plenty of work there trying to get post-CMOS chips working).\u00A0 One of the tricky bits is that I\u0027m fairly sure you need branching instructions to be Turing complete.\u00A0 Quantum \u0022computers\u0022 might avoid this by essentially executing massive loops as single programs (and have some standard computer feed them each \u0022loop\u0022), which might be some way to have a \u0022standard\u0022 computer do most of the work and let your \u0022optical computer\u0022 do the \u0022loops\u0022 all at once (of course this would require the same tech that builds silicon chips).\u00A0 This \u0022do one thing very wide\u0022 idea would at least avoid the need for an amplifier, or really just put the \u0022amplifier\u0022 in the [non-optical] computer that is running the optical computer and creating all the light at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re also missing a lot with the whole idea of a TV screen having a lot of data.\u00A0 The HDMI cable that runs to the TV\u00A0 also has all the data the TV can show and isn\u0027t exactly cutting edge on the electrical scene.\u00A0 While light does have the capacity to harness a fantastic amount of data (see Claude Shannon\u0027s work on channel capacity\u00A0 [1940s]), trying to modulate light at that level seems next to impossible (then again, wifi has been running at microwave frequencies for a decade, who knows what the real limit is.\u00A0 Just expect to spend decades in infra red before reaching \u0022optical\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLosing binary is a bigger problem than you might think.\u00A0 Binary is only somewhat important (SSDs ditched that decades ago), but the Boolean (thanks again Shannon) underpinning allows much of what we think of computer operations to happen.\u00A0 You would have to come up with some sort of similar operations that light can perform (perhaps some sort of associated memory (hash array) function, possibly with minor (presumably non-Boolean) operations to form some sort of map-reduce function (map-reduce basically powered google 20 years ago, but they\u0027ve since moved on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrowing away 80 years of work on computing is a bit much.\u00A0 I\u0027d suggest learning the very foundations of computing (Shannon and Turing) to understand why things are made using CMOS electronics and exactly what problems you need to solve with light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-10T10:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, have you devised how to build the basic
