I didn\u0027t really know where to post this since the actual thread got locked but since it\u0027s related to the wait for KSP\u0027s latest update. Here\u0027s the thing I believe to be a minor issue. With people uploading videos of the experimental builds there will always be a portion of the KSP fanbase (normally new) or potential future customers who think that the latest version is now publicly available and then be let down to see that the version number is not matched on their game. Obviously this leads people to post and ask for an ETA. This is where the problem begins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we\u0027re not allowed to ask that question the mod is left with the duty of informing this person they asked a no-go question and close their thread. I understand the reasoning, however this truly does come off as anti-consumer, purely because the person is then left in the dark with no indication of whether the update is days away (which most of us do know) or perhaps weeks or months, which to somebody who is fresh to KSP may not be so obvious either. The person is then left with a non-answer and a closed thread and nothing more than a \u0022you shouldn\u0027t \u0027ave done that, boy!\u0022 feeling to leave with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, why don\u0027t Squad throw out ETA\u0027s that have a 2 week or so lead on their real target and then \u0027surprise\u0027 the community by dropping it early? It would give them headroom for emergency bug fixes and to delay the false date further if needed. At the very least it would give people a window to check back within rather than hitting refresh constantly, easing up stuff for the backend and then in turn giving the mods a way to answer these people, rather than having to leave them in the dark and close the threads. I know you guys must have your reasons for the method, and I can probably guess what a number of them are being a follower of Star Citizen too, but at the same time to see the best community I\u0027ve ever encountered have to resort to non-answers and thread locking is a shame for such a basic request and I wish there was some other way around it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to guess, I\u0027d say you guys put out dates before, slipped past that date and then had the fury of the combined internet to deal with which caused further issues with people refreshing with more vigour than ever. Or something of a similar issue where the decision was made that it\u0027s easier to drop the update, then announce rather than give people hope when you might not be able to meet at an exact deadline. I know there are definitely reasons you may not wish to follow the model of giving deadlines closer to release so I\u0027m not requesting a change of any sort, just pointing out that it\u0027s a shame to have to it dealt with this way from such a warm and inviting community, playerbase, mods and devs all included. PS I should clarify that I don\u0027t feel a need for an ETA myself having a lot of alpha backing under my belt and that I\u0027m not asking for one either. Also, sorry for the wall, I didn\u0027t intend for this post to end up this long!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ayana","CreatedById":105618,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T11:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s hoping the 64-bit bugs won\u0027t break very many things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CreepyD","CreatedById":73461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T11:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really wanted it today since I\u0027m off after a minor op, probably tomorrow as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a \u0022It\u0027s definitely not going to be today\u0022 would be nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is the hype in me has now peaked and has started dying down now all the vids and everything are \u0027out there\u0027, I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not alone there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre these bugs so game breaking that they can\u0027t just be hotfixed a day or two later just like every other game does?
