I decided to crash a probe into Jool (like you do). But thinking and seeing in YouTube videos, I thought it would blow up during re-entry. But it didn\u2019t. Instead it stayed intact and blew up 250m below the surface of Jool. I even made sure all cheats were off and re-entry heating was all the way up. But it still didn\u2019t blow! I am just wondering what is up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T19:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas it a very small probe? And how fast have you been, in terms of airspeed / surface velocity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first guess would be that your probe slowed down faster than it was fried, and soon reached airspeeds where survival was possible. From then on, falling and falling is normal. Jool has no surface, but the developers have drawn the line at 250m below \u0022sea level\u0022 - anything lower will be destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MSA","CreatedById":194763,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T20:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had the golden 1.25m probe core and the biggest relay antenna\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not sure how fast it was going exactly but I burned\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/retrograde2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022\u003E\u00A0at AP which was near Vall\u2019s orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
