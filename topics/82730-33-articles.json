To go into more detail on what I\u0027m thinking for craft design, behind the Starlifter cockpit would be SAS, a reactor, and the asteroid capture claw. On each of the booms would (maybe) be a docking port, with inline fuel storage, then a cluster of engines and RCS at the end of each boom, giving you the necessary torque to wrestle the asteroid, with forward and reverse engines at a 2:1 ratio (more pushing forward than pushing backwards for better acceleration, but still enough to break).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where having engines that will function as both engines and RCS engines would be helpful, as you\u0027re going to need a lot of thrust to be able to wrestle an asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also why giving us various adapters and junction points can allow us to create all sorts of wild and crazy vehicles with your parts pack.
