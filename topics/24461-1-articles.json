It\u0027s kind of funny trying to stuff it all into the space helmet, as the seal isn\u0027t properly sealed, and it blocks my vision. I recently found out about Kerbal Space Program thanks to Steam. It was COMPLETELY off my radar until then, and on a whim I decided to try the demo, where I quickly lost myself to this incredible game. Five hours later, I made the decision to purchase it in full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lost myself for five hours to the \u003Cstrong\u003EDEMO\u003C/strong\u003E of an \u003Cstrong\u003EUNFINISHED\u003C/strong\u003E game. Wow. The full completed game is going to destroy me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot very many games just click like that with me. It sort of happened with Minecraft back in 2011. (I\u0027m now pretty Minecrafted out.) It happened with The Elder Scrolls series back in 2002 with the release of Morrowind. It happened with Garry\u0027s Mod, the famous Half Life 2 modification. Now, it\u0027s happening with Kerbal Space Program. (Honestly, for pretty much the same reasons as Garry\u0027s Mod.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve enjoyed plenty of different games in the mean time, but when a game really \u003Cem\u003Eclicks\u003C/em\u003E, something magical happens. I can\u0027t stop thinking about it. I \u003Cstrong\u003Edream\u003C/strong\u003E about it. I start watching things and reading things in order to learn more about it. Kerbal Space Program has done this to me. It\u0027s got me watching Youtube videos of NASA launches. It\u0027s got me researching the Apollo program. It\u0027s got me using words like apoapsis, periapsis, prograde and retrograde in my everyday speech. It has me annoying my family, friends, and coworkers with my constant space-babble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to watching this game grow and progress into the gigantic phenomenon it\u0027s destined to become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m off to attempt another lunar mission.
