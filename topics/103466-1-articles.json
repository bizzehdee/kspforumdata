I was assuming that all contract science would then be split between funds and reputation, and all \u0022exploration\u0022 science would still go to science. The contract science seems to be dividing properly, but what seems to be happening with the other science points is they are just vanishing. None of the science, funds, or reputation meters go up, even though it says I am getting science for transmitting data from a new biome, for example. Is this normal, or am I misunderstanding how the strategies work? I wanted the bulk of the science (from contracts) to go to funds and reputation, while still getting a trickle of science from exploring, in case I wanted to change strategies, or new tech trees come out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T02:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veldez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T21:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll currency income is converted by strategies, from any source\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T23:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReputation works a bit differently to the other \u0027resources\u0027 as it\u0027s capped at 1,000 (or possibly 100; it\u0027s late and my brain has stopped).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you get closer to that level - whatever it is - the increase from \u0027points\u0027 is reduced so the maximum is never exceeded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything new does come out it\u0027s extremely unlikely you\u0027ll be able to continue your existing career save, so I wouldn\u0027t bother.
