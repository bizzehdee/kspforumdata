I haven\u0027t been able to try FAR (potato computer), so I may be wrong. I think the flaps work to decrease your speed while increasing lift. Again, I\u0027m probably wrong about the flaps\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E That is just incorrect.

Since KSP has wonky rules about parachutes, they can\u0027t touch the ground without disappearing. It\u0027s like this with rockets too. Look at your next atmospheric landing with parachutes. Right when the chutes touch the ground, they disappear. Same goes for spaceplanes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why everyone is suggesting RealChute.
