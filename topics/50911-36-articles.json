So the thing to do there is to head into the config.xml and look at the \u0022angular drive\u0022 parameters. Reducing the spring constant there should help with reducing the initial disturbance, and reducing or increasing the damper constant should affect the stability of everything; the effect really depends on how the frequency and physics timestep play with each other. The constants are currently ridiculously high to get around the angular velocity limit, so reducing both should help, though it will make a lot of things a bit more wobbly.
