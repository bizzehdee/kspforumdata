What kinds of challenges would the Kerbals face? How could they survive? Would they have enough resources to go into space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in this post, I am going to start by making a few assumptions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbin and Mini-Kerbin have a very similar geological history to that of Earth, with the exception of having a tiny, extremely dense object in their cores which gives them their gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPer Capita, Kerbals use up resources in roughly the same amounts and at roughly the same speed as Humans. The average population density is the same as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Year One\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 in KSP is the equivalent of the year 1950 on Earth.

Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s begin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo one of the core elements (no pun intended) of maintaining a civilized society is have natural resources available so growth can continue. Overall there are two types of resources: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESurface Resources\u003C/strong\u003E such as forests and living space are calculated based on the surface area of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESub-Surface Resources \u003C/strong\u003Esuch as minerals and fossil fuels are calculated based on the volume of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how exactly do we find how much of these resources are located on Kerbin and Mini-Kerbin? Well first we need to find out their volume when compared with Earth. What I found was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8W9TmV8.png\u0022 alt=\u00228W9TmV8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Cool, but why is this important?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 you may be thinking. Well, since the Kerbal population scales with the planets\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 surface area while the planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Sub-Surface resources scale with its volume, the Volume: Surface Area ratio directly shows how fast the Kerbals will consume their Sub-Surface resources compared to Humans. For example, if there is some mineral that we run out of in 2056 (106 years after our starting point in 1950), then Kerbin will run out of that resource in Year 10 and Mini-Kerbin will run dry around the end of Year 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this is intense. So how long can the Kerbal civilization sustain itself (unless it expands into space)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I have found various sources to show a range of estimates for various Sub-Surface resources. What I found was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ElTMi3m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ElTMi3m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: 1 Earth year = 3.427 Kerbal years\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 2: Surface resources aren\u0027t included because they scale with the planet\u0027s surface area (and hence its population and resource consumption rate), so they\u0027ll get depleted at the same time on any of the 3 planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does this mean? It means that the Kerbal civilization is much closer to running out of resources than us. So the only way they can survive is by building up a space program to try to colonise other worlds and mine them for resources. This actually makes a lot of sense within the game itself. Think about it, why is it called the \u0027Kerbal\u0027 space program and not the space program of any single corporation or nation? Because its an international effort to work towards a common goal of \u0027not going extinct.\u0027 Also, why is it that Kerbals seem mostly fine with other Kerbals dying? Because they would consider it an acceptable loss in the race to leave Kerbin before its too late.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in total, how long do the Kerbals have? Well, since most of our rocket fuel is produced from natural gas, we\u0027d probably lose our capability to leave Kerbin by year 67, and Mini-Kerbin by year 7. Civilization could probably survive until coal runs out (the materials to make renewable energy facilities will have disappeared long ago) in 140 / 15, then everything would fall apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and did I mention climate change? Since it is proportional to the consumption of fossil fuels, then using medium estimates we should see above-preindustrial temperatures of \u003Cstrong\u003E1C by 21/3, 2C by 27/3, 3C by 31/4 and 4C by 36/4.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what was the point of this post?
