I\u0027ll try to summarize my 3 experiences with GPP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. First time playing GPP, try to go for realistic progression as I always do. Land on Iota several times, land on Ceti several times, and then I prepare a manned flyby of Niven. Niven spacecraft is 3 months away, and I try to finish a tourist contract using the tourism \u002B mod (I believe that\u0027s what it\u0027s called). I try to return them home from my 50 man station, detach the 10 meter inflatable heatshield too early, killing 25 tourists. Reload, all 3 reloads involve in me cheating in some way. Think to myself, \u0022I should restart, and not cheat. Maybe this will be better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Do the same thing. This time, I install the bases and stations contract pack. I make the foolish mistake of setting up 1 station around Ceti AND Iota. It\u0027s quite the long trip from Ceti, especially that half of the time, you end up orbiting the opposite direction, and have to spend 800\u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to redirect your orbit. I also completely screwed over my entire playthrough, since i accepted the Icarus probes program, in which you need in excess of 15,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E just to land Icarus, due to it\u0027s extremely close orbit. Restart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Everything goes flawless. I preform a manned flyby of Niven, and don\u0027t decide to set up any bases yet. I then get a huge sleuth of contracts regarding Gratian. If I were to succeed, I would earn 5 million funds. I construct two crafts, the orbiter, and the lander. I spend 4 days on planning and docking the 2 behemoths in orbit. In orbit, I have a 500 ton spacecraft, and I should be able to not only land, but return. I get into orbit just fine, and plan the landing. I land the 2 out of 3 crew on the side of a hill. Instead of accepting defeat, taking the 2.4 million funds from carrying a science lab, making the orbiter a station, landing and planting a flag, I turn on 0\u00A0gravity, and try to fly the thing to orbit once I turn off hack gravity when I\u0027m upright. My calculations end up incorrect, and I miss orbit. I crash, losing 1 person, as I EVA\u0027ed one of them. I call the mission a failure , and try to return the orbiter home. I run out of fuel, and being the bad sport I am, turn on Infinite fuel. EVEN THOUGH I had 8 years of life support left, and I could\u0027ve sent a rescue craft to save it, I do it anyways. I don\u0027t feel anything close to content, and I go back to the stock KSP system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot even close to the Mun in my stock KSP system with OPM installed, I don\u0027t feel content, and want to start GPP again. This time, without research bodies (since you know, it felt tedious using most of my money to research planets very far away).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need help. What should I do to improve my experience in GPP, when I know Gael\u0027s two moons better than the back of my hand?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150430-galileo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022150430\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150430-galileo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Galileo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I need you man. I\u0027m not typically a sore loser in these games, but I also believe the limited KSP time on school nights hurts the enjoyment factor of sending a rescue mission leads me to just try to get the missions over with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
