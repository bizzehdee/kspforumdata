It survived, even at 4x, and I started to realize that the only way this was possible was that I either built it really well (HAHAHAHA, ME, WELL-BUILT, WHAT A JOKE ;_; ) or KJR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uninstalled it, and tested my ships. The B-17 had wing flex farther than I\u0027d expect (It\u0027s not an airliner, for God\u0027s sake!), a wobbling joint between cargo bay and monopropellant tank (which was dead weight to lengthen the aircraft and fit the wall gunners and ball turret) and much, much more maeuverable to breaking on landing. And I thought that my piloting skills have finally had some decency in them..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other bombers, the B-29 survived, but the De Havilland Mosquito, next in the line, had the accursed predicament of #LOLENGINESTOWED (i need to redo that ugly engine) and the Lancaster just barely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, that Lancaster has.. problems. It flies okay (not really remarkable) but the problem was.. crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the aircraft is immediately loaded and set off to fly, the cockpit that KSP fills in with is.. the rear gunner. The worst place to ever control a bomber from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, if I were to develop the legendary British bomber, I had to replicate at least some of the most well known bomb loads. The B-17 was easy, the standard firebombs. IIRC, it wasn\u0027t fitted with anything special, other than remote-controlled bombs and such. The B-29? Firebombs and either Little Boy or Fat Man, I chose the former. The Lancaster.. there are at least three. The Cookie Blockbuster, the Grand Slam, and the Dambuster. The Cookie is easy, load the Lanc with similar loads to the B-29 or B-17. Grand Slams are pretty straightforward too. But the Dambuster bomb.. Water physics are crappy, the thing can\u0027t just fall and survive, and even if it did, it would just stay there, a hunk of useless Scheisse that is not lethal in any way. I need at least two British bombers..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pTrevTrevs\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pTrevTrevs\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, do you think you could make a World War I bomber?

I\u0027ve also been considering the Vickers Vimy, and it\u0027s certainly possible. Or so I hope. But they seem to share a common shape, so it would most likely be easy when made with a common base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a Zeppelin..
