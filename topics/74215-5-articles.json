That processor can handle it so long as he manages the heat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad did figure out how to do it. And they did test it. The poll at the beginning of the thread, at the time of this post, is only showing a 72% success rate for DirectX based configurations. This is not a failure rate you want to have in an official release. 64 bit KSP is not ready for official release or support yet, neither will it be for when 0.24 comes out. Not until that failure rate is less than 5%. My hunch is that we will not see an official x64 KSP until 0.25 or even 0.26. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe glitch between loading screens is the Unity player is not flushing the video buffer out while loading a scene. Which means that the x64 Unity Player, at this point, has an unconfirmed, non-game-breaking bug. This is simply my theory though, and I could be wrong on this. The cases where switching to openGL is a driver compatibility issue between Unity and the graphics driver. These cases are issues that Unity, nVidia, or AMD needs to fix, not Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T07:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOhhhh we\u0027re aware of this thread.
