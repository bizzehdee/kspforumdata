It has its problems, it has weaknesses, it isnt guaranteed to 1 shot every enemy, and it can be 1 shotted itself, but given how bloody strong the damn thing is ATM, i dont think i could ever wish for a better craft if you look at the part count advantage (which could be lowered even more if i didnt arm the bloody thing with Tripedo-Ms and medium railguns, but used weaker or at least more efficient parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd after a long painful time, ive found a spot to give it a proper command deck without killing its survivability off entirely. The new hull though is just amazing. I have so much real estate inside it that i could probably fit over 30 drones, 6 railguns, 4 tripedo-Ms all inside (as in nothing is mounted on teh outside of hull). With that much ammo the lagfest would kill me though :D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI uploaded the most recent version, the SK-CRV-A6 to my company repository, so feel free to give it a try. I really worked hard on it, and i feel its one of the best ships on here if you take into account how few parts it is. 170 part hull, 270 parts fully armed with very powerful weapons. Its a tad heavy, and not the most efficient design, but the armor is very very resilient vs both standard low velocity garbage and phased rounds, and while im not saying it wont die to a single shot, ive NEVER managed to do this with a popper-H, tripedo-M, ibeam, or RT-5 (which are the current weapons i test it againt. Note, ibeams and RT-5s must be fire from i believe 250m at most, past that the physics gets all screwy and you can delete parts with missiles, and personally i consider taking advantage of that an exploit so im not even gonna try to make my ships exploit/hack proof) at least according to the battleclub rules of not once has a single shot killed both all weapons, all engines, and all its power sources. The most you can pull off with a popper is say shooting off the rear/front, and or doing alot of internal damage, but not once does it completely die.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nId love some feedback, perhaps what you guys think i could improve. Known issues right now are very badly placed weapons where ive had a few shots take out more then 1 per hit (making disarming the hull perfectly possible). Another issue is a rather vulnurable engine cluster although compared to earlier variants, this has greatly improved with it being rather unlikely for anything to wipe out all 3 engines. The final issue is that it is suceptible to teh resonance kraken after taking immense damage (as in it will wobble itself until it explodes), at least this only happens after so much damage that ship is more or less done, and it makes a nice self-destruct device :D.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust be aware, the craft is NOT rated for any weapon that is much more powerful then the popper-H, high end weapons liek zeke\u0026#39;s super torpedoes will kill it fairly reliably (although i have had times where it did actually survive surprisingly).\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T14:31:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spearka","CreatedById":12271,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T14:09:38Z","Content":"\nDoes anyone know if the forum changes upcoming will change the NBC?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T14:30:27Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Spearka\u0027]Does anyone know if the forum changes upcoming will change the NBC?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis thread is in Forum Games, afaik there are no plans to remove content from here.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T14:30:32Z","Content":"\nThey shouldn\u0026#39;t, no.

Im now working on a drednought for use by pirates, but part count is bad now :(\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, broadside shooting has one benefit, it lets you fire recoillessly (as the fire shoots out the other side), and it lets you have more compact weapons storage. With the stupid exhaust damage they implemented, i cant seem to stack weapons one behind another anymore without using radial engines and angling them sideways. Its not all bad, but sofar it seems the days of those SRB stacks that are in in excess of 1 SRB long are dead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd my new carrier, ive had ones around for ages, but this one, thanks to the tweakeable opening/closing and thermo fixes (nolonger goes instant boom when using phys warp), its so much better now. The hull is 210 parts, of which 24 are weapons hardpoints (which can be removed if you dont want to empty missiles into hostile ships from it).\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]FzDOd[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIm gonna perfect this a bit later, but for now its even somewhat survivable vs capital ship torpedoes.

Added 6 internal hardpoints where drones can be loaded, increasing weapons capacity from 6 0.6m weapons to 12, retaining the usual 6 shot FlaK cannon on the nose, which while somewhat weak, is really nice to have if either out of primary weapons, or you get those weapons shot off. Armor sufferes a hair bit, due to the extra weapons (and well, honestly anything that isnt 80m/s tolerance is always going to increase suceptibility to high end weapons), but overall, who doesnt like to have 6 high precision guided weapons.

Its rated ONLY against popper-H, RT-5\u002Bstructural panels, and ibeam weapons. Anything stronger can and WILL kill it (although from my testing it still stands a good chance of remaining operational even after getting hit by what id call overpowered weapons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen again, it was always intended as a support ship, given that until U5 (and from what ive heard even that might not quite give us that major of a boost), im stuck making support ships, i feel the SK-CRV-A6 (prototype) or -Ig6 (mainstream combat version) is the best thing i have that has 170 part hull (~270 with standard weapons loadout). that, and well, although im not arming them with such firepower for fun, it can carry 4 Tripedo-Ms, which have been proven to work wonders against the majority of targets ive used em on. They are lighter, simpler, and superior to the popper-H in every way that matters (popper is still better against weaker ships as it has more shrapnel), at least vs capital ships. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat, and while i have no intention of ever doing so, you could theoretically arm it with ~20 or so drones ontop of the usual 4 heavy torpedoes and 6 forward firing flak guns. So yeah, it may be killable, but it usually doesnt die to a single shot, and, it seems to be very hard to split with anything that isnt excessively heavy and part count (in terms of weapon).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, im working on developing a new Tripedo-M, so it should have better firepower with less mass and part count, and im also developing a short range drone that is again, less mass, part count, and just as lethal/accurate. Ive come to the conclusion that part count and mass is what matters moreso then insane armor, but i still like to have enough armor to deflect anything but what id call high end weapons (your tirepedoes, zeke\u0026#39;s new 10t missile, ofc stuff like that will kill this thing at least half the time).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T18:24:26Z","Content":"\nWorking on a new air superiority fighter (no BDArmory on this one, though I might test it with that someday)...\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/aqFmvDi.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/kr9EMrV.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/mKK7QUX.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far I\u0026#39;ve designed a pair of kinetic-kill dumbfire missiles and one cruise missile (the last pic) for it, all of which work quite well, since the two simple ones burn off their hardpoints but leave the airframe itself unscathed.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T20:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do the KKVs perform against ground vehicles?
