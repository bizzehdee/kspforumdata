I did get permission from the excellent snjo to use his FSAnimateGeneric and I should have that implemented by the end of this evening. By the look of his docs it better supports multiple animations as well as passing me the EVA functionality I want so badly plus a bunch of bells and whistles in that one module. When MSI comes out I will revisit and have a play, it\u0027s only a few lines of code anyway and packing all of Firespitter is frankly making me feel inadequate because it\u0027s not floating or fan powered etc, - it\u0027s just a lift \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColmo, Talisar;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I could I would, that simple.
