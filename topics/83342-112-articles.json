If you\u0027re running the 1.2.2 dev build then there\u0027s no part inventory, which ironically might be a benefit\u00A0here, so you can\u0027t pull things from the inventory to have reduced rates. Since the part tracker is gone too, everything is treated as \u0022fresh\u0022 and build times are generally a bit higher than they should be. The second, and probably biggest in this instance, is that the thermometer is pretty pricey. The default formulas use cost as the driver for build times and at 900 funds the thermometer is a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebig\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0contribution for small and inexpensive ships. The girder you mention is 25 funds, which is tiny in comparison. Build time is roughly \u0022(2000*sqrt(cost)) / rate\u0022 in seconds, where cost is just the entire cost of the vessel. Edits are calculated as \u0022progress\u00A0= BP_old - 1.1*(BP_new - BP_old)\u0022 so you\u0027re probably losing a good chunk of progress by adding on that thermometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like your vessel cost about 9500 funds, with a BP of about 195,000. Adding a 900 funds thermometer has a new BP of 204,000 with a difference of 9,000. Your new progress would be 195,000 - 9,900 = 185,100 so you have to make up 18,900 BP (the loss for editing plus the now higher BP due to adding a new part. Consequently removing parts takes less time). At a rate of 0.3 BP/s that gives 63,000 seconds or 3 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m either missing something or something\u0027s up.

The \u0022integration\u0022 mod sees that event and refills all the ignitors back to their default values (and could optionally spend some funds to do it, if that was desired). KCT recalculates everything and the integration mod uses this chance to add a variable to the KCT formula that\u0027s the number of ignitors replaced on each part. Since the integration mod also came with a Preset overriding the standard formula, the variable gets used to make the BP of the edited craft higher, resulting in additional build time.

Once you recover it has to recalculate all the BP values (since it has no memory of the initial ship once you launch it) using current settings and the parts don\u0027t store their BP values at all. Only the overall BP for the ship is cached once calculated.\u00A0You can freely recalculate at any time though and can cache those values manually in this theoretical integration mod. If it\u0027s just based on some \u0022reuse reusability %\u0022 that is defined in the integration mod you can just pass that into the BP formula(s) and write the formula to give one value while editing and another value for new builds (or in this case, the recovered build).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s try a theoretical example. Say you have a part that is 50% reusable and has 2 ignitors by default. So fresh with two ignitors it takes\u00A0100% of normal, after one ignition it\u0027s at 125%, and after both ignitions it\u0027s at 150%. Let\u0027s say all parts normally contribute a flat 2000 BP each (definitely not true, but we\u0027re making this example easy). So when we recover the vessel we recalculate it as if it were brand new (this might sound wrong, but it\u0027ll work out in a moment), so each part contributes 2000 BP no matter the remaining ignitions. Now we edit it and we want ignition replacement to take extra time, simulating refurbishment. Our BP formula then should be 2000 * ((2-[reusability]) - ((1-[reusability])/([maxIgnitors]) * [remainingIgnitors])). With full ignitors it\u0027s 1x (or 100%), with one out of two used and 50% reusability it\u0027s at 1.25x (meaning the vessel\u0027s BP goes up after editing instead of remaining the same), and with both ignitors used it\u0027s 1.5x. The integration mod can calculate everything between the parenthesis itself and pass a variable to the formula, then modify the actual BP formula to just be: \u00222000 * [R]\u0022, where R is our calculation. One caveat, R MUST be equal to 1 when we\u0027re not editing\u00A0in order to properly calculate what the BP would be for a new engine, otherwise the time increase doesn\u0027t work right. That can maybe be worked around with a more complicated formula, but I can\u0027t think of a good way to do it off the top of my head. If the integration mod doesn\u0027t want to set [R] to 1 internally (or is only running in the editor scene) then we can utilize if statements and a new variable that KCT will add that I am tentatively going to call E for \u0022editing\u0022 (I have yet to check for collisions).

Maybe. It\u0027s supposed to, but there\u0027s a fairly specific order that you have to follow for it to work correctly but I can\u0027t find the post that somebody made explaining it. If I remember correctly, it\u0027s to set your desired launch site in the editor when you build, then build it and go about your business, then when you go to roll out the vessel to the pad (maybe only when you press the launch button) you have to go back into the editor and make sure that launchpad is selected. Otherwise everything blows up. It used to work nicely without requiring you to switch the launch site in the editor\u00A0but a change in Kerbal Konstructs or KSP caused it so it goes nuts if KCT tries to launch at a site that isn\u0027t the one selected by KK. That might be fixable, but I haven\u0027t looked at it in a long while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cami","CreatedById":119545,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T21:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223002040\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002283342\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490817462\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273338\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, magico13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately no. Once you recover it has to recalculate all the BP values (since it has no memory of the initial ship once you launch it) using current settings and the parts don\u0027t store their BP values at all. Only the overall BP for the ship is cached once calculated.\u00A0You can freely recalculate at any time though and can cache those values manually in this theoretical integration mod. If it\u0027s just based on some \u0022reuse reusability %\u0022 that is defined in the integration mod you can just pass that into the BP formula(s) and write the formula to give one value while editing and another value for new builds (or in this case, the recovered build).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s try a theoretical example. Say you have a part that is 50% reusable and has 2 ignitors by default. So fresh with two ignitors it takes\u00A0100% of normal, after one ignition it\u0027s at 125%, and after both ignitions it\u0027s at 150%. Let\u0027s say all parts normally contribute a flat 2000 BP each (definitely not true, but we\u0027re making this example easy). So when we recover the vessel we recalculate it as if it were brand new (this might sound wrong, but it\u0027ll work out in a moment), so each part contributes 2000 BP no matter the remaining ignitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0 think thats upside down. On recovery you calculate the engine was originally 2000 BP when it was new. Then you subtract 2000 BP from whatever it becomes after editing. This cannot possibly work correctly, no matter what value I calculate during editing. Lets assume I go with your figures and beef up the BP to 3000 when detecting that ignitions are 0/2. Consider the following two scenarios:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI dont edit the craft at all. I get 1000 BP cost but the engine is still unusable\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI rip the engine off the craft and add a new one. I get 0 BP and have instant refurbishment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that scenario 2 is completely independent of whatever formula I come up with for the case of reduced ignitions. The problem is that the recovered craft is considered \u0022new\u0022, which it isn\u0027t. I\u0027d need away to make the \u003Cem\u003Erecovered\u003C/em\u003E engine worth less than 2000 BP, so when it is replaced by a really new one, there is a BP cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T21:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119545-cami/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119545\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119545-cami/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@cami\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0you\u0027re right, I think I did do it upside down because I was caught in the \u00220 ignitors means it needs fully refurbished, so time must be maximum when at 0\u0022 except that you can just plop a new engine on instead and it doesn\u0027t take any time, since I was thinking backwards. Alright, so instead you calculate it so that the BP is reduced at recovery and goes up to \u0022normal\u0022 when you restore the ignitors. For a simple example of 0% reuseable with 2 ignitors you just say the BP is 0 at 0 ignitors, 50% at 1 ignitor (1000), and 100% at 2 ignitors (2000). So BP = \u00222000 * ([ignitors] / [maxIgnitors])\u0022 at all times. With reusability I think it would be\u00A0\u00222000 * ([ignitors] * (1-[reusability])/[maxIgnitors]) \u002B [reusability])\u0022. Again, either each variable can be sent to KCT so the formula can be changed easily within the preset, or it can be computed within the integration and just sent as R (or whatever) to give \u00222000 * [R]\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSound correct this time? At recovery with both used it\u0027s at reusability, at 1 out of 2 it\u0027s halfway between reusability and normal, and at 2/2 it\u0027s at normal.
