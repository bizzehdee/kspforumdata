No ability to select or deselect any vessels from the tracking widget.\n\nJust finished doing a quick test and a untouched version 1.0.2.842 was used, started a sandbox and put the space station core (you can change the vessel type to a station or anything else it doesn\u0027t seem to make a difference) on the launch pad and the stearwing on the runway. From the station or the stearwing go to the map view and the tracking vessel widget is locked out. The tracking centre only allows theses vessels to be un/highlighted.\n\nDo vessels have to leave the launchpad or runway in order for this widget to unlock? \n\n This tracking vessel widget issue is not game breaking because sometimes this widget does not work and a workaround is to visit the tracking centre, it is just a mystery.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T13:44:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:02:39Z","Content":"I found this is a bug where if the Navball is hidden, you cannot use that widget.
