I\u0027m just hoping someone else with more info will see this and realize its not just them that has the issue. \n\nBasically in physics warp when crossing 70km over kerbin, ascending or descending, unknown things explode. I suspect fairings as the culprit, only because fairings already have a million other bugs associated with them, and I did have them on my spacecrafts. Log says overheated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T05:11:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 05:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Superluminaut**"},{"CreatedByName":"CrasHReBooT","CreatedById":143916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T19:10:39Z","Content":"I had the issue of overheating at the edge of the atmosphere where the overhead came from the vertical decouples. The heat shot up to an gigantic unreadable number and rapidly spread to the whole ship. The only reason my ship did not explode is because I turned on the cheat to ignore max temperature to see what was going on. Mind you, I have a heavily moded KSP, and this post is for the unmoded game. But it seems to me this is not a mod issue. I placed a thermometer on my ship and took this reading. This is no joke. I just want this issue fixed for I really like this game.\n\n[![To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg](http://i1324.photobucket.com/albums/u603/Bonemachine1/To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg)](http://s1324.photobucket.com/user/Bonemachine1/media/To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceK","CreatedById":147100,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T00:24:35Z","Content":"I just encountered something similar.\n\nI reentered the atmosphere with my spaceplane at roughly orbital velocity and timewarp. The instance it dropped out of warp at the edge of the atmosphere, a Quad Adapter exploded. Since I considered it a bug rather than incompetence, I reloaded a safe file from when it was in a 100 km orbit. The engines on the adapter heated up, causing the adapter to explode again. I reloaded a few times, always with the same result.\n\nI think it that\u0027s similar to your problem. There aren\u0027t any fairings on the spaceplane, the only new (1.0.3) items are radiators. Also, I don\u0027t use any mods except for Kerbal Alarm Clock at the moment.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the spaceplane on the night side of Kerbin after I ignored max heating. The left Quad Adapter is the one which exploded. At least I don\u0027t need any lights any more now.\n\n![2015_06_28_00003.jpg](http://s1.postimg.org/8krqefnen/2015_06_28_00003.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T00:26:17Z","Content":"I am having the basically the same problem but im also getting a message saying \u0022can not time warp while under acceleration\u0022.

The ship was at 200 m/s or something like that, 5000m altitude. \n\nThe drop was a failure, so I reloaded : just after the reload, all the the temperature gauges of the experiments in the capsule\u0027s service bay appear and begin to fill. Two seconds later, they explode.\n\nReload : same thing. I immediately open the service bay, and wait. Explosion.\n\nReload : same thing, but I open and immediately close the service bay : the gauges disappear, there is no explosion, I can finish the mission.\n\nAlas, I did not keep the save.\n\nI have tried to reproduce the two incidents, with no luck.
