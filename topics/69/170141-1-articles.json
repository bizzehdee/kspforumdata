I finally narrowed it down to the settings.cfg which is missing from a totally fresh install of KSP. Could the developers look into this? I\u0027m running 1.3.1 and I had to copy the settings.cfg from a github page before it would apply the graphics settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N4palm","CreatedById":178687,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-09T15:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same problem please, but in a more recent version.

I just got used to dropping my old config file into every new version. If your playing just under Steam you should always keep a back up. If you don\u0027t have one you might try just dropping in a blank text file and calling it -\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003Esettings.cfg \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E-\u003C/span\u003E Its a old issue if your under Linux\u00A0 Squad should know about it but you might want to file a bug report?

If it\u0027s not being created I would advise you check if KSP has write permissions in the installation folder, you would think on Steam this is a given, but that\u0027s not always the case.\u00A0Check \u003Ca href=\u0022https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2274-IFLV-5334\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E to find out how to repair the folder\u0027s permissions on Steam (Repair Library Folder subsection):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
