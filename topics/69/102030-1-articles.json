Both now have some minor damage wich i need to repair.\n\nI found this really weird as I had just safely landed and was just rolling slowly along the runway..\n\nThis is not too bad though, happened only this once so far. I am just interested as to what might have caused that if anyone knows. Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T02:31:28Z","Content":"Sounds like the phantom buildings bug. If it happens again, check the flight log (Fn\u002BF3). If you can reproduce it reliably, post your quicksave and/or reproduction steps."}]}
