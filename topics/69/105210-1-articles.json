I\u0027ve actually seen this happen before in 0.90 and I think it may actually be a steam glitch (a friend of mine had the same thing happen in Civilization V).\n\nIt\u0027s just the text of the kerbals names, everything else is fine.\n\nKSP 1.0\n\nWindows 8.1 64x\n\nEdit: A restart of KSP fixed it up. Or maybe a clear of the save, not sure which one did it, probably restart.\n\n[![screenshot2_zpskb2prkyj.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot2_zpskb2prkyj.png)](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot2_zpskb2prkyj.png.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T17:51:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"}]}
