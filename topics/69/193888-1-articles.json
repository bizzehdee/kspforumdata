You can follow along these steps in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to reproduce these errors in KSP 1.9.1. I\u0027m on Win 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. open a new model\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. place a Mk1 command pod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. RMB menu on the pod:\u00A0reduce\u00A0the monopropellant quantity and also change the flow priority. RMB away to close menu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. place any\u00A0MK1 rocket fuel tank below the pod. RMB it and reduce\u00A0liquid fuel and/ or oxidizer levels and also change the flow priority.\u00A0RMB away to close menu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. use ALT \u002B LMB to make a copy of the tank and attach below the first tank. The second tank should be an exact copy of the first... it is NOT. The fuel priority was copied but fuel quantity was reset to default.\u00A0Copy: FAIL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Press CTRL-Z. Second tank is erased as expected. But SURPRISE there\u0027s more you can\u0027t see.\u00A0RMB the first fuel tank. Note\u00A0the fuel quantity and priority have both been reset to default values. Undo: FAIL\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.\u00A0Press CTRL-Z again.\u00A0First tank is erased as expected. Now RMB the command pod. The fuel quantity and priority have both been reset to default values. Undo: FAIL again\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a big model and change many fuel levels and priorities sequentially, then move something by mistake and undo it... it will undo the\u00A0move and ALL the fuel priority/ level changes back until there was a second visible change to the model. All of those changes are undone without warning. Terrible!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a hardware engineer, no software expert, but this is some very basic stuff here, like CS101 stuff. And\u00A0we still can\u0027t press ESC to cancel a move command.
