I have found that in the latest version all landers bounce (Mun or Minmus) as soon as they contact the ground and they never settle. I cannot use airplanes because as soon as the scene loads on the runway, it starts to bounce until the plane shakes itself apart.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a known bug or do I need to do something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-04T00:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a known issue with several landing gears beeing very bouncy in 1.4.4 and 1.4.5.
