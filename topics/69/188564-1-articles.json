When saving a subassembly only the root part of the subassembly gets saved for me. Google unfortunately does not return any usable results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI encountered this in a modded install first, and after going thorugh the lovely exclusion process without any luck I thought I\u0027d check a stock install. Weirdly, after uninstalling KSP, clearing out gamedata and reinstalling KSP,\u00A0I am still seeing this behavior on a stock install. I\u0027m running KSP on windows 10 via steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure this must be related to my machine somehow, but im just unable ot figure this out myself.
