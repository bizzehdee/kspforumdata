I was running 24.0.549 with no issues at all, the only mod was Mechjeb. I finally got around to upgrading to 25, and now I\u0027m experiencing a lot of problems. I\u0027d like to think it\u0027s due to my hardware, but I exceed all minimum requirements. Incidentally, I\u0027ve wiped Mechjeb, the game itself is \u0022clean\u0022 hence it being posted here!

I used to have 24.0.549 set to 1280x1024 as this was the \u0022recommended\u0022 Windows res.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - First issue with 25, it doesn\u0027t get past the loading screen. It just crashes before giving the option to load a game. I used the launcher to change this to 1024x768, and it launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - When going to build a rocket, on entering the building the screen flashes briefly and then loses all of the outer icons... all of the new/save/launch etc, and even the parts menus. However, the options still come up if you mouse over them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - When building the second part of the rocket (so command pod\u0027s there, try adding something else), the game crashes out again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried a reinstall, same result. The other building are fine, I can use the admin building, accept missions, buy science tech etc, it\u0027s just getting past the building a rocket part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies if this has been mentioned in another thread, but searching \u0022crashing\u0022 brings up more results than I can read!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould really appreciate any advice as at the moment I can\u0027t play as I can\u0027t \u0022downgrade\u0022 back to version 24 again! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T01:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter causing the game to crash, please upload your output_log.txt.
