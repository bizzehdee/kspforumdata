KSP 0.25 on the default settings comes very close to this just getting to the main menu so you need to do something to reduce the amount of memory that it uses. The usual solutions to this are either reducing the texture quality by one (or more) notch, or by running with the -force-opengl command line switch, or by installing the Active Texture Management mod.
