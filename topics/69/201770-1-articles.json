Last version I played was 1.9.x. Now trying out 1.11.2 and immediately noticed that when I use the fuel slider on the Flea \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E to adjust the amount of solid fuel in the booster, it is now moving the slider in chunks of 14 rather than one at a time. It looks like they changed from the old slider that was percentage based to a new slider that takes out pre-determined quantities from the total fuel amount. For example, the slider now starts out with 140 units (instead of being at 100%). When I grab the slider to start removing fuel, instead of counting down 139, 138, 137, and so on, the slider now just jumps\u00A0 to 126, then to 112, then to 98, and so on, removing fuel in chunks of 14. I assume this is the same for all the SRBs and probably liquid fuel tanks now too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there are totally logical and worthwhile reasons why this change, which is why I want to know if it is possible to go back to the old way? Is there a setting or something that can revert it back or am I stuck with doing it this way now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-16T22:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanging the increment value might\u00A0be tricky but at the top right of the right click menu (next to the pin) is a \u201C#\u201D. If you click this, \u00A0it lets you type in an exact value, bypassing the slider\u00A0altogether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-16T23:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think any change was made here.
