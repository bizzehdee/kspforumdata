However, If launched with 32 kerbonauts, performance goes straight out the window. I\u0027m having 0.5-1 frames per second. When launched empty (or with only one person) performance is fine. So, the problem is not part-count per se.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any settings I can change to make this work?

I\u0027m pretty new to the game, with just over 300hrs of experience in it. I\u0027ve not had this problem before, because I generally stick to low numbers of Kerbals in my ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027re probably right in saying that the problem is caused by the rendering of the individual Kerbals, and I\u0027m not too sure if KSP renders them in the background. If you\u0027ve not already, I would try minimising the view of the Kerbals and seeing if that works. KSP might still render them in the background, but I don\u0027t have anything else to suggest, sorry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf all else fails, you could try your ascent into orbit via the map screen. I do this sometimes with bigger vessels, doing the gravity turn using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts (or you could use the stock ones from the ship info on the right). This significantly improves the game\u0027s performance for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, hope I\u0027ve fixed the problem!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
