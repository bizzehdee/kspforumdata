I think i finally found the reason on my rig, changed it - and nopw i dont see any difference between my gemFX settings and the vanilla anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, i am on \u003Cstrong\u003ENvidia \u003C/strong\u003Ewith driver \u003Cstrong\u003E368.sth.\u003Cbr\u003E\nusing dx9 mode - please dont rely on this for other rendering methods!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i went into the 3d-settings menu of the driver(nvidia control panel)\u00A0and was also bothered not beeing able to delete my KSP-profiles here, since it seemed that i also wasnt able to add different pathes for the KSP_x64 to try out some settings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nso i wiped the profiles with an external Program andd recreated a new one for a test-install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReading carefully through the manual there was a hint, that some applications might not be able to use AA with HDR on their own,\u003Cstrong\u003E and that u should force the driver to \u0022override the application settings\u0022...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.. well, tried that and - well, there was a huge difference.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think the reason might be that\u00A0KSP / unity is using another method of AA than the driver is...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,128);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:georgia, serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf Override any Application Setting is selected, it will ignore any AA set using the in-game settings, and instead attempt to forcibly apply the type of AA you specify under Antialiasing - Setting.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou should make sure, that u still set AA ingame to 2x, since it might deactivate PPFX (edge-highlighting) if you completely disable it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not 100% sure if this is everything you need to change, since i wiped the whole profile and set some other settings additionally - but thats what i remember to do the trick at last.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d be happy to provide you with more information - depending on the feedback..
