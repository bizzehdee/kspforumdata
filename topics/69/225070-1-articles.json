The game crashes at 3 points that I\u0027ve confirmed so far ;\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn loading the menu\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLeaving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to go to launch\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecovering Vessel\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n----------------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt appears to be happening at loading points. I checked my steam log and all I could find is a line that says the app ID (220200 I think) was removed from running list. There\u0027s no reason given or anything. So I played around with settings. The game seems to be happy when set to these graphical settings ;\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTerrain detail\u00A0 - High\u003Cbr\u003E\nTerrain scatters turned off\u003Cbr\u003E\nScatter Density - 100%\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRender Quality - Fantastic\u003Cbr\u003E\nTexture Quality - Full res\u003Cbr\u003E\nAero Fx- Normal\u003Cbr\u003E\nReflection Refresh - Medium\u003Cbr\u003E\nReflection Resolution - 1024\u003Cbr\u003E\nTerrain Shader Quality - Ultra\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurface, Underwater, Highlight fx all turned on. Not touched the other settings on that side of the graphical menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nScreen Resolution - 2560 x 1600\u003Cbr\u003E\nWindowed mode\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnti-Aliasing 4x\u003Cbr\u003E\nV-Sync - Every V-Blank\u003Cbr\u003E\n120FPS\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd then again I\u0027ve not touched other settings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n------------------------------------------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo for greater context these are my PC Specs\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU I9-13900k\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nGPU 4090\u003Cbr\u003E\nRam 32gb DDR5\u003Cbr\u003E\nm.2 4tb\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe monitor is 4k\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s a pretty high spec PC. Handles every other game with ease (Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher at ultra, Skyrim Nolvus with 2000\u002B mods installed)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n---------------------------------------------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo this brings me onto when the game decides to crash. So naturally given the PC specs I want to play this on 4k full screen. When either FULL SCREEN OR 4k are picked (even when picked separately ie 2560 x1600 full screen) the game seems to crash.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried wiping the game entirely (Delete saves, appdata folder, steam folder). I\u0027ve even wiped my PC recently because I had too much clutter. I\u0027ve verified game files after fresh installs. My GPU driver is up to date, The PC is up to date with all it\u0027s updates. It\u0027s a functioning version of Windows 11 that I run. The game is booting from Steam through PD\u0027s launcher. I\u0027ve even tried bypassing the launcher but still have the same issue. I\u0027ve used -force64 to force KSP into 64 mode which still had no effect. What am I missing here? Is the game simply too old and not utilising the DDR5 RAM or the GPU properly?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously I have the game running but I\u0027m eager to fix this issue to get the best possible vanilla quality of KSP and then maybe tentatively start installing mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E should the game stabilise on vanilla.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
