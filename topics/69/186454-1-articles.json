I\u0027ve noticed it and it\u0027s DLC (which I do not have)\u00A0are on sale at the moment and am wondering if its possible to just transfer it over, I guess? Would using the \u0022Add Non-Steam Game to My Library\u0022 mean I would not have to purchase the game again? The only answers I\u0027ve found online have been contradictory. I just need to make sure I\u0027m not wasting anything buying the same game twice when I didn\u0027t have to. If I do have to\u00A0its fine, more money for more updates I guess. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-17T15:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way the sale is set up right now, you would only save $2.53 buying the DLCs separate from getting the whole bundle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I would just buy the bundle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut AFAIK, you can actually buy the DLCs from Steam and then just put the folders into your store install... at least I\u0027ve seen that mentioned recently on the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-17T15:54:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2019 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Geonovast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
