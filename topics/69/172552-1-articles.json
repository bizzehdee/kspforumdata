The DLC needs to be downloaded, extracted, then \u003Cu\u003Einstalled\u003C/u\u003E, unlike any mods we might\u0027ve used thus far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re savvy about all that, be sure to read the KSP logs generated by the game each time you run it (or at least try to start the game.) Copy that file into a \u0022spoiler\u0022 tab here on the forums and I bet you\u0027ll get a much more\u00A0specific answer. You might even be able to troubleshoot on your own, if you\u0027re able to understand and identify the problem found in the KSP log. You can find your latest KSP session\u0027s gameplay logs in a .txt titled \u0022KSP,\u0022 right next to the game\u0027s main executable, available after your first attempt to boot the game.
