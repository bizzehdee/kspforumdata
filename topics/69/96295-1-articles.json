Unfortunately this won\u0027t occur, when I click on the launchpad, the button stays greyed out and the status of the launchpad states it isn\u0027t in need of repairs?!? Yet it clearly is destroyed with the rubble and the askew angle that the rocket is on when trying to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know how to fix this? Why isn\u0027t an option for indestructible buildings in the regular options menu, why is it only selectable when you start another sandbox campaign?? Why was destructible buildings the \u0027default option\u0027 for older sandbox saves. It\u0027s really annoying tbh.
