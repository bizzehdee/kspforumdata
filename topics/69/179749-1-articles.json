Whenever it hits 270-269mb it pauses and jumps back up to 289-290mb. It\u0027s in an endless cycle. This causes constant stutter while working on my ship and it causing a lot of annoyance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is this and is there a way to make this not stutter endlessly? What is the alocated memory. Is it the cpu cache or is it system ram? I\u0027m not really sure.(nvm it\u0027s over 1gb. It must be system ram.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP latest version(steam I beleive.) 1.5.1.2335\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFedora 28 Latest kernel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhenom II 1100t\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16gb 4x4gb 1600 ram (9cas)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGA-970A-D3 board?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10603BG (410.73 drivers)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo over-clocking or anything(btw, would that help in this game?

I think it was accessing but turned it off to get it to act a little faster and I think it helped. But I still get this annoying stutter. This is a large ship but I\u0027m wondering if there is a way to get rid of the stutter or figure out what it is. It went from 1287mb to 1342mb reserved memory but it\u0027s still having problems. Although I think it\u0027s a little less now that it increased it. It keeps counting down from 290ish mb unallocated to 270ish mb unallocated then dumps some and goes back causing a stutter. the value of unallocated memory is the same regardless of the amount allocated from what I can tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I was wrong. It can change when it stutters. It\u0027s was just in a loop at the same 270mb at the time this occurred. Would it help if it had the option for more ram? Or if we had the option to increase it. What is causing the stutter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis stutter causes lots of problems like causing the mouse to miss do things and rip off parts or stop you from counting spaces to keep parts symetrical. It\u0027s pretty annoying if you are trying to be precise or timely. Caused me to reload a ship way too many times to count and start over work on aspects of my ships. Sometimes it makes it almost impossible to move stuff around in general depending on how aggressive the stutter is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EIs there some sort of memory timing that could be tweaked to make this stutter stop?\u003C/u\u003E Or is there anything else we can do on our end to help reduce this. Besides lowering parts count or whatever on our ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YkHsssL.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YkHsssL.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O0baWYa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/O0baWYa.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-13T00:10:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2018 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-13T11:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try the MemGraph mod:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed885148336\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/175924-15-memgraph-updated-with-stutter-reduction/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:249px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-17T07:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going through the ram timings and figuring out what I can trim down. So far I put it into ganged mode instead of unganged mode and it\u0027s pretty much resolved the stutter. It happens, but at a much reduce effect. Unless I just haven\u0027t caused it sufficiently yet. This may help resolve it though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may have slowed down general performance though. I think my 1000 part ship is flying a little slower than normal now. I\u0027m at 13 seconds per in game second. I think it\u0027s normally less. But I could be wrong(it may normally run this slow. It may even be an improvement.). Upside/downside I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the timing between the engines starting went back down to what it was before the 1.5ish patches. It had regained a pause and this makes that smoother again. From what I\u0027ve read ganged is better for single threaded games. I wonder what changed to make it pause longer in unganged mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.overclock.net/forum/18051-memory/324052-ganged-vs-unganged-mode-13.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.overclock.net/forum/18051-memory/324052-ganged-vs-unganged-mode-13.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been reading that thread.

Might be a little better though. Hard to tell. I think pauses from engine start and time for a plane crash to break up has increased significantly.
