It was a wonderful thing. It was made out of Cubic Octagonal Struts, with some of the tiny rover wheels on there, as well as an External Command Seat, some solar panels, and a battery. Nothing too out of the ordinary. I drove it around for a while \u003Cem\u003E(no problems yet, mind you)\u003C/em\u003E but noticed that putting a Kerbal on there raised the CoM enough to make it a wee bit unstable on hills. So, I added a small SAS module to help it right itself...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eoh no.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately after being decoupled, the rover began to vibrate (the SAS was not turned on at this time). The vibrations increased to an absurd level over a period of a couple of seconds, before the rover crashed into the pod I had used to load it. One of the wheels came off, and the rover immediately stabilized. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon further investigation, here\u0027s some things about this strange vibration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E Removing any one part of the craft via a crash seems to make the wobbling instantly stop. This includes wheels, cubic octagonal struts, or the Kerbal pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E Once the wobbling stops, there is no way to make it start again. The rover remains perfectly stable, and in some cases, can even drive reasonably well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E The Small SAS unit \u003Cem\u003Eis the cause of the wobbling\u003C/em\u003E, and removing it makes the problem vanish. The SAS unit is not clipping into any other part. Furthermore, it \u003Cem\u003Ehas mass\u003C/em\u003E (I think) and thus should be the thing keeping it from wobbling to bits in the first place!
