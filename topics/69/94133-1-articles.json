Killing the physics with time warp would stop the shaking, but then when I went back to 1X it would gradually start to build up again until after about 2 minutes the ship would fly apart. At first I thought it was just the SAS going off the rails, but it would happen exactly the same even if I had everything turned off. When I finally jettisoned those floppy jumbo tanks, the problem fortunately went away completely, but there is no reason things should start shaking around like that when there is no acceleration of any kind being applied to the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T18:39:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 06:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZtheCdr","CreatedById":128427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T17:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I can\u0027t help you unless I know what your ship looks like.
