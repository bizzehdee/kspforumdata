Following the directions of Gene Kerman i adjust the maneuver node and perform a burn with the nukes. The burn is 5min40sec and i physical warp. After a while the engines start to overheat and they destroy the small tanks that they are attached to explode (i am aware of this bug). After this, there is nothing else to do but to quit to the main menu. Then i continue another save game but when i am the KSC screen all the buttons are disabled and the only way to leave is to Alt\u002BF4."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:09:36Z","Content":"LV-N engines will get hot by design, solutions include using other parts to absorb and disperse the heat (not feasible with a pre-made vessel) or to use full power sparingly, and lower throttle settings for long duration burns ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:17:12Z","Content":"Although if the game is freezing up on you, that might be another issue.

I reproduced the bug and here are the steps i took to reproduce it. Before i did this procedure i had a sandox game created.\n\n1. Start the ARM training mission 1\n\n2. Follow the directions of Gene Kerman up to the point where you adjust the node and stat the burn (Gene\u0027s Next button is grayed out until the ship has a close encounter with the asteroid)\n\n3. Start the burn at full throttle, optionally turn psychics warp to any speed you want, i went for 4x and wait until the nuclear engines start to overheat.\n\n4. Wait until the small tanks that the nuclear engines are placed explode (i should have read the changelog better that heat is propagated)\n\n5. Once the tanks explode, end scenario.\n\n6. Go to the sandbox save\n\n7. At this point the only building you can access is the astronaut complex via double clicking, all the other buildings are not accessible, also the exit to main menu button at bottom right works fine at this stage (if you don\u0027t click at the astronaut complex)\n\n8. After you access the astronaut complex and exit, the exit button to main menu is disabled and you can exit the game via Alt\u002BF4\n\noutput log file before i Alt\u002BF4\n\n[http://www./view/d356dei3t0c6c2b/output_log.txt](http://www./view/d356dei3t0c6c2b/output_log.txt)\n\nI run the game at Win 7 64bit\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:11:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kookoo\\_gr**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:16:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E LV-N engines will get hot by design, solutions include using other parts to absorb and disperse the heat (not feasible with a pre-made vessel) or to use full power sparingly, and lower throttle settings for long duration burns ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis needs to be changed ASAP though. Nukes already got a mass increase, fuel change, and a bump further back in the tech tree. Their main purpose is for long burns in deep space. The current heat production makes them unusable for that purpose. Spamming parts is not a viable solution. Neither is running at 20% throttle on an already low thrust engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:43:03Z","Content":"I agree. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI personally don\u0027t like how much it overheats, considering the rest.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"seyss","CreatedById":137952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T01:06:27Z","Content":"Squad ruined LV-Ns...... thanks for making me having to redesign all my crafts"}]}
