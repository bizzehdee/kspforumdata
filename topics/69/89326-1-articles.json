Thanks for any input or suggestions, I tried a search on google and here on the forums without luck. So here\u0027s my story: I have an older Mac with 10.6.8, it has no HDMI so I\u0027ve been using a DVI-HDMI cable to my TV since I got Kerbal. I last played version 23.5 ARM patch with no problems. Decided to wait until 0.25 to get back to the solar system and I\u0027m ready! Psyched for contracts et al!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Due to the age of my computer, I have always set the rendering and textures down a bit, and turn off V-sync, Anti-aliasing, and set the frame limiter to 60 or default. Also I have set my second monitor and the game for 1280 x 720, also for performance reasons. As the Mac users will understand, I have to set the monitor arrangement so the system menu is on the TV where I want to go fullscreen. I\u0027ve tried a few resolutions and alternate Kerbal settings to no avail. When set to my laptop screen Kerbal goes from Fullscreen to windowed no problem. When I set it for the TV, whether I use \u0022apple F\u0022, the settings menu option, or the Kerbal menu \u0022Window\u0022 option, both screens go black and won\u0027t switch back with Apple-F. I never tried Apple-M to minimize before but that isn\u0027t working either once it\u0027s gone black. I can still hear the music running so it doesn\u0027t kill the program but I have to force quit out. I try windowed mode on the TV but no good resolution allows me to see the bottom of the screen, even with the system menu out of the way on the laptop. Has anyone else been using a second monitor and found it to fail with this update or for any reason? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks a million for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T23:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

And thanks for the reply Master Tao, I\u0027ll further display my ignorance on forums and with some aspects of Macs. And yes, I have an old system, time to upgrade as soon as I\u0027m able, but I was happily able to run Kerbal good enough for now. Should I include a .log file, which one and how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Otherwise, I hope this helps as well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E KSP version: 0.25.0.642 KSP Store, not Steam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Add-ons/Mods: None\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E System: OSX 10.6.8 MacBookPro 2.16GHz Intel Core Duo 2GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM (If I remember correctly, I read that I could install 4GB but it would still only show 2, I believe I took out a single 1GB chip and installed 2 2GB chips several years ago for what it was worth)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What happens: I connect the laptop to my HDTV with a DVI-HDMI cable, I set the second monitor for 720p and Kerbal to 1280x720. With screen arrangement set to second monitor (TV) the screen goes black and won\u0027t switch back to windowed. This is while using \u0022Apple-F\u0022. This also happens if I select Fullscreen on the settings menu and accept or apply, and likewise with the top menu option from windowed. With screen arrangement set to laptop, Kerbal will switch between fullscreen and windowed without delay or problem. Changing resolutions or other graphical settings has not had an effect as yet, works fine on laptop, not on second monitor, I will try some more as well soon. I resorted to playing some on the laptop screen for now. Anyway, This has worked fine for me since version 0.19 and was used up to 23.5 without trouble. I have not tried ver 0.24. Not sure what else I could include other than some system log or Kerbal log that is mostly a foreign language to me these days. I understand some of it.
