It\u0027s a nuke powered mining craft around Minmus and given the low acceleration I didn\u0027t bother to use struts. My occurrence only happens during acceleration while on the map screen. Once I click back on the craft view I can see the ship wobbling more and more erratically, even if the engines are then turned off, then it tears itself apart. If the craft is not on the map screen when it accelerates it is fine, but as soon as I go to map, after a few seconds the oscillations begin.\n\nThis is a stock game with no mods, windows 32 version, 1.02, and I\u0027m adding my save game [here](http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Kraken)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:23:36Z","Content":"Guys, we need your logs from after this event occurs, you\u0027ll need to reproduce it and send us the output\\_log.txt and KSP.log\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T12:21:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:53:32Z","Content":"For mine it happened quite a few times with the \u0027Minmus Miner\u0027 craft. Most recently it even happened during acceleration when I was not on the map screen. I\u0027d pretty much decided to abandon that ship and was building a rescue vessel to retrieve the science... I mean the crew of the craft.\n\nAside from the save game I gave earlier [here](http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/KSP.log) is the most recent log file I have. The failure happened quite a few times as I attempted reloading and adjusting the orbit around Minmus in different ways and different thrusts.

Dropping the stage while on a stable orbit made the kraken go. Other time, I (think) I was on a stable orbit, albeti eccntric, around Eve (I was about to land though, so I\u0027m not sure). Opening the service bay alleviated the problem, mostly. Next time, I\u0027ll get a log."}]}
