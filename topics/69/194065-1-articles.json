Could only find quite old threads about this but none of the ones I read had any actual solution, nor has the game been patched to fix the issue. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECLARIFICATION: The squirming will self agitate from the slightest fraction up to a certain point, even if a craft looks stable for several minutes it can start wriggling more and more up to a cap where it at least won\u0027t get any worse but it will keep rolling back and forth by that amount forever, this can make\u00A0docking an absolute nightmare.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore you ask; the control of these crafts is completely solidly locked to the entire craft, no noodling causing it to twist and lag behind. Increasing or decreasing reaction wheel capacity only substantially\u00A0affects frequency of the rolling as far as I can tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only temporary workaround I\u0027ve found is to put three rotors on 3way symmetry with weights on them inside a cargo bay and keep them spinning at some moderate RPM, it causes dampening that makes a substantial difference for up to around 300 ton cafts but becomes very impractical beyond that. (For those not well versed in physics and mechanics: when something spins on one axis it resists having this axis turned in any other direction - having at least three of these pointing away from each other causes the craft to resist turning in all directions and even if you turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E while the craft is rotating on any axis it will eventually slow down to a halt by itself. Yay physics!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould make me very relieved if the problem could be taken care of once and for all, preferrably already in the upcoming 1.10 patch if possible but I\u0027d settle for 1.10.1 without rioting in the streets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDITIONAL EDIT: Hatched the idea while typing up the above and have now tested it properly in several variants, there is a different workaround and probable explanation for why not all players are seeing and reporting this issue. By having the control point sit on a flexible part of the craft immediately connected to reaction wheels (or the control point itself having powerful reaction wheels) the \u0022lag\u0022 is in a way shifted to the body of the craft (not technically 100% accurate but easier to understand) instead of the control point and this causes a moderate dampening effect as long as the body has its own set of reaction wheels as well. This method can be very hard to apply to complex craft with multiple control points since you can\u0027t use the root autostrut on this bendy part so the root has to be in another place than the control point if the craft needs that particular type of strut to reliably fend off Krakens. Combining this \u0022reverse lag\u0022 with the spinning weights method produces reliable results for even stations that weigh many thousands of tons, as long as the spinners are somewhat heavy and attached to the main body of the craft and not the control point of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-25T16:54:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2020 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Rejected Spawn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
