I just saw the sticky about 1028 from 1024.(I honestly thought I had the hotfixes already.) I get the game from steam. Why has it not updated to these version?! I have it set to auto update and even set it now to highest priority. It refuses to update it. Is there a seperate place to get the update. I can\u0027t find one. And would one cause any problems with the steam version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tried opening the game manually via the launcher with the update button.

The Linux build has a long standing bug where it does not properly show the build number.
