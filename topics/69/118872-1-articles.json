I was playing around with that while troubleshooting and I couldn\u0027t figure out why it would work sometimes but not all the time, but I just figured it out. Apparently you have change the mode settings first and then rebind the input after that in order for it to stay. I was trying rebind it first and then change the setting which doesn\u0027t work.
