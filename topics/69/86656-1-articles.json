I\u0027ve been having a tremendous amount of fun with the Debug menu, and especially Whack-a-Kerbal, in 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the bugs that I\u0027ve found so far. Pardon any lack of eloquence, as some of these bugs are a bit difficult to explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Whack-a-Kerbal can now be opened in every screen in the game, including the main menu and the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Mousing over the Debug menu or Whack-a-Kerbal in the Main Menu causes all of the buttons to change color, as if they have been pressed. (They don\u0027t actually get pressed, though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;You can destroy buildings with Whack-a-Kerbal in the Space Center screen, now! (Although I think that this was intended.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;When time-warping up immediately after destroying buildings with Whack-a-Kerbal in the Space Center screen, the time-warp feature gets jittery and laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;When Whack-a-Kerbal has been opened in the Space Center screen, it cannot be closed in any screen except the Space Center screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;When Whack-a-Kerbal is open in the VAB/SPH, trying to move it around can cause the part tab immediately behind it to stay open and follow the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;When mousing over Whack-a-Kerbal in the VAB/SPH with a ship loaded, the symmetry, angle snap, and \u0022Back\u0022 buttons are highlighted, though none of them are actually pressed.
