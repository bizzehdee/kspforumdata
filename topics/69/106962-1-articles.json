I know you can attach struts *to* parts that don\u0027t permit surface attach, but we can\u0027t put the first node of struts or fuel lines on them."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:44:46Z","Content":"Well, I think it\u0027s probably a side effect of the fact that they aren\u0027t set up to accept surface attachment. The problem being that if surface attachment is turned on, then you can attach things to the fairings themselves. This sounds like it\u0027s not a problem, except for the fact that things start phantom floating (sticking in their original position) when the fairings are jettisoned. So, a bug of sorts, but I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s due to the current mechanics.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:46:07Z","Content":"You could just turn on surface attach in the cfg and see what happens, seeing as it\u0027s off though I guess it\u0027s by design."}]}
