There seems to be no option to add action set like other games and also when selecting \u0027set\u0027 within legacy controls I don\u0027t get a popup like normal. I could potentially set up a new scheme from scratch but I want to use some of the triggers that the default config uses such as changing to map mode, flight mode, VAB etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason for doing this is to adjust the \u0027Docking Controls\u0027 mode because the default bindings use the space bar to switch between translation and rotation however this can be achieved with the two thumb pads on the controller at the same time. The problem is that docking controls in game remove the ability to use translation and rotation at the same time, unlike flight control with the \u0027i, j, k, l, h, n\u0027 keys. Another solution I was considering was editing the config for the docking mode key bindings in \u0027settings.cfg\u0027 in the main KSP directory and adding the keys back in but so far I haven\u0027t figured out how to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated, Thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: After experimenting more it doesn\u0027t seem possible to delete existing action sets at all from the configuration screen. I have tested this in both 1.0.5 and 1.1 pre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-19T11:28:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2016 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerbinDallas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
