I haven\u0027t been able to figure out the part number required to determine where the docking port is attached (see the above link for a description of how this works). Now I get a nullref exception spamming in the debug. Not sure if it was there before though. I\u0027ll probably keep trying.\n\nIf anyone knows how to find part numbers (I heard KER might be able to do this?) please let me know.\n\nP.S. Stock Plus fixes some bugs and allows you to rename your docking ports, which is really helpful when you need to find them in the save file!
