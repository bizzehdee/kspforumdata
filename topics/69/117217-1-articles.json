You can continue to edit the ship fine but once you exit the VAB and attempt to launch [this](http://imgur.com/ze0JIgX) happens. If you load the saved ship you get [this](http://imgur.com/bl7tOhO) (Notice the lack of fairing between the second stage engine and the decoupler) instead of a proper VAB, and the only way to remove it is to exit the VAB and re-enter. This bug has happened to me with two different ships, both times when i replaced some LV-T30s with LFBs.\n\n**Craft Files:**\n\n[Original ship with LV-T30s](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1co2pz2piy5twe6/Muna%20V.craft?dl=0)\n\n[Bugged ship with LFBs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/drq09eutyn0qrix/Muna%20VI.craft?dl=0)\n\nThe only difference is the LFBs and I added an extra experiment to the second one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T00:05:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jetwave**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T10:46:35Z","Content":"Hi Jetwave, there is definitely something wrong with your craft but it is not the LFB\u0027s, as by removing the fuel tanks of the north or south facing boosters from your Muna V causes the vessel to be bugged on launch and uneditable on return to the VAB.\n\nNo parts need to be added to your craft to cause this issue.\n\nHere is what happens when you remove one of those tanks, the craft here has had most other parts removed to narrow down the issue.\n\n\u003E ![kcLBxYV.png](http://i.imgur.com/kcLBxYV.png)\n\nThe log is full of errors like this as well.\n\nNullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n\n at Part.requestResource (.Part origin, Int32 resourceID, ResourceFlowMode flowMode, Double demand, Int32 requestID) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\n at Part.RequestResource (Int32 resourceID, Double demand) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\n at ModuleCommand.CheckControlSourceState () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\n at ModuleCommand.FixedUpdate () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\nRemoving the fuel lines didn\u0027t fix it, I suggest you scrap this craft as even completely removing the 2.5m section or re-rooting the vessel did not fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"Jetwave","CreatedById":97965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T14:34:08Z","Content":"Ahh, I didn\u0027t think that it would be removing the parts that caused it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ll just use this as an opportunity to make a 2.5m Lander."}]}
