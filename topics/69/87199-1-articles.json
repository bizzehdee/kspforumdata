After failing to achieve orbit around Mun due to lack of fuel, I had my Kerbal EVA to push the capsule into orbit. After reaching 10% hydrazine I had the Kerbal enter the capsule to refuel. On the second time of pushing I was down to 20% fuel and had nearly achieved an orbit and suddenly the camera started to spin and zoom out. As a result the Kerbal flew away from the capsule. Every time I would navigate close to the capsule the camera would start to spin again and he would jet in all directions both consuming fuel and moving in random directions away from the capsule. This occurred until my Kerbal exhausted his fuel and both he and the capsule he nearly rescued plowed into the munar surface. :\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T19:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich capsule were you using? Actually, a description of all the parts of the capsule, or better yet a screenshot of it, would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how close were you to the capsule when the spinning started?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of known issues with EVAs on certain capsules, specifically the MK1 (starter capsule..). One issue is a tendency for Kerbals to slide off the ladder on EVA. The other issue is Kerbals being rapidly ejected away from the capsule when you EVA. The rapid ejection seems to only occur with certain part combinations. I\u0027ve seen it with a Z200 inline Battery on top of a MK1 pod, but it may exist with other part combinations as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, if you can provide more information that would be interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IonStorm","CreatedById":9417,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T23:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t take a screen shot, but I had a Command Pod Mk1 with a Mk16 Parachute, two Mk2-R Radial-Mount Parachutes, two OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels, two Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Units, two Pegasus I Mobility Enhancers, one 2HOT Thermometer, one Communotron 16, and one SC-9001 Science Jr. Such as the arrangement shown. I was pushing on the bottom of the Science Jr. I had done so successfully for one load of EVA hydrazine and was finishing my second. Whenever I would EVA within, say a 10 or 20 m the camera would freak out again and my Kerbal would RCS off in some random direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen the sliding ladder issue and the ejecting from the door issue. This was something else. It was the camera changing perspectives (perhaps from orbital to chase as I was on the edge of getting my orbit above the munar surface?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16962811/ScreenShot.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ScreenShot.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T01:51:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 01:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by IonStorm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eedited for added clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T03:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I wasn\u0027t able to duplicate the issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027m also thinking along the lines of camera mode. I was going to ask which camera mode you were in (Free, Chase...). I think there\u0027s a good chance the camera changed modes, as you suggested maybe because you were at an altitude border and the mode automatically changed. That can be frustrating sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try different camera modes, and I experienced some camera strangeness while transitioning to Auto mode, and also while in Auto mode. Things happened pretty fast, so I\u0027m not sure exactly what order things happened. At one point I was hitting the spacebar to orient the Kerbal while the camera was swinging around, causing some unwanted motion. Another time, the camera shifted as I was making some inputs, again causing some unwanted motion. I don\u0027t think I got the same effect or severity you got however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I\u0027m also thinking a camera mode transition is the culprit. It sounds like you saw this effect several times as you made several (probably frantic) attempts to push the capsule into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was testing this above Kerbin, not Mun, so it\u0027s possible I\u0027m not seeing the same effect because of my location- I\u0027ll try Mun later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I\u0027ve actually had better luck just abandoning the ship and getting the Kerbal to EVA his way into a stable orbit- letting the ship crash and coming back later to pick up the floating Kerbal. Sadly, you lose the Science you had in the capsule, so I certainly understand the reasoning behind trying to push it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IonStorm","CreatedById":9417,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T23:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking into it. You know, I forgot I could change the camera mode during EVA (I don\u0027t get much time to play and keep in practice). I also figured I\u0027d try to be greedy and get my whole capsule (besides that\u0027s where the snacks are). I figured I would have enough time to emergency transmit the data and EVA my Kerbin into a safe orbit for rescue on the last refill of hydrazine. Pushing the capsule into orbit was going perfectly until I was nearly there and I tried to EVA to refill my hydrazine. Then I frantically tried to get back to the capsule before expending all my hydrazine--I nearly opened the cheat menu, but decided to accept my (Kerbal\u0027s) fate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m expecting a Kongressional inquiry into the incident.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tychochallenge","CreatedById":85444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T23:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei am having a very similar problem.
