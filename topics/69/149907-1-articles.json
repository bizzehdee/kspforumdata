No mods yet. The problem I\u0027m having is that once KSP loads up, it immediately loads Default career save, \u00A0and goes into the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be a great feature if it were configurable - if I could turn it on and off, and specify which career save to use. But it always uses Default career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried deleting the Default career, but then the game re-creates it the next time I launch it, and goes back into tracking station again. Can somebody explain this? I\u0027m not sure if my computer specs or anything is relevant, so I\u0027m skipping that part. As I said, no mods, build 1.2.0.1586, installed through Steam, though launched from shortcut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T13:09:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would help us if you provided more information on this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you describe is not normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
