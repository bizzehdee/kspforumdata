Passing us some log files and what version of KSP (OS) can help give us clues. My first thoughts are to double check your folder permissions (since you deleted everything) and make sure they aren\u0027t read only. Steam has some weird tendency with that.

I tried your suggestion and changed the KSP folder to remove the read-only option but that didn\u0027t solve the problem. I believe the default Steam link to the game is the 32x version so instead of launching that again I tried the 64x version in the KSP folder. That version of the game loaded up just fine and I had the option to start a new game, ect. I thought maybe there was just a problem with Steam so I tired the regular KSP executable for the 32x version and got the same problem. Here is a link to the dropbox copy of the output_log text file.
