Less lag. Fly to 100m/s on runway to see drag line using F12 to see aero lines. At 120m/s you will see the other normal drag lines. Using aero gui or aero context menu(action menu) info then relaunching at runway will cause other bug.(Although this seems to have stopped for me all of a sudden. Maybe be hard to reproduce. Not necessarily important. I included it incase it is somehow related.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft is not stable structurally.\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E It requires unbreakable joints to use\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. There is also another bug where if you open the aero gui or context menu info or similar from the RightShift\u002BF12 menu and then try to reload on the runway it will break on runway even with cheats. It will then have further problems as time goes on. This problem with the aero menu and other info is making it very hard to test. It makes me restart the game every time I look at any numerical drag info in the game relevant to the craft. I\u0027m not sure if the two are related problems or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the full sized craft, at between 366-400m/s the drag will overcome the craft and draw it sideways until eventually the tail fins cannot control the slippage created by this mysterious drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227CrTlA4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7CrTlA4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see it on the right side of the craft. It\u0027s one red bar much longer than the others in the clouds of the engine smoke. This is a top down view of the craft. It\u0027s starting from somewhere in the right most pillar on the right with the extra fuel and one single cargo bay. I cannot figure out where it originates. It almost seems like it not from a part but from some phantom force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally this level of drag comes from an uncapped part. But I cant\u0027 find one within the craft. Is there a possibility this is happening between joints where the cargo bay meats the fuel tank or similar. Or from any joint. I would say it might be from forces opening a joint on the craft but I think it does this on the runway also even though you can\u0027t see the drag at that point as far as I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E I think I just found the drag location. It appears it\u0027s the rear cargo bay door. At least on the runway. I\u0027ll try to replace it and fix it. It\u0027s weird it\u0027s only the one side. BTW, it starts to show the drag line at about 100m/s while trying to take off. Not sure why, but I didn\u0027t think it showed excess drag last time when I went over the parts in that column.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact I think the bigger bug here, if not related, might be the problem with reloading on the runway after using the gui or menu physics/thermal info... If you go back it starts decaying your game by blowing up on the runway then looking up into the sky and lights textures start to disappear. You have to restart the game entirely from desktop to resolve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanging out the part did not remove the drag.. I\u0027ll reduce the engine number for parts reduction and see if it\u0027s still an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just modified the plane to fix some issues with the wings and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E not related to this bug. I managed to make the same drag switch from the right side of the plane to the left in the exact same manner... Could it be related to mirrored parts put on in double symatry.
