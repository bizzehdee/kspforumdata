Is there a game performance issue that would arise from this, or is it only a matter of user patience being threatened? I can handle laggy performance to do cool stuff, but if a moon landing attempt could be botched due to frame-rate physics that\u0027s something different. :\\"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T06:10:31Z","Content":"Please provide more information. Has it been doing this all along, or has the game slowed down? How many parts does the ship in question have? Is it attempting to land near other ships already landed?

I noticed the over 4-1 Real-to-game second ratio when I was flying a behemoth of a jet across for a survey. I will try to analyze the true FPS tonight, all I can say now is on launch a non-tiny ship causes very blocky performance. I expected this as the laptop is a utility pc and not built for graphics. I can cope with a bad frame-rate, but I just wanted to make sure the physics engine wouldn\u0027t \u0022falter\u0022 because of it.\n\n...like, for instance, This oddity from this morning- Valentina stepped off of the parked aircraft to do an EVA report, and before she could stand up, she Exploded. ...Yes, I don\u0027t get it either.\n\nP.S.- \u0026 thank you Sal-vager, I will apply the frame rate counter tonight to get more sci- err, data.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T16:24:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GarrisonChisholm**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:26:35Z","Content":"This seems better in Support, when you get a chance GarrisonChrisholm, please upload your KSP.log, output\\_log.txt, (from KSPData), settings.cfg and dxdiag to dropbox for us, we\u0027ll see if we can find a way to improve your situation.\n\nMoving to Support."},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:36:40Z","Content":"@sal\\_vager // Thank you Sal\\_vager; I will return to investigating this shortly, however at the moment the Fun side of the equation is still greater than Toil, so I am exploring more of the game before getting to my framerate issues. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) -- thank you for your unfettered willingness to attempt to help so many people."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:39:46Z","Content":"Attempt is the word, if I could fix KSP so it\u0027d work for everyone I would."}]}
