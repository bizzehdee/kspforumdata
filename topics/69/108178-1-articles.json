A normal shock cone intake at low altitude and around mach speed. \n\nThere seem to be 2 drag systems still in the game. The old one with 0.3 drag value and adjusted for air intake. This is the drag that shows up in the action menu even if you dont have aero forces enabled in menus. \n\n![A5F0D9411B2732F778BFA2F5580B1CCE75D7B6C1](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534018874973017638/A5F0D9411B2732F778BFA2F5580B1CCE75D7B6C1/)\n\nAs you see the relic of the old system is showing drag of 1.78 while the new one under it says 20.07. \n\nWhen you close the intake:\n\n![85B3D2ECCBC2FCC1ACBAADD0674B659ABE76C551](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534018874973017911/85B3D2ECCBC2FCC1ACBAADD0674B659ABE76C551/)\n\nThe old system shows 0.3, the new one 19.94. The difference in the new one is I think just those few meters of altitude and fluctuation in speed between screenshots. Not whether the cone is closed or not. \n\nIs this intended or unintentionally left out?\n\n(btw, I dont consider mechjeb and KER as being a detriment to posting this in \u0022unmodded\u0022 section. )\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T08:48:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Radam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:48:57Z","Content":"This is not a mod issue, thats why I ORIGINALLY put it into unmodded section!"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T01:52:04Z","Content":"(Moved back to main support for visibility.)\n\nIntended: intakes, like everything else, use the new dragcube system, so the drag value set by (and displayed by) the intake module (set based on closed/open, or intake rate) is completely ignored."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T07:09:33Z","Content":"So its intended that closing intakes does not matter, and that a standard nosecone has higher drag than shock cone intake?\n\n![5DF425049A50FBB7B119B11B55C81A7B54E3D4EE](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534018989696458029/5DF425049A50FBB7B119B11B55C81A7B54E3D4EE/)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nA separate but similar intriguing thing, a fairing base has the same drag coefficient after fairing separation:\n\n![759496FD4EB5989C0AD5308D576EC1F4F231F622](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534018989696502526/759496FD4EB5989C0AD5308D576EC1F4F231F622/)\n\n![017B0F0CE5F99A171F442C7D18914F5A4EF881DB](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534018989696502851/017B0F0CE5F99A171F442C7D18914F5A4EF881DB/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:36:21Z","Content":"Im still inclined this was not intended. As the feature was in 0.9 and there still are ways to modify drag multiplier of the part on the go. Just like landing gear for example. And as in real life the front part of the intake might not contribute much to the drag, but overall the air inside the duct will surely make more drag than if it were just a pointy cone. \n\nThen again changing current drag values would mean increasing drag alot when they are open, and making it slightly more than a cone when closed. Which would put even more drag on various SSTO designs. \n\nSo, whatever ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n(code still needs a cleanup from the remnants of the old system)"}]}
