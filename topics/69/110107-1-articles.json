KSP feels like it did before Squad fixed the garbage collection issues. Ships of around 500 part that would run fine in version 0.90 now run much slower..\n\n Also after only 5 mins of play the audio starts skipping and popping like it used to.. What the hell is going on here??\n\nIs this an know issue with version 1.02? Why havent Squad said anything about this? I have waited so long for Squad to sort things out and we are taking steps backwards..\n\n Unity 5 will improve things hopefully but we are talking 6 months at least.. \n\nSo how can I check if its my PC or KSP? Anyone else having audio skips and pops along with reduced game performance?\n\nAnd, why haven\u0027t Squad said anything about the bugged ambient sound?? \n\nThank you for reading this.\n\nMJ"},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:23:02Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know about audio, but I feel my fps is lower in 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:29:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know about audio, but I feel my fps is lower in 1.0\n\nI can confirm they are. I have tried the same ships in v0.90 and now in this one. FPS are lower in v1.02. \n\nIf someone can do an experiment for me I will rep them. Build a ship of around 500-600 parts in the VAB. Then load it and move around for a while. Does the audio skip for you?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:31:10Z","Content":"Maybe [**Sarbian\u0027s memory tool**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92907-GCMonitor-1-2-3-A-graphic-Memory-monitor-%28Feb-22th%29)will help pinpoint the issue MajorJim, it\u0027s worth a try."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:40:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe [**Sarbian\u0027s memory tool**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92907-GCMonitor-1-2-3-A-graphic-Memory-monitor-%28Feb-22th%29)will help pinpoint the issue MajorJim, it\u0027s worth a try.\n\nIs it normal for FPS to go no lower than 33.3 FPS?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:51:38Z","Content":"What\u0027s wrong with 33 fps?"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:12:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s wrong with 33 fps?\n\nNothing at all. I was just curious as no matter what I do FPS never goes below 33.3 FPS. But it is far from smooth with all the frame skipping and audio bugs the game is unplayable for me at the moment.
