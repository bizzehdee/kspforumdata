I stopped playing last spring to wait for the 64-bit support so I could include mods. In summary, clean installs of KSP from Steam\u00A0crash\u00A0during the initial load screen when launched in 64-bit. If it does load through (less than 1 in 10 times), the game will eventually crash while playing. In those cases, it happens\u00A0when I have taken screenshots or toggled thermo/aero. 32-bit appears to work fine. My PC is Windows 10 64-bit. Why 32-bit works when my PC is definitely 64-bit, I do not understand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have talked with a mod from DasValdez\u0027s twitch channel who gave me many suggestions to try, including verifying cache and trying an install on my HD instead of SSD. I\u0027ve also posted other details, specs,\u00A0and a couple of output_log files in the bugs forum.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9427\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9427\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust prior to posting this, I deleted the whole KSP folder from the steamapps/common folder, reinstalled via steam, and launched 64-bit (right click; \u0027Launch KSP (64-bit)\u0027). I believe it should be version 1.1.2.\u00A0I got another crash somewhere randomly in the loading screen. I only get output_log files and KSP log files. No specific error or crash logs, nor do I get an option to send a crash report to the devs. I saved the logs from the most recent crash and a DxDiag report, but I\u0027m not sure how to upload the files\u00A0in here just yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve not really seen an other reports similar to mine. Any suggestions are welcome.\u00A0I hope to eventually resolve this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you,\u003Cbr\u003E\nlilmp89\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T11:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/1162-lilmp89/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u00221162\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/1162-lilmp89/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_5802_6\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@lilmp89\u003C/a\u003E, the Unity3D engine is sensitive to other software hooked into memory, and several programs are known to cause KSP to crash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most well known software that causes this is EVGA\u0027s PrecisionX 16, Fraps can also cause this when displaying the frame rate of an application.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you don\u0027t have these you are using RivaTuner Statistics Server, which hooks into memory and monitors the frame rate, this is a 32bit application which may also explain why it is causing trouble for KSP 64bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom your logs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\RivaTuner Statistics Server\\RTSSHooks64.dll:RTSSHooks64.dll (0000000180000000), size: 442368 (result: 0), SymType: \u0027-exported-\u0027, PDB: \u0027C:\\Program Files (x86)\\RivaTuner Statistics Server\\RTSSHooks64.dll\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease disable RivaTuner Statistics Server before playing KSP, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lilmp89","CreatedById":1162,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T18:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat fixed it!!!
