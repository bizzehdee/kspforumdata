Clicking on items becomes almost impossible, most clicks seem to get ignored completely and you have to keep trying until it registers.\u00A0The entire computer gets slow: if I cmd-tab to the desktop, the dock and all other animations are just as stuttery. But everything is butter-smooth again the moment I quit KSP. Sometimes it starts again right away when I relaunch KSP (even the main menu with the yellow text lines stuttering into place instead of sliding smoothly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s even weirder: every time I have this issue, I close the lid of my laptop, wait until it goes to sleep (which takes longer than usual, up to a minute or so), then open it up again, and all of a sudden the game is smooth\u00A0again. Really smooth, like 60 fps or so. Sometimes it starts stuttering again shortly afterwards, so I repeat the sleep trick and it\u0027s OK again. After a couple of times, it stays smooth for a much longer time, I\u0027ve been able to play for half an hour or so with smooth animations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas what might cause this? I have a MacBook Pro 17 inch mid-2010, 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB of RAM, SSD, Intel HD Graphics 288 MB and NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MB. I know it\u0027s getting a bit old, but most of the time it can handle the game just fine, and the stuttering is totally unrelated to workload. It gets really hot while playing KSP, but that does not seem to be related to the stuttering since, after a few seconds of sleep, it\u0027s smooth again and sometimes remains smooth for half an hour while still being very hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any insights,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMichel Colman\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-01T15:49:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2016 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by michelcolman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T18:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what to suggest \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157405-michelcolman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157405\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157405-michelcolman/\u0022\u003E@michelcolman\u003C/a\u003E, if you \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022\u003Etake a look here\u003C/a\u003E and upload your Player.log and hardware info to dropbox then we can take a look and see if anything stands out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T02:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeat can be a huge problem for laptops especially if there is no clearance underneath it for air to\u00A0flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the GPU or CPU is too hot it can\u0027t do it\u0027s job effectively and you will often see stuttering or loss of frame rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend a\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant\u0026amp;ion=1\u0026amp;espv=2\u0026amp;ie=UTF-8#q=laptop%20cooling%20pad\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecooling pad\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0you can get them for around 10 dollars, and they will do wonders for your overheated lap and your overheated laptop.
