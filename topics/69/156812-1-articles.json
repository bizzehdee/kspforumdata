I went back in and when I tried to load the vessel. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E vessel selector had NOTHING there. I went to the craft files and got rid of the crafts and it then loaded all the stock vessels just fine. I put back all the vessels and when I checked. it was all gone again. not the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003Esph\u003C/abbr\u003E but just the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E. while I was moving all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E vessel out of the folder I saw that the one I was working on was 3 megabytes. all the others where 10-20 kilobytes and there \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewas\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a 200 kilobyte craft there as well. (the base\u00A0launcher, which\u00A0I used for launching the satellites) so could someone please explain how that weird stuff happened?
