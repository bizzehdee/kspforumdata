Later, I received a contract to expand the station to a capacity of 11 and have an Engineer on board. I took this as an opportunity to really expand my station, but I did it in parts. I launched a module up to the space station (say for example I was connecting Unity to a Zarya module), which didn\u0026#39;t increase the capacity. As soon as I docked, the contract was marked as Failed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI didn\u0026#39;t fail the contract, I just haven\u0026#39;t fully completed it yet ... the next module (say, Zvezda) would have added the engineer plus remaining life support requirements for the contract. I don\u0026#39;t think these contracts should auto fail right as soon as you dock another ship to it. If the station gets destroyed in the process, or the contract times out, I could see it being marked as failed. But not for docking multiple craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKess\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T06:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe contract should not fail when docking partial segments.
