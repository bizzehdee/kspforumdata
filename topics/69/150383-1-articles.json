A lot of the times the parts will not turn green or be able to show the GUI. I have the rotate the craft or camera view a lot to get them to work again, sometimes even go to the space center and back to the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HiTechKerbal","CreatedById":170607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T21:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same problem. This makes the game unplayable at times. Quick save/reload will work for like 2 seconds then the parts will go unselectable again until game restart. It\u0027s not all parts, and it\u0027s not even the same parts every time. Like right now, I\u0027m about to land and the heat shield isn\u0027t selectable/highlighting at all, whereas the last flight I could jettison it no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-22T19:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll need your logs guys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
