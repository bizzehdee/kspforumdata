It may also be a problem when a joystick gets removed because it is no longer detected... although this was not my case.\n\nAfter deleting the settings.cfg file (this is a pretty big hammer as it also resets all your other settings) I was able to register my joystick axis. I think the config file gets some bad settings (in particular for pitch axis -- although this may just be a symptom of the fact that it is the first setting and is the most likely to get \u0022multiple\u0022 and/or \u0022changed\u0022 joystick configs first) and hangs before popping up the dialog to register the axis.\n\nAnyway, after removing the settings.cfg file, it started working.

I can program buttons in all day but whenever i try to change the axis bindings they don\u0027t work at all. \n\nThe only way I have ever gotten around this issue is to move KSP from the steam app folder and to a flash drive or other folder then start steam and uninstall and reinstall KSP but make a copy of the fresh install and move my mods and save game to the copy. I then play on the the copy directly and can once again change axis bindings without the screen graying out. if the game crashes or I close it i have to make a new copy and do it again. it seems that KSP only likes to bind axes in a fresh install I don\u0027t know why. I have even tried with out mods and I still run into the same problem after the binding change. I know they are supported because other games like Microsoft flight sim x steam edition the controls work fine on all three devices. any help would be much appreciated. i have run into this problem since 0.90 to 1.0.4\n\nWhen I have been able to bind the axes it works like a charm but if I reload the game the bindings are no longer there and if I change any other settings I run into the problem of screen resizing and even if started from the launcher the problem still persists. This is so very annoying and I would really like to free up some disk space so I don\u0027t have to have two copies of KSP on my computer. no settings are saved even though in the config file they are correct it seems to either not check the config file or is checking a config file in the hard code and glitching out."},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:51:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yea I have the same problem with either my Xbox 360 wired controller, CH Pro USB pedals or my CH Flight Sim USB yoke.

Running a thrustmaster warthog and saitek pedals. I get this problem if I use TARGET to attempt to overcome unity\u0027s ridiculous 20 button limit. If i disable TARGET then the input maps correctly, but of course then the HOTAS is pointless since you can\u0027t use its inputs.\n\nDeleting the settings.cfg has no effect. Reassigning device ID\u0027s with JoyID has no effect.\n\nSemi-workaround: The advanced fly by wire mod \\*does\\* work with TARGET running, but only if you remap almost everything to keyboard input. If you don\u0027t do this it doesn\u0027t recognize some inputs (ie, the switches).\n\nUnfortunately the AFBW mod also has some other issues, like corrupting its config if you press a joystick button while in the keyboard config window (may sound like an odd thing to do but when you\u0027re remapping 40-odd inputs to keyboard keys it can be easy to forget which ones are still regular buttons - namely the modifier buttons set in TARGET). Some functions in AFBW also don\u0027t seem to work, for example the \u0022physics warp\u0022 input can be mapped but has no effect. \n\nFurther, some inputs are simply unavailable in the stock configuration, like physics warp, trim, show/hide the navball, and so on - because \u0022reasons\u0022, no doubt. So you can\u0027t just run stock either.\n\nSo, basically, no matter what you do, you\u0027re boned. The only bug-free solution I\u0027ve ever found with KSP is to manually program everything in autohotkey. But you can\u0027t really expect everyone to do this, and it still won\u0027t give you otherwise-unmappable inputs (\\*cough\\* trim \\*cough\\*) like AFBW will.\n\nThis is not an acceptable state of affairs for a post 1.0 \u0022flight sim\u0022 styled game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T02:36:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T12:28:01Z","Content":"I have a similar problem, the game doesen\u0027t seem to recognize my joystick axis.
