The reason it gets stuck is because I\u0027ve offset the decoupler slightly inside the heat shield case, for aesthetic reasons. This offset is what causes the fairing to get stuck, but it\u0027s the consequence of the stuck fairing that I\u0027m reporting about (as I\u0027m sure there are other ways to get a fairing stuck).\n\nIf a jettisoned fairing panel becomes stuck or remains in contact with a craft then:\n\n- You can\u0027t time warp and the message that appears says \u0022Cannot warp faster than 1x while moving over terrain\u0022 \n\n- The orbit in map mode goes haywire; no orbital path can be seen, but the Ap and Pe nodes are still present but are not in the right places (although the values they report are correct I think).\n\nI guess the detached fairing panel in contact with the craft makes the craft \u0022think\u0022 that it is in contact with the ground.\n\nI\u0027ve created a simpler craft that has the required design to make this issue happen. This is it in the VAB, I\u0027ve highlighted the small upper fairing panel which that part that clips into the heat shield casing (the fairing is expanded so it\u0027s outside the casing in the picture, when not expanded it is inside the casing).\n\n[![OWZquG8h.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/OWZquG8h.jpg?1)](http://imgur.com/OWZquG8)\n\nThe separation is messy as the panels collide with the casing. It always seems that all sections but 1 end up clear of the craft, just 1 faring panel always remains stuck\n\n[![PJ6mtsyl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PJ6mtsyl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/PJ6mtsy)\n\nIn these two pics you can see the fairing panel stuck, clipped partly into the heat-shield casing and in the second picture is the message about not being able to warp while moving over terrain.\n\n[![jwR0OvRh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jwR0OvRh.jpg)](http://imgur.com/jwR0OvR)[![ZaktpQyh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZaktpQyh.jpg)](http://imgur.com/ZaktpQy)\n\nThis is what happens in map mode; There is no blue orbital path and note the Ap marker quite some distance away from the actual orbit. Sometimes both markers are visible and sometimes they are static, in this test run just the Ap marker could be seen and it was flickering about all over the place.\n\n[![WcX4X4ah.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WcX4X4ah.jpg)](http://imgur.com/WcX4X4a)\n\nI can still use physical time warp and if I go into 4x physical warp and roll the ship fast that will dislodge the stuck fairing panel (here it is just as it became dislodged)\n\n[![7y2kuuKl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7y2kuuKl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/7y2kuuK)\n\nOnce dislodged the orbit in map mode returns to normal and I\u0027m able to time warp again.\n\n[![v5fINpmm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/v5fINpmm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/v5fINpm)[![vEOrCPCm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vEOrCPCm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/vEOrCPC)\n\n**Here is a craft that will cause this issue to happen.** [**http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/FairingBugDemo**](http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/FairingBugDemo)\n\nTake it into orbit and jettison the fairings. Most times 1 panel will remain stuck in the heat-shield casing and the issue can then be seen.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T19:40:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:30:08Z","Content":"When the dust settles around here, remind me of this again since I suspect it\u0027ll get buried.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:12:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When the dust settles around here, remind me of this again since I suspect it\u0027ll get buried.\n\u003E Cheers,\n\u003E \n\u003E -Claw\n\nThanks Claw!

In my case, I believe the fairing parts got stuck because the fairing was clipping through struts. Because the probe inside the fairing was the same diameter as the fuel tank below the fairing, the only way to run struts up onto the probe itself (to keep it from wobbling) was to attach the struts to the slope of the 2.5m adaptor below all that. Thus, the base parts of the fairing ciipped these struts, and it was those parts that stuck to the rocket.\n\n[![17292777644_8266d3cab8_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5321/17292777644_8266d3cab8_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/sm71jG)\n\nThe fairing parts remained stuck even when the ship was under forward thrust. However, I followed a tip from the gameplay questions forum on this subject, and spun the ship in roll using the E key. This slung the fairing parts away quite nicely. In fact, they took off with such speed I think their decoupler force finally kicked in. And once the fairing bits were gone, ship control was back to normal."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T04:48:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because the probe inside the fairing was the same diameter as the fuel tank below the fairing, the only way to run struts up onto the probe itself (to keep it from wobbling) was to attach the struts to the slope of the 2.5m adaptor below all that.
