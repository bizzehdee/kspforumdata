I believe it\u0027s occurring because the structural design of my rocket starts the cockpit\u00A0upside down and doesn\u0027t deploy the main rocket thrusters until about 6 million ft from kerbal. When I save the game and log out for the night. Then log in to resume flight, the only thing that spawns in, is the cockpit which is empty and a wierd camera angle that doesn\u0027t allow me to rotate the camera properly. This is really frustrating because I\u0027m orbiting other planets or moons from a single flight session and can\u0027t continue my science projects on a later day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a couple screenshots of my design.
