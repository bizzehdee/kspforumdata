Both parts have bugged in strange way. Whenever I restart whole game, their pitch, yaw and roll are automatically changed to strange values (as seen in left bottom part of HUD). I have tried disabling SAS by modifying persistent.sfs file, but that don\u0027t help. When I press any key for control, I can normally control it, but when I release key, it always change it\u0027s value back to strange values. Nothing helps here. Are there saved values for yaw, pitch and roll in persistent.sfs? If they are, I just need to know what values have I to change.\n\nI had some mods before and uninstalation doesn\u0027t help.\n\nEDIT: Solved. Just opened it in notepad\u002B\u002B and searched for pitch. There were trimPitch, trimYaw and trimRoll values, which were set to values corresponding to values they were set in-game. I have set them all to 0 and problem was solved.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T10:20:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 10:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nik333**"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T10:34:32Z","Content":"Looks like you had trim set (possibly by accident).
