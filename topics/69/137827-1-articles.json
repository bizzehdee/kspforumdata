Today\u00A0I noticed that whenever a Kerbal goes EVA,\u00A0framerate drops\u00A0from a (fairly) solid 30-25 (in space)\u00A0to an extremely unstable state that varies between what looks like\u00A05 and ~15, basically making everything barely playable for the remainder of the session. When two kerbals are out of the vessel simultaneously I don\u0027t get more than 10 fps. In addition to this, KSP seems to load slightly faster\u00A0when I use the 32 bit\u00A0version\u00A0(when running 64 bit transition between all screens takes slightly longer and the main menu hangs up for a few seconds\u00A0before becoming usable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run KSP on\u00A0Windows 7 64 bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T07:02:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Somgosomgo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
