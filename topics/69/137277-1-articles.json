Now obviously this rocket was designed by a blind apprentice, so de-orbiting would be... a challenge. Being a newbie and wanting a retry,\u00A0I went to space center, hit Save Game, gave it a name, and tried to deorbit with a periapsis at 35k or so. Oops, came in from too high, so even though my capsule miraculously survived re-entry it smashed into the ocean. Reload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUhm. Except there\u0027s no save file. It didn\u0027t, in fact, save anything. The saves folder has my initial save file from back when I started (so it did work once), and a persistent.sfs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to load my initial save file, and now it overwrote my persistent.sfs no questions asked. I\u00A0am now out of a few hours of productive gameplay,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else have this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
