When I enabled the full screen in the graphics tab of KSP it simply sets it borderless full screen. Is there a way to force it to lock into proper true full screen rather it be a INI edit or some option I have simply overlooked?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance for any assistance\u0027s.

So there must be something else interfering. Avoid running KSP from the launcher, run directly from KSP.exe instead.

Well, the fact that it\u0027s minimising when you click off the screen it\u0027s active in usually indicates in it\u0027s true fullscreen mode -- in fact, that\u0027s often reported as one of the most annoying troubles with trying to get KSP running smoothly on a multi-monitor setup. Not sure why the G-sync thing is not kicking in, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can see on the interwebs, G-Sync is a technology that requires you to have both a monitor \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E graphics adapter that support it.

I have a GSYNC monitor and a supported video card. Running the game in full screen does not kick in GSYNC. I think this may be a problem with Unity games because the same behavior with Hearthstone.
