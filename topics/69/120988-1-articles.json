Everything is in working order, with the exception of one rather upsetting bug: my trajectory and orbit paths disappear from map view whenever I zoom out. This makes planning maneuvers extremely difficult even for nearby bodies, and completely impossible for distant ones. The paths reappear as soon as I zoom in, but I have to zoom in so close that I effectively can\u0027t plan any useful maneuvers. I can\u0027t do any interplanetary missions at all, even though the game runs flawlessly otherwise. Suffice to say, this is a bummer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some searching around and didn\u0027t see anything which looked like a conclusive answer. I did try adding \u0022LC_ALL=C\u0022 to Steam\u0027s KSP launch options because I found several people who recommended it as a kind of general fix for KSP issues on Linux, but in this case it didn\u0027t make any difference.

I think we can be sure this isn\u0027t an AMD-only issue, seeing as I do not have any AMD components in this computer. But I suspect you\u0027re on to something about OpenGL not working right with my particular drivers. I gathered what information I could about my graphics hardware, which is an Intel model, but before getting to that I have another thought:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel\u0027s website has up-to-date graphics driver downloads for Ubuntu versions 14.10 and 15.04 ... but not for 14.04, which is the version I\u0027m presently running. I installed 14.04 because that\u0027s what the Ubuntu website recommended, and I\u0027m relatively new to Linux. I\u0027m wondering if it would be worth switching to one of these newer Ubuntu versions in order to try out the updated Intel graphics drivers. I don\u0027t know the difference between these versions, but if Intel has stopped supporting Ubuntu 14.04 then I assume there\u0027s probably a reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts? This is a new computer, so if I\u0027m going to try wiping my OS and switching to another it seems now would be the time. I\u0027d like to know if you, or anyone else, thinks there\u0027s any possibility that a different Ubuntu version and the latest Intel graphics drivers are likely to fix my KSP problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the most relevant-looking information from my HardInfo system report (let me know if I missed anything important):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessor: 4x Intel\u00AE Core i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpenGL Renderer: Mesa DRI Intel\u00AE Iris 6100 (Broadwell GT3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpenGL Version: 3.0 Mesa 10.5.9 (Direct Rendering: Yes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOS Kernel: Linux 3.19.0-28-generic (x86_64)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe terminal command \u0022lshw -c video\u0022 outputs \u0022configuration: driver=i915\u0022 along with some of the same information given by HardInfo.

From my limited knowledge it seems like outdated Intel graphics drivers are the most likely culprit, though I haven\u0027t seen any assurance that new drivers on a new version of Ubuntu would fix this particular bug. Unless someone can think of a different fix, a new OS might be my only recourse. Is there another potential fix I\u0027ve overlooked? And if not, does anyone know which version of Ubuntu (14.10 or 15.04) is more likely to run KSP properly?

I dunno how you noticed such a slight detail, but you nailed it. I wonder if there\u0027s a way to trick the game into staying in the close-up orbit path drawing mode even at large zoom distances? It seems like that would be a perfect fix, but figuring out how to implement that change is well beyond my ability. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable could take a crack at it? What would be really ideal is if the developers simply omitted the faraway draw mode from future Linux versions of KSP altogether. IMO the difference between rendering orbit paths in front of bodies versus behind them is a trivial one in terms of gameplay, and eliminating that transition seems like it would prevent this problem from ever happening again on every possible combination of drivers and hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Onieronaut","CreatedById":151188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T06:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a major discovery: my computer is running KSP in 32-bit rather than 64-bit mode.

To test this I disabled my 32-bit KSP executable by renaming it to disabled-KSP.x86 while leaving KSP.x86_64 as it should be, just to be certain that Steam couldn\u0027t trick me by launching KSP in 32-bit mode when I asked it to launch in 64-bit mode. I\u0027m glad I thought of that, because sure enough it turns out that when I use the launch option input \u0022%command%_64\u0022 and try to open the game through Steam, it gives me a missing executable error. Either that input is incorrect or Steam is just ignoring the input completely. I suspect the latter, in which case when I launch through Steam it most likely is not applying Sal_Vager\u0027s suggested GL optimization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixing the directory path in my homemade KSP.sh executable did in fact make it work (thanks again), but I\u0027m still having the same problem with disappearing orbit paths. I assume that unlike Steam, this method actually does apply the suggested GL optimization. This would imply that whatever is causing my orbit paths to disappear, this GL optimization does not fix it. (It didn\u0027t fix my fairing flicker, either. Oh and I\u0027ve also tried playing both with and without anti-aliasing enabled, it doesn\u0027t have any effect on these bugs.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn another PM, Eleven pointed out to me that I can run KSP in 64-bit mode simply by double-clicking Launcher.x86_64 in my Kerbal Space Program folder. That works, and it seems pretty foolproof, so I\u0027m just going to launch the game that way for the time being (since the executable script isn\u0027t having any noticeable effect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe whole UI including the orbit rendering is replaced in 1.1 so we\u0027ll have to see if that fixes it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI sure hope the new UI system fixes this.
