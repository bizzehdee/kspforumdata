The game is not frozen because the splash text still changes as well as the loading screens. My pc isn\u0027t weak either and I downloaded the game about a week ago and have never had mods. My PC is also under pretty heavy strain while this is happening, 40% CPU usage and 80% GPU usage. My PC is no slouch either, Ryzen 7 5800x, 32 gigs 4000mhz RAM, RTX 3060 12 gigs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-16T01:28:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2022 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Epsilon_Operative\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding extra info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-16T22:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like an exception in the loading process is causing the game to stop loading, however the loading screens and tips are separate to that so they\u0027ll just keep on going even when the game will never load.
