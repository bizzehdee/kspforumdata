So i decided to make the transfer, They sent me my steam key and i copied multiple times into steam and it didnt work. So being the idiot i was, i didnt save the key. I emailed Kerbal, they never got back to me. So i bacically said screw it, ill just stick with .18.1. But now that they\u0027ve updated it a ton, i was hoping it would somehow be possible to get a new steam key or have the same one re sent to me to see if it will work. It just sucks that i can\u0027t get the game i paid for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
