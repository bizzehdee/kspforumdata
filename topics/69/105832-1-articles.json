Notice the 0.02 drain and 31.1m/s velocity. [http://i.imgur.com/nN7Wzvl.png](http://i.imgur.com/nN7Wzvl.png)\n\nSecond, my parachute has been heating up despite being angled directly against prograde.\n\nThird, the natural resting position without SAS, during reentry, is about 45 degrees off of retrograde, tilted counter-clockwise (when facing the hatch).\n\nAre these intended behaviors? Is anybody else experiencing these?"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:45:48Z","Content":"The ablator being depleted at slow speeds is intended because ablation is set to happen according to the temperature of the heat shield, not the velocity. It will keep ablating until it cools down.\n\nWe\u0027d need more information to diagnose the other two issues - crafts, screenshots, reproduction steps, etc."}]}
