I started this career save in 1.0.2, but I didn\u0027t have this problem until a few days ago after 1.0.4. I\u0027m playing career mode on a custom hard mode setting, which means things are going quite slow. I am running mods, but I have re-produced this in stock KSP without mods.\n\nI finally managed to orbit the Mun for the first time in this career. After the burn to intercept the Mun, I set myself up to have a 25k Pe when I arrived. After crossing the Mun\u0027s SOI my Pe jumped to 50k. I made a correction burn to bring it back down to 25k, then circularized at 25k x 25k. I EVA\u0027d my scientist to grab the experiments I collected in high space and reset them to collect low orbit and gathering low orbit biome science.\n\nThis mission completed 3 contracts, so before I left the Mun I switched back to the Space Center to check and see if any new contracts were available that I could complete with this ship. I was in the Sun and the batteries were full when I left, but when I switched back it was out of power and was all of the sudden in a 48k x 30k orbit and both the Ap and Pe were dropping at a pretty fast rate. I was on the opposite side of the Mun for the exit burn, and only had just enough fuel to make the return burn. The orbit dropped down to 32k x 26k while waiting to be in position for the return burn.\n\nToday accepted some new contracts, one of which was to gather science from space around Kerbin. I already had satellites in orbit from previous contracts, so I could easily knock that one out. I switched to an existing satellite to transmit science and it was out of electricity, but it was in the sun and immediately began charging up. It was in a stable 500K x 400K polar orbit and fully charged when I left it, but its orbit began dropping just like the ship in orbit around the Mun.\n\nI decided to install a fresh KSP and start a new sandbox game to see if it was mod related or my save, but it is still happening. I installed one mod, HyperEdit, so I could quickly throw a ship into an orbit. I loaded the stock vessel Orbiter 1A and placed it in a 30K circular orbit around the Mun. After almost an hour, its orbit has dropped to 29.1K x 28.7K, and is still dropping."},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T07:52:35Z","Content":"Only thing I can suggest is that you install RCS units and then activate them to help maintain your orbit. (Mechjeb does that for you, I believe.)\n\nI once had a space station that i tried to dock with, using mechjeb, and i watched do multiple attempts, failing, backing off and trying again...\n\nIt was then that I noticed the station was dropping out of orbit, it started at 100K ... and dropped to below 98K before I noticed. I got my kerbals into a pod and escaped but that took time, by the time I was able to try and save the station, it was already too late. That was in a version before version 1.0 ... to this day, I don\u0027t know why it did that. It started off in a stable enough orbit. \n\nI suppose these things just happen, its never happened since, so maybe your \u0022bug\u0022 isn\u0027t really a bug.\n\nEDIT: Have you considered that while the Mun has no atmosphere, it still has gravity? Maybe that is your problem. 30K might be a tad low.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T07:55:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kiwi1960**"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T08:46:36Z","Content":"I know there is voodoo that you can do with phantom forces and part clipping...

The stock craft does have clipped parts, so I threw a Stayputnik core in the same 30k x 30k orbit and left it running for an hour. To rule out any torque forces I disabled the reaction wheels and drained the battery in the VAB before HyperEditing it in orbit. This time the Ap began rising and the Pe lowering, but after an hour the Ap and Pe were ~100m lower than where it started out.\n\nI just remembered while typing this that I may have 1.0.2 on a backup drive. I\u0027ll check that out later and see if it happened in 1.0.2, but I\u0027m pretty sure it didn\u0027t because I would have noticed it when fulfilling satellite contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"NJC2","CreatedById":83404,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:46:07Z","Content":"I did still have 1.0.2 on my backup drive and repeated the experiment.
