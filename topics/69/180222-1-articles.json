If you got the game on steam, try to verify the data integrity (steam should recognize at least one missing file and download it again), otherwise go for a clean reinstall.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is a small chance that steam will not notify you about any missing files and pretent as if anything is fine. In this case, go to \u0027KSP_install_directory/GameData/Squad/Localization\u0027. The folder is supposed to contain a single file called \u0027dictionary.cfg\u0027....delete it and verify the data integrity again.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious though: Do you play on linux, windows or mac? I know a few reports about localization issues but for myself, it only happend once when I tried to install the game on linux.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
