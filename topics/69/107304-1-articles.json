Switching in and out of map view did not.\n\nThe second issue is that apparently command modules don\u0027t cast shadows:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![lighting2.png](http://www.nmichaels.org/files/lighting2.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nNote that if Bob backs up there, he\u0027ll illuminate the capsule, but it still won\u0027t cast a shadow.\n\nIn case this is a driver issue or just me, here are some details:\n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107 [GeForce GTX 650] (rev a1)\n\n$ uname -a\n\nLinux stalactite 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt7-1 (2015-03-01) x86\\_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI am running the 64-bit build of 1.0.2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T22:28:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by saskwach**"}]}
