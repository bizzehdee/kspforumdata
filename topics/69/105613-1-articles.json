Its basic function is to limit the amount of time that can pass before the game forces the video card to draw a new frame (if it hasn\u0027t already, of course), sometimes waiting for it to catch up, if need be. I\u0027d suggest trying it on lowest setting and then highest setting, and seeing which is more like the gameplay you want, and then fiddling with it a little more to see if you can find a sweet spot."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:20:48Z","Content":"I had Max Physics Delta all the way to the right (0.03). \n\nNow i have it all the way to the left (0.12) and the ingame clock stays green, but the stutter and audio glitch is still there and seems more severe."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T06:23:53Z","Content":"To be clear, neither is the gameplay that i want and i can\u0027t find a sweet spot where it is better."},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T06:46:38Z","Content":"Is this a steam or standalone version of KSP?\n\nAlso can you please use Process Explorer ([https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx)) to monitor CPU, Memory and GPU usage during your gameplay. \n\nSome time ago I help a guy which was expiriencing similar problems but with different game. \n\nIn that case the cause was the fact that for some reason games textures were saved into GPU Shared Memory (part of system ram that was made available for graphics card in order to extend its memory capabilities) instead into dedicated GPU Memory (the actual physical memory of the graphics card). This was then causing the slowdowns due the fact that graphics card Access to shared GPU memory is much slower that Access to Dedicated GPU Memory due the fact that when graphics card is accessing the Shared GPU Memory the data must go through two controllers (RAM controller and PCI Express controller).\n\nAlso Process Explorer could give you nice idea of your computer utilization so you can quickly see what might be causing the slowdowns in your games (CPU, GPU, memory controller - I/O handle, high HDD utilization, etc.). \n\nI use this all the time to keep my computer running at peak eficienty by indetifying the programs that might be using most of my system resources so that I can then go and search for their alternatives when possible."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:04:27Z","Content":"It is standalone, though i do have steam running. \n\nThere are a million options in that tool.
