Since installing .90 (fresh download/unzip, not an update), if I accidentally swipe (wanting to move the cursor) too close to the right edge of my touchpad the sidebar comes up and minimizes KSP. Fortunately, this rarely happens during critical times like when about to land. The game is still running and I can bring it back up and continue playing, but it gets annoying when it starts happening often. Of course, this also happens in windowed mode and KSP doesn\u0027t minimize then, but I don\u0027t like windowed mode (can\u0027t see the edges of the window).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens in my usual lightly modded install.
