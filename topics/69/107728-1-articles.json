Extending/retracting works fine, but the toggle function is undone by loading/launching a craft or leaving the SPH/VAB. It appears on all crafts i tried and in both SPH and VAB.\n\nKPS version 1.02.842 at windows 32 bit using steam, all stock\n\nSteps to Replicate (at least for me):\n\n1) enter SPH or VAB\n\n2) attach an A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E. to any craft\n\n3) edit the toggle function in the actiongroupes (remove it from brakes and/or add it somewhere)\n\n4) save the craft and load it\n\n5) toggle function will be only at the brakes again\n\nedit: WRONG TAG, sorry ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nGoogle told me there was a similar threat already, but it was removed or something and I haven\u0027t found any threat with the same problem so I hope this bug isn\u0027t known already\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T19:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:40:38Z","Content":"So what\u0027s the workaround?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hosch","CreatedById":137329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T05:50:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So what\u0027s the workaround?\n\nProbably a missclick by me"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:31:37Z","Content":"Yeah toggle is not working, but both the open and close actions do work."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:37:49Z","Content":"Retagged as bug."},{"CreatedByName":"m1k3ol","CreatedById":76028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T05:23:49Z","Content":"same for me\n\nI don\u0027t even have to reload a craft, if I take them off from the break action group, they just stay there when I press \u0022launch\u0022, even if I remove them from every group, they still get deployed when using \u0022B\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:29:26Z","Content":"If you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons, there\u0027s a fix for it here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-0-25-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-0-25-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"m1k3ol","CreatedById":76028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T04:39:38Z","Content":"not opposed, and yeah, aware of your great thread...\n\njust filling in on the bug as \u0022replicated\u0022 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n(and that recent updates haven\u0027t got to this yet)"}]}
