Once the game gets past the hang, everything works perfectly, and the hang doesn\u0027t occur again unless you exit KSP and restart it. The hang also doesn\u0027t recur if you return to the main menu from inside the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP version 1.0.5.1028, no mods. The problem started occurring two or three months ago; I had not made any patches or hardware changes to the computer around that time. The problem happens every time I start KSP, even if no other programs are open at the same time. However I do seem to have a minor glitch with one other Steam game (a menu hiccup, curiously), and an occasional window-resizing glitch with a couple of online flash games that use Unity (is flash-game Unity the same Unity used by KSP?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, off the cuff it looks like it might be a bug in Unity, but I wanted to get the official word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
