FTP transfers have offered this feature for decades, for example. But more relevant to you would probably be a download manager, like you said. Nowadays they\u0027ve fallen out of popular use, but for those users with a slow and unstable connection, like you, they still offer download resuming for HTTP transfers, and they still work all the same as they did in the days of dial-up. I recommend you try it, as you may find it a great relief even for other things besides KSP. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/the-best-free-download-manager-1328199\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean overview of potential options\u003C/a\u003E.
