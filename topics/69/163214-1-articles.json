Then, I watched a video on it and I saw how much fun it was, so I decided to give it a go. I entered the launcher, and it wanted me to log into the ksp store. Unfortunately, since it\u0027s been a few years, no one remembered the email or password that was used to log in. I was hoping a mod or someone could help me with this, because I really want to give this game a go. Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRagingIrishman","CreatedById":165004,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T02:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179760-ijbindustries/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022179760\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179760-ijbindustries/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ijbindustries\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0email \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u00222a595f5a5a45585e6a414f58484b46595a4b494f5a58454d584b4704494547\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E or look at the support section on the website\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
