In the VAB on my Dell Inspiron 15, I attach the parachute (any, although it is worse with radial ones) and the framerate drops to 6-8 fps. I launch, on launchpad it is fine, and when I load the craft in the VAB with parachutes there is no lag as long as I keep the same parachutes. If I add new ones however it lags down again. I tried lowering settings, using 32bit player instead of 64bit, but nothing helps. I don\u0027t have any mods. This is not Steam, it is the KSP Store. Help please?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T17:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a bug when selecting a fresh parachute.
