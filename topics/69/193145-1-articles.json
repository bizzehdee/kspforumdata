So, recently most of my creations that have a rotor will do as follows: Get put onto the air strip, then the rotor will come to life (I removed all controllers from the ship) and spin so fast it breaks most of its propellers off. I have no clue why its doing this, but it clearly appears to be some sort of bug. Has anyone else encountered this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
