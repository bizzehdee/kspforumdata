So I built this \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i6SFHvD2Kp9Vlw2LXsBEZG0VlWtaBJ9xaQcSGaRY5cvbvMTIqCbrIJRxxyjcV39LMastdg=s142\u0022 alt=\u0022i6SFHvD2Kp9Vlw2LXsBEZG0VlWtaBJ9xaQcSGaRY5cvbvMTIqCbrIJRxxyjcV39LMastdg=s142\u0022\u003E \u00A0and hacked it into a low jool orbit. Then I gave it unbreakable joints, unbreakable parts and ignore max temperature.\u00A0I then did a retrograde burn and\u00A0started falling towards the surface.\u00A0I turned off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E and let it fall. It was taking a while so I turned physics warp to 4x and waited. Suddenly it spazzed out and I was flying around in empty space. The navball was going crazy. The speed was fluctuating like crazy and was is the quintillions or something and the altitude was spazzing out as well and had the letter P next to it. It did this for a while then it all stopped, the altitude said 0 and the speed said nan.\u00A0I reverted the flight and when I\u00A0was\u00A0on the launchpad again the terrain was\u00A0this spiky wavelike pattern and it\u00A0covered all of\u00A0kerbin. I tried it several times and it happened every time. sometimes all of kerbin was that spiky wavelike pattern, sometimes none of it and sometimes only the water. please help. it crashed once but I don\u0027t know how to copy files into here without copying all the text.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-23T04:36:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2016 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by rockets-don\u0026#039;t-make-toast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eproblem with picture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T21:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollow the support instructions for how to make your log files available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firemetal","CreatedById":164725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-27T02:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a Kraken Attack.

It\u0027s what I would expect to happen, dropping an indestructible ship into Jool, at 4x physics warp no less. Jool\u0027s core is supposed to destroy any parts that get that far down, presumably from the extreme pressure. With unbreakable parts, and the physics errors inherent with 4x time warp... well, let\u0027s just say it\u0027s no surprise the Kraken reared its ugly head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and the answer is no, you can\u0027t penetrate Jool\u0027s surface. It doesn\u0027t have a surface in the proper sense, what with being a gas giant and all. There is an altitude zero, but all it marks is the altitude 250 m above the altitude of certain death. The used to be a surface, back before v0.23, but that was years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
