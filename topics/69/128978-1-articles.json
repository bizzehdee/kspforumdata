Then I launched the first part of the station into Mun orbit. When I had the station in position in the contract overview at the top right the tick for new station was green. After docking the second part to it with some more fuel I did not check this. After docking the third part with even more fuel (4000 units is required)\u00A0the tick was not set anymore (the second and third part were launched after the first part obviously). I had to load a quicksave while docking the second part to the station if this might have something to do with it. Since then I can\u0027t finish the contract (I actually tried with a small craft having enough fuel to fulfill the requirements, an antenna and solar panels. That craft fulfilled the contract requirements again until it docked to the station).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m absolutely not sure whether I did something wrong or if I encountered a (rare?) bug. I also looked through the save file and checked launchId values after reading somewhere that this is how the novelty of a station is determined. The contract has a launchId value of 30, and the lowest launchId value of any part of my station is also 30, so this shouldn\u0027t be the problem. To verify I made a copy of the save, changed the launchId in the contract to 29 and loaded that. I then went to the tracking station and jumped to my station. The tick was still not there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept to disassembling the whole thing and replacing one or more parts of the station which is financially unattractive I am out of ideas. Can someone please tell me what is wrong with this station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe save file can be found here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2mj978vhh8mje7/broken-space-station.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/k2mj978vhh8mje7/broken-space-station.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T11:47:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222343507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128978\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451578681\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156223\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022liwo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/31/2015 at 3:18 AM, liwo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone please tell me what is wrong with this station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can!
