At the tutorials (Flight Basics tutorial), when going for orbit i had my Pe at 102km and while within the atmosphere i place a maneuver node to create an orbit. After that i pressed the button warp to maneuver node and the game kicked in to physics warp. Once outside the atmosphere when i tried to warp to 1x speed the game refused to do it, also i had a message that the game could not time warp while on a scenario, and was locked at 3x physics warp.\n\n2. I run the scenario EVA in Kerbin orbit, rescued jeb and landed the pod back to Kerbin. Then i recovered the pod and went to the VAB. I placed some of the command pods and the lab. I hired some Kerbals from the astronauts tab (while at the VAB), placed them at the pods and pressed launch. All the buttons froze. i could rotate the camera but no buttons could be pressed"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarapple","CreatedById":137606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:40:34Z","Content":"Have a bump because bug 2 just happened to me."}]}
