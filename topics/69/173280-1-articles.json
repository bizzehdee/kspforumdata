I started a new career game (normal difficulty); started off with 25,000 funds.\u00A0I then built the basic starter craft: Mark I Command Pod \u002B RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B Mk16 Parachute (1,222 funds). After launching the vessel, I had 23,778 funds (which is correct). Jeb launched the craft up to ~14 km and then safely landed. I recovered the vessel for 1,138 funds (which is expected). However, after the flight, instead of having 23,862 funds I had 85,716 funds which is not correct. This is a brand new install, brand new game, no mods, and somehow \u0022extra funds\u0022 are getting added every time I recover a vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I launch a vessel and immediately recover it no \u0022extra\u0022 funds\u0022 get added. Also, every launch a different amount of \u0022extra funds\u0022 are added. So the amount is not consistent; only that \u0022extra funds\u0022 are added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tried a game with 300% \u0022fund awards\u0022 multiplier. The \u0022extra funds\u0022 bug was still present and also seemed to be multiplied by 300%. After recovering the vessel (first flight) ~220,000 \u0022extra funds\u0022 were added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also started a few new games and the \u0022extra funds\u0022 bug was present in all cases (demonstrating it happens in all cases and not random)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone else experiencing this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
