Thanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo cents here, I think that 0.90 has a royal problem with Persistent file update on certain events, 32bit or 64bit, the same problem. I can get into the mission control contract center but if I try to exit, the game locks up, this happens after a normal game exit game. I\u0027m on my 6th carreer mode start, I can get to tier three (15-20 sci) technology but thats about it. Hard mode normal mode, doesn\u0027t matter. The upgrade preceding failure is the \u0027rocketry\u0027 branch and all the part in mine are stock, so its not being caused by modded parts. Also on my latest save after leveling up 20 sci rocketry i could not go into the VAB; the bug is not consistent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say make sure all your Add-ons are updated. Although I did this and it did not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure all your game saves are normal exits. Again did not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake a copy of the game data folder and remove all Addon directories. Going to try this next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal seems to have forced some into 64 bit, so make sure you are running the 32 bit you installed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.90.0 has alot of problems, i\u0027ve experienced various bugs and I see alot of bug reports here with no responses other than the spurious reply of a person with a similar problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you right click on the structure it gives you the option to upgrade, if you have the $Ker$ then you can upgrade the structure, I\u0027ve only made it so far as to upgrade one structure before my game locks up so . . . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T00:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d guess you\u0027re seeing the bug whereby any kerbals rescued from a contract and then subsequently removed from the roster (usually by firing them from the Astronaut Complex) will make a mess of your save.
