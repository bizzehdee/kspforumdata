The screen was locked and left some HUD displays up while others are gone. I forget if I reloaded or had to force exit, but regardless I attempted again and got around the issue by using the grabber on the inner module/lander to grab the upper part of the cargo bay, and not use the other grabber at all. Odd because I had used the grabber on the large ship before in its same position to grab a stranded command pod for a mission with no issue.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl0xd7jjwj026yb/2015-06-24_00001.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl0xd7jjwj026yb/2015-06-24_00001.jpg?dl=0)\n\nAferwards, I decided to use my space plane to transfer astronauts between the ground and who was on the station (docked with the two other ships as seen in other picture). Everything was going well till i hit 80km, when i was told I couldn\u0027t not time accelerate under acceleration, when I had engines off.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ynql10g8q427fr7/2015-06-24_00005.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ynql10g8q427fr7/2015-06-24_00005.jpg?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s1m2lhckrnngs8a/2015-06-24_00006.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s1m2lhckrnngs8a/2015-06-24_00006.jpg?dl=0)\n\nMy vessel responded very oddly in this glitch. Even if engines were on and using fuel, the craft did not register any movement or change in Delta V. Ailerons would move and reaction wheels would be running, but no movement whatsoever. (Tho correct me if im wrong but I believe the solar system and its objects move around you and not the other way around. so everything was at a stand still?)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/iru44zgmq2bjc49/2015-06-24_00007.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iru44zgmq2bjc49/2015-06-24_00007.jpg?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehxlgu732d6r4ao/2015-06-24_00008.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehxlgu732d6r4ao/2015-06-24_00008.jpg?dl=0)\n\nOh yea and then my ship exploded killing the crew cabin members.

(Note: everything I report only started happening in 1.0.3/1.0.4)\n\nRadially attached devices like solar panels or antennae now sometimes give an \u0022cannot activate while stowed\u0022 error if you have a cargo or service bay anywhere else on your ship. If you have two or more that are symmetrically attached it\u0027s usually only one that gives the error.\n\nThe game sometimes doesn\u0027t let me warp, instead giving me the \u0022cannot warp while under acceleration\u0022 message. Happens at 0% thrust and even when engines are off.\n\nAntennas sometimes get stuck while sending science (won\u0027t fold up again). Stopping transmission won\u0027t work (still stuck) and once you go to the space center and back the antenna gets unstuck but the transmitted science is lost.\n\nI now regulalrly manage to break stuff just by rotating my craft in space I for example had two Gigantor solar panels snap clean off by rotating my spacecraft.\n\nOnce when I tried to send some science back my whole service bay and all batteries exploded.\n\nStuff still sometimes randomly explodes. Temp is nominal for all of the flight then suddenly overheat markers appear on all parts of the craft and it explodes.Temperature overlay (F11) shows nothing unusual. Takes just two or three seconds from everything is fine and dandy to stuff goes boom.\n\nThere seems to be a glitch in reentry heating calculations. If you come in hot you\u0027ll sometimes explode the instant you hit the atmosphere (e.g. counter switches from 70,000 to 69,999 on Kerbin re-entry and boom). Doesn\u0027t matter how long you are in the atmosphere either, I had this happen once with an periapsis of about 69,600 meters over Kerbin (I was going 7 km/s but still hitting the atmosphere for less than 2 s should be survivable at that speed and atmospheric density). Game doesn\u0027t even have the time to show overheat markers as it only takes an \u0027instant\u0027 (less than one second) to happen.\n\nThere are all kinds of weird phantom forces that hit your craft once physics winds up (VAB or SPH to launch, tracking station to craft) or the physics context switches (e.g. from orbit to atmosphere). Switching from tracking station to a craft will make it \u0022yank\u0022 around. Sometimes the force exerted is high enough to significantly change your orbit or to break stuff. I have a landed craft where the solar panels will fall of if I switch to it, just from the force the physics model exerts on it during \u0022wind-up\u0022. I several times had a force that was so high and sudden that after \u0022revert to launch\u0022 my whole craft including the launch clamps yanked sideways and ended up at an angle of 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Once a craft even broke apart while in orbital transit when I switched to it from the tracking station.\n\nRight now the game is unplayable for me because I don\u0027t know what random physics glitch will kill my craft next. I don\u0027t even dare to switch to my orbital station because every time random stuff blows up or breaks off. 1.0.2 was fine by comparison.\n\nI haven\u0027t built a new craft yet (only worked with ships created in 1.0.2) but it seems that all of the crafts built before 1.0.3 are borked. Somehow the game seems to be confused about which parts are attached to which other parts and then screws up the physics calculations. This seems to affect the new convection, conduction and shock heating models the most but all physics calculations are affected.\n\nWhat seems to be the case is that most physics issues seem to come from \u0027instant\u0027 changes in force or flux vectors. THis looks to me like a calculation or rounding error in the models (value approaches \u0027infinity\u0027).\n\nSquad really shouldn\u0027t have shipped such a huge change on a \u0027dot\u0027 update."},{"CreatedByName":"Vaulter","CreatedById":135465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:21:14Z","Content":"Same things for me:\n\nRandom vessel explosions and ghost accelerations (\u0022cannot warp while under acceleration\u0022) observed quite stable.\n\nSadly, not playable anymore :/"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T19:54:11Z","Content":"I feel you guys.

Tested on a clean KSP 1.0.4 (build 861). In my tests, I could \u0022fly\u0022 that Space Station (SS2), timewarp and return to normal time without adverse effects, but only when SS2 is the first object flown in game. Going back to it, even if only through the Space Center, makes the station to start a spontaneous disassembly if timewarping. That is certainly in relation with the NullReferenceException (shown in your output\\_log, but also in mine) \n\n\u0022...\n\nat (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Transform:INTERNAL\\_CALL\\_TransformDirection (UnityEngine.Transform,UnityEngine.Vector3\u0026) \n\n...\n\nat Vessel.GoOnRails () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0\u003C/filename\u003E\n\n...\u0022\n\nwhich means when that station is being packed for timewarp, the parts coordinates have to be frozen but something is missing that is needed to get the correct orientation on one or more of those parts. \n\nWhat I see is the station begins to disassemble with parts freely floating away, as if they lost the attachment relation with their parent part.\n\nNow, checking the output\\_log, can see before a disassembly, there is another specific NullReferenceException when going from the SS2 to the Space Center:\n\n\u0022at (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Transform:INTERNAL\\_CALL\\_InverseTransfo rmDirection (UnityEngine.Transform,UnityEngine.Vector3\u0026)\n\n...\n\nat Part.OnDestroy () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0\u0022\u003C/filename\u003E\n\nOk, that tells nothing of what part is it about, but sure a part was destroyed and its joints terminated when the SS2 was left. Why that happens is not clear, however I have one observation here: if I wait long enough to let everything to settle (so that accelerations among parts due to the physics with off-rails vessels are very small) I can successfully get back to the SS2, timewarp and back without problems. The issue arises when I don\u0027t wait and the physics still fight to position those parts.\n\nBelieve that may suggest you what to do (wait longer, let the station physics settle before making it on-rails again). The cause may be from the very thin connections (just a docking port in most cases) and the size of that station, that means even minimal errors in alignment of the parts may bring to forces greater then required to break the joints."},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T08:09:57Z","Content":"What a very knowledgeable and helpful response diomedea, I can tell you know your .....
