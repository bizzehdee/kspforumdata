I also noticed that my tech tree had gone too. \n\nI have done 3 fresh installs, computer resets and I also tried validating the cache through steam which I had no clue how to do. \n\nIf anyone can help me with this I would be very grateful!

To do this, open a Terminal, change the directory to where the KSP\\_osx is and type: \u0022sudo chmod -R 777 KSP\\_osx\u0022 (without the quotes). For more information on OSX permissions and how to do this graphically, [please see here](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/415).\n\u003E \n\u003E Saved state issues\n\u003E \n\u003E OSX saves the state of programs it runs. Sometimes these files are corrupted and need to be deleted for a program to run properly again. Click[this link](http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/17/delete-specific-application-saved-states-from-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-resume/) to learn how to find the saved states; the one you need to delete is the unity.Squad.Kerbal Space Program.savedState folder.\n\nPlease give those a go, then try looking in the VAB again, let me know what happens and upload the new player.log from that attempt."},{"CreatedByName":"TrivialTurtle","CreatedById":148194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:42:06Z","Content":"Ok so, I haven\u0027t done what you quoted from the sticky but I went back onto KSP and went to the career and clicked on the VAB and tech tree etc and updated my [player.log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pgn5h2usdfl4q2x/Player.log?dl=0) hopefully this helps?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:45:00Z","Content":"Please fix your permissions and clear the saved state for KSP, then try again."}]}
