I hope that well I am trying to install the last update patch specifically the KSPx64-Patch-1.7.X-To-1.7.3 that I downloaded from the official store of course. What happens is that when I try to install it, I jump in the installation window that locates the folder that contains the game, I have the game located in \u0022c: / KerbalSpaceProgram, that is, the original game is installed by default; the question as I said it skips that I can\u0027t find the right folder, so I have to install it where the game is, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing but it doesn\u0027t let me do it, as it doesn\u0027t recognize the folder where the original game is. I opted for the easiest solution but not the fastest to download version 1.7.3 and install everything again. Is there a solution for this not to happen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
