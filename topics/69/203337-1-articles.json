In career mode, custom action groups are supposed to be unlocked at level 3 of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, where level 2 only unlocks the standard actions. However, at level 2, as soon as you select any part with the action group editor open, the custom action groups are added to the list and you can use them anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
