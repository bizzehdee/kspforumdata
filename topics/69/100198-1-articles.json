That\u0027s pretty unusual around here (not that it\u0027s helped you any). Although I do thank you for actually posting logs. My first thought is that it looks like you are running out of memory.\n\n    Error occurred at 2015-02-20_053828.D:\\Games\\KSP_win\\KSP.exe, run by Robert.[COLOR=\u0022#B22222\u0022]98% memory in use.3996 MB physical memory [66 MB free].[/COLOR]0 MB paging file [0 MB free].0 MB user address space [2461 MB free].Read from location 00000000 caused an access violation.\n\nKSP uses a lot of memory at times, and it does a huge memory grab right at the Main Menu (when everything is fully starting up, and it pulls textures). A few things you can try... Also, I recommend starting KSP from KSP.exe or a shortcut to KSP.exe.\n\n- Make sure you have all other programs closed, as much as possible anyway, to free up memory.\n\n- Either delete your settings.cfg to reset to default graphics options, or edit settings.cfg and find the TEXTURE\\_QUALITY line. Change it to \u0022TEXTURE\\_QUALITY = 1\u0022 (or even 2 or 3).\n\n- Make a shortcut to KSP.exe, and add the -force-open-gl (this may reduce memory requirements, but at the risk of corrupted graphics)\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure if you are using any mods. If you are, you might want to remove them and get the game running first. Then add them back a few at a time and keep an eye on your memory.\n\nHopefully that helps, and again, sorry for the zero replies.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
