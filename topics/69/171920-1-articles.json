I downloaded the newest version, and I started playing on the science mode. The problem that I noticed was a mysterious wobbling that started happening for my rockets. I thought it wasn\u0027t that bad, but when I got the first landing wheels, I kept on having my spacecraft explode constantly. It would either be so unstable that it would not be able to take off, or parts of it would just suddenly blow up. I believe that I am using the 32 bit version, as it does not give me a choice, and I am using ubuntu with 3.6\u00A0Gib. I tried a new install on the same computer, but it still had this problem. it happened even with a basic vehicle made using just 3 FL-T400 fuel tanks, the terrier engine, the Mk 1 command pod, and the LY-01 fixed landing gear. I have no Idea what the problem is, and I hope that other people can figure out a solution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
