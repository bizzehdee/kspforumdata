See if the lines work, though KSP may be too slow to play that way, if that does work there may be a newer (or older) version of the current driver you can try.\n\nFailing that, you might want to give VMware fusion a go as it\u0027ll use different drivers to communicate with the host graphics card, or try a dual boot instead.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T16:04:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"Willbl3pic","CreatedById":12468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T16:33:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nI\u0027m not in a VM."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:04:15Z","Content":"That changes a few things, though it\u0027s still worth testing the open driver by uninstalling the proprietary driver and rbooting, and also trying the updated [**AMD driver**](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Ubuntu\u002Bx86\u002B64) which is up to 15.7 now and is available as a .deb, so can easily be installed using Ubuntu software centre or my preference, GDebi, which can be found in the repos.\n\nAlso, if you have changed any of the default Catalyst settings such as anti-aliasing or forcing mipmaps, try disabling them."},{"CreatedByName":"Willbl3pic","CreatedById":12468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:25:44Z","Content":"When fiddling with Catalyst settings, I decided to update Catalyst completely.
