When I got all of them on board, I time warped to a transfer window back to Kerbin, but after the time warp I couldn\u0027t save my game anymore. I loaded the last quick save I made and time warped again, but after that time warp I still couldn\u0027t save the game. I then just went back to Kerbin and landed successfully, but I couldn\u0027t recover the vessel. I tried to EVA the Kerbals and recover them, but it still didn\u0027t work. Going to the Space Center, saving the game, going to the Tracking Station and exit to main menu, all don\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then just closed the game via task manager and opened it again, but then it started at the last quick save I made, so back in an orbit around Duna. I then just tried again, trying to figure out the moment from which I can\u0027t save the game anymore. And it seems to be after a long or fast time warp. If I use the 100.000x time warp, it immediately doesn\u0027t work anymore, if I use the 10.000x time warp it works for a few seconds, but after a while I get the same problem again. So the problem seems to arise after/while a time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen other people have also experienced this problem, but almost all of them after docking, but I didn\u0027t dock anything in this flight. I transferred the Kerbals from craft to craft with there EVA pack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs\u00A0far as I know I haven\u0027t clipped any parts and I don\u0027t have any mods.

I tried to create a save and then reload it, but while it calls itself \u0022quicksave #1\u0022 that doesn\u0027t show up at all when I go to load a save. I also tried renaming it but with the same results. I had done some warping, but I\u0027ve warped with other vehicles without a problem. When I loaded \u0022persistent\u0022, it recovered the capsule with one Kerbal in it and the other two Kerbals were still in the lander, orbiting Minmus. They had the \u2206 V to return to Kerbin and luckily as I had done this once already losing all my science (and two Kerbins I had to return to \u0022Active\u0022 mode) I had put parachutes on it. I recovered them then and got all my science ... but this does\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:inherit;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Efix the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n**[EDIT]** Did 2 sub-orbital flights (one with transferring crew to the lander and back) no problem. Did another Minmus flight w/landing, on re-docking I could not go to the space center or tracking station. I could however revert the flight.

Docked, transferred crew, couldn\u0027t save or go to space/tracking centers.
