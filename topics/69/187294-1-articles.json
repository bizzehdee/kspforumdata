Tough to describe this in just a few words. In career mode; I had progressed very far, earning lots of cash and science and reputation. Sent a Kerbal to the North pole to get some science. After planting a flag, weird graphics started happening. Near the flag a spinning pinwheel appeared; it was bluish-pinkish color, triangular, pointy, pinwheel shaped. I tried to get the Kerbal to grab or touch it, but couldn\u0027t. It just hovered, spinning near the flag. I then panned the camera around to look at the landscape. Looking directly North, not far from the North pole a spinning sphere appeared. It looked like the sphere in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E that shows center of mass, but was bluish color. I watched it for a while. Moments later the game and system crashed, not a blue screen crash or freeze, but it completely and instantly shut down, black screen, machine turned itself off. I rebooted, restarted game but the save I had been in was empty of data, no persistent file, nothing. I lost it all. The saved name file was listed but I couldn\u0027t open it. No quick saves, all gone. Was this a Kraken? I\u0027ve not had any other problems with the game. My system is very robust, new machine, Win 10, with lots of ram and power, no mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
