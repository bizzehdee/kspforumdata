Will any of my other software work? What about device drivers and so on?\n\nI have old ever used Windows, so ignorance concerning cross compatibility is causing me to worry. Anyway thanks in advance for any assistance."},{"CreatedByName":"Acet","CreatedById":123646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:40:05Z","Content":"Start by getting Ubuntu putting it on a flash disk or CD/DVD-R and booting from it to check if it works fine in your machine. Later when you are comfortable you can move that to a fixed partition in one you hard-drives (last I checked Ubuntu made it easy to move like that)\n\nKeep in mind that applications installed in Windows will not run in Ubuntu (there might be crazy ways to make some work under Wine, but that\u0027s usually too much trouble), so you\u0027ll have to install in that OS anything you want to use in Ubuntu, and yes, that means you\u0027ll have to explicitly install the Linux version of KSP in your Ubuntu.\n\nAs for device drivers, Linux has its own device drivers. For any device drivers that don\u0027t come with Ubuntu you will have to search the manufacture\u0027s sites for their Linux device drivers. I believe both Nvidia and AMD have Linux drivers for Graphics Boards based on their GPUs."},{"CreatedByName":"Torih","CreatedById":144304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:45:37Z","Content":"Burn Ubuntu to dvd and boot up from that drive, it will (most of the time) give you an option to install alongside windows. It will partition a drive if needed (make sure you have data backed up!) or select another fresh drive.\n\nGuide here [https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/installation](https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/installation)\n\nAs its a different OS it uses different drivers and software etc. Double check your hardware has Linux drivers.\n\nYou can however run some Windows software with Wine [https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/wine1.4/](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/wine1.4/) not everything works but its pretty good."},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:45:57Z","Content":"I\u0027m not an expert, but I did exactly this a few months ago and am loving it - partitioned dual-boot. There are plenty of how-to-vids and even an installer that is easy to follow and use. That\u0027s how I did it.\n\nAnd yes, you\u0027ll have to download KSP for Linux. As your other software, you\u0027ll have to get the Linux version.\n\nHere\u0027s the forum thread link which can answer your questions:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24529-The-Linux-compatibility-thread!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24529-The-Linux-compatibility-thread!)\n\nEDIT: Ninja\u0027d by more helpful people"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:52:43Z","Content":"Hi Sokar, yes you will need to download the Linux version of KSP, you already have access to both Linux and OSX versions as well as Windows, depending on where you bought KSP you will see the other versions available to download.\n\nLinux distributions usually handle all the drivers for you, with an option to install any proprietary graphics driver either during install or from the software repository for that distro.\n\nMany people will recommend Linux Mint as it is very complete and easy to use, it is based on the same distro that is used to make Ubuntu so KSP should work fine.\n\nThere\u0027s lost of info online on installing Linux, and we\u0027ll be glad to help here as well ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
