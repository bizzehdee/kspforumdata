I extracted the files from the clean download into a separate folder, deleted the old version and opened Launcher, where the Patcher was downloaded. I click on the Patcher to update to the new version, and it tells me: \n\n    D:\\Kerbal Space Program\\Patcher.zipThe archive is either in unknown format or damaged.\n\nI tried restarting the computer, turned off Norton and tried the download again to no avail. Is the Patcher not working? I remember when upgrading to 1.0, the Patcher didn\u0027t work at all, but at least it opened.\n\nSpecs:\n\nWindows 7 x64\n\nNorton Internet Security and AntiVirus\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif):D:D"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:27:00Z","Content":"[**Sorry but the launcher/patcher will not update KSP yet.**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120983-The-launcher-will-not-update-KSP-this-is-a-known-issue-see-here-for-help)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:59:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [**Sorry but the launcher/patcher will not update KSP yet.**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120983-The-launcher-will-not-update-KSP-this-is-a-known-issue-see-here-for-help)\n\n...which is why I once again spent four hours yesterday redownloading the entire game.\n\nThis is not cool; the Patcher/Launcher problem is the sort of thing that deserved an emergency ASAP fix, not to be left unaddressed through four updates.
