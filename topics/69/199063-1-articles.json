I\u0027ve found a temporary solution to this but it ends up not working 10 seconds after. It says I have missing game files and it redownloads them and then proceeds to say I have more missing game files. Stuff wont deploy and IF I can even place something it wont setup. I\u0027ve looked at plenty of tutorials and stuff so I know that I need a satellite and I need to place the control station first. I hope there is a solution to this if not I might just ask for a refund.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-25T08:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you downloading KSP from Steam?
