I don\u0027t know if this is supposed to happen, or if it\u0027s a bug... I mean, I thought that no matter where monoprop was the thrusters would use it unless you turned off fuel flow from that tank. I also thought that they aren\u0027t \u0022activated\u0022 at a time, but always active. Maybe passive is a better description... But, this is just weird.\n\nThis is weird, and to me it doesn\u0027t make that much sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T22:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bill Phil**"}]}
