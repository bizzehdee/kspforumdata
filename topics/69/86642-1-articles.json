Turning down the graphics doesn\u0027t seem to do much. I get about 15fps when i look at Kerbin, just gets worse the more rockets i put on my ships. It\u0027s \u0022playable\u0022, but a better framerate would be nice. So if you have any tips I\u0027d appreciate it!

EA/Dice intentionally limited BF4 on PC, PS4, and XB1 just so they could have PS3 and 360 versions. They also run on medium and low settings in 720p, maybe even lower (been a bit since I looked at the relevant info specific to BF4) where PC\u0027s can run it on high and ultra in 1080p and more. Some PS3 and 360 games, while in 1080i or p on your TV, are rendered internally lower than 720p and upscaled before being outputted to the TV. On a PC, BF4 is rendered, by default, to what resolution you set it to, but it\u0027s adjustable so you can render it with more or less detail depending on PC horespower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, and this is the most important part -- PS3 is a fixed platform with a fixed OS with fixed hardware and fixed specs (other than HDD size). That\u0027s why games for consoles have better optimizations. Knowing all users will have the same hardware means the PS3 developers don\u0027t have to worry about supporting AMD or Nvidia or Intel GPU\u0027s, AMD or Intel CPU\u0027s, 32 or 64 bit, and Windows or Linux or OSX like Squad has to. Would you like it if Squad just dropped Windows and OSX support, heck, 32 bit support altogether, because KSP plays better on 64 bit Linux? It would be much more optimized like the consoles then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to buy stuff every year to be a PC gamer. You don\u0027t even have to spend a lot of money to do so. I could build you a gaming PC for the cost of the Xbox 1 ($500 USD) that\u0027ll play any game up to this year with the highest settings. Just go to Newegg and find a 7850k APU DIY bundle for under $400, then buy an R7 250 GPU to crossfire with it, and you\u0027ll have a sub $500 gaming PC that\u0027ll handle modern games in 1080p. The only time you actually need new hardware if you build a system like that is if you have to play every game on max in 4k resolutions or in 3d or some new technology comes out that you just have to be a part of. Personally, I\u0027m waiting on the Carrizo APU that\u0027ll be released next March or so and build my system around that (provided my PC doesn\u0027t die in the meantime and I go the Fx-8350 or 8370 route). Hopefully they\u0027ll have an 8 core model that\u0027ll work with my R7 260x...a 6 core version specs have been leaked, but no info in the GCN it\u0027s using or what GPU\u0027s it\u0027ll crossfire with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really isn\u0027t much to do in the way of optimizing them other than reducing the amount of crap the OS is running or replacing that with a lightweight Linux setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T06:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could try inhome streaming from your powerfull PC to your chromebook e.g. with steam...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rixram","CreatedById":133632,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T19:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elthy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Elthy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe you could try inhome streaming from your powerfull PC to your chromebook e.g. with steam...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have KSP on my regular computer.
