There are definitely some differences, but some distros (like Linux Mint) have a UI that\u0027s very similar to windows and has a pretty minimal learning curve. The main difference for the average user is that you\u0027ll be primarily getting your software via the software center instead of downloading installers (Linux had an app store long before everyone else)."},{"CreatedByName":"JAD_Interplanetary","CreatedById":134778,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:54:45Z","Content":"I only run Linux at home, and I have KSP installed through Steam.

Install a lightweight OS (I recommend [elementary os](https://elementary.io/docs/installation)), then install KSP. The whole setup could take up a minimum of 7 gigs of storage space (I recommend allocating more) and will only take around 20 seconds to boot. Windows probably takes about that long to shut down. I think that 7 gigs and 40 extra seconds of loading time is a small price to pay for 64-bit ksp.\n\n**Or you could even install linux onto a 16GB\u002B flash drive** and not even bother with partitioning your drive \n\nBrought to you by a full-time linux user and from viewers like you\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T21:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree**"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T21:13:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would consider using Linux, but from what I heard, Windows users *will* have trouble adjusting to it.
