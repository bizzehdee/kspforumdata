Considering that it takes 1/2 hour to start up and only had 2 GB ram, this isnt good. However, when I got my KSP install of 1.4.5 over to the new laptop, the startup is faster, but the game as a whole drops in FPS compared to my old laptop, lots of stuttering. Checking my CPU usage I found that im getting 90\u002B SPU utilization, while RAM is holding steady.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried a fresh install of both 1.4.5 and 1.5 to see whether that would fix it, and it didn\u0027t help. Changing the graphic options didn\u0027t help either. My new laptop has 8 GB ram and no, my original KSP install has only info,functions and autopilot mods - no visuals,planets or parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyonw know why is it being so laggy?
