At 9000m out of fuel. Going down. Deploying the chute. Still gaining speed with predeployed chute. At 4000m it deploys fully but I\u0027m still don\u0027t deccelerate and crash into water at 230 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeed to say that I\u0027ve also reverted to launch a couple of times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshot. Note the altitude and the speed.

But there\u0027s nowhere to place them, unless I add a bunch of girders with chutes on them like apples on a tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I\u0027ve experienced another bug: after splashing into water I EVAd Jeb and made EVA report while on the ladder.
