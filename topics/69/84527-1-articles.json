First I make a ship and everything works fine until I get to the point where I try to make an orbit. When I do this the entire ship locks down I can\u0027t tilt it or boost or go into different stages. All I can do is wait for it to crash to the earth/kerbin. This makes the game unplayable. I am looking for way to fix this. I am it on steam and have tried reinstalling it. If you know how to fix it then please tell me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T21:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi XrainMT,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to guess that you are either running out of battery power or you do not have any torque modules installed.
