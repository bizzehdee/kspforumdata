Occasionally there\u0027s also pixel-noise or random shapes flicker up, but the UI-flicker is the most consistent problem.\n\n**Mods**: All Stock\n\n**Steps to replicate**: Just start playing, the first flickers will appear after 10-15 minutes, after that it gets progressively worse. I\u0027ve included a short video below, that was fairly early in the session because I didn\u0027t want to wait until it becomes unplayable.\n\nIt happens in flight, at KSC, inside the VAB, inside the UI-only buildings like the administration building.\n\nIt **does not** happen in the main menu (at least so far).\n\nGraphics card is GTX765M, so it should easily be able to handle this. I\u0027ve played default settings, minimum settings and the settings recommended by Nvidia full-screen and windowed, no effect. I also updated the graphics driver for this bug, again, the flicker persists.\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds**: Restarting KSP regularly.\n\n**Other Notes**:\n\nVideo of flickering over here \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK8I2szHEPg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n ([https://youtu.be/KK8I2szHEPg](https://youtu.be/KK8I2szHEPg))\nFull system specs: [http://pastebin.com/fKP7KkKs](http://pastebin.com/fKP7KkKs) (I noticed that it lists my internal graphics card.
