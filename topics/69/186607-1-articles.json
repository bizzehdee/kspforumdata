Initially i thought it was mod issue, but after some checking, even a clean install (with removing all left over files etc), still has the issue present. To say more, when i put mods back in, modded engines, like prop engines from AP\u002B mod, have their sound fade away correctly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also tried fresh install of 1.7.2, and the issue was there aswell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas how to fix this?
