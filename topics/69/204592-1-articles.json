The drag/aero physics have since then changed, but the training was never adapted to it.

It also helps to hold pitch up or down on the way up to force an arc instead of going straight up... that will also limit how high you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-31T01:20:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2021 01:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stannis59","CreatedById":228885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-30T15:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224026279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204592\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630372742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152460\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swjr-swis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/31/2021 at 6:49 AM, swjr-swis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat training was created in an older version of KSP.
