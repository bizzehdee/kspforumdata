I moved the KSP Steam Library from C: to D: because C: had gotten filled up, and now KSP takes forever (3 - 4 minutes) before it gets to the Start screen. Before it seems like it took only about 2 minutes, on average. Any suggestions on how to make it load any faster?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-23T22:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisable the frame rate cap and V-syncing- for some odd reason KSP loads stuff at a speed directly linked to the frame rates; I\u0027ve seen frame rates in the hundreds or even over a thousand once during game loading, so limiting it to just 60FPS, or adding V-syncing which\u00A0reduces the frame rates,\u00A0would slow that down dramatically. It\u0027s possible that the drive partition just works slower so you might have to live with the difference. A\u00A0SSD has a considerable speed advantage over a HDD, but if buying a new hard drive just for KSP seems a bit much then try this tiny mod which might help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002257146\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1662411141\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172841-14-18-hyperspace-load-ksp-faster-on-hdd-or-not\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-24T02:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223993720\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203231\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624485770\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisable the frame rate cap and V-syncing-\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUmmmmm.... you have WAY over-estimated my technical knowledge and ability!
