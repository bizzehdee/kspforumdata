For some reason it yaws to the right although I dont press the D key. The torque only comes from my command pod. I found that the reaction wheels of the capsule are always running and are not idle by right-clicking the capsule,\u00A0disabling the reaction wheels solved the problem, but then I dont have any torque to turn the spacecraft. I already had the problem before, but not on every missions that I flew. It cant be that my D key stuck otherwise I would spam D\u0027s in every text that I write.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current KSP\u00A0version is v1.0.5.1028.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T16:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi QuietElite, please hold down \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe mod key\u003C/a\u003E and press X to cancel all trim applied to the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuietElite","CreatedById":155890,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T17:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answer.
