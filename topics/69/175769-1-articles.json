Stage recovery? Well, it is hard to do precision landings in ksp, as in real life. I usually just parachute stuff down to the surface and recover them using the stage recovery mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-10T03:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will take practice. Returning boosters from orbit is a matter of periapsis location and altitude, along with velocity at periapsis, plus a little bit of crossrange capability. Landing boosters in an RTLS situation like SpaceX does, aim for 3/4 the way to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, ish, as Kerbin rotates, and steer the rocket to use it like a wing to further refine your approach. Fire engines when ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote, this will require a mod, as if you focus on the first stage, the second stage will be destroyed, and vice versa. FMRS I think does this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-10T06:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you referring to recovering a booster stage, or just a precision landing near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRevoering a booster stage can be complicated or as simple as you like, a number of mods will handle this.\u00A0\u00A0 In stock, this is very difficult to do, as the chances of losing either the ship\u00A0 or the booster are very high due to timing concerns.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrecision landing near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty easy.\u00A0 There\u0027s a lot of great threads on here about that, so I won\u0027t go into details.\u00A0 But since every ship flies a little differently, it\u0027ll just take some trial and error to get your reentry burn right so that you can land near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E every time.\u00A0 I have it down so that I can pick a random ship with chutes and reliably get within 20km, and a powered descent I can get within 1 km.\u00A0 Add some mods designed for this task, and it becomes almost pinpoint everytime.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-10T18:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to land near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E precisely, then I\u0027d recommend installing the Trajectories mod.
