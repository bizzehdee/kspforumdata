All drivers are up to date and calibration on Windows 10 is fine in conrtol panel. However, when i then start Kerbal it does not recognise it in game or if i go into Settings and open the controller settings. It doesn\u0027t even recognise a joystick is present. All there is is the mouse, Track IR and 6D thing. I have also tried with a Xbox One game pad and i get the same result, the PC recognises it in control panel but nothing at all in Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm i missing something? does it need a mod downloaded for joystick/pad to work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T17:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHI \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170953-windystig/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170953\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170953-windystig/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@windystig\u003C/a\u003E, there\u0027s a few things to know with joysticks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stick must be plugged in before starting KSP, and the axis bindings (up/down etc) will only work on the pitch, roll, yaw and throttle side of the settings screen, not on the button side (so pushing the stick forwards won\u0027t register when trying to bind to Pitch Down), and there\u0027s a limit of 20 fire buttons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that the stick should work, if you still have trouble see this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd let us know what stick you\u0027re using.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"windystig","CreatedById":170953,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T22:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Sal_Vager\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI naively thought it would recognise it automatically.
