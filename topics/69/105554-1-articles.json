I save the game, go to sleep and next morning, when i launch the game, those two contracts wasnt there ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) I have only minor contracts like (Position satelite, Rescue, Perform visual surveys). And my \u0022Archive\u0022 tab in Mission Control is empty ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif).\n\nAny suggestion what to do?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T08:49:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:55:49Z","Content":"Hmm. That\u0027s odd. Perhaps it didn\u0027t save when you thought it did. If you did a manual quicksave, try to load that one back up and see. (Maybe make another named quicksave with ALT\u002BF5 where you are, in case it reverts you too far.)\n\nYou can also try to play the game a bit longer and see if they pop back up. Also, check the Accepted and Completed tabs in Mission Control to see if they popped up in there. If they are completely gone, then try waiting it out.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorisaj","CreatedById":130038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:19:43Z","Content":"Thanks!\n\nIt was in saves...\n\npersistent.sfs has only 54KB\n\nand\n\nquicksave.sfs has 150KB\n\nso i loaded game from quicksave.sfs and its ok! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:50:27Z","Content":"Excellent! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHave fun,\n\n-Claw"}]}
