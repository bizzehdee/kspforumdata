During flight set timewarp to x3 (it was safe in most cases, even with x4)\n\n2. Decreased timewarp to x2 (or x1, doesn\u0027t matter)\n\nAfter this my plane turns its nose down (around 30-50 degrees or even more in some cases) and then up again. I think there\u0027s no need to notice that I\u0027ve lost plenty of speed with this maneuver. And of course it could be really dangerous to timewarp near the ground. Sometimes it happened with switching from timewarp x2 to timewarp x1.\n\nSo I started a sandbox game to investigate. I tried different planes and finally came to conclusion that this problem **happens only with this swept wings** (though I haven\u0027t tried swept wings type A and B because they have terrible issues with ailerons attachment). And in my previous career which I started in 1.0 just after release the same plane worked fine (as I remember).\n\nP.S. After lots of trying and reloading/restarting I encountered another strange issue with editor: multiple ship loading (using Load option, not Merge). I couldn\u0027t replicate it again, but before it happened editor asked me to save the vessel though I just opened it and turned on CoM, CoL and CoT.\n\n![screenshot61.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78202708/screenshot61.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T17:34:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by orven**"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:19:51Z","Content":"In regards to your latter problem, KSP does a lot of really strange things right before it crashes.
