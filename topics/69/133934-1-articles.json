Or simply that it\u0027s not meeting my expectations?\u00A0Keep in mind that you\u0027re not driving on the road, but rather on bumpy, uneven terrain, littered with boulders. Imagine a dry river bed. Now imagine driving a sedan, or even a truck, at 30 mph through it. Do you expect your tires to survive?
