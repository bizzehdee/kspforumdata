Other parts it will happen on but I don\u0027t know what the circumstances need to be. I can build rockets without issues, but anything else is a gut wrenching waste of time because I spend all this effort trying to build something and I come across a part that no matter what just will not stick on the craft properly. They will stick in the wrong place, like inside of the wing or inside of each other. I\u0027ve tried loading stock crafts, taking parts off and putting them back on exactly as they were but I can\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI captured this happening with the panels.

The 3rd picture is from the b9 mod, where it did the same thing. It took a really, really long time to get any of them to connect. Most of the time they just sit there with that opacity and they won\u0027t join together. I feel a little embarrassed to ask if they are even supposed to connect on the sides. It\u0027s hard to tell what is or isn\u0027t supposed to connect because of this issue. I\u0027m so jealous of people who can play it without these kinds of buggy things happening!

There are two methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Node connections...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To connect to a node, the part you are currently \u0022holding\u0022 must also have a node. You will need to roughly align these parts in order to get the nodes to connect. Once they connect, it turns green. It looks like you\u0027re familiar with this process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Surface connections...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In the video, you\u0027re trying to attach the edge of a panel to the edge of another panel. In order to do that, you need to surface attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you surface attach? you ask... Well, parts that surface attach will connect where ever your mouse is. So in order to attach the part you\u0027re holding to another part, you have to touch your mouse to the spot you want to connect to. Once you do that, the part will \u0022stick\u0022 and turn green. Then you can use the WASDQE keys to rotate the part to the orientation you want, all while surface attached. You can also hold SHIFT while pressing the WASDQE buttons in order to reduce the rotation increment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after you get parts attached, you can use the offset and rotation gizmos (those floating buttons in the top left). Simply select one of those gizmos and then click on the part you just placed (or any part for that matter). The offset tool will make a set of three arrows pop up, while the rotate tool will pop up a sphere to turn. You can use these tools to slide or rotate your parts around. Turning off angle snap will make the movements even more precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Little Katie","CreatedById":129746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T19:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love you.
