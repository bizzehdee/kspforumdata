KSP is limited to using a max of 3.8 Gb before it crashes. It can only utilise a single processing thread as well, which I believe means you can barely use all of your computer\u0027s resources to help the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next update should help with this big problem. The game is updgrading to Unity 5, which allows for multi-thread processing and has 64 bit support. This should mean you can use all of those 16gb of RAM to run KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice would be to wait until the update and then see what happens.
