are missing in the flight scene view when in low\u00A0orbit\u00A0on Duna and Moho. \u00A0Both planets look normal in map view and from high orbit. \u00A0All other planets render normally. \u00A0On Duna, everything looks normal until 110km. \u00A0Then, between 110km and 100km the texture fades out and I\u0027m left with the view seen below.

\u00A0I do think that what I\u0027m seeing is the biomes though. \u00A0The colors are different than the Shift F12 setting, but the outlines are roughly the

to Duna and Moho, has it ever worked or has it always looked this way for you?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it\u0027s a new install we should be able to rule out a bad file, unless both installs came from the same zip folder, it is possible you have a corrupted zip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be a weird rendering bug that only appears with those two planets and only with your mesa driver and intel card combination, if that is the case then a driver update might fix it, I see you\u0027re using 14.04 LTS and it uses quite an old version of the mesa driver, updating should make newer drivers available, as would using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/\u002Barchive/ubuntu/ppa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEdgers repository\u003C/a\u003E which supports 14.04, your current driver looks to be 10.1.3 while edgers has 11.0.4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may also be caused by anti-aliasing, which the Unity engine has a lot of trouble with on Linux, some things will fail to work with anti-aliasing off even if anti-aliasing itself doesn\u0027t work, if it\u0027s off try with it on and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also notice you don\u0027t have a lot of video ram, only 256 megs according to the Player.log, I can\u0027t see your graphics card memory in the hardinfo report, so maybe it\u0027s shared with the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a nullreference exception in the Player.log as well but it looks like it\u0027s related to the UI, rather than the terrain rendering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d try anti-aliasing first, then a fresh zip if it wasn\u0027t already, then look at a graphics driver update, hopefully that will fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it really is because of insufficient video ram I\u0027m not sure what you could do, I think some old laptops allowed you to set the shared memory in the bios so that may be worth a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zaruthoj","CreatedById":156510,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T23:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biome theory might not
