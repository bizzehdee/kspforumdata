I was hoping 1.0 would fix it, but I guess not.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nI entered SPH, and the floor was flickering. I immediately hit the exit button. \n\nThe display becomes a RBG color wheel. I exit out of fullscreen using the green button, to take a screen shot,\n\nbut the game crashes. \n\nHere is the crash log:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/buhbi5p95lt5wgj/Crash_Log.rtf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/buhbi5p95lt5wgj/Crash_Log.rtf?dl=0)\n\nI did a fresh install tonight, and I\u0027m using steam. \n\nI\u0027m currently playing with my air in clamshell mode, hooked up to an external display. But this has happened before with the built-in display. \n\nComputer specs:\n\n2013 Macbook air\n\n1.7 GHz\n\n8 GB Ram\n\nIntel HD 5000"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:54:59Z","Content":"See [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116985-1-0-Constant-crashing-on-OS-X?p=1877631\u0026viewfull=1#post1877631) for more information. It may be possible to mitigate this issue by reducing the texture quality. At this point, we\u0027re trying to narrow down the cause, which appears to be excessive memory usage on some Macs, but not others."}]}
