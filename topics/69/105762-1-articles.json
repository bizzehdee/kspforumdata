Usually the load menu does not load if there is a corrupted craft file in the SPH directory in that particular save. If the problem seems to stem from nowhere, try removing all the craft under \u003Csavename\u003E/ships/SPH in your KSP/saves directory and try loading then.\u003C/savename\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:34:43Z","Content":"[Exception]: IsolatedStorageException: Could not find a part of the path \u0022D:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\saves\\For Stuff!!!\\Ships\\SPH\\Auto-Saved Ship.craft\u0022.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWhen trying to load^^"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:39:34Z","Content":"Hmmm. I hope you did not delete the SPH directory, but if you did you can recreate it inside the ships folder.

Upon creating the directory myself the problem was resolved.\n\nagain all you have to do (if you can not save space planes) is create the SPH folder under .../Kerbal Space Program/save/Tostito/Ships/ \n\nas the simple fix."}]}
