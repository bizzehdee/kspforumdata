Also, we can\u0027t view that file with your current privacy settings. \n\nAnyway, to fix this, just move all your .craft files out of the Ships\\SPH folder, then try to create a simple craft and reload it to confirm that the SPH does in fact work again. Then, start putting the craft files you took out back in, one at a time, testing the Load button each time. When it stops working, you\u0027ve found the broken file. There\u0027s not much you\u0027ll be able to do other than deleting it, I\u0027m afraid. Broken files that cause this kind of error are typically missing just about everything, so rebuilding from scratch is more or less the only option there is, unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"ofir","CreatedById":137926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T00:04:48Z","Content":"Alright, but when doing this do I have to fully close ksp or just click on load?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T00:17:49Z","Content":"You can freely move the .craft files around, and try clicking on Load in between. No need to restart KSP while doing so.\n\nYou can also bring up the MOD\u002BF2 debug log (ALT\u002BF2 in Windows). If it\u0027s a corrupt craft file, the log will often tell you.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"ofir","CreatedById":137926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:14:58Z","Content":"Haha, I\u0027ve found the problem the folder SPH was missing."}]}
