I [did what you said](http://postimg.org/image/e79g8migb/), then reactivated Steam overlay for the game, then ran it from the Steam browser, and the problem disappeared! I\u0027m now able to use the Steam overlay, and the VAB and SPH are both accessible again!\n\nBut the weird part is that, as you can see from that screenshot, it *claims* that I didn\u0027t actually install anything. It seems to be saying that I already had everything installed that I tried to install. But if that\u0027s the case, then why would the bug have gone away? It happened consistently every time I tried to start a new game, before. And yet now it\u0027s gone, despite that it would seem as though I haven\u0027t done anything.\n\nI wish I would have checked, before deactivating the Steam overlay, and after reactivating it but *before* attempting to install that driver, whether I was still getting the graphical bug in the VAB/SPH. Then I might have known for sure what fixed it, or if it truly did just fix itself on its own (as it seems to have).\n\nAh well. Thanks for your help! The problem is resolved.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T03:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Elen Sila**\n  \nforgot link"}]}
