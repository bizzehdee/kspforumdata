I just have a problem with what it\u0027s programmed to do (because I\u0027m colorblind).\n\n**KSP version:**\n\nKSP 1.0.2 (Mac...not Steam)\n\n**A detailed explanation of what happened and what you were trying to accomplish:**\n\nI was trying to build a fairing, and was clicking like crazy but couldn\u0027t get the fairing point to place a cross-section. It turned out that this is because I can see the \u0022[LMB] Place Cross-Section\u0022 text changing from gray to some yellowish color, but I can\u0027t see that sometimes the yellowish color is orange (apparently) and sometimes it is green (or so I was eventually told).\n\n**A screenshot of your craft or any relevant screens**\n\nIs it orange? Is it green? I couldn\u0027t tell there was a difference:\n\n![OiW22vS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OiW22vS.jpg)\n\n**The ouput\\_log.txt or player.log file KSP creates when it launches and, if applicable, the crash log KSP has generated when the program crashed**\n\nNot Applicable\n\n**A detailed list of system specifications**\n\nNot Important here, I think.\n\nI would recommend that Squad fix this particular aspect of the interface to avoid frustrating their colorblind customers. If the cross-section can\u0027t currently be placed, the TEXT should CHANGE (not just its color) to indicate why.\n\nAlso, your choice of prefixes here doesn\u0027t have one that really applies here (perhaps something like **[colorBLINDNESS]** would work)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T19:38:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"}]}
