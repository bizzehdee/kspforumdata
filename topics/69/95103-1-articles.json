I was simply playing, and I noticed that at some point the button had been removed from the flight screen, making it very hard to complete contracts. Contracts can still be completed, but I can\u0027t check my progress with any kind of ease. I have deleted my game data (using Steam) and I redownloaded the game and ported my save over, but that did not restore the widget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have looked over the game\u0027s hotkeys and I don\u0027t see anything about hiding or managing on screen widgets. The debug menu doesn\u0027t provide any answers either. Is there some hidden key combination that I\u0027m not seeing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure I might just have to paste in a few lines to my save file, but any relevant parts of the .sfs file are no longer there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
