Once the freeze stops there\u0027s about a 50% chance that the item will have moved correctly, otherwise it doesn\u0027t move at all and I have to try again (which of course triggers another freeze).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens both in the VAB and whilst in flight, and both with mods and with a clean KSP install.
