The [NCS Adapter](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/NCS_Adapter) got moved to the fuel tank category, had fuel added to it, and got its appearance revised, back when 1.0 was released.\nIf you\u0027re just looking for a 1.25m-to-0.625m adapter, there\u0027s the [FL-A10](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-A10_Adapter) or [FL-A5](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-A5_Adapter), both under the Structural tab."},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T21:47:12Z","Content":"I think my install might have gotten messed up. i\u0027ll try a new one as I was having some other odd issues as well."}]}
