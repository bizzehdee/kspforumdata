Yea maybe it could have been more efficient money wise but I was able to take it in from Jool to Kerbin with 2 Kerbin aerobrakes (the first one took a lot of quick saves to get altitude just right) at 100% re-entry difficulty. \n\nAs I\u0027m coming down this happens (the inner craft comes outside the cargo bay through the wall, a lot. It got more drastic after my picture) [https://www.dropbox.com/s/qy3e0n6zo7uaof5/2015-08-06_00007.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qy3e0n6zo7uaof5/2015-08-06_00007.jpg?dl=0)\n\nSomeone made a thread about \u0022magical\u0022 cargo bays that I guess freeze things in place in them? That would be great, but im fine with things moving in the cargo bays, just not them coming through the walls. Also note that if you disconnect yourself from an object that is in your cargo bay and time accelerate, the object will travel outside your ship like the bay is not there.\n\nThe return took a few quick save reloads to get it down, and surprisingly it did not tear my ship apart like I was expecting; it just flailed around violently and made me annoyed and very worried. I think this maybe due to Claws stock bug fixes I have installed; they fixed my Glue Kraken issue (Claw\u0027s my hero), and maybe stopped the ship from being torn apart? Aside from that its an all stock game from Steam.\n\nIt was brought on when the ship got lower in the atmosphere, not when it was going 4.4km per second through 70-38km atmosphere range. The weight of the ship is *slightly* towards the rear and I bring it down from front-forward because you need a heat shield, and that made it go side to side a little, but the ship was controlling it well; until the lander in the cargo bay flings out from the inside and screws everything up. Did it ruin my $400k mission? No. Did it destroy my ship or corrupt my save? No, and I\u0027m happy about that. Was it extremely unrealistic and an unsatisfying end to the mission? Yes, but I got 2.2k science out of it.\n\nIt would be really great and realistic to have the parts inside the cargo bays stay put and actually contain things, or better yet let Engineer Kerbals make temporary struts in space to secure objects (and not just those inside cargo bays). Please note my craft is connected inside the cargo bay via a docking port. A Sr. docking port may help it, but it would look weird and im good on that.\n\nOne last thing: is it weird that during Kerbin re-entry while coming in straight that there are not really flames on the right side of my ship?

I\u0027ve been debating if this should have gone in the development suggestions fourm or here; I chose here. If it\u0027s not a bug and you can move threads feel free to move it there\n\nOh yea and once it landed and I clicked recover, the game crashed and gave me this error report. Upon starting game back up, my ship was still in the water it landed in and i was able to recover it\n\noutputlog -- [https://www.dropbox.com/s/cezql40e374b163/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cezql40e374b163/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/peh3yd00jifq6o3/report.ini?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/peh3yd00jifq6o3/report.ini?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/yjynzc0bctr56pj/error.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yjynzc0bctr56pj/error.log?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3gutq1s5pxvv7r/crash.dmp?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3gutq1s5pxvv7r/crash.dmp?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T04:57:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 04:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T08:12:45Z","Content":"Well, all I do is put a strut from the other end of my payload to the bay wall, usually one single strut is enough and as it\u0027s in the bay it isn\u0027t adding to drag.\n\nThat\u0027s only good for taking cargo up though, as you can\u0027t place struts in space.\n\nSo what I do when I have an object I know I want to recover later is place docking ports on both ends, small ones are fine.\n\nSomething I need to test is using landing legs to hold the floppy end of a payload, the feet of some of the landing legs are actually separate parts, so they can press against parts of the same vessel.\n\nWheels are also separate parts, so a small wheel in the floor of the bay should act as a stop, preventing the payload from moving through it.\n\nEdit:\n\nWorks with the LV05 and LV-01 if the wheels are placed on another part outside the bay then clipped inward, doesn\u0027t work if placed on the bay itself.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
