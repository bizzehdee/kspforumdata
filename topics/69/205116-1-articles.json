Not only that but it causes the entire dGPU to crash and stop working until I reboot the machine. This is evident from all its stats dropping to zero in MSI Afterburner and other games giving errors about not being able to access it when I try to play them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when I disable the DLC from the Properties window in Steam, the game loads just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also works fine with the DLC enabled, but only when using the laptop\u0027s integrated Intel GPU - however in that case it runs at less than 10fps, even in the menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case it\u0027s useful, the dGPU is a GeForce MX350, the iGPU is whatever\u0027s on the i7-1165G7 and the laptop is a VivoBook S15.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve reinstalled the Nvidia drivers with DDU and reinstalled and verified KSP\u0027s game files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-03T18:48:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2021 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by HBB360\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
