However, I might be more worried about KSP doing something dumb with the RAM since it\u0027s a memory hog like no other. (Nothing I\u0027ve ran to date can max out RAM usage regularly like KSP can...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, KSP is actually kinda light on graphical requirements. All the pretty pictures you see online in-game with fantastic views tend to be with graphical mods installed. If you\u0027re running integrated graphics (indicative by the shared RAM specs), I would worry a bit more if the CPU can handle KSP. KSP is pretty CPU-intensive comparatively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, you may wind up running the game in non-real-time.

With a bit more detailed information, I can tell you with much more confidence, but any frame rate drops are probably the fault of A, a weak CPU combined with high part-count vessels, B, you\u0027re starting to run out of physical memory and are chugging as you start to move too much to swap, or C, you installed 47 graphics mods with high-resolution textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-01T06:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223040525\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493594548\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177332\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John_M42\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, John_M42 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDedicated memory: 128MB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe, but you\u0027re sure pushing your luck with that 128MB dedicated VRAM...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSystem requirements say minimum 512MB, your \u0027card\u0027 sounds like an integrated chip with access to shared system memory, so you might get away with it.
