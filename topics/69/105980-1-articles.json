[http://imgur.com/m6hhmuj](http://imgur.com/m6hhmuj)\n\nYou can see that the title of the mission is to fly by duna, or every tourist need to go to the mun or minmus. i think there is a problem when missions are created.\n\nI hope this will help to do not the same mistake than me and enhanced missions for further upgrades.\n\nsee you."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:39:23Z","Content":"That does look odd. It looks like there is more further down. Did you scroll down to see what was there? I think the contract system has an order for the planets when it makes the name. So maybe only one tourist wants to go there and the whole thing gets named Duna.\n\nIf not, then definitely looks like a bug.\n\nThanks for the report, and welcome to the forum! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
