The HP website boasts \u0022industry leading processor so you never need to worry if it\u0027s powerful enough\u0022; that is a colossal joke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, there are three main elements KSP hits: CPU, GPU, and memory, of which the first is limiting for high-end computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor memory: you need enough of it to load KSP, any mods involved (particularly parts mods with memory-hungry textures and models), hold any background processes, without putting anything important into swap memory (basically using the hard drive/SSD as extra memory as a last-ditch effort). 4 GB can be kind of tight, 8 GB is usually enough unless you\u0027re one of those \u0022Mod It Till It Crashes\u0022 types, and 16 GB would be overkill. The speed usually doesn\u0027t matter too much; generally, standard DDR3-1600 or DDR4-2133 is more than sufficient for the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the GPU: This is \u003Ci\u003Eusually\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0the limiting factor for AAA games, since those games tend to be computationally simple, but packed with very demanding graphics elements. The general advice is to set graphics settings down until either your FPS plateaus (GPU is crunching frames faster than the CPU can push them to the GPU), your FPS exceeds the refresh rate of your monitor (usually 60 FPS), or you\u0027re just generally happy with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP, fortunately, graphics are rarely limiting, particularly when notched down to minimum. Even with the relatively wimpy integrated GPU on that laptop, I doubt it\u0027s the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to the CPU, this is usually (unless there are memory problems) the limiting factor for KSP, which is a very physics-heavy simulation game that puts huge loads on the CPU. You\u0027ve got to calculate forces on every part by every other part, manage on-rails vessels, manage CommNet, aerodynamics, heating, solar panels, and many other things which hit the CPU for each and every simulation timestep. The quick-and-dirty way is to increase the maximum time per frame, which lengthens the KSP simulation timestep at the cost of making the simulation slightly less accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this, all I can suggest is to keep your craft small, avoid any CPU-hungry background processes, keep your laptop cool (prop it up so the bottom fans are unobstructed, etc), avoid some of the more CPU-hungry mods (my best guess is that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E will be the worst offender), and, well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a 1.6 GHz dual-core Celeron. Were you really expecting much out of that thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacopo","CreatedById":153479,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T17:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/122674-starman4308/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022122674\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/122674-starman4308/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Starman4308\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhp stream has a quad core 1ghz not a dual core 1.6 ghz.
