This appears in all space scenes and also in the main menu screen.\n\nThere have been posts on this topic already which I have read, unfortunately the proposed solutions didn\u0027t work for me. Therefore the full story:\n\nKSP version 1.0.2, Win 7, 64bit, intel i5-3570K, 8GB RAM, AMD 5770 Graphics card.\n\nDuring months the above combination worked fine, i.e. the behaviour mentioned did not appear.\n\nWhat I tried out:\n\n- Clean install of KSP. Issue persists (Yes, I\u0027m normally using KAC, MJ and KER, but it obviously doesn\u0027t relate to these mods, therefore I\u0027m posting into this forum)\n\n- Setting Texture quality in AMD Catalyst Suite to different values, including \u0022Quality\u0022. Issue persists.\n\n- Installing newest AMD Driver. Issue persists\n\n- Complete uninstall and reinstall of AMD Driver. Issue persists.\n\n- Loading an old persistent.sfs. Issue persists.\n\n- Playing around with graphics settings, restarting KSP several times. Issue persists.\n\n- Added Astronomers Visual Pack into a clean install. Issue persists. Clouds, but blurry.\n\nWhat surprised me:\n\n- Starting the instance of KSP from another Windows account. Issue is gone.\n\n- Starting the instance of KSP from another Windows installation (Win 8.1). Issue is gone.\n\n- And of course, on other PC\u0027s the effect is also not there.\n\nTherefore, I have to assume that the \u0022normal\u0022 windows account that I\u0027m normally using suddenly has something (process or setting or Kraken) that is telling KSP to reduce the GPU resources.\n\nDoes anybody have an idea where to get any further hints? Any logfiles or somewhere to look at with process explorer? I\u0027m living with the Win 8.1 workaround but as an engineer I\u0027d like to understand the cause of the issue.\n\nThank you in advance"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:00:24Z","Content":"Hello Maestro22, please upload your KSP\\_Data\\output\\_log.txt and dxdiag log from the affected account and from an unaffected account to dropbox.com or a similar fileshare site, differences that might explain this might be written to those logs."},{"CreatedByName":"Maestro22","CreatedById":147697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T20:11:01Z","Content":"Hello sal\\_vager,\n\nthat sounds like a good plan. I compared those files and found one tiny difference in the dxdiag lines 56, 58 and 59 - descibing the Monitor model I\u0027m using. For some weird reason it identifies it correctly as admin, but not as a normal user. The problem: I can\u0027t verify whether this is a new effect or not. But it points at least slightly in the direction.\n\nHere\u0027s the [link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzsHy6P3a0AoelFCbzdOVkxwbXM\u0026usp=sharing)to the files.\n\nI\u0027m happy for any further ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T20:31:20Z","Content":"I think that a non-admin is just unable to query those lines, it shouldn\u0027t matter too much what the display is.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t know how you will find the cause of this issue, it may be a setting in your user profile but finding it may be difficult, the only thing I can think of would be to compare the regsitry between the current profile and another.\n\nYou could follow[**this guide**](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-corrupted-user-profile#1TC=windows-7)to \u0022fix\u0022 a corrupted profile (essentially by making a new one and copying files over), allowing you to play KSP with full textures and allowing you to do some sluthing in the registy at your leisure."},{"CreatedByName":"Maestro22","CreatedById":147697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T19:09:30Z","Content":"I found it! It was a long way with many relogins, but in the end I could narrow it down to one line of XML making the difference... For anybody having a similar problem here\u0027s my experience:\n\nThe graphics card profile of my Radeon HD5770 is stored in a file Profiles.xml in C:\\Users\\\u003Cuser\u003E\\AppData\\Local\\ATI\\ACE. Within this file there is one line making the difference:\u003C/user\u003E\n\nGood: \u003Cproperty name=\u0022TextureLod\u0022 value=\u0022HiQuality\u0022\u003E\u003C/property\u003E\n\nBad: \u003Cproperty name=\u0022TextureLod\u0022 value=\u0022HiPerformance\u0022\u003E\u003C/property\u003E\n\nThe trick is, that in the AMD Catalyst Control Center I see no option to influence this value. As I wrote before, I installed the latest AMD drivers (currently 15.7.1), but also in the previous version (14.something) that option was not visible. And yes, I have advanced settings enabled.\n\nIn the end, the original post that I read while investigating tis issue pointed in the correct direction, but AMD\u0027s Control Center is simply hiding that essential option.\n\nThank you sal\\_vager for pointing me in the right direction!![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T10:55:14Z","Content":"Well done Maestro22, I didn\u0027t know that option was hidden, I even have it on Linux with the Nvidia driver, it\u0027s called \u0022Image Quality\u0022 for me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMarking as solved!"}]}
