You\u0027ll need to open KSP\u0027s main folder and look through the files there. If you have a Steam copy, it\u0027ll be in \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\Steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\u003C/span\u003E. Otherwise, it\u0027ll be wherever you chose to install it to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen up the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003ESaves\u003C/span\u003E folder and go through your save folders one by one. You want to pay attention to the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003C/span\u003E files; specifically, their file sizes. They won\u0027t be huge files, but look for one that is especially small (less than 5KB, or thereabouts). This file will be corrupt and unplayable, and is causing the Resume Saved window to not appear as KSP gets stuck parsing the file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t find the busted file this way, simply open up KSP and attempt to Resume Saved from the main menu. When it doesn\u0027t work, hit Alt\u002BF2 and look at the red text to see which save file is broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Equicksave.sfs\u003C/span\u003E file in that same save folder (or another named quicksave in that folder) that was saved pretty recently, you can simply delete the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003C/span\u003E file and rename the quicksave file to take its place. Otherwise, there\u0027s not much you can do; the data in that specific save game will be lost, and you\u0027ll have to delete the save completely in order to fix the main menu so that you can play -- make sure you copy any craft files out of the relevant folders if you want to keep them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"narbleator9000","CreatedById":131348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T08:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey thanks a lot!
