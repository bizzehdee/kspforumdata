I went into my GameData folder a clicked on the Squad folder to try and see what was wrong with it, but when I clicked on the folder a message appeared on my computer saying I couldn\u0027t access the folder and after closing that message the Squad folder simply vanished. disappeared. without a trace. I thought this may be that my computer was hiding the Squad folder so I didn\u0027t access it, but when I tried loading KSP I was greeted by a completely black screen and nothing else.
