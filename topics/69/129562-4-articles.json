This heap is defined by the engine, not by KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, you can reduce the amount of garbage being created each frame by using methods \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/97386-padishar/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002297386\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/97386-padishar/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Padishar\u003C/a\u003E and other explained throughout the forum and these methods are widely known upon Unity developers. Less garbage each frame means basically that this heap is reached much slower and instead of having the GC run every 5-10 seconds you could reduce it to a point where it runs every 10 minutes and literally noone would complain about a 0.2 second hang every 10 minutes compared to the current state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods increase this issue because obviously there are more objects (btw. \u0022objects\u0022 doesn\u0027t necessarily mean physical objects but also lists, data, variables etc.) to be created and destroyed each frame.
