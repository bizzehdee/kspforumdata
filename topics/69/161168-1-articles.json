Cant Load Game Since Newest Update - Mac","CreatedByName":"crazycatkikicraft","CreatedById":178160,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T16:20:33Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"crazycatkikicraft","CreatedById":178160,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T16:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease Help. I haven\u0027t been able to play KSP since the newest update! Here is an explanation of the problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I launched KSP on steam, like I always have, without updating my computer or anything different. Just a normal day. I notice the new loading pictures, wich i think are pretty cool, and then at around 75% or so of loading the game, It stops. It just stops. It stops on the asset: Squad/Parts/Wheel/roverWheelXL3/roverWheel3. I tried again, and it didn\u0027t work. So I turned off steam and opened it again and tried. Didn\u0027t work. I turned off my computer and left it for an hour or so and tried again. Didn\u0027t work. This all happened after the newest update occurred. So i uninstalled the game and reinstalled it. Didn\u0027t work. But the strangest thing is that I got rid of the mods I currently had installed\u00A0after it stopped working, but it still reads\u00A0the assets in the mods, even though there are no mod GameData. I searched through my computer and i seemed to still find a few files from the mods, but I don\u0027t want to mess up something, since I am really bad at this sort of thing, so I let them be. But how can mod files get to other places, even when I deleted their GameData? Creepy. Their assets appear in the loading bar, even after I reinstalled the entire game. But I just want to know how I can easily fix this, not about how the mods are getting through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also always stops at: Squad/Parts/Wheel/roverWheelXL3/roverWheel3. Every single time. I have no idea what this has to do with anything, but since the update, it has never gone passed it. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw my laptop is a\u00A0MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) /\u00A01,6 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor /\u00A04 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Memory /\u00A0Intel HD Graphics 6000 1536 MB Graphics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I haven\u0027t changed anything with it. No mouse change, no setup change, no internet change. Just nothing. Im pretty sure its related to the mods or the update, but I don\u0027t know how to fix it, because I don\u0027t do this sort of thing. ;-;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I need some sort of module manager or what? All i need is simple instructions in to what on earth I need to do (because im a noob at this stuff :(. I just want to play my ksp).
