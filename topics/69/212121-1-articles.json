I initially deleted it for space for other games but was wanting to get back into it because of the KSP2 hype. I have seen people post about this issue multiple times and all but maybe one was to do with mods. I have never downloaded any mods ever since I got KSP, I haven\u0027t even downloaded the expansions. I have reinstalled, verified game files, adjusted allocated memory, I have watched my memory as the game was loading and nothing is helping or giving me any indication to what the problem is. I have the log file which I will link below, but their is no crash report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M4QooZxesMbBGqk9pwXRogrsi8NyOqn2/view?usp=share_link\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1M4QooZxesMbBGqk9pwXRogrsi8NyOqn2/view?usp=share_link\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-19T21:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/225626-thesakman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022225626\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/225626-thesakman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@theSAKman\u003C/a\u003E, and welcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich operating system are you on? \u00A0If you\u0027re on Mac (OS X) I can help ya fix that issue. \u00A0If you\u0027re on PC (looks like if from your post, I\u0027m sure someone will check in shortly with an answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theSAKman","CreatedById":225626,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-19T23:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running windows 10 home (64), i7-7700k, 16g ram,\u00A0asus rog stix gtx 1080\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansAcker","CreatedById":195534,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T16:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that the whole log file?
