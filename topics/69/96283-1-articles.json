In the new install I have very limited stock parts (1 pod, 1 fuel tank, 2 engines, 0 command/control, 1 basic structure, 0 aerodynamics, 1 utility) and the orange folder has no rockets at all. The original version I purchased was populated with a whole host of stock parts and 10 to 15 preassembled rockets. How do I get stock parts and preassembled rockets in this new install?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T22:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to 0.90\u0027s Career mode! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where a new (Career) game will start off, unless you\u0027ve manually altered the custom difficulty settings, in which case you can enable the Stock crafts for Career. Those few limited parts are all you start with; you can unlock more by spending Science points in the Research and Development facility at the Space Center. Contracts are available from the Mission Control building between the VAB, SPH and Runway, which are presently the only way to fund your space program -- it does get expensive. In the Admin Building (far left of the others, near the Flag) you can select different modifier strategies which will alter the amounts of Funds, Reputation, or Science you receive under various circumstance, as well as a couple other more complicated ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock craft are also typically unavailable in Career mode unless you manually tweak the difficulty settings when creating the new game. The rationale behind this is that they aren\u0027t much use until a fair way through Career mode when you\u0027ve unlocked the parts they use. And by then, many players are accustomed to building things their own way, more or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you just want to play KSP the way you\u0027re already accustomed to, you can opt to use Sandbox mode when creating a new game instead. This will give you access to everything right from the start, Stock craft included. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CajunRon","CreatedById":79173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T22:49:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!!!
