This is not related to version change, as far as I\u0027ve seen. In my career save\u00A0the game reverts itself.\u00A0Some vessels are not where they should be, or otherwise disappeared without a trace, some science data is lost, along with any researches in the R\u0026amp;D Center made in the span of time, the dates do not change though. That\u0027s the strangest part. It\u0027s like the entire thing never happened, My Kerbin Orbital Station disappeared, and the pilot was later marked Dead in the Crew roster. On the other hand, my Munar Research Station also disappeared without a trace, but the crew of three were reported to be alive in the roster, and not assigned to anything. I had 3 Relay Satellites in an orbit quite outside Minmus, but they too disappeared (Does not show up in tracking station as anything). Any debris relating to the missing vessel is also gone. Previously, I made sure that I had researched \u0027Ion Propulsion\u0027 and \u0027Adv. Science Tech\u0027 in the R\u0026amp;D Center. Today they were gone. Perhaps it is the version change breaking my save, but I am no longer sure. There wasn\u0027t a version update between yesterday and today. I had made my Munar Station then. The relay satellites were much older, but were affected nontheless. Is anyone else having this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blag","CreatedById":150331,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-24T22:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI now don\u0027t have any trust in the save management of KSP, So I put my save folder in dropbox, and use the versioning to revert my Persistent.sfs when something strange happen... :-/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t had this kind of problem however, I think you should add your version / platform, it could help to try to reproduce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
