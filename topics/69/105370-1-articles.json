Now the booster is too small, just like in the above picture.\n\nThe same thing happens if I quicksave and quickload instead of reverting to launch. \n\nWhen tinkering with tweakScale I made the observation that the value/object\n\n    part.transform.GetChild(0).localScale;\n\nfor the root part seems to behave differently on launch compared to revert-to-launch/quickload. \n\nWhen I write it on vessel load, \n\n    part.transform.GetChild(0).localScale = (someValue);part.transform.GetChild(0).hasChanged = true;part.transform.hasChanged = true;\n\neverything is fine on launch and for non-root parts. But on revert-to-launch or quickload the value for the root part gets reverted to 1.0, which reverts the size of the visual model, and the [camera bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94844-View-zoom-out-on-camera-mode-change?p=1441712\u0026viewfull=1#post1441712) is triggered. \n\nMy theory is that the common factor is localScale!=1.0, which is first set to the right value and then overwritten by some default. The additional bad things in TweakScale\u0027s case are probably connected to setting the hasChanged flags.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T22:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:23:14Z","Content":"Got it, KSP is getting the scale wrong on revert, it\u0027s a bug and should be reported to the public tracker ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso, so cute!\n\n![oQg0gnd.png](http://i.imgur.com/oQg0gnd.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"z26","CreatedById":91677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:46:15Z","Content":"Well, thanks pellinor for explaining it better than I could ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:49:39Z","Content":"There should be a related bug report by biotronic on the tracker, I just can\u0027t find it now."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:16:30Z","Content":"This bug has been around a while.
