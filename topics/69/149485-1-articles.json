But admitted I think there is some room for improvement. Atleast give us a slider for auto generated textures like trees (with a tree line this time please)\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s kind of a fixed objective of any game developer to make the game playable for everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t expect major changes for that reason, and I\u0027ll explain why more specifically if you want to know.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP already is CPU intensive. I have a overclocked 4.3ghz 3570K Processor with 8gigs of ram. This particular processor seems to do very well for ksp according to a chart I read sometime ago. The reason for this has to do with calculations (flops) per clock which is technical and I\u0027ll spare you. Most newer CPUs are better at this but the 3570k in this instance has that and a high base clock \u002B overclockability. Other CPUs might not work as good as mine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI get 15\u002B fps just on my 200 part vessels and even lower if I go near 300 parts (which is where things are still tolerable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat your suggesting is to make the game besides CPU demanding also GPU demanding. The problem there is that the CPU supplies RAW pre-calculated data for your GPU. The higher the graphics, the more the CPU has to do to serve the needs of the GPU. This is minal though, especially in KSP, so mostly this should not be a bottlenecking factor. But because your CPU in KSP is already pretty much stressed atleast on one if not multiple cores any more load is only going to get the FPS further down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo making KSP with higher end graphics will exponentiate the performance losses because the CPU now has to do a 2nd thing while already stressed with it\u0027s basic physics and KSP related calculations. This is why you see frames per second loss if you got a variety of graphics mod installed on KSP. So expect FPS loss if you are going to mod. With the right settings a proper CPU and enough RAM it should still be very playable, regardless of your gamedata folder contents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI see it is basically a trend for CPU intensive sandbox environments to have lower graphics. Take vanilla FSX for example. Because programmers are often limited to choose either a CPU or GPU intensive environment because a environment that has both elements will always make the CPU a bottleneck no matter what Extreme overclock edition \u002B phase change cooling you\u0027ll choose.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
