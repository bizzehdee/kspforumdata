That is working, however the action group doesn\u0027t know it. If you launch with the control surface deployed, you must press the action group twice to get it to raise. Of course pressing the button twice is the workaround but this minor bug needs to be fixed eventually. Once the first \u0027ignored\u0027 button press has occurred, every one after that works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"surge","CreatedById":136150,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T15:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis occurs for (cockpit) lights and gears too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T18:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has happened for gears forever, this is new though, can you please write this up on the bug tracker Alshain ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T06:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis has happened for gears forever, this is new though, can you please write this up on the bug tracker Alshain ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to do the bug tracker tbh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps are pretty simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Flaps have no reason to try to synchronize themselves with a button that doesn\u0027t exist. Toggle means toggle, even if it means one set of flaps deploy at the same time another set of flaps retract, that should be possible (though I don\u0027t know why you would do that). It does give me an idea for another test.... stay tuned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: Yes, that is exactly what is happening. I put two sets of flaps on my plane, one deployed, one not, both on the same action group. Press the button and one set deploys while the other stays the same. Press it again, they both retract. So it is behaving like the landing gear, except unlike the gear there is no button to sync to and no need for this functionality. If it must exist, it should be opposite since planes typically take off with their flaps deployed for lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-14T06:31:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
