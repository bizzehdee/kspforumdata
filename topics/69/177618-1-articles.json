Steam updated the game and it started no problem. I create a new sandbox game, and quickly\u00A0notice that my favourite fuel tank has disappeared\u00A0(The big orange fuel tank). The only way I can gain access\u00A0to that part and many more, is by loading a stock rocket that includes\u00A0the part I\u0027m looking\u00A0for.

The current equivalent is\u00A0Rockomax-64. It\u0027s stats are the same as the Jumbo 64. It has variant color schemes with one being orange.

The only\u00A0deprecated part that has different stats is the Mk1-2 pod that is inferior to the current Mk1-3 pod. I enabled it in my career at a earlier tech level than the Mk1-3 pod, but have only used it once or twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-17T13:47:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2018 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Tonka Crash\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-17T14:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll parts can be accessed by the advanced mode which is enabled by clicking the \u0027arrow\u0027 (3 vertical lines and a triangle) in the top left corner.
