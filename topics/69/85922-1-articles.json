The landing stage has 4 radial mount engines which makes the firing animation when throttled and it stands that they make 120kN trust each, but the ship experiences no acceleration whatsoever. Anyone had this bug, and better yet fixed it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: The engines point down into the rover. In the real world, this would result in the expelled fuel bouncing back from the rover and actually giving a net trust the opposite way. Does the game detect that the engines hit the craft? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit 2: Jupp, that\u0027s it.
