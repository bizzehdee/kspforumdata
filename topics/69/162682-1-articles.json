Do you have more than one installed in your machine? Have you disabled all but one of them?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso sounds like the resolution is not supported by your card/monitor. You could try resetting the settings file so that KSP will generate a new one with valid resolutions and back to default.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry going into the KSP directory and renaming or deleting the settings.cfg file. When you first start KSP it will regenerate this file with the default/valid settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
