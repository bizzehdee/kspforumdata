So if you hit Enter to save, it will actually NOT save.\n\nNow this sounds like a minor thing, but this is actually a critical issue. Hitting that key is always mapped to actually save in all games and programs, and no one will go check and/or notice that it was not saved. I and (according to Reddit \u0026 co) many other people have lost countless hours of progress to this issue, ending in frustration and possibly abandoning the game all together, because of a simple miss-mapping.\n\nIt would be great if you could prioritize that issue in your bug-list."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T21:09:23Z","Content":"**[MOD - Moved to** [**Support (unmodded installs)**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/76-Support-%28unmodded-installs%29) **subforums.**\n\n**We also have** [**another subforum dedicated to modded installs**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/77-Support-%28modded-installs%29)**.]**"}]}
