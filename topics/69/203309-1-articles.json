Everything seems to be working again now, but I hardly dare play in case they do something else to it and it wrecks my save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I hate automatic updates, they break things with no warning.\u00A0 Please give us the option to turn off automatic updates, there is no way to do that on Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have now copied the game to a different drive that Steam doesn\u0027t know about and will try playing it from there, in the hope that it will stop Steam/Squad messing with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
