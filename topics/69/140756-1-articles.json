I can only assume that it is causing my GPU to crash, as I can still hear the game running in the background, I just can\u0027t see anything. I am then forced to hard reset my computer. This happens every time I run KSP 1.1.2, it has never happened with previous versions or with other games. This is a clean install with no mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutput.log: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/5BUqKtBt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/5BUqKtBt\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndxdiag: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/8ZGKrPMA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/8ZGKrPMA\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
