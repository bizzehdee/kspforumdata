If you are amenable, we can go through a few things to get you started. However, I must request that vitriol stays out of it; it is entirely unwarranted, and directing rage at people on these forums will get you nowhere fast. If you want help, we\u0027re happy to help. However, we\u0027re not punching bags, so I must request you withhold any attacks."}]}
