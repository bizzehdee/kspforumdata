I saw there was a long dead post from 2016 about this but it\u0027s happening again and not just once in a while. It happens to all unmanned rovers. I can\u0027t seem to find any rhyme or reason as to when they vanish but it happens relatively quickly, usually with 15 minutes of me stop using it. I\u0027ve left them with brakes on and with the wheels put in so I know they aren\u0027t rolling off. Any thoughts?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-06T08:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince no-one has recognized it exactly, I\u0027ll make some guesses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are options in the main-menu settings \u0027tidy up KSP\u0027 and \u0027maximum persistent debris\u0027 that would make KSP remove unattended craft, but only if they end up categorized as \u0027debris\u0027 (with the empty-tank symbol in tracking station and map screen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are on PC, the file \u0027KSP.log\u0027 will contain some explanation of why the rovers were removed \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027too many vessels in scene: removing \u0026lt;vessel-name\u0026gt;\u0027 if it was due to those debris\u00A0settings,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027\u0026lt;vessel-name\u0026gt; destroyed by pressure\u0027\u00A0 for things that it re-enters the atmosphere unattended.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0027Console\u0027 dialog box that opens with the alt-F12 key on PC (and some traditional \u0027cheat-mode\u0027 input sequence on console) also shows these messages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
