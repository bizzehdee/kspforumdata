I use maneuver nodes to plan a synchronous orbit to Minmus and everything goes fine initially, until my probe enters Minmus\u0027s sphere of influence. At that point, I get this weird trajectory, as though I am still under Kerbin\u0027s gravitational influence and Minmus has no effect on my craft. Below are pictures to illustrate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I am approaching an orbit to Minmus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1XXqpu4l.png\u0022 alt=\u00221XXqpu4l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I supposedly enter Minmus\u0027s orbit, I get these weird trajectories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/98QoYS0l.png\u0022 alt=\u002298QoYS0l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe control centre labels my position as \u0022On escape trajectory out of minmus\u0022, which makes sense given my trajectory path, however Minmus has NO gravitational pull on my craft whatsoever. I tried burning retro at the periapsis of the blue trajectory: hat didn\u0027t produce a stable orbit around Minmus and only affected the escape trajectory when I enter Kerbin\u0027s influence again (the other end of the blue line). I even tried crashing my craft into Minmus, it just travelled in a straight line until it impacted, as though the moon had absolutely no influence over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm running 32bit KSP v0.90.0.705 beta, the latest version as of this post on windows 8.

Minmus does have quite low gravity, so you have to slow down considerably to get a stable orbit around it. If the projected future path is changing, you\u0027re definitely affecting your velocity, so there\u0027s no reason you shouldn\u0027t be able to get a stable orbit. It may be that you\u0027re simply not changing your velocity enough for the orbit to be stable -- Minmus orbits have extremely low speeds compared to Kerbin or the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust from a glance at the screenshot, though, if you\u0027re burning in that orientation, you\u0027re not burning retro -- the pink triangles are normal/anti-normal and essentially change the angle you orbit at, but burning normal/anti-normal won\u0027t get you a stable orbit. Of course, I could be wrong, you might have just happened to have that orientation when taking the screenshot, but just to make sure -- the retrograde icon is the green circle with an X through it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-11T01:31:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thanny","CreatedById":110623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T01:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have no mods installed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wangmaster","CreatedById":135089,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T03:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurns out everything is fine, I just didnt burn enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help anyway\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
