I can\u0027t seem to delete the profile or reset anything regarding to the joystick. When I open the joystick in the device manager I can see that it\u0027s working by testing everything in the properties. I\u0027ve spent hours trying to figure this out, and haven\u0027t found anything pertinent to my situation. Please help me out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
