Showing the temperature (F11) indicates no heat issue at all."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:19:54Z","Content":"That\u0027s an annoying bug involving parts with low mass. They spontaneously explode. \n\nThey explode even more if clipped."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:12:02Z","Content":"This one tends to bite me when I use warp in the atmosphere. There used to be an issue with the physics tic that heating would explode the part before the cooling part of the tic happened, may be related to that."},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T06:23:18Z","Content":"I had this problem too. I had a battery pack directly under the probe and it was overheating and exploding every time. I conducted a few tests and found that if I moved the battery pack further away from the probe the exploding stopped. Not sure if moving it away does actually help but in my case it did."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T11:44:55Z","Content":"Press alt-F12-\u003EPhysics-\u003EThermal\n\nLower conductivity factor until the problem stops. \n\nIt doesn\u0027t happen for me using Deadly Reentry, which sets conductivityFactor to 3.3, so you should be ok at least that low.

I had a mission to Moho all planned out in Career mode and it was ready to start heading for Moho but of course a load of stuff started overheating before I was even out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. \n\nI\u0027m sure this happens to small parts and happens even more if there\u0027s stuff clipped into that part, even if it\u0027s meant to be clipped, like docking ports and how their model naturally clips into the parent part. This happens the most with the short Rockomax adapter, but I\u0027ve also seen it happen with 1.25 fairing bases and cargo bays. (My Moho mission was a combination of these three all attached to each other x\\_x)\n\nI shouldn\u0027t have to resort to changing the game\u0027s physics or using the cheat menu in order to play the game properly, I hope this gets fixed in 1.1."}]}
