It won\u0027t even move pass 0.2 m/s which is abysmal for a small less than 10 ton rover that is only supposed to hold 4 kerbals which main mass is the mk2 lander can and the mk1 crew cabin and 2 small BG cargo containers. Even when converted to docking mode with controlled from the docking port the steering just doesn\u0027t work at all. Not to mention that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and Wheel Authority are put to zero. I had no problem driving it on the Mun before when testing. I even did research on how cars are designed to not flip etc. Am I doing something wrong or is the game just trying to be a dick to me? Bugs like these are a killer for me when trying to do anything in the game even with the parts doing the intended purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.instagram.com/p/ClwqYcKJ2O-/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.instagram.com/p/ClwqYcKJ2O-/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-05T00:55:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2022 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by CaptWhitmire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-05T09:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to the main menu settings, re-bind the wheel controls to the arrows not WASD so they don\u2019t clash with attitude control, then enable advanced tweakables.
