Of course, I installed the latest drivers from Nvidia right away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut (sad trumpet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game systematically crashes badly during load screen, about halfway through the progress bar. When I say \u0022crashes badly\u0022, I mean it instantly cuts power to the motherboard and restarts after a few seconds. From the POST screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I downloaded the latest game version from KSP\u0027s website (version ID in the launcher is 2152), and things remain the exact same. I changed the graphics settings to \u0022Minimum\u0022, just to see if a rewrite of the config file would make things better, but it doesn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny idea what\u0027s going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: I\u0027m playing vanilla KSP. I do have Avast anti-virus on at all times, although in gaming \u0022silent\u0022 mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-13T12:39:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2018 12:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Kebral\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epost-scriptum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kebral","CreatedById":181028,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T12:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhem... okay well, sorry but I just answered my own question. Deactivating Avast did the trick. But I believe it could still be useful to those who get into the same sort of trouble, because it isn\u0027t intuitive that Avast should make your computer cold restart because of some game incompatibility. At least it\u0027s my opinion. And how could updating graphics hardware cause such a weird change in behavior? Whatever. My KSP works!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
