This normally resides in memory during a game, and copies of that data are written to the .sfs save file. Loading a save file writes that data back into memory so that you can continue where you left off. This particular bug is caused by the data that is still in memory not being updated when the training save is loaded. The level of the buildings affects the options that are available to the player. The workaround is as the others say -\u00A0Either restart the game and go straight to the training session, or load another save that has fully upgraded buildings before going to the training sessions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis bug has been reported and has been fixed in the Pre-Release version as part of our feature addition and maintenance program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
