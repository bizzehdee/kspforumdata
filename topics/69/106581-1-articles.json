A test build I\u0027d put on the launchpad had 4 container brackets (from kerbal inventory system) attached to the inside with containers on the brackets. Attaching no less than a dozen struts between the service bay and external components doesn\u0027t do anything to fix the problem. More often than not, it explodes on the launchpad the moment the physics loads. If it decides to not explode on the pad, then it launches and flies around just fine.\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7133201/Station%201.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7133201/Station%201.craft)\n\nRequires Karbonite and Kerbal Inventory System\n\nEdit - Opening the service bay doors when it\u0027s vibrating, but hadn\u0027t yet exploded the craft, seems to have an effect?
