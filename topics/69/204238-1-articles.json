I tried going into the program files and opening from the launcher, which worked but when the game opened all of the menu options\u00A0text had changed to a bunch of alphanumeric gibberish. When I bring up my Steam library and select KSP the button says \u0027INSTALL\u0027 instead of\u00A0 \u0027PLAY\u0027 even though it still shows my hundreds of hours played.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-06T16:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a corrupted Steam install. Try verifying the game files (right click KSP in your Steam library \u0026gt; Properties \u0026gt; Local files \u0026gt; Verify integrity of local files) and if that doesn\u0027t fix it, uninstall and reinstall KSP- remember to copy your saves from KSP/saves/your_save_name(s) to somewhere else e.g. desktop so they don\u0027t also get deleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
