It\u0027s not supposed to do that, the fairing is not supposed to decouple ever. It kind of ruins the immersion if the not separating fairing separates. This didn\u0027t happen in 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:14:02Z","Content":"Ahh. I\u0027m going to guess this is how the interstage shielding bug was fixed. I\u0027m guessing that fairings now break apart so that the unshielding code gets triggered."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T02:52:16Z","Content":"Any updates on this? I have a retrieval module that uses fairings as a heat shield and the fairing releases itself when I decouple the docking port from my space plane. Guess I\u0027ll find out if the shield is really needed."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:53:20Z","Content":"Sorry to tell you this but this is the way they were made to work, the only workaround would be via the use of addons to change the behaviour.\n\nThreads such as these are better as Suggestions in [**the Suggestions and Development Discussion forum**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion) or as Requests in [**General Addon Affairs**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/19-General-Add-on-Affairs), rather than as requests for support or as bug reports, as there is not really any support we can offer, nor is this a bug.\n\nJust please try to remember that fairings, just like solar panels, are extremely fragile and the slightest knock by another vessel, even a separated lander or EVA kerbal, will break them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T13:02:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"}]}
