I turned off Steam cloud sharing\u00A0 and reinstalled, thinking maybe it had something to do with my gamesave file (Steam installs any game save that have been previously associated with your account by default). The game works now. I will now have to start a new save but oh well, I hope this may serve as a warning to anyone who tries modding without knowing what they\u0027re doing lol. There may be a way to repair my old save but it\u0027s whatever, I had about 100 hours played total, and they were all on that career save, so I wasn\u0027t TOO far into the game, just getting ready for my first interplanetary missions. So on the bright side, now I can restart with the knowledge I just learned from that first 100, without making all the same mistakes early on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo before you even say \u201CBSoD is related to your computer, not KSP,\u201D I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t believe that. So here\u2019s my full story and I\u2019m hoping to get some help. I recently tried modding my game, only added a few (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, Engineer Redux, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. I tried playing and my game was getting some bad artifacts (it had never had a single problem before), so I uninstalled all the mods and tried to start the game again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon restarting, as the bar on the loading screen got full, my game crashed. It closes, I try to open again, and I get a BSoD with a \u201CDriver Power State Failure\u201D code. I have tried EVERYTHING involving my drivers for every single thing on my laptop, I even paid for a premium driver service to be sure I could fix the problem. Nothing has worked. Every time I open the game, it crashes before changing from the loading screen, and shortly after causes a BSoD even if I don\u2019t try to open it again. I have ran other games, stress tests, benchmarks, etc. for hours without a problem. No temp issues. I\u2019ve recently repaired/upgraded this laptop, and I feared I may have damaged the GPU when applying new thermal paste. But as I\u2019ve said every other game runs perfectly well, I\u2019ve done stress tests using multiple different softwares, and I haven\u2019t had a single issue. My computer is actually running much, much better. I have a GTX 1060 6GB laptop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u2019ve also read it could relate to leftover mod files which I thought was definitely going to be the issue, but I\u2019ve done clean installs multiple times, (deleted all the files from Steam and redownloaded), and the problem is still occurring. I\u2019d really love to get this issue fixed as KSP is the only game I want to play at this moment lol. And again, if you\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s not related to KSP, I appreciate you trying to help, but I simply don\u2019t understand how it could be anything else. I also recently modified my .sfs file, and I\u2019ve read of other people having stability issues after doing that.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatt\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-09T23:17:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2022 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by jorenmatt3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
