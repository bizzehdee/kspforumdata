I\u0027d like to be able to fly aircraft in KSP much as I would in a flight simulator, at least with regard to directional controls, with a joystick. However, when I go into the Settings screens, none of the jopystick axis settings sections work. I suspect that the problem may be a lack of suitable software in my Linux install, but on searching Synaptic for the word \u0027joystick\u0027 there\u0027s such a plethora of options that I\u0027m unsure as to which to select for the best. \n\n KSP version: 1.04 Linux, 64 bit OS: Linux Mint 17.1 a fresh install (literally - this is a new (to me) refurbished PC) aside from addition of XFce desktop, VLC media player, removal of Thunderbird email and addition of Claws email and Sysinfo.

I thought sudo gave one the root access one needed anyway. What\u0027s particularly puzzling to me is that earlier I was able to get the joystick working with Flightgear fine - I was bodding around some airfields in Californioa in an ultralight and a Mitsubishi A6M with no problems at all. Doesn\u0027t that mean that the OS knows the joystick is there? (Added in edit - I had to put HTML break tags to make things more readable!
