You could try opening up the log file using ALT\u002BF2 and seeing if there are a lot of entries streaming by.\n\nOther than that, we would actually need to see your logs, pictures, or something else to help clue us in as to what might be the issue. If you need help finding that stuff, the info can be found in the sticky in this forum.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T14:07:55Z","Content":"I might report back on this soon. But it seemed that the 1.0.4 patch fixed the problem. I remember this behavior happening with a large number of radiator panels in the editor. With any other parts it seems to be fine."}]}
