I cannot for the life of me get the game to run for more than 30-60 seconds before crashing to desktop. It does not matter if I stay on the main menu or rush through and get a rocket on the launchpad, it always crashes. I have tried verifying local files, and have gone as far as to completely delete the KSP folder and have Steam install it in a different library on a different drive with the same results. This issue is 100% reproducible for me, and I have yet to actually play.\n\nI\u0027m unsure how to post one of my dozens of crash logs, as this forum says \u0022You may not post attachments\u0022 and the text is too long for a single post. If needed, I\u0027ll break it up into several posts. Thanks for any assistance you can provide!"},{"CreatedByName":"Pravus_Obzen","CreatedById":133425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T08:12:11Z","Content":"I am also having the same problem!
