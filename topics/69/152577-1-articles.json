Because of it, my car is turning (which is normal if we consider those aerodynamical pertubation) but i\u0027ve already check thousand of times and rebuild the car, always using the symetrical thing but the problem still here even with no difference betwenn my left and right side.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a bug, i\u0027m happy to contribute to the good devellopement of the game, if it\u0027s my fault thank you for telling me what\u0027s wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor informations i\u0027m running KSP 1.2.1.1604 on a laptop with Intel core i5 processor and a nvidia GEFORCE 710m\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/NP5yy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/NP5yy\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(screenshots)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s5c5vbwadjvr4k/Report%20bug.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7s5c5vbwadjvr4k/Report bug.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(my save)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ctyxi70lcyou85h/Roulade.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ctyxi70lcyou85h/Roulade.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(the vessel)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T12:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Antoinebernadet, I have move this to technical support, though I can say it is not aerodynamic drag causing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aero overlay is not reliable, and does not always show all the lines or lines of the right size, instead please try using the debug screen (alt\u002BF12 on Windows) to enable the aero data in the action menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey reveal there is the same drag from the wheels on both sides, or even more drag on the left side, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/MjiTq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eas can be seen here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour car behaves better with no wings, or with struts to brace the wings so they don\u0027t bend, but the reason it moves to the right is because the runway is a slight camber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is like this because the ground at the space center is completely flat, but the center is not by the runway, it is by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, so the runway is like a very flat U shape, and gravity pulls you slightly to the side towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your car stays straight it is fine, even if it has drifted, but if it turns the aerodynamics of the wings can make it turn more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Antoinebernadet","CreatedById":171894,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T16:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your quick answer, happy with your explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
