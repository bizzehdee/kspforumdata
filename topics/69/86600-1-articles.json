Well without knowing specifics of your setup, I would have to ask you to check out this thread and give us a bit more details: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could be several ways to fix this, but the bottom line is that 0.25 renamed many of the part files. So you probably used Steam or the patcher to get the update. In which case you\u0027ll have to (as a minimum) delete the contents of the GameData directory. Then reinstall or (if you are using steam) verify the game cache. This should fix the part problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the save files, I would need more info (from the link above). And maybe even post a save file on mediafire or pastebin for us to download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kaora","CreatedById":83018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T12:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for the answer going to check that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
