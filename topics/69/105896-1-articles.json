And when it came to the point where I needed the chutes, only 1 of the chutes fired. The other was \u0022in the cargobay\u0022 according to the game. Opening the bay allowed me to fire the other chute.\n\nI\u0027ve uploaded the craft here for reference:\n\n[http://daid.eu/~daid/ToErr.craft](http://daid.eu/~daid/ToErr.craft)"}]}
