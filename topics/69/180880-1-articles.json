I realize certain parts need to be placed first. However, as I am a new player I am not sure if this is how the game has always worked, or if it is a bug new to the latest \u0022Making History 1.6.0\u0022 expansion. It seems strange that you have to \u0022clear the board\u0022 of parts at times and random extra command pods\u00A0end up floating on the screen without having ever been placed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChris\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-26T02:10:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2018 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Stonc024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ehad to rename control modules command pods / removed computer info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T07:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/r9FFYNO.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:384px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 alt=\u0022r9FFYNO.jpg\u0022\u003EI have not seen nor heard of any bug that sounds like you describe. \u00A0There were not any changes with version 1.6 in how you assemble craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t quite imagine what trouble you are having, but I\u0027ll take a guess that is likely wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany people \u003Cu\u003Eexpect\u003C/u\u003E to drag with the mouse (mouse-button-1 down, move, then release the button) but in KSP you don\u0027t drag things, rather you click them once to pick them up, then move the mouse, and click again to place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts\u00A0turn green when they are in an attachable place on\u00A0the craft.\u00A0If you put them down elsewhere, they become transparent, and red when the mouse is over them, but there is no need to clean them up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T10:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking\u00A0 \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162784-ohara/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162784\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162784-ohara/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@OHara\u003C/a\u003E may be right here with the screenshot however if you could provide a picture too it would enable more members to help you with this issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T17:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Technical Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
