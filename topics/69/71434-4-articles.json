One docking port is the parent (whose number is relatively easy to find). For step 5c, you need to determine the \u0022child\u0022 docking port. This is a bit tricky because nowhere in the save file does it explicitly tell you what number a part is. If you have another part attached to the child docking port (such as a fuel tank), you can go look at that fuel tank and it will tell you its parent number. Assuming the docking port is the parent of the fuel tank, that would tell you what part number the docking port is. It can be rather difficult to figure out what a particular part\u0027s number is if you are unfamiliar with looking at saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t tried it already, I would highly recommend that you use the \u0022super quick and dirty\u0022 instructions.
