I reverted to the VAB. After this some of the parts were missing, so I reloaded the craft save. I am now not able to use the VAB at all, the staging is acting as if I do not have anything attached to the root node and I am not able to select any parts either existing or new. Importing the craft file into a different save does not fix the issue.\n\nI have no mods, and I am running Windows 7 x64. KSP Ver 1.0.4.861 \n\nI have had issues with overlapping parts crashing the VAB before, this seems to be something different. \n\nHere is a screenshot of the issue as I am seeing it in the VAB. \n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=468667565](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=468667565)\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:03:31Z","Content":"Hi Semicon, please upload your craft file to dropbox ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Semicon","CreatedById":118137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T23:46:51Z","Content":"Thanks man,\n\nhere is the link;\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/nykm20nzb0js6cj/Saturn%205.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nykm20nzb0js6cj/Saturn%205.craft?dl=0)"}]}
