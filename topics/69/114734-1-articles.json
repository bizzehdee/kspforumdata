I know it\u0027s Steam.\n\nI lost one craft to this already in this game, started after the 1.0 patch. This time it showed portraits ( prior loss was a probe ) so I EVA\u0027d someone causing the game to crash. The previous time it didn\u0027t crash, just deleted the craft and made all screens black until I force closed the exe from task manager.\n\nI\u0027m really not keen on having to use a 3rd party file storage service just to host crash reports your forums should allow me to attach, OR an in game reporting system? Not to be a .... but I\u0027d imagine you\u0027d have a lot more of these reports if we could just post em here instead of having to screw around for an hour signing up for 3rd party services to tie in here."}]}
