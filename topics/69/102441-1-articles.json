Testing a mailsail on escape trajectory out of Kerbin is not an insignificant challenge if you dont use said mainsail to reach the escape velocity.\n\nIf its a \u0027right-click run test\u0027 style contract then obviously you can use the engines. If its a \u0027activate through staging\u0027 style contract then you can still light the engines as long as you right click to activate and dont stage till you get where you need to be.\n\nAs mentioned it also doesnt need to thrust, which is why \u0027test x landed on kerbin\u0027 is free money, just stick the engine direct to a probe core, launch, spacebar, recover.\n\nI also fell for this one and accepted the \u0027test ion thruster\u0027 so that i would get early access to it, then realised i had no xenon. I actually researched the node to fill the contract because i didnt know about the \u0027no thrust needed\u0027 bit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T13:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem**"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:41:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If its a \u0027activate through staging\u0027 style contract then you can still light the engines as long as you right click to activate and don\u0027t stage till you get where you need to be.\n\nYou can also re-stage the engine by putting it in a stage above the current one (you can even create a new stage on the fly for this purpose), which will also fulfill the contract."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T00:00:02Z","Content":"Moved to Support, so the right people can see it."},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T00:59:16Z","Content":"I just completed that one ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ... on a sub orbital trajectory.\n\nKnowing i dont have the fuel yet, but we did try without and succeeded.,"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T04:10:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Indeed, this is a very useful loophole.
