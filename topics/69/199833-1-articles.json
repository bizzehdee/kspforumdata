I wanted to\u00A0start a new, Career, game. Started okay, but after my first mission, when I obtained fuel and engines, I tried adding an FL-T100 Fuel to a MK1 Command capsule. The fuel tank disappeared and the game froze, I couldn\u0027t even exit until I clicked \u0027New\u0027, then exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI resumed and with more missions using the RT-5 Flea, I\u00A0acquired additional fuel options. I\u00A0tried the FL-T200, but same problem. Oddly, I can start with a fuel tank and add a capsule, then re-root to the capsule, but adding a 2nd fuel tank (it disappears) causes the game to freeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advise would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, David\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-26T13:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157562-drburns650/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157562\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157562-drburns650/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@drburns650\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0continue to reroot for now, I\u0027ll mention it to a dev friend of mine, and I also say report it in the bugtracker.
