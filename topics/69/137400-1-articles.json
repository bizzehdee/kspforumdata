They range from not moving if clipped or rotated off center to bouncing and causing chaos.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example my tank in 1.0.5 had the wheels slightly clipped. It used to get up to about 22 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn 1.1 the same tank won\u0027t move an inch. However if i go and fix the wheels so they don\u0027t clip it will move but it consumes so much electric charge that it gets a max speed of 5-8 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Unless a moderater says other wise my advice would be just to play around with other things like rockets or maybe planes until all this gets fixed. If not i would say go back to 1.0.5 until it gets resolved\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you use mods Kerbal Foundaries is working on updating to 1.1 and their makers has stated they got their tank tracks working so when they release their 1.1 version it may make for a good temporary fix. That is assuming they beat Squad to fixing the problem\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T17:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are indeed bouncing and causing chaos. Wasn\u0027t this the point of pre-release? (Not that I\u0027m angry, just a little annoyed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
