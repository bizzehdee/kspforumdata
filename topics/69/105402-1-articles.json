In previous versions I\u0027ve seen it work the way you describe (i.e. CoL marker would be right above CoM for capsules). Maybe it\u0027s because Iwas using FAR.

And in the VAB, air flows directly down from the top. So it can be rather sensitive to surfaces that are turned.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
