I can\u0027t see any hint in the part config file. Any expert advice?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mythos","CreatedById":137308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T09:35:05Z","Content":"In the KIS thread I was given a fix: [https://github.com/mongoose11235813/CommandSeatIconFix/releases/tag/0.1](https://github.com/mongoose11235813/CommandSeatIconFix/releases/tag/0.1)\n\nJust download the DLL and put it into your GameData folder."}]}
