I have a couple stations\u00A0orbiting both the Mun and Minimus, as well as some rovers and relay satellites. I was prepping for a trip to Eve when the game suddenly started experiencing a number of glitches. The first: The game seems to think that I\u0027m clicking on things multiple times extremely rapidly. For example, clicking on the \u0022add an orbit\u0022 button in maneuvers clicks the button about 10 times a second until I click away at something else (you can see why this is an issue). The same goes for any other click button or menu such as clicking action groups or navigating the R\u0026amp;D facility. The second: The game will occasionally decide to up my time warp from 5X to the maximum speed (10000X?) for no apparent reason. This may be related to the first but it is a recurring issue. I can\u0027t find any other advice online or anyone who has experienced this issue as well. I also tried to uninstall and reinstall the game, but the problem persists. Please help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-17T09:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf multi-clicking everything \u0026amp; uninstalling the \u00A0game didn\u2019t change anything, then it\u00A0could be\u00A0your mouse rather than game.
