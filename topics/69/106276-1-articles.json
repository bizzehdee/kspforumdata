Nothing new, right?\n\nWell, 3 times now, when I crash the plane, the game \u0022crashes\u0022 but doesn\u0027t actually crash. It freezes, with the explosion sound on a small loop. Very loud, very annoying, and I have to force KSP to close, which means no crash log. When I get home I will try and replicate it again, and post the Output log, but as for now I just have the story.\n\nThis also slows down my computer for a while, whilst it tries to figure out what\u0027s hogging all its memory. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
