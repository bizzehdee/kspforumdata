Targeting objects is not course-plotting, therefore is not always relevant to maneuvers.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI recommend starting a fresh career game with this in mind, as it could dramatically change how you spend those precious few kerbal bucks you get when you first set out. Take it slow and scrutinize your available options for maximum preferred gains.\u00A0Milking science data and ore mining exploits can become quite lengthy, or repetitive and boring.
