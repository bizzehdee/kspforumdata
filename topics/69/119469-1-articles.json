I\u0027ve had luck with HyperEdit in the past. The trick is, don\u0027t control the ship. Once the game has trouble with that sort of thing load up Hyperedit while controlling a different ship, select your buggy ship in the drop down, select \u0022orbit\u0022, and then put in the orbital parameters you want. Once you exit out of that, your ship should work fine. I\u0027ve saved several stations as recently as this month with that method.
