Never before had I experienced constant slow frame rate. I have had low frame rate before when firing massive rockets off, but not like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI accidentally deleted a (and my only) save file in the game, so I had to restart. When I created a new game, as soon as I loaded it, it was very laggy. I was around 18 fps. I went to build a rocket, and launched it. It was literally the smallest, most basic rocket you could build. When it launched, I was running at 15.5 FPS. I kept playing, hoping that it would stop lagging out, but it didn\u0027t. I got some more parts, made a slightly bigger rocket, and entered orbit. I was on my last stage with a little fuel so I could get back, and I was running 12.2 FPS. That never has happened before, and I don\u0027t know why it is happening now. I tried quitting KSP and relaunching it, still did it. I quitted Steam all together, relaunched it, opened up KSP, and it still had terrible frame rate. I don\u0027t know why this is either. There are no mods in the GameData folder, and no other save files. I didn\u0027t recently download any giant games or software onto my computer either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the strange thing is, when I zoom out enough so my spacecraft isn\u0027t in view, it can run at up to 62 FPS. If the sun is in my view I can get speeds of 33 FPS. When I am in map view, most of the time, it ran about 66 FPS. It seems only to go really low when you can see my craft.\u00A0Why is this happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Computer Specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacBook Pro - 13 inch\u00A0late 2011 (yes I realize it is an old computer but like I said, it was running amazingly before).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS - 10.10.5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcessor - 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemory - 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraphics - Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-31T16:50:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2015 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nickrulercreator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T20:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes your computer only have the one card?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaptops often have an integrated (low performance) card and a dedicated (high performance) card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be that KSP is defaulting to the integrated card, this is typically caused by the laptop being in power saver mode.
