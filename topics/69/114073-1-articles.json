It was a fresh install and no mods or anything. I have a decently powerful gaming PC so yeah. In my 0.90 install I had the settings default and it ran fine. I had been playing 0.90 and 1.0 on and off, but I had 1.0 uninstalled (who knows why.) and just installed it. Now if I try to go into 0.90 and play it still does the exact same thing.\n\nSPECS:\n\nProcessor: AMD FX(tm\\_-4300 Quad-core Processor\n\n3.80ghZ\n\nRAM: 8.00GB\n\nThats all, and if need I will provide a log. Then again this was a fresh install and I ran the game for 2 seconds on startup. I also tried reinstalling many times and it just won\u0027t do the trick.\n\nThanks for the help! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) -Myself"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:04:09Z","Content":"You need to provide logs."},{"CreatedByName":"NasaSpace101","CreatedById":140410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:38:35Z","Content":"Here it is.\n\n[https://jumpshare.com/v/2PIV9tABExtT73eSycC2?b=hcYqSmIc1omdrWqQOMBw](https://jumpshare.com/v/2PIV9tABExtT73eSycC2?b=hcYqSmIc1omdrWqQOMBw)\n\nNot on dropbox because I was being lazy."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:42:16Z","Content":"Hmm, it looks like your graphics driver is not installed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E GfxDevice: creating device client; threaded=1\n\u003E Direct3D:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Version: Direct3D 9.0c [d3d10warp.dll 6.3.9600.17415]\n\u003E \n\u003E  Renderer: Microsoft Basic Render Driver\n\u003E \n\u003E  Vendor: Microsoft\n\u003E \n\u003E  VRAM: 256 MB (via DXGI)\n\nYou can get [**Nvidia drivers here**](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us), [**AMD drivers here**](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download) and[**Intel drivers here.**](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)"},{"CreatedByName":"NasaSpace101","CreatedById":140410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T15:55:55Z","Content":"Oh ok, thanks alot."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T16:02:23Z","Content":"No probs, oh and you might need to reboot after installing, to make sure the driver works properly."},{"CreatedByName":"NasaSpace101","CreatedById":140410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T02:05:40Z","Content":"Ok so now when I tried, for some odd reason the drivers didn\u0027t install even with my the driver CDs.\n\nHow can I explain this?"},{"CreatedByName":"NasaSpace101","CreatedById":140410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:15:37Z","Content":"Nevermind I got it working.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T04:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 04:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NasaSpace101**"}]}
