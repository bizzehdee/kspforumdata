If the tracking station is turned really low you won\u0027t get much of a signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes your probe have a direct line of sight to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E? Unless the antenna has an unbroken straight line between it and the tracking station (or any other ground station if you have them switched on) you won\u0027t get a signal. You\u0027ll need to put some relays in place which can receive signals from both the probe and a ground station, and by using more powerful relay dishes on the relays you can use a less powerful antenna on your probes, rovers, landers etc. which are cheaper and smaller too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a scenario that has an example communications network in the game, it has some useful pointers in it but you don\u0027t have to build your network like that and there are many other ways of doing it. How many relays you need round any particular planet or moon depends on what you\u0027re doing- if you\u0027re planning a large crewed expedition then it\u0027s good to have full comms coverage, likewise if you\u0027re running lots of rovers, but most of the time you can get by with one or two relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wait until you unlock some more powerful relay dishes e.g. RA-2 or RA-15 before launching interplanetary probes, you can make them double as relays once they\u0027ve got all the science they can; the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is doing the same thing right now around Mars, it\u0027s a science probe but it also doubles as a signal relay. By the time you unlock the good relay dishes you should have all the science experiments unlocked too, so that probe can have ALL THE SCIENCE!!! instead of sending several different probes with newly unlocked experiments on them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way to improve a relay network, particularly around other planets, is to put a really powerful relay on the same orbit as the planet but slightly ahead or behind, it\u0027s difficult to do but well worth the effort. Put one relay around Kerbin at 90 degrees inclination and as high as you can, with the biggest relay dishes you can on it-\u00A0that will be your backup for when the Mun gets in the way of a direct link to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-11T21:51:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2020 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Artiom4ik24","CreatedById":186895,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-12T14:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your reply!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have extra ground stations enabled, range and DSN modifiers at 1.00.

You\u0027d need four RA-2s to have enough range when they\u0027re at their furthest from each other, and that\u0027s at maximum range which means low signal strength and I think that results in less science from transmitting experiment data home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single 15G relay dish has nearly double the range required to contact a level 3 ground station at maximum distance, so I suggest you wait until you unlock the RA-15 before going to Duna\u00A0and instead try to focus on Eve- Eve is almost always in range with a single RA-2 (so 2 will keep the signal strength high), you get more power from your solar panels that close to the Sun (whereas at Duna you get noticeably less) and you can aerobrake to a landing in one go, as long as you bring enough ablator on your heat shields! Alternatively you could focus on gathering all the science you can from Kerbin itself and/or the Mun and/or Minmus, which will complete the tech tree very rapidly even with the science gains turned down to 20% or even 10%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiagram came from here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022153808\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9631351688\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166349-antenna-range-diagram-stock-opm-jx2-gpp-gpo/\u0026amp;tab=comments\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3191097\u0026amp;embedComment=3191097\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3191097\u0022 style=\u0022height:298px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-12T20:33:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2020 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo fixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Artiom4ik24","CreatedById":186895,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-14T11:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very much!
