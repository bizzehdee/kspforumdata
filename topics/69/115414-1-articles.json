Place the attached .craft file into (KSP folder)/saves/(save folder)/Ships/VAB\n2. Open the attached .craft in the VAB\n3. Pick up a 2.5m nose cone from the Aerodynamics tab\n4. Hover the nose cone over the attach node on top of the exposed fuel tanks, but do not place it\n5. Press X (or symmetry-change button, if remapped) to change the symmetry mode\n\nMore information is available in [this bug report](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5221).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T19:22:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ChaoticWeg**\n  \nclose due to known issue"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:09:31Z","Content":"Hi ChaoticWeg, this has been known for some time now, there\u0027s no fix yet, please try to avoid changing symmetry when placing some parts."},{"CreatedByName":"ChaoticWeg","CreatedById":116721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:22:53Z","Content":"Thanks!
