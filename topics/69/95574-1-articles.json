It is most noticeable when everything is static and all the forces ought to balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 1: Take a stock Aeris 4A and park it on the sloping side of the runway. Engage the parking brake, wait for everything to settle and then physics warp - the plane will start to slide downhill. I got 0.5 m/s at x2, 1 m/s at x3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 2: Build and launch the following from the VAB: Stayputnik at the top, X200-32, docked pair of Clamp-O-Trons, another X200-32. Wait for it to settle and then physics warp - the upper Clamp-O-Tron will sink into the lower one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NQQqa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had these effects in other situations and in earlier versions of KSP. One time my Kerbal got out of his rover to get a photo of a Mun Arch - he used physics warp to walk there faster but was overtaken by the parked rover. I suspect that \u0022flapping wings\u0022 on a plane are related to the second example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two examples are static, so physics step size shouldn\u0027t be an issue (at x1 the net force is zero; at x2 the net force should be zero for 2 time units). So is this a bug, or is it a deliberate change to prevent explosions during physics warp? I would like to have parking brakes that work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
