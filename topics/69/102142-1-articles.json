I purchased the game using paypal I received conformation from both paypal and KSP that the payment was made and received. I went to the KSP site and started to download, but there were issues, this was Sunday night, I went to re-download it from my profile, but when I got to KSP and signed in my game was not in the purchased items area to download it. I messaged them Sunday, four times yesterday and I filed a claim with paypal. I just want a refund now. Online or not, they failed to keep their end of the contract and their customer service sucks."},{"CreatedByName":"Samssonart","CreatedById":57129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T17:29:01Z","Content":"Sorry rhidle, we haven\u0027t received any email messages in [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2f0a186d405f5b4640410a186b) , is it the address you sent them to?
