They do appear to be in my save game persistence file.\n\nI was attempting various contracts at the same time. I sent a probe to the Mun and rescued Corsen Kerman, who was stranded in orbit, and then landed Corsen for an EVA to collect science. An odd thing to note is that trying to produce a crew report errored with \u0022Crew Report requires the Mk1 Command Pod to be manned\u0022. This was with Corsen on board. (fyi I\u0027m not sure if engineers and scientists can also do crew reports and if Corsen is not a pilot). The probe then piloted the craft back to Kerbin and was recovered OK.\n\nI noticed at this point that none of my contracts were completed and I earned little money.\n\nMy contracts (IIRC) were to rescue Corsen, fly-by the Mun, collect science from space around Kerbin and I think collect science in some way from the Mun (surface sample.ect). I had other contracts but these were my goals for the mission.\n\nAfter some reading of the forum I backed up my save game directory (attached) and then restored my quicksave.sfs \u003E persistent.sfs\n\nThe save is immediately after rescuing Corsen while in orbit next to Corsen\u0027s Scrap. No contracts are visible in-game but they are documented in the persistence file.\n\nIf someone can help me restore my save game file that would be awesome. If you can fix the bug then doubly awesome!\n\nSave game folder and output\\_log.txt download link:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xndtnffhbqjsw1/Del_KSP_files.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xndtnffhbqjsw1/Del_KSP_files.zip?dl=0)\n\nI did launch and quit KSP a few times before making a copy of the output\\_log.txt. The saved game folder is immediately after the mission ended and I realised something was wrong. Also oddly my saved game was renamed to \u0027default\u0027 - this occurred several days ago though.\n\nLet me know if you need any more info\n\nThanks\n\nDel"}]}
