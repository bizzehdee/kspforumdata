But if you think it\u0027s linked to terrain scatter, have you tried turning off the scatter completely to see how it runs?\n\nAlso, if you could upload the output\\_log.txt, that might provide some extra clues. You can upload that to somewhere like pastebin, google docs, or dropbox and link it here.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"juvilado","CreatedById":106978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T20:20:20Z","Content":"[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3QGu7U-wjNpfndjM1dEcUdXZmVBZy1QVDZkc1JhR0l0c0gtc0F2ZjBxT0pIeTB6WHVMZnc\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3QGu7U-wjNpfndjM1dEcUdXZmVBZy1QVDZkc1JhR0l0c0gtc0F2ZjBxT0pIeTB6WHVMZnc\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nThis is the link of a folder with two error reports.
