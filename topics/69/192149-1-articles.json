Based on some Youtube videos and reading the wiki and elsewhere I installed pretty common mods: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbal Engineer Redux, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, NavyFish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator, and the Surface Lights mod. The game works fine in Career mode. Before starting Career I played through and completed all the Training scenarios including\u00A0Asteroid Redirect Part 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I would like to replay that scenario and it won\u0027t begin. All the others work when I press Start. For Asteroid Redirect Part 1, the Start button does nothing; it depresses and returns to normal when I release my mouse button, but nothing else happens. When I try to click or double-click on the name of the scenario and its green clipboard icon, the mouse clip goes through the window and instead activates the text behind, so I am continually being directed to the \u0022About Making History Expansion\u0022 website.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have restarted my computer and checked for Windows updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have moved the mods out of the KSP directory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, that training scenario won\u0027t begin again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat should I do now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-05T07:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022178.18\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 style=\u0022width:165px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u0022330\u0022 alt=\u0022Rhz6HRy.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Rhz6HRy.png\u0022\u003EI have not seen this problem, but I remember that the ARM scenarios are different to the others in that they cannot be saved and resumed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might try deleting the scenarios/ARM_Asteroid1/ directory, because on first install of KSP the scenarios directory has no subdirectories saving the state\u00A0of the (partially) completed scenarios.\u00A0 It looks like at right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, maybe your KSP.log will make the problem obvious.\u00A0 When I start the ARM scenario, my KSP writes to that file:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n[LOG 23:33:25.676] Loading banner texture from C:/KSP191/KSP_x64_Data/../saves/scenarios/banners/Refuel at Minmus.png\n\n[LOG 23:33:25.757] Loading banner texture from C:/KSP191/KSP_x64_Data/../saves/scenarios/banners/Space Station 1.png\n\n[LOG 23:33:26.013] Loading banner texture from C:/KSP191/KSP_x64_Data/../saves/scenarios/banners/Transmissions.png\n\n[LOG 23:33:26.095] Scenario #autoLOC_1200000 is non-resumable.\n\n[LOG 23:33:26.095] Scenario #autoLOC_1200000 is non-resumable.\n\n[LOG 23:33:28.121] Scenario #autoLOC_1200000 is non-resumable.\n\n[LOG 23:33:28.122] Scenario #autoLOC_1200000 is non-resumable.\n\n[LOG 23:33:34.474] Scenario #autoLOC_1200000 is non-resumable.\n\n[LOG 23:33:34.513] [KSPUpgradePipeline]: ARM_Asteroid1 updated from 1.2.0 to 1.9.1.\n\n[LOG 23:33:34.529] [ScenarioTypes]: List Created 21 scenario types loaded from 1 loaded assemblies.\n\n[LOG 23:33:34.530] [MessageSystem] Load Messages\n\n[LOG 23:33:34.560] Game State Saved to saves/scenarios/ARM_Asteroid1/persistent\n\n[LOG 23:33:34.594] [UIMasterController]: HideUI\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keithustus","CreatedById":203155,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-05T15:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223752134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192149\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221583394568\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OHara\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, OHara said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not seen this problem, but I remember that the ARM scenarios are different to the others in that they cannot be saved and resumed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might try deleting the scenarios/ARM_Asteroid1/ directory, because on first install of KSP the scenarios directory has no subdirectories saving the state\u00A0of the (partially) completed scenarios.\u00A0 It looks like at right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, maybe your KSP.log will make the problem obvious.\u00A0 When I start the ARM scenario, my KSP writes to that file:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I moved my scenario directory, renaming it from\u00A0Kerbal Space Program\\saves\\scenarios to\u00A0Kerbal Space Program\\saves\\scenarios-backup.
