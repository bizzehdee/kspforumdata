If you have a quicksave (or a named quicksave from pressing Alt\u002BF5) you can delete the persistent.sfs file (make a backup first just to be safe), copy the quicksave and rename the copy to persistent.sfs. \u00A0Then launch the game and you\u0027ll hopefully be able to load like normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T12:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like KSP was saving right when you closed it. If so, that means one of the saves are now corrupt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar to above, except I recommend moving (not deleting) the save directory first to verify that is the problem. Start first with the folder for the save you were playing. You also don\u0027t have to restart KSP, just leave it at the start menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP might also give you an error in the debug log, which you can bring up in the debug menu with either ALT\u002BF2 or\u00A0ALT\u002BF12 (windows). That might tell you which file fails, but I can\u0027t remember for sure off hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you confirm thw save, then replace the persistence.sfs with a quicksave as recommended above. I also recommend keeping copies of the save\u00A0incase you hit another issue and the save gets further messed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T13:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/65508-jebretary-automatic-version-control-backups-for-craft-and-saves-v040/\u0022\u003Ejebretary\u003C/a\u003E invaluable for this, it is a Git based versioning system which keeps a copy of *every* save, quicksave, craft, and subassembly you ever make so if anything happens short of deleting your game folder you can usually recover to a point not too far back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt won\u0060t help you now but it will prevent you suffering in the same way in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Notwal","CreatedById":150429,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T00:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for all your help, though nothing really worked.
