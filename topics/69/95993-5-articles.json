Unity itself is pretty good about not creating lots of garbage but various features of the Unity API do make it quite awkward (if not, downright impossible) for KSP (and mods) to do some things without creating unnecessary garbage though KSP and quite a lot of mods do also create quite a lot of other unnecessary garbage themselves that it should be quite easy to fix. In an ideal KSP, the turnover of memory would be low enough so that garbage collections could be deliberately triggered at key points where a frame rate glitch will not be noticeable (scene changes, switch to/from map view, pause game, save etc.) and it wouldn\u0027t need to run at any other times. This would be tricky to achieve but it should be quite easy to vastly reduce the rate of garbage collections from where it is now.\u003Cp\u003EThe GCMonitor mod (linked somewhere earlier in the thread) allows you to easily see the memory turnover and garbage collections happening. The rate of rise of the line should be much lower than it ever is at the moment, ideally it would only ever rise during flight when something does actually need to be allocated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, when this issue surfaced over a year ago a simple google search showed me it wa clearly a GC issue. I hadnt encountered it after a patch ages ago but it\u0027s definitely back with a vengeance now. 100% this is GC. those who build small craft may not encounter it.
