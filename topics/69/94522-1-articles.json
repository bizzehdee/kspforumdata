Compare that to 0.24 (which was the last version I played, as I had mods and stuff on that version and was too lazy to update to 0.25) which took about 2 minutes to load, even with about 13 mods installed! So I just wanted to post this to ask if others have had such drastic changes in the load times and if anyone might be able to help me out here.

So I might just have to deal with the long load times, as after that the game itself still runs fine for me.
