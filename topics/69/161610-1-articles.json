Now I\u0027m sure this is great for people with english, but for me using a danish layout, its gamebreaking since there isn\u0027t a backquote key on there. The only way for me to generate a backquote is to Shift \u002B \u00B4 and then hit enter. Needless to say this doesn\u0027t work in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to customize this, because the using an English Layout while playing presents even more issues. Please help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Nevermind, I just noticed an option to actually change hotkeys has been added at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-05T07:42:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2017 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Sokar408\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
