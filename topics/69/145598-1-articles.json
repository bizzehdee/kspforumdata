All seems fine but I am unable to assign my joystick functions. I can assign some of the buttons but it will not pick up the joystick itself. I have looked for previous solutions to this in the forums but nothing has been of any help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy OS is Windows 10 on a 64-bit machine with a GeForce GTX 960 graphics adapter. My joystick is a Logitech extreme 3-D pro which is still working with other games such as Microsoft FSX, xplane and Elite Horizons. Just in case I uninstalled to ensure the demo version was cleared from the system and reinstalled from scratch and I also ran the patcher to synchronise all files with the server so everything is totally up-to-date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave I missed something obvious?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone got any suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJulian\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T13:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, silly question but are you using the axis assignments on the right or the button assignments on the left?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Kerman","CreatedById":167522,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T17:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept for the hat, the buttons can be assigned it is the joystick axis movements (and the hat) that it fails to pick up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T18:06:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hat switch is actually treated as another pair of axis, rather than as buttons, so the hat can also only be bound to the axis bindings on the right hand side of the settings screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you calibrate the stick in Windows before starting KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Kerman","CreatedById":167522,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T21:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOMG, NOW I understand what you mean by the left and right side.
