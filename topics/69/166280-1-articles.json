I updated my password and it\u0027s still doing it. I remember seeing something in a post yesterday about something being broken from Squad but I don\u0027t remember where I saw it or what it is that\u0027s broken. If I am unable to update via the launcher how can I do it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nDisregard. Two seconds of research and I found my answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
