I\u0027ve had an terrible fail... I was editing an engine: The \u00A0LV-T45 when I stopped messing around and I go to the CFG and I put all the normal things but ocurred something terrible... \u00A0When I was going to play again KSP the LV-T45 says that the manufacter was \u0022Found lying by the side of the road\u0022 and also I\u0027ve can\u0027t attach the engine. It even says that the max thrust was 1000! So. Can someone do a copy of the engine for KSP 1.2.0 and convert it on a ZIP? Please. Well, if you check my account it appears the same thing in the Status of my account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T23:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Technical Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve accidentally munged a game file, generally what you need to do is to repair the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you bought it via Steam, there\u0027s a \u0022check local files\u0022 option via the Steam client, which will automatically spot the file that you munged and repair it for you-- doesn\u0027t require reinstalling the game or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you bought it via the KSP store, I think there\u0027s an option of some sort there, too, but since I haven\u0027t done that myself, not sure of the details-- perhaps someone else could chime in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Space Program wiki\u003C/a\u003E generally provides the .cfg file contents for each part, so for example, you can see the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineLV-T45/liquidEngineLV-T45.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELV-T45 config here\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Not sure how up-to-date it is, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the future:\u00A0 if you\u0027d like to tweak the parameters of KSP parts, you have a couple of options to protect yourself from this happening again.\u00A0 One of the simplest is to use ModuleManager, which is a very common mod that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of other mods bundle because they depend on it.\u00A0 It lets you add \u0022patch\u0022 config, which is applied to the stock config files at run time, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewithout actually modifying the original config files\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 This has several benefits.\u00A0 It means you can\u0027t accidentally munge your game.\u00A0 It means if you want to undo your changes, just delete your patch .cfg file.\u00A0 And if you have a set of patches that you like, they\u0027ll stay in place even when you update to a new KSP version (i.e. they don\u0027t get wiped out each time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nobodyhasthis2","CreatedById":154685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-20T01:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnark has got the answer 100% right here repair the game.

KSP does allow users to create multiple backups of the original game directory. Each\u00A0copy of the whole game will still run in the new location.
