I\u0027m on unmodded KSP Career mode\u00A0and got a rescue mission. The title says \u0027Rescue Jebediah from orbit of Kerbin\u0027 Already strange, since this is my first rescue mission on this save and Jebediah is alive and well. I click to see more details to find the white boldened text again mentions Jebediah, but the task list contains \u0027Save Desby Kerman\u0027 and \u0027Recover Desby Kernan\u00A0on Kerbin\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest issue is, no ship even appears in the tracking station! I have tracking ships turned on (as well as all other tracking options just to be safe) but nothing. At first I thought I needed to upgrade my tracking station, but pretty sure that\u0027s not a thing and that didn\u0027t work anyways. I don\u0027t like cancelling missions, or even declining them for that matter. Is there any way I can get around this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttached an image of my mission below:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/g83PS8D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/g83PS8D\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-25T09:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197656-croze/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022197656\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197656-croze/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Croze\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does\u00A0look\u00A0like a bug, seeing as the top line reads save Jebediah Kerman and the objective reads save Desby Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-25T11:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I\u0027d submit your save file and logs as a bug on the tracker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
