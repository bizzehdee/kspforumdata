Player has no control over the ship. In short: Any flight that is resumed after quitting the game is doomed.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\nStart new career (any mode), select difficulty and turn re-entry heat to zero. Go directly to the VAB and assemble a ship (I don\u0027t think this matters much, since it happened to me with several different ship configurations). Here\u0027s the ship I built:\n\n(from top-down)\n\nMk16 parachute\n\nMk1 Command Pod\n\nLV-T45 engine\n\nTR-18A Stack Decoupler\n\n----------------------\n\nUse anything to get that into orbit. For testing purposes I used:\n\nKerbodyne S3-7200 Fuel Tank\n\nS3-KS-25x4 Mammoth engine\n\n1. Get your ship into Kerbin orbit.\n\n2. Press the Escape Key and select Space Center\n\n3. Press the Escape Key and select Quit to Main Menu (and quit the game normally)\n\n4. Re-launch the game, resume your saved game, go to the Tracking Station, select your ship and click the \u0022Fly\u0022 button.\n\nImmediately upon loading your ship, the ship should begin to spin wildly out of control.\n\nHere is a short video of the bug:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH61g7qOTFQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T22:39:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Targa**"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T15:30:15Z","Content":"In order to test this, do I need to save the game manually or will it automatically save when I quit to the main menu?

From your video it doesn\u0027t appear that there are any phantom control inputs. Can you repeat the problem creating a new save? Do the first run, putting the ship in orbit and after you quit take a copy of the whole save folder and the output\\_log.txt file in KSP\\_Data. Then do the next run where the ship spins and after leaving it spinning for at least several seconds, quit back out of the game and copy the output\\_log.txt file again (as a different name). Then zip up all of that and upload it to a file sharing site (e.g. dropbox) and post a link. Then, we can take a look in the logs to see if there is any indication of a problem and we can try loading your save and see if we also get the spin..."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T18:30:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Mk16 parachute\n\u003E Mk1 Command Pod\n\u003E \n\u003E LV-T45 engine\n\u003E \n\u003E TR-18A Stack Decoupler\n\nDid you put an engine in without a fuel tank? I\u0027m recreating the ship right now but I think you missed a part.\n\nEDIT: From what I could make out in the video, I think you used the FL-T400 fuel tank.\n\nThe ship works fine for me upon reloading. Have you ever had any mods? Even if you\u0027ve uninstalled them?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T19:06:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"Targa","CreatedById":116596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T21:36:51Z","Content":"Uninstalled mods to test that they weren\u0027t the issue. I\u0027m starting to think that something must have changed in the game files due to mods. This happens now no matter what I do or where I am. I just loaded a saved game with a ship landed on the Mun, and when I went to fly it, same thing happened. The ship was vibrating slightly, then when I took Jeb EVA both him and the ship spun rapidly like in the video. (and yes, forgot to mention the FL-T400 fuel tank in the OP)\n\nI purchased the game thru Steam, so I\u0027m going to have Steam verify the integrity of the files. Hopefully that\u0027ll resolve the issue.\n\nEdit: Checked integrity and Steam found 7 bad files. Fixing them did not solve the issue. I then uninstalled the game completely (checking to make sure the directory was completely empty), re-installed fresh, and now the issue is solved. Thanks all!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T22:41:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Targa**"}]}
