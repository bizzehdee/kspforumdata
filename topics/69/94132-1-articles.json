While I was making the final approach trying to land my all-stock, low part count space plane Laythe lander back at on the KSC runway, part of the right wing just exploded off in mid air. I actually managed to get the plane on the ground without killing the pilot, but just as I touched down the other wing exploded too, and then the KSP Launchpad, which had nothing on it, had a tremendous explosion off in the distance as well! I don\u0027t have access to a screen shot right now, but I\u0027ll post one later. Several subsequent attempts produced similar results until finally I was able to get on the ground with nothing spontaneously exploding. The plane was all stock, and had been flown and landed without incident in 0.25 several times before.
