I noticed it goes up to 80c at times. Now, I am playing on an Asus (laptop) i7 4710hq 8 GB Ram with a GTXm850 4GB - The laptop is only 1 month old, just bought it. I do use a cooling pad too. I do live near the Amazon in a tropical region where temps are a constant 30c throughout the year. But I do run what seems like more demanding games at a lower temp.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T20:30:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DanJaker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:08:39Z","Content":"KSP is actually a lot more demanding than you would think given the graphics.

My CPU used to get as hot as yours but now, the temperature is OK... the hard drives (according to HDD sentinel) are running at 26c 28c and 24c... they used to get into the 40\u0027s ... my problem wasn\u0027t so much the game as the HDD\u0027s... they would cause the entire system to get hot, the game made it go slightly hotter still.\n\nOn your computer, Make sure the fan vent isn\u0027t blocked with fluff... and never put it down on the bed covers...

The computer won\u0027t meltdown or anything so long as its vents are not blocked and fans are running. The max temperature for 4th Gen mobile i7s are something like 105 deg C and it will throttle itself down to avoid destruction. \n\nI also had a decommissioned former office laptop, a T4400 dual core with discreet nVidia GPU running KSP at around the same temps.\n\nIf you\u0027re really worried about the heat just go to Advanced Power Settings and dial down the max. processor usage to about 80-90%. This will limit how far the Turbo Boost goes and cap the heat production, while reducing CPU throttling (this may give you more stable framerates, since, the Turbo Boost isn\u0027t smart enough to stop overclocking to the max until it reaches throttling temp).\n\nA laptop cooler doesn\u0027t do anything in my opinion - at least, not in this kind of climate. It doesn\u0027t move air fast enough to compete with my collection of super powered desk and/or industrial fans.
