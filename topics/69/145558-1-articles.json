I tried deleting the joystick from the inputs but it did not help. Any idea how to get my controls back and how to properly setup a basic joystick?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEric\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MachTurtle","CreatedById":153223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-08T15:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, liquid_magma, and welcome to the forums.\u00A0 I\u0027ll do my best to help you and I\u0027m sure others will add their thoughts as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you may have two problems. The warning you saw about \u0022no remote or pilot controls\u0022 happens when a spacecraft lacks both a pilot (like Jeb or Valentina) and probe core (like a Probodobodyne unit or Remote Guidance Unit). Try adding either of these to your craft and see if that warning goes away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem seems to be that KSP isn\u0027t recognizing your joystick. The main settings screen \u0022input\u0022 tab is the right place to configure it. Do your joystick axes show up when you try to assign them to roll/pitch/yaw?\u00A0 Do joystick buttons (assuming your stick has them) show up when you try to assign them to functions like brakes or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u00A0 If not, I\u0027d check to see if your joystick works in any other games. I run KSP on a Mac and therefore don\u0027t use any included drivers, but other platforms may need them. Also, I find that my joystick must me plugged in when I start KSP, otherwise it\u0027s not recognized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck and feel free to ask for more help if you\u0027re still having problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
