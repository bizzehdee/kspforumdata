Oh, the failures! When I finally got the rover landed, there were some funny problems I had to work through with funny consequences that I wish I had recorded. At the end of the \u0022day\u0022, though, the mission was finally accomplished, and I left the rover parked right outside of my Mun base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day, though, when I went to pull some science from said Mun base, I saw that the rover was gone. There is no trace of it anywhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is \u0022What happened to the rover?\u0022, and, more importantly, \u0022How can I park a rover in a way that keeps it from vanishing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-18T14:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is nothing that makes a Mun rover disappear, ever.
