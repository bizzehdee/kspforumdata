I would recommend:\u003Cbr\u003E\na) Going into Steam Properties for KSP and verifying your files. To do this: right click KSP in the steam client application and select \u0022Properties\u0022. Then Select the \u0022LOCAL FILES\u0022 tab and then click \u0022VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES....\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nb) Ensure you don\u0027t have any mods installed in your steam directory for KSP. Or if you do, ensure those mods are updated for KSP 1.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazycatkikicraft","CreatedById":178160,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-28T08:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did that, they said the integrity of the files were 100% every time. I also figured out that if ur on steam, to play the game, go to \u0022betas\u0022 in \u0022properties\u0022 of kerbal space program and go to one of the lowest (i did the lowest one and it worked). So for now, in order to play the game (for me anyways), u need to play the old school updates. lol xD. Rip us all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
