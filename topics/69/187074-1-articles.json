When time warping, a weird rotation of the vessel will appear. This rotation seems to be synchronized with the rotation of Gilly. This happens under a very specific altitude of 100 km.\u00A0Here is how to reproduce it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch a vessel. Use Alt\u002BF12 to set orbit around Gilly. Set semi-major axis to 114,000 and eccentricity to 0.1. Set camera to LOCKED. Start time warping. You will notice that when you get above 100 km the rotation will stop. Also, if you place a maneuver node, aim at the blue marker\u00A0on\u00A0the navball, then time warp, the vessel\u00A0should normally stay on\u00A0the blue marker. But it will not if you are under 100 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks like a bug to me. Or am I wrong? Is it happening to you guys as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-10T02:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP uses a reference frame that rotates with the planet, for craft in low orbit\u00A0(where the EVA report would be \u0022in low orbit\u0022) or lower, including on the ground.\u00A0 That means we cannot demonstrate Foucault pendulums in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a known issue on the bug tracker at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5234\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#5234\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe software quality department marked it \u0027not a bug\u0027, based on a user\u0027s excellent explanation.\u00A0 If we as players have good reason to want KSP to use an inertial reference frame, I think we could reset it to \u0027yes a bug\u0027.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure we want to ask for a fix, though, for fear of side effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pejsek","CreatedById":139640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-10T08:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, I see. I always wondered why the maneuver node drifts just a little bit when warping in low orbit. However\u00A0for Gilly, I think the 100 km are just a bit too high (sphere of influence is 113 km) and it can be a little annoying when your scanning satellite regularly runs out of power because the solar panels moved away from the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
