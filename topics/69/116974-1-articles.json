I am at the \u0022Close your orbit\u0022 step. It says to press M to go to map mode. Press X to kill the engines. So far, so good. Then it says to click the Ap symbol. The problem is that most of the time there is no Ap symbol. All I see is a blue line that goes from the bottom of the screen to the top.\n\nI have tried this tutorial many times. It doesnt seem to matter if I go to the horizon on the navball by hitting \u0027A\u0027 or \u0027D\u0027. I could be pointed at the symbol on the navball that the tutorial guide \u0022Gene Kerman\u0022 tells me is the prograde direction.\n\nTo be honest there is alot about this game that I don\u0027t get. \n\nThe thing is the prograde symbol looks lime green in Gene Kermans speech bubble but yellow on the navball so maybe my problem is that I have the wrong prograde direction. \n\nNow I cannot get back to the flight part of the tutorial. I accidentally clicked to go to the space hangar or something. I couldnt figure out how to go back to the flight in progress. I quit and came back into the game. Then I selected \u0022Training\u0022 and then \u0022Flight Basics\u0022. I end up looking at an isometric 3d perspective of the whole launch base with the Launch Pad and the Vehicle Assembly Building etc. It wont let me go to the launch pad because I have to assemble a vehicle. Do I have to start the tutorial from vehicle construction phase? If so why does the program allow me to choose \u0022Training\u0022 and then \u0022Flight Basics\u0022. It should just force me to start at Training and then \u0022Construction Basics\u0022. I cannot find my last vehicle I saved during the first step of the tutorial.\n\nI really want to like KSP. Is my install completely broken?\n\nBen\n\nI have a mac. OSX 10.10. KSP 1.0.0.813. Macbook Pro Mid 2012. NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThis was in my KSP.log file:\n\n[LOG 23:48:03.563] Scenario Construction Basics has status Unstarted, but is being validated for a game resume. Something\u0027s off here.\n\n[LOG 23:48:03.563] Scenario Construction Basics is non-resumable."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T14:11:51Z","Content":"Is this problem happen on career mode?\n\nIf that so, it\u0027s bot a bug:you have to upgrade your tracking station to level two(that is, upgrade once); the cost is 150 000 funds.\n\nTry the sandbox mode to see if the problem persist, if is still occur you should put the log file, so persons who are better in informatics than me can see it ;P"}]}
