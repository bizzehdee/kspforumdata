I\u0027m accepting contracts in mission control, building my rocket, and going to launch. When I get there and check my active contracts the list is empty. I launch the rocket and everything works fine. I recover the rocket and it shows me the records I broke. I go back to mission control and I\u0027m showing no completed contracts, not even the launch a rocket contract. I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m just missing something simple here and any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T09:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167715-nickdanger3tb/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167715\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167715-nickdanger3tb/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nickdanger3tb\u003C/a\u003E, can you could take a look here please, we\u0027ll need more information before we can help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
