I did use that thread as a basis for my question, but it is quite a general problem affecting flight physics. I will try again, but feel free to ask for anything specific that is missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Happens: Craft descends extremely slowly at low altitutes (few 1,000m) in Kerbin atmosphere, when empty of fuel (zero thrust) and no parachute deployed. It descends tail-first extremely slowly through the last few thousand feet at \u0026lt;1m/s decent rate (oscillating between 0-5m/s), taking \u0026gt;5mins to pass the last 300m despite zero thrust. When the parachute is deployed decent rate increases immediately to a more normal 10m/s. Prior to chute deployment, if the craft is manually pointed nose-down the decent rate accelerates rapidly, which can be converted into a zoom-climb with no thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods / Add-Ons: None\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps to Replicate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Build a small rocket consisting of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea craft: Stayputnik, FL-T400 fuel tank, LV-T30 liquid fuel engine, large inertial stabiliser, 4 symetrically placed winglets, two battery packs and a parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea launcher: 4 solid fuel boosters in two stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- launch, flying until all three stages have depleted of fuel (craft usually goes into an uncontrolled spin after pitching to 45 degrees during the second stage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do not deploy parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: Craft will descend rapidly until the last few 1000m, where it will slow almost to a standstill and descend slowly all the while it is orientated with the (dead) liquid engine pointing downwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixes/Workarounds: Point craft nose down to temporarily increase descent rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther Notes/Pictures/Log Files: None\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T11:05:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost likely you\u0027ve just encountered the infamous infiniglide bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock atmosphere is extremely soupy and control surfaces don\u0027t work as you might expect.
