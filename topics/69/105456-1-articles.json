The game does start in a widescreen ratio window first time on a clean install, but for some reason that\u0027s not reflected in the screen resolution shown when you first open the \u0022Settings\u0022 screen inside the game. That screen defaults to 1024x768 (4:3 old TV ratio) the first time. As soon as you Apply/Accept something in Settings, it changes the game to the displayed 1024x768 choice. Just pick a wide screen ratio (e.g. 1280x800, 1344x844, 1900x1200, etc), and all should be good.\n\nI can confirm I\u0027ve seen the bug. Easy workaround."},{"CreatedByName":"Argon","CreatedById":103523,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:06:46Z","Content":"^ Thanks, I\u0027m running the 2280x1800 retina mac, which is an odd ratio.
