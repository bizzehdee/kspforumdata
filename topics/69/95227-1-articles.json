These older parts remain if I revert to the hangar too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had hoped that 0.9 would fix this problem so I could play the game again, but this problem is STILL here. I\u0027ve updated, uninstalled, reinstalled, updated and nothing. In addition to this, I now have a listing of two of every older part in the parts window during hangar construction. I\u0027m running a Windows 64bit system with the current 0.9 patch. The game doesn\u0027t crash so no long can be given, but here\u0027s a few screenshots showing what I mean:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAlright, everything looks good.
