That is simply not the case because of the way solar technology works.\n\nIn the real world solar panels have contiguous receptors, if even a portion of the solar panel is in a shadow, it drastically reduces their output. The closer the shadow is to the connection point, the worse it gets. If it covers the connection point it should be 0.\n\nI can\u0027t tell which panel you are clicking on, but that one that is top center and the one to the left of it should both have an output of 0 if the game models how the real thing works.\n\nEDIT: On second thought, I suppose those look like several panels in an array, in which case only the panel that has shadow would be rendered ineffective IF (and only if) it were wired in parallel.

Series and Parallel are not something you just do because it is convenient. It would be dependent on voltage or charge rate requirements (which to be honest, we don\u0027t know in this game). Imagine two AA batteries, they have 1.5 Volts 2000 Amp hours each. If you wire them in parallel (positive to positive and negative to negative) you end up with 1.5 Volts 4000 amp hours. If you wire them in series (positive to negative) you have 3 volts 2000 Amp hours. Now in the case of a solar panel, it\u0027s charge rate not amp hours, but it works the same. If you need a higher voltage, you have to wire them in series.\n\nMy point is, if you put a shadow on a solar panel, it is unpredictable. You do not know how much power it will actually generate based on a percentage of shadow coverage. It\u0027s not a direct correlation, so the game is not wrong.
