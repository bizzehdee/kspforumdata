I have played the game through steam on other, less powerful computers/laptops and performance there was very noticeably better. When running on default settings and 4-part ships I am already subjected to the orange timer. On lower settings, this starts occurring at roughly 10-part ships. The performance hit is slightly lower when looking at the sky, so I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s partially related to the rendering of the surface and/or space station. Sadly, the performance hit has made the game not very fun to play at all. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\ncomputer setup:\n\nPhenom II X6 1090T\n\nRadeon HD 6900 series\n\n8gb RAM\n\nwindows 7 64bit\n\nvideo drivers are currently the latest beta drivers for AMD.
