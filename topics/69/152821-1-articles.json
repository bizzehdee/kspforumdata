Now I would like to share at least one save game between these two computers, So I copied one of the save games onto my NAS and placed\u00A0a link in the local KSP folder. But KSP does not treat the link as a folder or doesn\u0027t follow its path,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anybody have a clue ob how to setup KSP to read \u0026amp; write on a NAS?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I am running Window 10 / 64 bit and use a Synology NAS)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T13:54:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Carraux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Freds","CreatedById":132437,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T15:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause KSP saved games are essentially text files,you can try to use GIT to keep them versioned and and synchronized between your computers. You only need to remember to do \u00A0commits and pushs every time you switch computers. It works in teory, but i never tested this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T16:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe try symlinking to the file, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u0027s how to do it on Windows and Linux.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carraux","CreatedById":60890,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T08:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreating a symbolic link via MKLINK was the solution, thanx @sal_vager!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
