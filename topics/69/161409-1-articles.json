Without boring you with the details, the issue will likely be solved if you move the KSP icon (KSP.app) from /Applications/KSP_osx to your Desktop, and then back to\u00A0/Applications/KSP_osx.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that in order to move a file to the Desktop and not create an Alias you may have to hold command while dragging the file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
