If suggestions are made to tinker with things (changing CPU affinity, which I read in another thread, for example) I\u0027ll probably need some hand holding, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer/Game information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Game is a fresh, NO-mod version 1.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Win 7 Home Premium, 64 bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- AMD FX 8120 8-core @ 3.10 GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 16GB Ram\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- GeForce GTX 560SE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**My computer just came back from the shop. It was having a lot of issues (probably due to my kids) and had to have a fresh Windows install. The ONLY thing I\u0027ve put on the computer since coming back was KSP...no Steam, other games. Nothing. I have checked Java/DirectX and all appears updated. I have updated my video card driver to the latest available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I have never had a problem playing KSP on my machine, which I always play at max settings. Now, with KSP 1.0.4, I\u0027m having a LOT of freezing going on. I first noticed it in the VAB. The screen would get very glitchy, would freeze, and have a lot of transparency to the KSP environment outside the VAB (sky, ground, etc.). While freezing the music/mouse continue to operate normally. I have had a couple of crashes here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get a ship to the launch pad and/or launch, the game freezes and is unplayable. I got a couple of ships to orbit by slewing the camera to a chase view and avoiding having the terrain in the picture. That doesn\u0027t seem to help now. I have not (IIRC) had a crash while in-flight, but it is unplayable until I\u0027m in orbit. Then it behaves a bit, more-or-less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried dropping the visuals and FPS down a bit, but doesn\u0027t seem to help. I\u0027m including a picture from the VAB and am attempting to leave a dropbox to my Output Log. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps! I tried to follow the tacked \u0022Before Posting\u0022 threads as best I could, but will be happy to try to provide whatever else is required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, after looking at the picture, it may have been taken when I had a couple of mods added in. However, my issues are occurring still with a clean (deleted game, re-installed), unmodded version. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fyzf8wdx3c96xex/Oct14OutputLog.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fyzf8wdx3c96xex/Oct14OutputLog.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vkjGqNu.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022vkjGqNu.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E***Update***\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I kept reading more info on possible issues.

(My computer has been restarted since then.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still had the freezing/glitch issues, unfortunately. I was able to get a smaller ship up, to orbit, and back to Kerbin without it locking up completely tho! The VAB had the worst issues, once with a freeze over several minutes. Once it woke up, I was able to launch. The terrain and ship displayed a lot of glitchiness/flashing at times during flight. The altimeter was slightly glitchy as well, with one digit (the 10s of Km) not displaying. During orbit and in Map view, my blue orbit ring disappeared at times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say that my issues were less dramatic with this smaller ship.
