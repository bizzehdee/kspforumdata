If I disable torque on the probe core - everything goes normal. The same thing happens if I put something inside that don\u0027t fit in size (cylundrified monopropellant tank rotated vertically for example). I know that part clipping is bad but this don\u0027t happen with other parts (I suspect that is because other parts don\u0027t have \u0022fairing\u0022 behaviour) and some parts can have slightly bigger colliders (maybe, I am not pro in models, physics and such) so if everything looks okay (visually) thad doesn\u0027t mean that it is actually okay. And looks like that attaching to the bottom node in the bay have more chances to generate this issue.\n\nUPD: Looks like the reason of shaking was not in the probe with torque, but in colliders conflict. This happens only with closed doors. When I open the doors - everything comes to a normal state.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:27:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by orven**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:01:56Z","Content":"I\u0027m playing a science game and I\u0027ve not yet gotten Tech for the 2.5m Service Bay, but I do have the 1.25m Service bay and I have mounted an OKTO inside it ... no problems so far.

And checked it again: cannot get this shaking with probe again. So maybe that was not-so-obvious-clipping issue. But I am still curious: is it should be fixed or is it supposed behaviour that I just have to take into account.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T15:19:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by orven**"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:51:52Z","Content":"I also noticed an issue with colliders and service bays (and already reported it so Squad may check).

Seeng the bay affected by ghost forces when putting a pair of radial chutes that about to fit inside makes me really worry."}]}
