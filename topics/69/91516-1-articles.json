There is usually little that can be done other than restarting your build (though saving your craft regularly with a different name during construction can help to reduce the amount you have to rebuild). Hopefully the editor improvements coming in 0.90 will fix some of these bugs...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T17:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry is a bit wacky sometimes. There are a few common ways that can cause the overlapping part explosion that you\u0027re describing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry-in-symmetry (I call it recursive symmetry) is touchy but manageable. I build like this a lot, but you have to be mindful when making symmetry of part trees that have symmetry in them. Especially if you had to do anything unusual to get the symmetry to happen in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really bad one is having ALT\u002BF12 part clipping on while dealing with symmetry. You can run into situations where the editor will overly multiple copies of a part on a single node (because you told the game to let you do that). If you attempt to do more symmetry, things really go haywire. If you\u0027re going to do clipping with symmetry: turn on the clipping, do your attachment, turn clipping back off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are even worse if you use the \u0022undo\u0022 feature.
