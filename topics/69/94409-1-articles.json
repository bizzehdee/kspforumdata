I\u0027ve tried removing all the extraneous craft flying around (including debris) and the game still locks up. The game doesn\u0027t hard lock, it just get\u0027s to a point where you can\u0027t change ships; return to the Space Center or even save the game. Before getting to that failure point, things like Jeb automatically piloting to the radial, prograde, normal, etc... points stops working. It\u0027s like the code breaks down and gracefully looses functionality. The game might superficially appear to be working correctly but then you notice something you need to do just isn\u0027t possible and you try to save and you can\u0027t save, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis big seems to happen whenever I get \u0022far\u0022 into the game. When I have several stations around planets and ships on missions things just fall apart. This \u0022bug\u0022 has occurred in numerous games (ie. restarts from scratch) for the last year but this is the first build that was fun enough to play this far without mods. The game really is looking fantastic, couldn\u0027t be happier with the vision. I didn\u0027t think it was \u0022fair\u0022 to hand a problem like this to the devs with a modded game but the core degradation seems consistent and with this build clearly tracks to the game core itself. When you get \u0022far enough\u0022 into the game (superficially I correlate this with a certain number of missions/ships in space but it could be a time thing or another factor entirely) everything seems to fall apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T06:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked through your logs and some of the errors look pretty random. Although the full crashes were fairly consistent. The current output_log.txt was also very unusual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say with the random errors, my first recommendation is moving KSP out of your \u0022Program Files\u0022 directory. Keep it away from Documents, the desktop, program files, or any places which specific to a user. Windows DEP can cause all kinds of random problems with KSP/Unity. You\u0027l need to copy KSP to a new location (not move), or install a fresh copy some place else such as C:\\Games\\KSP. If you \u0022move\u0022 it, Windows DEP knows you\u0027re trying to trick it and will still \u0022help\u0022 you out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not try to replicate your problem yet, so that might not be it. But it\u0027s definitely known to cause a slew of random problems and crashes. Give that a try and see if it\u0027s any better.

As Claw mentioned, making a copy outside of Program Files may help. It also might help to completely redownload KSP from the KSP Store entirely, in case some of the files are corrupted (you can, of course, backup your saves first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore that, though, it might be worth disabling NVIDIA Experience -- there have been a few users who\u0027ve had trouble with it in the past, so it\u0027s worth a shot.
