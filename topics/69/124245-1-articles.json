I am at the setting menu under input and I can\u0027t figure out how to make the pitch up/down yaw left/right and roll left/right integrate with the joystick. I try holding the stick forward so it will enter it for pitch down but nothing happens. All that can be entered is the buttons on the joystick not the actual joystick function. Can someone please help me out with this. Thank you to all that can help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T20:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to go to the axis settings, not the button ones.
