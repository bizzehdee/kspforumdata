There are a few specific parts that have a drag cube specified in the part.cfg itself. Those are usually the hollow parts (such as decouplers or cargo bays). Those part require special cubes, hence they are stored in the part.cfg file. For everything else, the drag cube is calculated when KSP starts the first time and stores it in that database. Then is subsequently uses those values unless it detects a new part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonought","CreatedById":165215,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T21:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, hadn\u0027t spotted that file.
