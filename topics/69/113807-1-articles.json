There is no affected save in particular; I moved my career game off to the side and have been testing with a fresh install.\n\nI\u0027m going to check out that other thing with starting from within the game folder when I get home. If that works, that might indicate that there\u0027s a missing \u0022./\u0022 from the beginning of the lib callouts... I\u0027ll work around it with a shell script if it turns out that works.\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"stratvox","CreatedById":134498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:29:04Z","Content":"Hey, see my post in the other thread.
