I neeeeed validation. Shortly before going to bed, I remember quicksaving, then proceeded to\u00A0land\u00A0a craft from my station to near KSC in the water, and 2 of the 3 engines fell off the back on a hard landing. Afterwards, I decided to send up a spaceplane into LKO and call it a night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday i loaded up the game, and saw that debris were left over from the craft that lost 2 engines in the water, so im like \u0022awesome more money\u0022, and then i realize its probably the engines that fell off, and they are sitting on the ocean floor, and i was like \u0022omg thats dope im going to go check it out\u0022 so i go and \u0022fly\u0022 the debris instead of recovering it, for the moment. Once I get there, the beginning of the horror story commenced. The altitude, which started at 250m or so, began rising and I was gaining vertical speed while visually I was sitting on the ocean floor as an vectoring engine. I was then not able to recover the part, and it said i was under acceleration and could not do such a thing. I have a screen shot of this. Upon getting back to KSC, I decided to recover the other engine that fell off from the same vessel earlier, and not \u0022fly\u0022 the wreckage this time. I dont think i got cash for it, but i dont vividly remember the cash display cycling around after clicking recover. At this point I have still not noticed whether or not my\u00A0missions are gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, after that I decided to look at wreckage that took place at least a week or two ago near KSC, where a different\u00A0spaceplane ran out of fuel and just barely survived a splashdown; some parts were on the ocean floor, so I decided to see if I would get the same issue as I previously did of getting vertical speed. I did not, and my part on the ocean floor (also an engine) was perfectly fine and I was even able to recover it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then went to look at my space station, and it still had my ship on it that i landed last night, and recovered the debris from today. and the ship was still there and docked? Also, the space plane with cargo that I hauled up last night was no longer there.\u00A0I was so confused, and I still am..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was at this time I clicked on my mission control center, and found out all my active missions were gone; i was getting ready for a high paying landing\u00A0Eloo gravity mission. But im quite horrified to find that also my archived missions are gone along with them. I decided to look at my quicksave file, which should bring everything back to normal, to before I landed the ship that was docked, but ALL the active and archived missions were still gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need to disclose that I do have mods. But I believe this belongs here because none involve mission changes, and with the exception of KIS/KAS, all either display information or Its for visuals only.\u00A0If this must be moved to modded installs only, so be it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtmosphere trajectories\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistant objects\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVE (clouds only)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKAS/KIS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerball Engineer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMecJeb2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClaws stock bug fixes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Alarm clock\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats all I have.
