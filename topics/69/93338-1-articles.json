Now i have a couple of hours to report some of those issues. But before i do, i wanna write down my system setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: Intel Core i5 4690K 4x 3.50GHz So.1150 BOX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU: 4096MB Inno3D GeForce GTX 770\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM: 8GB (2x 4096MB) Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1866 DIMM CL9-10-9-27\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMAIN: MSI Z87-G45 Gaming Intel Z87\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESYSTEM: WINDOWS 8.1, 64 BIT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALL DRIVERS ARE UP TO DATE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, i bought this game on STEAM. After downloading, it started in a small window, so i went to the settings and put everything on \u0022high\u0022 or \u0022fantastic\u0022, since my setup is quite good. Result: Game crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, i thought i can restart, but now it started to crash while loading. So I restarted my computer, updated everything and it still doesnt work. Obviously, it\u0027s some RAM problem which i don\u0027t understand. Anyway, i deleted the game and re-installed it again via STEAM. Again it opened in a small window. I started a new game and it crashed. Then i restarted, went to settings and put everything on LOW (come oooon!). After this, my game kinda worked. I went to the rocket-building place and started to build my very first rocket ever, but my Keyboard didnt work there. I couldnt use W,A,S,D,Q,E to rotate stuff, but whatever, it wasnt actually necessary for my first rocket, so i went to the launchpad and clicked spacebar to start. Nothing happens. i right click on the engine, activate it and my rocket starts flying. I would like to have it go a little faster so i press shift to throttle up. Nothing happens... i think something is broken. Hope i could get some help, cause everyone is already having fun playing this game :/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-21T01:23:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2014 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T17:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFind your settings.cfg file in the KSP directory and delete it.
