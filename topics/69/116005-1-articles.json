It also sets single part symmetry status to Mirror in the SPH and Radial in the VAB (invisible to the player). I did try your steps above, but seriously, a picture would help.\n\nIn stock KSP, the steps you provided did give a poorly built wing, but it was still mirror. It did not switch to radial, nor did it change when I restarted KSP. I tried several times and didn\u0027t see a difference.\n\nThis is partially why I beg for pictures, .craft files, definitive reproduction steps, etc... Not because I enjoy inflicting pain on people (although it is fun ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ), but because it is much harder to see the issue you are trying to point out, and for me to understand and/or offer help (or build a fix).\n\nI want to help, really. But with the info above, I have no answers to offer.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T07:27:23Z","Content":"Thank you very much for sending me a craft file. And I agree that there is indeed a bug. I decided to post in here, because it\u0027s probably something worth pointing out to others. Also, it\u0027s not a bug I\u0027ve seen yet.\n\nSo the bug is actually triggered by in the editor based on what symmetry mode you have selected when opening a file the first time. I haven\u0027t previously run into this before, but that\u0027s probably because most people typically build mirror craft in the SPH vice the VAB.\n\nSo, what does that mean to you? Your file is definitely \u0022broken\u0022 but should be easy to fix.\n\n- Make a copy of the file first (just in case). Open up the .craft file and search/replace all the instances of \u0022symMethod = Radial\u0022 with \u0022symMethod = Mirror\u0022 (do not do a search/replace just \u0022Radial\u0022 because you will break the file).\n\nOpening the File:\n\n- Now, when you go to open the file in the VAB, set down a generic root part (any root part). Then change the symmetry mode to Mirror (press R). Now go open your fixed .craft file and the parts should not reset to Radial.\n\nI will see if I can figure out what\u0027s causing this. I thought I knew initially, but seems I will have to dig a little more. That should hopefully be enough of a workaround that you can continue to work. Also, by the way, if you accidentally open the file before switching symmetry modes, it\u0027s not a problem unless you click \u0022Save.\u0022 Just switch the symmetry mode to Mirror and open the file again.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
