Especially:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nData Execution Prevention does not break KSP. If it did before, it doesn\u0027t now. Turning this off is a bad idea.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUser Account Control does not break KSP.

And this bad advice is still stickied in this support forum despite it being false.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClaw hasn\u0027t been active since early 2016 or I\u0027d have sent him a personal message about this.

Unlike BUILTIN\\Users, \u0022Everyone\u0022 is \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E, including guests and anonymous network clients, and \u0022Full Control\u0022 isn\u0027t needed unless an application is manipulating permissions.
