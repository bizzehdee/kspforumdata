On my Shuttle like spacecraft, the radial decoupler heats up, and it explodes. First I thought it\u0027s because of the heat of the engines, but I put on a lot of radiators next to it, but it also explodes. And it also heating up after I shut down the engines.\n\nHere are some images:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzNKKmq_O3uSfi1lV2sybkdnUzJRaXlCTk0wZ3VhSGR3VVFFbG1WYmJ5elg0bnR2N3hESGM\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzNKKmq_O3uSfi1lV2sybkdnUzJRaXlCTk0wZ3VhSGR3VVFFbG1WYmJ5elg0bnR2N3hESGM\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nThank you your answers.\n\nD\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1vid"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:14:38Z","Content":"What type of engines are you using?"},{"CreatedByName":"Begga","CreatedById":151137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T23:57:24Z","Content":"i had the same problem. i took another radial decoupler ( i think if we had the same problem we also had the same type of radial decoupler) and than it doesnt happen anymore. nearly got mad before and i dont know whats the problem but this works with me"}]}
