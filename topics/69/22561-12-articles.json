I\u0027ve got myself new Linux box running Ubuntu 13.04 and its packed full of grunt, KSP is running very well on it. I\u0027ve been trying to get my joystick working and have been in a world of confusion! I have a small numbers of mods installed, most notably MechJeb 2.something. Here are some of the things that have been confusing me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I put a MechJeb on the Aeris aircraft in order to experiment with my joystick without killing kerbals. If I \u0027launch\u0027 my aircraft with a pilot on board, the navball orientation is as expected. If I \u0027launch\u0027 my aircraft without aircrew onboard, the navball is rotated such that the blue is on the left hand side and the brown is on the right. This swaps the pitch and yaw axes on both the joystick and keyboard controls. Edit: OK. I was being dumb. If I selected the cockpit on an unmanned aircraft and selected \u0022Control From Here\u0022, the navball reorientates itself correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When \u0027launching\u0027 the Aeris (with a Mechjeb and pilot on board) the controls seem normal (as far as i can tell) until I engage the SAS, at which point only positive valued input appears to come from the joystick on all three principal axis. To clarify, I refer to the 3 input scales in the bottom left hand corner of the GUI. With SAS off, my joystick can pitch up and down, roll left and right, yaw CCW and CW. With SAS on, I can only pitch up, roll right and yaw CW. No negative input is possible on any axis. Edit: just to confirm, when SAS is enabled, the keyboard still works for down, left and CCW when the joystick doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t mentioned the throttle as that just adds a whole new dimension of confusion, literally!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not been very active on the forums recently, so all of these issues may have been mentioned elsewhere, may be cross platform, or may be linux specific.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone offer any advise, please?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T19:12:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by fnordianslip\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T19:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the first is easy, the orientation of the mechjeb module is to blame as it keeps hijacking control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second problem is not so easy, I have not experienced it yet so don\u0027t know the cause or the fix so It\u0027d be interesting to know what stick you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up my sticks with jscal (part of the joystick package in the repo\u0027s) prior to playing KSP so that might be it, and all my sticks are old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Saitek ST90, Logiteck Wingman Extreme 3D, Logitech Dual action pad and a no-name Chinese flightstick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fnordianslip","CreatedById":19310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T19:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, you\u0027re right about my first problem, that\u0027s all good now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the 2nd problem, KSP shows it as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E /dev/input/js0: fd 3, buttons 14, axes 7, name Mad Catz Mad Catz F.L.Y.5 Stick\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that I can repeatably obtain the reported behaviour (loss of negative pitch,roll \u0026amp; yaw joystick input) by engaging SAS. I\u0027ll see if it also affects manned flight without a MechJeb on board. Fortunately, for the sake of the kerbals, it should be repeatable on the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well, it is partially reproducible without MechJeb fitted to the craft. With SAS enabled, only negative roll (lefthand) functions with the joystick, negative pitch and yaw (down, CCW) only work with SAS disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try some different aircraft, and perhaps a fresh install. It\u0027s way less confusing without the yaw and pitch axes being swapped, I was faffing around with the joystick settings for ages trying to make sense of things before I even noticed that the navball was on the wonk!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe joystick behaves perfectly normally with jstest-gtk, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T20:09:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by fnordianslip\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T19:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, are you using an old settings.cfg? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/42643-0-21-1-Joystick-only-overrules-SAS-in-positive-directions?highlight=joystick\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESee here for more.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fnordianslip","CreatedById":19310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T20:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm. No. I deleted the original, but it wasn\u0027t old anyway. However, I\u0027m liking the sound of the deadzone fix. That\u0027s consistent with the roll axis working with SAS on in my last test. I\u0027ll try that and report back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Awesome, thanks for your help. Bill and I are both pleased! I\u0027ll see if I can get the throttle working now. I can\u0027t see why it wouldn\u0027t, as it just used to stick at 50% or more when I tried it before but I always had SAS on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother edit: I figured out that my joystick\u0027s throttle needed to be set at centre before starting KSP in order for the full range to work, otherwise it had a maximum level of 50%. KSP reported this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E /dev/input/js0: axis 4: raw -32767, mapped 0.000000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen I started it with the throttle fully to the rear, and this when I started KSP with the throttle at mid-range:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E /dev/input/js0: axis 4: raw 0, mapped 0.000000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll seems good now. Thanks for everything. BTW, it seems that this is all off topic for Linux, so I\u0027d be happy if you wanted to clear this noise out from the signal in this topic.
