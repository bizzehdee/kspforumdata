I started to build a multi-purpose station that consisted of more than 400 parts. The game performance was horrible. I was getting 1fps per second according to the performance menu. It was incredibly painful having 1fps. It made docking pretty much impossible. I don\u0027t know about you, but 1fps makes me dizzy when watching the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I looked at task manager and KSP was only using 30% of my CPU and 1.7GB RAM! Overall, only 35% of CPU was being used on my computer and 69% RAM. I just don\u0027t get it. Why is it lagging so much? It is hardly utilizing my new gaming PC\u0027s resource at all. I have other simulation softwares and they work fine. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Prepar3D run fine for me. For any of you who don\u0027t know, those 2 simulation software are the ultimate PC killer. \u00A0My computer can run it around 20fps. However with KSP I only get 1fps with 65% CPU and 31% RAM unused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis must mean KSP is hardly using my PC\u0027s resources well at all. What is wrong here? I really want to build interstellar ships and\u00A0big space stations but KSP is really limiting my ceativity. The computer bascially has no problems coping at all. However, KSP starts to lag after 400\u002B parts, and this is just getting annoying- it takes the fun away and it wastes a lot of time.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help will be appreciated.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T10:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/155576-atamtab/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022155576\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/155576-atamtab/\u0022\u003E@AtamTab\u003C/a\u003E, can you please \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022\u003Etake a look\u003C/a\u003E here and provide the information it asks for, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T11:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you checked my post from yesterday?
