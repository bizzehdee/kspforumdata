Struts are our (second ) best friends! But this bug might make us HATE struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bug was discovered yesterday. Because the top of my plane was floppy I added struts. So I took a strut, placed the first end, then placed it on the other end. What I think happened here is that the game could not decide whether or not this was to place the strut, or say It was me clicking the part. It was the latter that happened to me. Instead of placing the 2nd end it selected the part I clicked and made it follow my mouse. This time it was OK but you can imagine how much trouble this might cause.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T02:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot much trouble, you can just delete the part and use your best friend cmd Z. I have had this happen many times, though for me it is more often when selecting a strut.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
