It\u0027s enough for me to at least get some work done on ships. It seems to also be directly related to mods, or more specifically the amount of non-stock parts I have installed - the more I\u0027ve got the faster it seems to reach whatever threshold trips the CTD. I\u0027ve foregone a couple of mods that weren\u0027t really necessary for my project (which is establishing a mining base and shipyard on/around Minmus), and I\u0027m at least able to make progress.
