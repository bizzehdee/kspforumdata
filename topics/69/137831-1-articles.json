Steam installed 64 bit version of 1.1 along side the 32 bit version of 1.0.5 and this seems to be causing some issues. There are 1.1 parts showing up in the VAB/SPH when i had selected and loaded 1.0.5. Also, wheels do not respond to right clicking in the VAB/SPH and they don\u0027t respond to WASD when on the runway/launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there an easy fix like deleting the 64bit files and folders? Is there a way to only download the 1.0.5 (32 bit) version without 1.1 (64 bit) piggybacking on the install?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T07:32:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by WideEyedSleeper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mciann","CreatedById":105321,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T18:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having the exact same problem. \u00A0Completely clean install of previous version from Steam, and I\u0027m seeing the same thing. \u00A0Interested to learn how to correct it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T18:41:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mciann\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T18:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat build number are you getting for the 32 bit version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Just for the record, when I go back to previous stable build, it gives me a pre-release build.
