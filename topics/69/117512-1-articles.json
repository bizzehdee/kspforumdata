What it did so far. \n\nBut if i run KSP 1.0.4 with OpenGL and fullscreen, my screen is flickering. In Window mode it works fine, with Direct3D it works (windowed and fullscreen).\n\nBut i need OpenGL mode because of the mods i normally use. But this flickering happens even with a clean install. \n\nSo i could load a backup and go back to windows 7, but so far everything works. And a solution for this problem would be great. \n\nI hope someone can give me a hint on how to solve this. \n\n---\n\nKerbal Space Program - 1.0.4.861 (WindowsPlayer) Steam\n\nOS: Windows 8.1 (6.3.10240) 64bit\n\nCPU: Intel\u00AE Core i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz (4)\n\nRAM: 8164\n\nGPU: GeForce GTX 970/PCIe/SSE2 (3072MB)\n\nSM: 30 (OpenGL 4.5 [4.5.0 NVIDIA 353.62])\n\nRT Formats: ARGB32, Depth, ARGBHalf, RGB565, ARGB4444, ARGB1555, Default, DefaultHDR, ARGBFloat, RGFloat, RGHalf, RFloat, RHalf, R8"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:51:24Z","Content":"Hi Sphinx2k.\n\nThere\u0027s no known fix for this yet, flickering is usually a graphics driver issue when the driver is unable to update the screen properly, this could be due to frame buffer timing or a failure to synchronize with the vertical refresh, I can only assume there is some incompatibility between Windows 10 and Unitys openGL mode when fullscreen, this doesn\u0027t seem to happen in windowed mode as the game window is forced to update at the same rate as the rest of the desktop.\n\n-force-opengl is a [**Unity engine feature**](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) by the way, and not something Squad can address.\n\nYour only options seem to be to continue to run KSP in a regular window, or to force a borderless window with the -popupwindow command, though if that doesn\u0027t work and you still need fullscreen you may have to stop using -force-opengl.\n\nYou could try seeing if this has been reported on the Unity forums, but I expect the only real fix is to wait for your graphics driver vendor to fix this in their drivers."},{"CreatedByName":"Sphinx2k","CreatedById":149242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:18:32Z","Content":"Yes i was thinking that is is a unity thing.

If this does affect other games made with Unity there may be a driver update that addresses this sooner, though most Windows Unity games just use DirectX by default as that is the Unity default, -force-opengl is there for testing but it\u0027s not used as a matter of course.\n\nPlayers are only using it with KSP due to it using a bit less Ram, though the change to .dds textures with 1.0 has helped with that.\n\nDid you try -popupwindow with -force-opengl ? It\u0027d be useful to know if it works, though you may have to hide your taskbar, and it\u0027s also worth testing -force-d3d11\n\nUnfortunately there\u0027s no support in Unity for DirectX12 yet, though I expect that to change, that may also be why players are having this issue, and installing the DirectX 9 redistributable *might* solve it, or it might cabbage your PC, so I can\u0027t recommend you try this yourself, though apparently you can re-install Windows 10 to the same PC with no issues."},{"CreatedByName":"Sphinx2k","CreatedById":149242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:55:01Z","Content":"I think i fixed the problem. Maybe it helps other players with a similar problem. \n\nI figured out that the screen sync option within ksp, influenced the frequency of the flicker. So i played arround with the nvidia controll center and the settings there, focusing on screen sync and double tripple buffer. Nothing changed anything. \n\nThen after a lot of searching the internet and testing different settings nothing changed. But then i though maybe just try it with one screen....it was working. The flicker was gone completely without even restarting the Game. \n\nI restartet the game and it still worked, to doulbe check i enabled the second screen again ...the flicker did not return. Eben my modded game version is working normaly.\n\nI don\u0027t know why or how this fixed my problem, but if anyone has a similar problem i would advice to try it with only one screen enabled. \n\n*-popupwindow chanced nothing btw.*"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:59:24Z","Content":"One screen? are you using a multi-monitor setup?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sphinx2k","CreatedById":149242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T22:04:36Z","Content":"I have two screens, but only use one for playing.

When I tried OpenGL I had a similar issue. Most of the screen was a flickering mess while the lower left corner was displayed correctly. I tabbed out of the game then back in and all seemed to be fine at the main menu. Then I tried to play the game and it just locked up. This was on Win 8.1 single display but also a Maxwell 9xx GPU, can\u0027t remember what drivers though.\n\nEdit: Tried it again just now and the main menu displays fine.\n\nEdit 2: Tried to access the settings menu and it hung on the loading screen so I forced it closed. Loaded again, loaded a saved game, got to KSC, quit out, went to setting, loaded fine. It\u0027s completely random.
