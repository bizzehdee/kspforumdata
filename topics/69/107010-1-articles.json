The ablator in the heat shield can get consumed by the ship\u0027s heat","CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:17:22Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:17:22Z","Content":"Basically, that. I\u0027ve put an MK3 liquid fuel tank with four mk1 jet tanks radially mounted and nervs beneath them. Beneath the central MK3 tank I\u0027ve put a heat shield (hopefully for reentry). After landing in the Mun (which meant I\u0027ve fired the nervs for both the Trans Munar burn and the landing), the ablator is down to 85 or something from 850. I\u0027ve checked as the ship cooled down and ablator was being lost.\n\nI\u0027m not sure this isn\u0027t intentional behaviour, but it sounds strange as I would guess the ablator (ie ceramics on one side of the heat shield?) would only be burnt by friction from the outside, not heat accumulating from the inside."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:33:37Z","Content":"It reacts only to heat, there\u0027s not really any air simulation in KSP, and yes this is how it works.\n\nTry not to let your engines get too hot."},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:49:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It reacts only to heat, there\u0027s not really any air simulation in KSP, and yes this is how it works.\n\u003E Try not to let your engines get too hot.\n\nyet another very good reason heat radiator parts are needed.

If they are, the ablator is consumed to fight heat. If they aren\u0027t, then it\u0027s not.\n\nThat way the heat shield isn\u0027t consumed by firing the engines and players don\u0027t get to use it to cheat the thermal simulation. Heat shields would still (I assume) be useful to soak heat from ramjets and rapiers in the atmosphere, but one potential gamey use of them gets averted.\n\nOr, inside the atmosphere, they only consume ablator if the vertical velocity is negative - that way, they can\u0027t be used as radiators when ascending. They\u0027ll only be able to fight heat when going down in an atmosphere - their intended use."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:15:00Z","Content":"I would say this likely isn\u0027t an intended behavior.

I brought along several heatshields to aid in aerobraking on Eve, and when I got there they are already almost gone. This despite having several radiators on my ship. Four hours into my mission, the whole thing is a bust now.
