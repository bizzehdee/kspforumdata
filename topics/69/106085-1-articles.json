The straight wing segment worked as usual, using the tail fin on the rear section controls as normal. Any ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:14:22Z","Content":"Yeah, if the axis extends in front of the planes CoM it\u0027ll think it\u0027s in the wrong place.\n\nIf you change the angle of the ailerons a bit they should work properly."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:45:11Z","Content":"Pictures or a craft file would help with this one. It might be exactly what Sal is saying. Also, does it fly properly?\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Syhrus","CreatedById":64839,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:02:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ve encountered this one a few times as well. It happens when attachment point of the wing is in front of the centre of mass, so KSP thinks the elevons should be used like canards and reverses them.\n\nI think the problem stems from the swept wings having their centre of lift further back from their attachment point that most wings, so they are hard to place without causing the above affect.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
