I copied the craft file from my modded install, and created a new sandbox save in my unmodded install specifically to reproduce the bug, and take the attached screenshots.\n\nThe linked craft file is an example of the problem, but I have experienced it with other crafts as well. Because I discovered the issue in my career mode save, the vehicles have all used the new Cessna style landing gear (other gear untested) and the problem has been seen on the level 2 and 3 runway (level 1 untested). \n\nKSP Version: 1.0.2.842\n\n[Link to Craft on KerbalX](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/2074?download=true)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

In addition, it happens on every craft I\u0027ve made since 1.0. Adjusting the \u0022resting\u0022 angle of the plane inside the SPH makes no difference, repositioning the wheels makes no difference. The bottom-most pixel(s) of the craft are always spawned \\*just\\* below the surface of the runway.\n\nThis is clearly a glitch in the code that places the craft in the flight scene. I\u0027m very surprised that this thread is so short and the issue hasn\u0027t been addressed by Squad yet!"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T19:12:52Z","Content":"OHM.
