I set it in a circular polar orbit at 125km altitude. Before doing anything with the said surveyor, I \n\n quicksave and notice that the stack decoupler kicked me off a little from circular. I quickload before decoupling and then the satellite isn\u0027t showing anymore. I only see the orbital surveyor, nothing else. Kerbin\u0027s image is bugged as well. \n\n I don\u0027t see my staging anymore, I can\u0027t activate anything or move anything, the ressources don\u0027t show up as if the whole rocket didn\u0027t load with the orbital surveyor. I terminate the flight from the tracking station and launch another one and once it is in orbit, I go back to the space center. As soon as I go back to the orbital surveyor, the same bug occurs. All my other flights work fine even after the bug occurs, i.e. I can switch to my other satellites, stations in orbit, etc., and they work fine. I only seem to have issues with my orbital surveyor satellites...\n\n- A **screenshot** of your craft or any relevant screens\n\n The white and blue thing in background is Kerbin...![C4668AF63677DDAFF22065C07E0BE0C76DB93F63](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/31866712751848371/C4668AF63677DDAFF22065C07E0BE0C76DB93F63/)\n\n- A detailed list of **system specifications**\n\n ------------------\n\nSystem Information\n\n------------------\n\nTime of this report: 4/30/2015, 15:50:49\n\n Machine name: GATEWAY-PC\n\n Operating System: Windows 7 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0dition Familiale Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1\\_gdr.150316-1654)\n\n Language: French (Regional Setting: French)\n\nSystem Manufacturer: Gateway\n\n System Model: FX6831\n\n BIOS: Default System BIOS\n\n Processor: Intel\u00AE Core i7 CPU 860 @ 2.80GHz (8 CPUs), ~2.8GHz\n\n Memory: 16384MB RAM\n\nAvailable OS Memory: 8152MB RAM\n\n Page File: 3673MB used, 12626MB available\n\n Windows Dir: C:\\Windows\n\n DirectX Version: DirectX 11\n\nDX Setup Parameters: Not found\n\n User DPI Setting: Using System DPI\n\n System DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)\n\n DWM DPI Scaling: Disabled\n\n DxDiag Version: 6.01.7601.17514 32bit Unicode\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue ? \n\nThanks in advance!
