CH Control Manager Device 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nWhen I mapped the throttle axis in KSP, I moved the controller and KSP recognized and bound it just fine. It was saying \u0022Control Manager ID #00 Axis 2\u0022. But when I went into the game the game throttle was completely unresponsive.\n\nI had the throttle mapped to the Control Manager Device 1 Z-axis, but the game was listening for the Z-axis on the Control Manager Device 2, because in the games internal logic the secondary vitual controller was the primary of the two, and it couldn\u0027t tell that they were two different controllers.\n\nI finally fixed it by switching the mapped Z-axis on the secondary virtual controller. But it seems that if two control devices have similiar names, KSP can\u0027t always tell them apart. Maybe has something to do with the hash symbol in the name.\n\nAlso every time I plug in a new (or old) game controller to the computer, the next time I start KSP it seems to think that this new controller is now Joystick1. This messes up all the keybinds, on all the joysticks, as the controller that userd to be 1 is now 2, 2 is now 3, and so forth.\n\nHey developers, listen up: all the game controller axis and buttons need to be bound to unique identifiers, not names, and definitely not numbers of order. The game needs a surefire way of telling one controller from another. Good joystick support is paramount in a game that is mainly about flying in various environments."},{"CreatedByName":"Illogic","CreatedById":125972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T18:01:11Z","Content":"I just fixed mine, I\u0027ve been so mad I haven\u0027t played the game in months, I just can\u0027t stand docking or landing with the keyboard! I\u0027ve had an itch for KSP the last couple of days, so I decided to sit down and figure this out...\n\nSo here\u0027s what I did, with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro:\n\n1. Close KSP.exe\n\n2. Visit [http://support.logitech.com/product/extreme-3d-pro](http://support.logitech.com/product/extreme-3d-pro) and download the joystick\u0027s gaming software (~15mb) Note: If you have another Logitech controller other than the Extreme 3D Pro, browse the site for the software specifically designed for the controller in your possession.\n\n3. Install software and set-up, once installed and the software is running, continue to step 4.\n\n4. In the Logitech Profiler application, select \u0022Select A Game\u0022, and \u0022Create new game profile\u0022. Using your file browser, find the KSP.exe icon and select it. (It would not show up automatically for me, which could explain why Microsoft Flight Simulators liked my joystick and KSP didn\u0027t, this is a logitech auto-detect software inadequacy, not a Squad/KSP bug)\n\n5. Now enter your KSP file folder and delete the \u0022Settings.cfg\u0022 file, this will remove any key binding you had previously set, but it\u0027s worth it!\n\n6. Ensure your Logitech Profiler is running, close all windows, and run KSP.exe\n\n7. In KSP.exe, go to Settings -\u003E Input -\u003E Flight. On the right side column, you should now be able to assign Axis Bindings, which will enable you to control spaceships(And Planes) with a Logitech 3D!!!\n\nHope this works!!! Please exclaim publicly if it does and your excitement gets to my level!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"PumaX","CreatedById":82474,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T02:35:40Z","Content":"It happened again today.
