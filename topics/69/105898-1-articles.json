The problem seem to be reproducable and it affects linear/rotation control in docking mode. If I switch between those (pressing Space) my stages fire, which is most annoying if I used \u0022up\u0022 right before (Shift actually). I tested this on a completely clean installation without any mods.\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"upsilone","CreatedById":114654,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:26:14Z","Content":"Bump - \n\nprecisely my problem.
