They can skip planets. They have always been this way.\n\nIf you want a more linear progression, do the little bite sized World First contracts. They have the same rewards (1/4 the rewards, but 1/4 the amount of objectives) as Explore contracts, and you can chain them together with a single vessel, so theoretically, you could drag them out longer than the four objectives an Explore would net you. They also follow a strict progression based on your personal progression, and never skip planets unless you did yourself. (Obviously the Pol bug is an exception here, one that\u0027s been fixed.) They never ask you to do something that you have already done, they always ask you to do things that are very close in difficulty to things you have already done - things they perceive you to be ready for, and they are pretty decent reward wise.\n\nAnother benefit of them, is that there are literally hundreds of them: 14 per body, 17 bodies, so including the early game ones, it\u0027s a bit over 238, and they support modded planets. So if you progress without having one, and \u0022skip\u0022 it by unlocking progress, it\u0027s less of an issue than with the Explore contracts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T09:03:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 09:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:29:29Z","Content":"I have only been given worlds firsts for Mun - no explore contract for anywhere yet.

So what I did was accept a DUPLICATE Explore contract. Exit your game and back up your persistent.sfs file (Kerbal Space Program/saves/\\*\\*yoursavenamehere\\*\\*/persistent.sfs), and then open it in a text editor.\n\nSearch for the text \u0022ExploreBody\u0022 and you\u0027ll find the area of the file where your contracts are located. Each explore contract has 5 instances of \u0022body = x\u0022, where x is the id of the celestial body.

Quite frankly, I don\u0027t even care about the other parameters. Maybe someone who got the Explore Minmus contract can fill us in on the correct payout values (prestige, funds, science, rep, etc).\n\nAll I know, is generating a duplicate Explore contract with the debug console, and then finding the duplicate in the persistence file and changing the 5 instances of the the body id number to 3 did the trick.\n\nAlso, I did not let not getting the contract hold me back... In my game I have actually landed on Minmus and collected science. Editing the contract in this manner DOES NOT mark those events as complete. You\u0027ll need to perform those tasks again for the contract to register the events.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T03:55:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles**\n  \nAdditional detail"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T06:41:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The appearance of various types of contracts is not based on your reputation.
