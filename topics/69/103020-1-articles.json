When I choose a part, it just freezes in the floor..\n\nHowever I can load all ships from SPH. Both from SPH and VAB. \n\nI was thinking that it could have something to do with the save, because it\u0027s a save from before the beta update. \n\nCould this have a saying in the problem?\n\nAny idea what this could be caused by and how to solve it?\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edit:**\n\nI found out that it is only in that specific game that the problem occur.
