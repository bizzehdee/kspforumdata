I hope you haven\u0027t had anything else get mucked up since you posted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer is in what you have posted. Loading can can get stuck on anything that doesn\u0027t read the way the game expects. As you can see, the thing that is having a problem is usually the the thing that is left showing on the load screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what you have is that somehow the .png for mk2FuselageLongLFO_icon has got corrupted. The loader hits the corrupted file and gets caught because it can\u0027t resolve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that .png is what is used to display that part in the parts list. the @thumb is the storage folder for all the stock Squad parts list images.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFolder path\u00A0 Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\@thumbs\\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you need to do is cut that .png out of the folder. I am currently running 1.12.2 and don\u0027t actually have that .png so I am assuming it came after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo cut it and put in a new folder that is not inside the GameData folder structure. Try loading the game and see if it gets stuck anywhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it doesn\u0027t like having the .png missing then copy any other .png from that folder (so it fullfills the size requirement that KSP expects) to another folder, then rename the copy to the same as the corrupted one. Then put the renamed copy back in. KSP won\u0027t know the difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoad to see if you get stuck. If you don\u0027t then the only down side is it will have the wrong picture in the parts list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood Luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb man","CreatedById":223418,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-09T20:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I to have to say this, but when I mean I am no computer whiz.
