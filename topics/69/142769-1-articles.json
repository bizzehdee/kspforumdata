I\u0027m not sure what exact fps I got but previously I had 60 or more easily. I thought removing mods could help. nope. reinstalling? nope. I have no idea what happened but it\u0027s only happening in 1.1.3 1.1.2 was fine and all versions before. I know it\u0027s not part count or anything like that it happens with just a pod. I tried setting the fps limiter to different values and no help. so far that\u0027s all I\u0027ve tried but I don\u0027t feel like anything else can help as nothing was wrong before this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsystem: amd FX-6350, 16 GB ddr3 1600, asus strix NVidia GeForce GTX 960\u00A04gb gddr5, windows 10 home 64 bit,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-29T16:41:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2016 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mate_fin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira1000","CreatedById":152681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T16:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I can think to check is see if Nvidia is suddenly not implementing GPU acceleration for the KSP executable, maybe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mate_fin","CreatedById":155197,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T16:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222653465\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467217730\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152681\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gojira1000\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, Gojira1000 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I can think to check is see if Nvidia is suddenly not implementing GPU acceleration for the KSP executable, maybe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso how do I check this exactly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mate_fin","CreatedById":155197,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T17:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok\u00A0nevermind it\u0027s not an issue with ksp it\u0027s an issue with all the games. so too bad for me then I guess I can\u0027t play anymore\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T19:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you need to reinstall your graphics driver then reboot, your dxdiag hardware report will tell you exactly what driver you have, if you run dxdiag from the start menu you can save the report, post it to pastebin.com then link it here for us to take a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
