When I try to dock two ships, it mostly goes off without a hitch. But sometimes, now the second time, The two ports just dont attract to each other, and although i\u0027m perfectly aligned in every dimension and theres just a about no space between those 2 ports, they dont have that magnetism that pulls them together. It just sits around in space doing nothing. Although these two times I\u0027ve had that particular issue first appeared in a modded install (kerbal alarm clock \u002B Kerbal engineer) restarting the game with a unmodded install has no effect. The problem remains. A friend of mine has also encountered this issue. We both used .90 (beta than ever) in windows 7 64bit, 8 gigram.\n\nThank you for your support in advance"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T18:16:41Z","Content":"If they are close and not attracting, try to do a quicksave/quickload. That will force the ports to reset if they are not bugged.\n\nIf they are bugged, then you\u0027ll have to edit the save file and fix them manually. You can find the [directions for that here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5?p=1145499\u0026viewfull=1#post1145499).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"markospace","CreatedById":138178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T08:26:17Z","Content":"They might be on facing the wrong way if you reoriented them before placing on spacecraft. If you look closely at each side they are different.\n\nI did this and i couldn\u0027t believe it wasn\u0027t docking, i was sooo close time after time! Great practice though as when i redesigned ship and relaunched, docking was a piece of cake."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:48:54Z","Content":"Yes, valid point. I should have also asked for a picture of your docking. I assume that they are pointing the right way, since you said that you are able to dock them a few times before it fails.\n\nAny idea what you might be doing right at that point? What activities you are doing between the docking events (when it eventually fails). This bug is fairly common, but the exact cause is still a mystery to me.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:33:22Z","Content":"Also the Rockomax Hubmax doesn\u0027t have docking ports..."},{"CreatedByName":"markospace","CreatedById":138178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T22:58:21Z","Content":"No it either works or it doesnt. it just took me many docking attempts that were so perfect i couldn\u0027t believe they were not joining together. Thats when i remembered something Scott Manly had said about them having to be the right way round.\n\nWhen you select the docking part the top will be the correct face to join to another. So if you want to place it on the side of your craft make a note of how it looks. hope that makes sense."},{"CreatedByName":"Chowderpat","CreatedById":140156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T23:14:13Z","Content":"If you\u0027re coming in close, and you have sas on, turn it off, it should work after that."}]}
