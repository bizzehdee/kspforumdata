I am running the latest non-Steam release of KSP .23 on my late 2011 13 inch MBP running Lion 10.7.5 and I seem the be having problems with connecting certain parts together in the VAB, but the manner in which the game crashes (freezes or hangs) doesn\u0027t generate a proper error log. I think I may have narrowed it down to connecting the 1-m aerodynamic nosecone to an Advanced SAS unit while there are connecting struts in the way with radial symmetry is turned on - it\u0027s hard to remember if I had it turned on prior to placing the cone on top of the SAS unit, or if I had symmetry turned off and turned it on to place the part on my 4 radial lander motors. My game \u0022beachballs\u0022 and will not let me tab back over to the KSP window once I have tabbed away from it, and there is no crash report that comes up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running vanilla KSP, no add-ons or mods. It\u0027s been 15 minutes since I tabbed out of the game to the Finder and my laptop is still running in fast-fan mode and will still not let me back into the game unless I tell it to force quit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*UPDATE* - I have determined if the nosecone is set to symmetry mode first and then placed on the SAS unit (or other part), it doesn\u0027t cause the crash, even if I switch over to non-symmetry and back again. The problem only seems to occur when I am in the VAB and attempt to put the nose cone on top of any other part that happens to be in symmetry mode(or in the latest case, accidentally matching up to the bottom of a fuel tank) and have the selected part I\u0027m trying to place be in non-symmetry mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL/DR - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Macbook Pro 13\u0022 Late 2011 model - OS X Lion, Intel HD Graphics 3000 GPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Non-Steam KSP client with clean install\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens: In VAB: hen placing 1-m aerodynamic nose cone that is in non-symmetry mode onto a fuel tank or object that\u0027s in symmetry mode, and then switching the nose cone to symmetry mode, the game hangs indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to reproduce:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* From VAB, place fuel tanks in symmetry mode around a center axis (i.e. another fuel tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Select 1-m Aerodynamic Nose Cone (the one with the blue tip) and change to non-symmetry mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Reactivate symmetry mode while placing the nosecone on top of one of the symmetrical fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* All instances of the nose cone spawn on top of only the selected fuel tank - game hangs and does not generate a crash log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Other objects do not cause this hang/crash phenomena - only the 1-m nose cone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-24T04:13:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2013 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by alaskanime\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded \u0026quot;TL/DR\u0026quot; section in proper bug reporting format\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"interslice","CreatedById":98363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T03:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehaving the exact same issue on a mac pro running 10.7.5. stock game, no mods, nose cones hang the game in the same symmetry situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E gonna start troubleshooting/reinstalling things and see if anything changes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-24T03:57:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2013 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alaskanime","CreatedById":97791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T04:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found if you start out in symmetry mode and place the nose cone, as long as you are in the same session in the VAB, you can thereafter swap between symmetry and non-symmetry mode (and vice versa) and not generate the hang/crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"interslice","CreatedById":98363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T04:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok so i redownloaded .22 and the issue went away, and then downloaded a clean .23 and it came right back. i suspect its a bug with 10.7.5\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T05:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could well be a graphics driver bug.
