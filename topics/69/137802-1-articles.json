I was starting a career mode and was going to do an EVA. I moved my cursor over my kerbal\u0027s IVA portrait and the screen kinda freaks out. It seems to freeze for a second, before flashing the desktop for a moment, and then returns to the game where it stays frozen and then the game crashes. I\u0027ve tried everything I can think of via lowering the graphics levels and such, but it keeps happening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
