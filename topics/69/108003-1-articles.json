Soon there will be a lowercase version of punctuation. Er, oops, meant to put a lowercase period there~"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

The name of your ship is used as the name of the file the ship is saved to. Operating systems have some characters they won\u0027t allow to be used as file names because they have other uses. ? is one of them along with \\* and / and \\ and many others. I guess the game does some conversion somehow? Otherwise it would just fail to save your ship.\n\nNow to the important stuff: come up with a name that WILL break the game when you try to save the ship."},{"CreatedByName":"rockbloodystar","CreatedById":59828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:39:08Z","Content":"[https://xkcd.com/327/](https://xkcd.com/327/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:04:04Z","Content":"I allways number them with \u0022I\u0022 or \u0022II\u0022 for excample."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:10:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [https://xkcd.com/327/](https://xkcd.com/327/)\n\nThat make me want to change my name ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:33:55Z","Content":"Also, the font changes if I try to type in something in Russian.
