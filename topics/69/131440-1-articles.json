I hope that this thread will eventually become a general help-and-support thread for using KSP with steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my first question: Is it possible to make a clean install without deleting and redownloading?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: What I\u0027m going for is having my normal, modded-to-hell-and-back game is the one I access through stream, and the stock I access through a different shortcut.
