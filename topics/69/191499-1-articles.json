The game sort of slows down - although that might just have been my PC and not the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI resolved the issue by moving a few of the modules (those that have wheels due to a contract) to an orientation where they were able to get direct sunlight, but I thought I should warn others of a possible problem that they might encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-08T23:54:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2020 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by TotemicWeevil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
