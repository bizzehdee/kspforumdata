For example, on a recent mission I fine-tuned my approach to Duna from around 10 days out so that the maneuver node interface said I\u0027d hit a periapsis of 40km on an equatorial prograde orbit. When I then fast-forwarded to the inner edge of the SOI, I found that I was headed for a periapsis of 10000 km instead. As far as I can tell, the attitude of the orbit was the same, so it seems like an error in translating speed rather than direction at the SOI boundary. Anyway, this has happened to me multiple times in 0.90, and I don\u0027t especially remember having this problem in earlier versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-12T03:36:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2015 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T03:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a well known bug, actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t go through SOI changes faster than 50 times.

But I have also see the change in very steep trajectories before getting to SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is cause, i believe to an imbalance in RCS and torque wheels. What I do when a vessel is prone to this is that is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure my solar panels can pick up at any sun angle (if you can do this roll your vessel to optimal sun before making you final pre-warp config).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKill the RCS after setting the Ap\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKill the torque of all wheels except one wheel, you can even kill the torque on the one wheel but you will have to remember to reactivate as you approach the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValidate that the closest approach did not change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECross fingers, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my complaints with 0.90 is that RCS and torque of vessel in cargo bays are active by default, and with RCS its difficult to deactivate them, this causes ships to behave oddly during turns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I would point, the game is not very accurate for distant intercepts. Its actually a good idea to make adjustments about half the distance to the planet, you sometimes have better control along certain vectors getting away from the periapsis. On very steep trajectory the problem may be the numeric resolution limits of the operating system. For example if one is transitting Moho orbital radius to Eeloo, you may not even get an intercept, and have to travel half way to the planet on a close to intercept and then make final adjustments. If you manage to get an intercept (about 2/3rds of the time for me) it will change with anyvariance of the craft, and may change anyway in flight. I wouldn\u0027t neccesary call this a bug, per say, because minor adjustments in real flight are necessary. Of course they cannot time warp so . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"perk","CreatedById":137780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T01:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen i tried to replicate my problem for the video i realized i was most likely wrong about the range of velocities, but non the less the soi and precision problems are huge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGtETwiOEoQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafter the first change of the maneuver node to 941.2 m/s it should give an encounter (it is right between v_min v_max for the encounter) but it flickers out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that i just show how slightly changing speeds around that critical speed totally brakes the maneuver node as it now wildly fluctuates even the delta v for the maneuver it self all by its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo explain a bit more: the spacecraft is in the SOI of kerbin on a kerbin escape course, and since the \u0022escape\u0022 vector in the kerbol frame is really imprecise at that point, the orbital maneuvers in the kerbol frames glitch out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it got even weirder.. while i changed nothing but the maneuver node in the video, my current path resolved from an escape from kerbin to a bound orbit with a little over 126m meters apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft has 132 parts and 83 tons, which seems part of the problem.
