It has six extended communications antennas on it, arranged in a circle to look like a beam weapon (my game is titled \u0022The Galactic Empire\u0022 complete with Imperial flag.....)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I noticed that one of the antennae was closed. No idea how that happened, because I didn\u0027t close it. When I right-clicked and tried to open the antenna, the \u0022Extend Antenna\u0022 option wasn\u0027t there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a lot of exiting and reloading and general head-bashing, I went into the gamesave file (persistent.sfs) with Wordpad, looked in the station\u0027s part list, and compared the six antennas against each other, looking for one that was different. The first one did indeed have something wierd: in the first MODULE/EVENT/Toggle subsection, the \u0022active\u0022 flag was set to FALSE, whereas the other five antennas had TRUE. I closed KSP, changed \u0022false\u0022 to \u0022true\u0022, saved the change to persistent.sfs., reloaded the game, and when I went back to the space station and right-clicked the screwy antenna, its right-click menu was working normally again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got no idea how that one antenna got out of whack, but if you see this and you\u0027re okay with messing around in the save file (make a backup first!) this is how you can fix a part whose right-click menu went AWOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
