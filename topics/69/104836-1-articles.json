The problem is that the throttle, which KSP recognizes as Logitech.Logitech Attack Axis 2, can only throttle from 50% to 100%. Putting the throttle lever in the joystick to lowest position and pressing X to kill throttle and set it to 0% and nudging the throttle lever a bit increases the throttle directly to 50%\n\nSystem info:\n\nProcessor Information:\n\n Vendor: GenuineIntel\n\n CPU Family: 0x6\n\n CPU Model: 0x3a\n\n CPU Stepping: 0x9\n\n CPU Type: 0x0\n\n Speed: 3901 Mhz\n\n 8 logical processors\n\n 4 physical processors\n\n HyperThreading: Supported\n\n FCMOV: Supported\n\n SSE2: Supported\n\n SSE3: Supported\n\n SSSE3: Supported\n\n SSE4a: Unsupported\n\n SSE41: Supported\n\n SSE42: Supported\n\nNetwork Information:\n\n Network Speed: \n\nOperating System Version:\n\n Ubuntu 14.10 (64 bit)\n\n Kernel Name: Linux\n\n Kernel Version: 3.13.0-49-generic\n\n X Server Vendor: The X.Org Foundation\n\n X Server Release: 11501000\n\n X Window Manager: Openbox\n\n Steam Runtime Version: steam-runtime-release\\_2015-01-06\n\nVideo Card:\n\n Driver: NVIDIA Corporation GeForce GTX 660 Ti/PCIe/SSE2\n\n Driver Version: 4.4.0 NVIDIA 331.113\n\n OpenGL Version: 4.4\n\n Desktop Color Depth: 24 bits per pixel\n\n Monitor Refresh Rate: 59 Hz\n\n VendorID: 0x10de\n\n DeviceID: 0x1183\n\n Number of Monitors: 1\n\n Number of Logical Video Cards: 1\n\n Primary Display Resolution: 1366 x 768\n\n Desktop Resolution: 1366 x 768\n\n Primary Display Size: 20,51\u0022 x 11,54\u0022 (23,50\u0022 diag)\n\n 52,1cm x 29,3cm (59,7cm diag)\n\n Primary Bus: PCI Express 16x\n\n Primary VRAM: 2048 MB\n\n Supported MSAA Modes: 2x 4x 8x 16x \n\nSound card:\n\n Audio device: Realtek ALC892\n\nMemory:\n\n RAM: 13991 Mb\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n UI Language: English\n\n LANG: en\\_US.UTF-8\n\n Microphone: Not set\n\n Total Hard Disk Space Available: 103452 Mb\n\n Largest Free Hard Disk Block: 58331 Mb\n\nInstalled software:\n\nRecent Failure Reports:\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T11:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aghanim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T17:20:22Z","Content":"This is a known problem with KSP/Unity interface. I personally don\u0027t know in which part the problem lies, but my understanding is that Unity processes raw inputs regardless of joystick calibration. So support for joystick throttles seems to be hit and miss.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T19:39:18Z","Content":"Wait 3 days.
