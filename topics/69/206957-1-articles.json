Neither fork of KJR (-Next or -Continued) works well in 1.12.x. Turn on advanced tweakables and use autostruts as a workaround.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy experience is that KJR triggers massive acceleration during construction mode. It can change your orbit and sometimes causes parts of the vessel to impact against one another and explode. I also had some cases where doing an EVA and re-boarding would cause a capsule to get 0 m/s velocity, plummeting from low orbit towards the surface. I haven\u0027t seen any of these problems since uninstalling KJR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. This thread is in the \u0022unmodded install\u0022 subforum.
