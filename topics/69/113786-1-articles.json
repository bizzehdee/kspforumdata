Been retrying the maneuver for an hour or two every couple of days for a week or so. I\u0027ve been very close, and so was a little worried 1.0.3 would make it impossible (and hopeful it would make it easier), so I loaded up KSP today nervously. What I didn\u0027t expect was this glitch:\n\n**The Issue**\n\nKSP seems to operate normally at first, until I go to the Tracking Station and load my ship, the \u0022Duna Express\u0022. First Duna is gone, replaced by a pixelated white half circle. I figured it might resolve itself as I got closer to Duna. But the craft won\u0027t move. I can\u0027t retract my solar panels. In fact, none of the ship controls seem to do anything. Then I notice time isn\u0027t passing. The ship isn\u0027t getting closer to Duna at all. Some UI elements are out of place. When I hit ESC to pull up the menu, then resume, time starts flowing again, the ship is falling towards pixel-Duna as it should, but the controls still don\u0027t work, and weirder still, now every piece of the ship except the command pod goes flying off into the distance before resetting back to where it should be, and then immediately flying off into the distance again. I\u0027m guessing the command pod is moving towards Duna while the rest of the ship is flying to the original freeze point before snapping back to the command pod.\n\nAll other crafts I\u0027ve loaded fly normally, including other crafts in Duna\u0027s SOI. Ike displays normally. During the many reloads I did, Duna occasionally displayed normally, but usually it didn\u0027t. It doesn\u0027t seem to make much of a difference whether I load the craft through the tracking center or by hitting F9. There are three possible things I can think of that could make this craft unique (other than just some random part): it\u0027s the only manned craft currently flying; it has been quicksaved and reloaded a lot; it has one fairing (generated by a decoupler) that turned invisible a week or so ago during 1.0.2 and never reappeared.\n\n**My Setup**\n\nKSP 1.0.3 through Steam\n\nUnmodded\n\nMac OS X 10.10.3\n\niMac (27-inch, Late 2013)\n\n3.5 GHz intel Core i7\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![lsqdg.png](http://i.xomf.com/lsqdg.png)\n\n![bwxrh.png](http://i.xomf.com/bwxrh.png)\n\n![pfykl.png](http://i.xomf.com/pfykl.png)\n\n![lszpl.png](http://i.xomf.com/lszpl.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T02:16:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZenithRising**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T01:30:42Z","Content":"You are not alone.\n\n[One](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126319-1-0-3-issues?p=2034938\u0026viewfull=1#post2034938)\n\n[Two](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126291-Rolling-back-to-v1-02)\n\n[Three](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126326-1-0-3-Ship-uncontrollable-Minmus-missing)\n\n[Four](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5154)\n\n[Five](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5155)\n\n[Six](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5156)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bosun","CreatedById":146083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T02:23:20Z","Content":"DITTO, same issues as OP.

There\u0027s that.
