The crash was not happening a few days ago in what was it 0.93 there was not crashing but know the game on steam and the down load from your site store both are doing the same problem crashing to desktop in the load area or in the menu area when I click on some thing. Under stand this is on a great power house of a system and it is a fresh install of windows 7 pro 64x. it also has all up-to-date drivers and also for the thing plugged in to the USB. the new problem is that I reinstalled the old version and know it has the same problem so some thing steam or KPS installed is conflicting with some thing."},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:05:51Z","Content":"bump bump"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:44:08Z","Content":"You\u0027re running out of physical RAM, since your hard limit is 4GB (NOT the 32-bit limit, but the actual limitation of the computer hardware) and the system is using \u003E1200Mb for itself, there is not enough RAM to run the game.
