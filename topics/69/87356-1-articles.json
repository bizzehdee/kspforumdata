The first thing I did after 15min of play was turn down the music settings to Zero (So I could listen to the new Slipknot album) and hit \u0027apply\u0027. This caused my game to go into \u0022Windowed\u0022 mode and I had an improper view of my HUD/UI so my ship crashed... I had to force the program to close and re-open to get the full HUD/UI to display. Once open, I went to the menu options for graphics/display and noticed my video display settings weren\u0027t at their most optimum (By default), and the Full Screen option was unchecked. I believe that when I went to the in-game setting to turn down the music audio and hit \u0027apply\u0027, the default settings over-rode my input changes to the default changes and set my game to \u0022Windowed Mode\u0022. By simply going back into the game and selecting \u0022Full Screen\u0022 the problem was fixed, but all I did was change the music volume and hit apply. Let me know if you want me to try changing the audio settings again to see if it recurs. Easy problem, easy fix, thanks for the game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T04:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, if you can replicate the issue that\u0027s always good.
