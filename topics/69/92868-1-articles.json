It was fine a week ago, but today when I played it I kept noticing that my craft had some phantom rotation force constantly being applied to it. Using SAS did not correct the rotation force. It would just start spinning even when it\u0027s outside of the atmosphere, and no thrusters were on. It would always start to pitch down, and very slightly to the right. I had to constantly manually correct for this rotation, but it just kept happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to isolate the variables, I gradually took parts off my spacecraft, until only the command pod MK1-2 remained. At the launch pad, I turned off gravity using Alt-F12. There it was again. The craft began to rotate on it\u0027s own. I used the smaller command pod Mk1, and again, it started rotating. I then made Jeb get out and do an EVA, and to my surprise, the command pod stopped rotating. Somehow Jeb being inside the command pod was causing it to rotate! I switched to a different Kerbal, Bill, and again, the rotation force was present. When he was outside of the pod, the force was gone! But this time, I discovered something stranger. I had Bill dismount from the pod, start using his jetpack, and move around a bit. I had nulled all lateral velocity, and instead of coming down he started drifting backwards! He kept accelerating along his backwards vector, no matter where he faced. This force must be the cause of the command pod\u0027s strange rotation! To verify this, I launched the Stayputnik all by itself without gravity, and sure enough, no rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith different save files, new games, this all still happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... I hope this will be fixed soon? I haven\u0027t found anything online regarding this bug, so maybe I\u0027m the only one who got it? I don\u0027t use any mods btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://vwrstudios.com/output_log.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evwrstudios.com/output_log.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this game log I started the game, went to my usual save file, launched a craft that is only a Mk1 command pod with Jeb in it. Turned off gravity, let it rotate a bit, controlled it a bit, and then got out for an EVA. Dismounted, turned on jet pack, and floated in the air for a second. I then let myself be carried backwards by the phantom force. Then I revert to VAB, exit, quit, quit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T01:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no way of knowing if it\u0027s related or not, but your log is full of this, repeated:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EHandleD3DDeviceLost  HandleD3DDeviceLost: still lost\u003Cbr\u003ESkipped frame because GfxDevice is in invalid state (device lost)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename:  Line: 1617)\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo either you alt-tab out of fullscreen mode a lot, or there\u0027s something funky going on with your graphics drivers.
