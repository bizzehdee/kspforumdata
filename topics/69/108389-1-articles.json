I recently upgraded to Windows 8 64 bit, and I\u0027m experiencing a problem. When I try to make changes to my Kerbal Space Program folder, it says \u0022You need permission to perform this action. You require permission from *my name* to make changes to this folder\u0022 The folder is labeled game data. The options it gives me are try again and cancel. I am the administrator and the only user account on this computer. The version of KSP is 1.0.2.842 and was not bought on steam.
