It seems that when you attach an OKTO probe to the top node of a Mk1 pod, it amplifies the heating so much that the pod will explode at relatively minor speeds (800 m/s). I\u0027ve tested this with ever other 0.625m parts including all other probe cores and fuel tanks and only the OKTO probe causes this issue.\n\nI tested this with a simple rocket but it seems to show up in all rockets.\n\nMy test rocket was a Mk1 pod with an OKTO core and then a mk16 parachute on top. Underneath was a RT-10 set at 50% thrust and launched straight up."},{"CreatedByName":"pjj56","CreatedById":60970,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:17:44Z","Content":"**Version:** KSP 1.0.0.830 Windows 64-bit\n\n**Issue:** Stayputnik probe experiences extreme heating on reentry - up to 4000K! Possibly related to [Bug #4832](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/4832), as it also occurred on a rescue mission.\n\n**Save:** [Thermalbug.sfs](https://goo.gl/7exaQ9) - Simply wait until reentry, either warping or not: the Stayputnik starts heating up rapidly.\n\n![9vBDBGW.png](http://i.imgur.com/9vBDBGW.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"tylerthehun","CreatedById":109929,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:48:38Z","Content":"I\u0027m getting a very similar issue with an OKTO atop a MkI pod, with an SAS avionics module on top of that. Strangely, I have no issues in atmosphere, but once I get up to 60k or so and cut engines to coast to Ap, it then spontaneously explodes, and the debug menu says it was due to heat."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:52:24Z","Content":"Yeah it\u0027s known, 1.0.1 is coming though, hopefully it\u0027ll fix it."}]}
