Sometimes if you just keep diligently moving the mouse cursor along the orbital plane, you eventually get a chance to place a node, if even only for an instant. Another way to fix it is to reverse your descent so that you are behind the apoapsis, or bring your self back into an orbital trajectory. And I also find if I adjust the camera angle around, sometimes I find a position that is easier to place maneuver nodes from. The major conflict seems to be from the post-crash orbit line sometimes allowing you to place a maneuver node on it but always preventing you from clicking on your present trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in 0.90 there is also no way to set nodes until you upgrade something...not sure what but might be the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T00:28:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T00:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OhioBob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OhioBob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m experiencing a problem that I\u0027ve occasionally seen in the past.
