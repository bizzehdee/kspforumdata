They will decouple from my space craft but the decoupler stays on the engine and I can\u0027t use it. Also the decoupler isn\u0027t upside down so I have no idea whats causing this if you can help that would be great thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some screen shots of the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4Q4CAmW.png\u0022 alt=\u00224Q4CAmW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tedd9P5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tedd9P5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T06:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this is all stock, can you upload the save file?

Though in my experience that\u0027s not what happens, it\u0027s just what the behavior is like. End up just reverting to the VAB, reconnecting the decoupler, and it\u0027s fine.
