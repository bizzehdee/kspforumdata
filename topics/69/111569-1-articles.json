Several times! One in a similar ship like yours, and two other instances with my Laythe sea base.

I had a floating collection of fuel tanks, taxied the plane up to them, and connected them with a KAS cable (this was before there were KAS pipes). All went well at first but the cable didn\u0027t stop all relative movment, so during fueling one of the plane\u0027s wingtips clipped into one of the floating fuel tanks. I only noticed this just as I was disconnecting the hose, which basically made the wing spawn inside the fuel tank.

That justs shows the 1st few seconds. The tangle of fuel tanks and seaplane parts kept wrestling like that for a long time, slowly moving away, and eventually disappearing over the horizon, shedding the occational piece along the way.
