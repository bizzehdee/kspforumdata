This causes inverted pitch when attachment point of the parent and its own are on opposite sides of the center of mass.\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\n- craft file: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24834500/kerbal_wing/Goblin.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24834500/kerbal_wing/Goblin.craft)\n\n![kerbal_wing.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24834500/kerbal_wing/kerbal_wing.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:17:57Z","Content":"The axis of the control surfaces is intersecting or in front of the CoM, this is an old issue, move your wings back or change their angle so the control surfaces do not intersect the CoM."},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:30:08Z","Content":"Also having same issue. I understand the automatic mapping you refer to, however:\n\n1) The wings are angled and positioned to place CoL in appropriate place. It is not always possible or desirable to have to move them to work around mismapped ailerons.\n\n2) Ailerons have an invert option, which would allow us to override this, but it seems to be ignored. I can launch with it set and not set, but the ailerons behave the same either way. \n\n![4nGKsYB.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/4nGKsYB.jpg?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:15:30Z","Content":"The invert option only applies to the deployment direction."},{"CreatedByName":"Black-Talon","CreatedById":57463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:25:32Z","Content":"I am also having this problem, specific to roll control, and have to admit that it\u0027s problematic.\n\nParticularly when roll control should not be impacted at all by aileron position being fore or aft of the center of mass?? The position in front of or behind the CoM would impact their direction for pitch but not roll. Why is roll control inverted?\n\nI\u0027m now realizing as I re-read the original bug report that this was a report specific to pitch. I\u0027ll write up a new one specific to roll? Perhaps I\u0027m missing something as I haven\u0027t had this issue before and it\u0027s particularly problematic when you\u0027re controls work in reverse.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE 1: My post may have been a mistake - after removing mods and restarting the game I was unable to reproduce the issue in stock. I\u0027m going to get more information and post it in the appropriate thread/forum.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE 2: I have determined the issue to be specific to Stock Bug Fix Modules (Release v1.0.2d.2) with StockPlus enabled.

It\u0027s in the StockPlus part of ModuleControlSurfaceFix, which you can selectively disable. Sorry for the troubles.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
