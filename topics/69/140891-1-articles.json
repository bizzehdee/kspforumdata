SQUAD is pretty open/transparent about what they\u0027re working on, so there\u0027s little need to guess. If you\u0027re hoping for change X while the announcements are all about progress on change Y, you\u0027re just setting yourself up for disappointment (and frankly I see comments along those lines more often than I\u0027d expect). The focus of 1.0 was aerodynamics and heating, and 1.1 was Unity 5 and wheels, and SQUAD made no representations that there would be improvements in any glitches afflicting large stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also make a note in support of \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002216426\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@sal_vager\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s point\u00A0about how ambiguous the term \u0022Kraken\u0022 is on these forums.

Sometimes there are certain mass and build configurations that cause the physics to enter a feedback state. The migration to Unity 5 was an unknown from the standpoint of how much of a change there would be for this particular issue. I\u0027ve had plenty of large builds that didn\u0027t require crazy amounts of struts to keep from entering an oscillatory state. But you can also cause it to happen by putting a couple of symmetric girders on a FL-T800, with fuel tanks on the end, and watch it walk off the launch pad (that\u0027s not a very large ship).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout sounding more deflective, this is one of the issues with having an open ended physics game such as this.
