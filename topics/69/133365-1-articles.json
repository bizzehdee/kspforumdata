I check the video of scott manley on youtube to know how to modify my quicksave file. I will explain what I did step by step to make it clear:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI crash a vessel into the mun then press F5 by accident so I made the same vessel again put it on the launchpad and \u00A0change bob kerman from dead to available to put it in the new vessel then put it in orbit around the mun and landed. Then I did another big launch to do 4 missions at once and after 2 days of work I realize that one probe was missing a material bay because I mix with a service bay L and my station was missing a copula, so I tried that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put the new probe with material bay on the launchpad quicksave and then copy paste the coordinate of the one who was in orbit and modified the one who was in orbit to put it on the launchpad then F9\u2026 but it didn\u2019t work, instead both where put on the launch pad\u00A0 and both explode so I took my last quicksave file and instead of interchanging them both at the same time I put the new one from the launchpad and put it in orbit at 100k around kerbin then did the same thing with the probe but shift half orbit. After that I put the new probe at the same orbit that my old one was (outside the mun\u2019s orbit) and landed the old one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter this one I realize that the crash wasn\u2019t random and look at the date from the crash log and realize that since I modified the save file every time I revert back to launch of VAB it crash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my quicksave before any change and the last one.

With this cheat, there is a way to disable science experiment where I did it Like space center... I did nearly all experiment so there is no more science to get from VAB, admin, hangar, launchpad, runway.... So Can I put this science as already done because it will be really to easy to have over 1000 science more if all those experiment give the initial science return. So does \u00A0the hyperedit mod permit to take in consideration the science I already did even if I need to do it one by one???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T21:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt it will let you flag those science tests as completed in your new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll probably have to work on the honor system; \u00A0just ignore the fact that you already did them, give yourself the science, and just don\u0027t repeat those experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively there may be a way\u00A0to flag a test as completed in the Alt\u002BF12 menu in the science/research section but I\u0027m not 100% sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirius123","CreatedById":159683,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T22:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nafter further investigation I remark that not all spacecraft would do the crash in fact only my rover spacecraft do the crash... so i investigated more to find that I use \u0022TR-XL Stack Separator\u0022 which is experimental part for me now, so I switch only this part to a \u0022TR-2C Stack Separator\u0022 and no crash anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI import the spacecraft which have the\u00A0TR-XL Stack Separator in another save game (I created a sandbox to test that) and the ship does not give me instant crash after revert to launch/VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs it something seen before...
