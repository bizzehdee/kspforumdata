I recommend trying to bump down the Texture Quality a little. If the game isn\u0027t loading, you can manually change the Texture Quality by editing the settings.cfg with a plain text editor (such as notepad). Search for the line \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY =\u0022 and change it to \u0022TEXTURE_QUALITY = 1\u0022 (or even try 2 or 3). Restart the game. Sometimes after running KSP with this changed setting, you can go back and bump the texture quality back up a notch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MicroChipz","CreatedById":133383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T04:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour log seems to indicate that you are running out of memory.
