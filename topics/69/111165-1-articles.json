Even if I have a single part in the VAB, when I look at the floor it lags like crazy. I\u0027d guess this is due to all the Kerbals walking on the floor. Is there a setting I can change to reduce this lag? Tried playing around with the settings but couldn\u0027t figure out what was causing it."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:27:32Z","Content":"Hi Greenspan, the Kerbals can be switched off in the settings, but really it shouldn\u0027t be lagging at all, if you post your logs someone might be able to help, see the support stickies for more info."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:44:01Z","Content":"I experience noticeable lag also when looking at kerbals walking around in the background, especially on my older computer. As sal said, there is a setting in the Main Menu-\u003ESettings where you can turn them off. It helped me a lot.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
