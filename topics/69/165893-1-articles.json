RSC controls stuck in rotation mode and I can\u0027t really use ROT controls for docking. Before this the frames were jittering and basically going back and forth in time. Adjusted display settings, helped a little, then when docking it happened again. Don\u0027t know If this is important, but just recently updated to MacOS High Sierra, jittering happened a day before and stuck in ROT controls happened after.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m really irritated that I cannot finish my space station, I had it in a low orbit.

It was super annoying because I was so close to finishing my space station. Before this I also had problems, frames jittering left to right. I adjusted the texture quality and the resolution a bit, but to no avail. I\u0027m not saying the dev. team is bad, but seriously. Please optimize it a bit better for Macs, or at least not the highest spec computers. I don\u0027t know if this is due to me updating the OS, but seriously. It sucked.

To get a little more background story, normally you can switch the docking mode with the spacebar?\u00A0(or whatever key your mac uses)\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s very strange to see that the whole game just got glitched. My advice would be to create a fresh install, so a second one. Start the game and see how well it does work there, in sandbox mode for instance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI see you\u0027re not using mods, at least you have put this in the unmodded support section. So I guess you only have one install of KSP at the moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre you using steam? In that case, copy paste your Kerbal Space Program folder, normally located\u00A0in\u00A0C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\...). Copy the folder to another location, it doesn\u0027t really matter where, this is your \u003Cem\u003Eoriginal back-up\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter making the backup, delete KSP via steam. Just do a double check if all the files are deleted where KSP is suposed to be.\u00A0 Create a clean install via steam and test if the problem still occurs.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can assure that this bug has nothing to do with the performance of your rig. KSP is a relative low-end game, you can basically run it with a potato.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe something went wrong with the update as you mentioned, but for now de dev\u0027s can\u0027t do anything about that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem is solved by the fresh install, copy the save folder from the original back-up folder into the new game folder. This way you don\u0027t lose your progress.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the problem is present after importing your old safe, you know your safefile itself is corrupted or bugged in some way. Upload some logs to the forum and maybe someone knows what up. (but I really think it\u0027s a bug in the game itself or in your OS)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem occurs in the test install, before importing the old safe, you know the problem is within your mac itself.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn that case, upload your logs, as described here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5756866417\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, the developers, forum-users, etc., can see what is happening in your install. When something is really wrong with the install and bugs with your OS and that from other Mac-users, it will certainly get optimized soon\u003Csub\u003ETM\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdjsuting a game to a new OS and since your OS is just released, you can\u0027t really blame the dev\u0027s due the short time period. But I\u0027m sure it will be fixed in a patch later on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this solves you problem, just let me know. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n~Dr.Licor\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-27T09:29:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2017 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DrLicor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-28T10:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s on the bugtracker \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8218076816\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/165924-ksp-stuttering-issue-mac-os-high-sierra/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3181848\u0026amp;embedComment=3181848\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:255px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
