In earlier versions, it used to be possible to grab this part and place it back on the vessel as well, as a sort of kludgy way of duplicating subassemblies. Since 0.90 however, if you do this the VAB basically freezes up so that you can\u0027t place any more parts, nor can you exit to the space center. The only way I\u0027m able to quit the game in this situation to use Task Manager to kill it. As far as I can tell, this behavior is 100% reproducible. Obviously, I don\u0027t expect the devs to actually support such an unnatural act, but I think perhaps crashing the whole game is rather a severe punishment!"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:43:55Z","Content":"Yes. Undo is quite buggy/broken. Be careful with it, as it has a tendency to corrupt ships. Especially if debug clipping is enabled.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
