For some reason however, my visuals are completely messed up now. I included a screenshot as example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://prnt.sc/auktlm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://prnt.sc/auktlm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a new problem for me: I never had graphical issues with KSP in the past, though I haven\u0027t actively played the game last month. My other games are still functioning perfectly, so I would assume the issue has something to do with a recent patch. My previous searches kept resulting in topics about modded installations. Since I don\u0027t use mods, I eventually decided to just post the issue here.
