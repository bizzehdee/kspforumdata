Therefore the part isn\u0027t unlocked any more until you also unlock specialised Construction. But if you need it for crafts already built in your game, take what I wrote above as instructions to modify that config file (fairingSize2.cfg, in GameData/Squad/Parts/Aero/fairings) in your install.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Korial","CreatedById":153482,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T01:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
