While exploring the area Y-Y4 (one of three other tasks in the mission) I have had two Kerbonauts fall through the terrain and \u0022crash.\u0022 The first I had to walk a ways from the lander and he fell through at what I assume was the border of the mission area. The second landed safely, got out of his craft and fell through only when I attempted an EVA report to complete the mission. Any help in addressing this issue would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MattW93","CreatedById":114195,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T03:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I managed to complete the mission after upping the terrain graphics from low to normal.
