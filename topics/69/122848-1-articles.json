I slapped together a simple rover in the Hangar with the Probodobodyne RoveMate, the Mk1 Command Pod, the RoveMax Model M1 wheels, and the Pegasus 1 Mobility Enhancer. When I launched it, everything disappeared. The rover, the Sun, Kerbin, the Space Center, everything. All I can see is the space-y background now. I\u0027ve tried exiting and reloading, deleting my save file, loading quicksaves, etc. but found out that the only way to fix the issue so far is to delete all the game\u0027s folders. And I really don\u0027t want to have to do that again, as I\u0027ve got a bunch of flights in progress that I\u0027m not exactly keen on losing. Any help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T09:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi sillyforth, please\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E see here \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
