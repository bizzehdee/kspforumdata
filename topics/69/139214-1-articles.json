Sometimes, the game starts with 60 fps, but upon entering the VAB, framerate drops. It continues when launching.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed that if I CTRL\u002BALT\u002BDELETE while the game runs or is paused, the log file shows that the graphics device is lost, and reset. When entering the game again, the framerate is normal, at 60\u002B. This happends both in the VAB and after launching. I also see that there is some shader problems in the start og the log file. Any suggestiongs?

And there are still the same references to shader problems and graphics device in the log file.
