A few days ago i woke from my comps coolers running at maximum... After checking, i recognized, that 3 crashed instances of KSP were still active in the background, each producing a load of cpu usage... Well i was early enough to avoid damage to the hardware, that was already chilling at a cosey 82 degrees C. Since that incident, i check every time... And i have high expectations towards 1.1...
