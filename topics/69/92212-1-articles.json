Use the IVA view, look down in a cockpit with dual monitors and set each one to one of the cameras. Then, cross your eyes until the images merge. It\u0027s tricky to get the cameras to angle properly, but it should work. You of course also need the mods required to have external camera feeds inside the cockpit. Sorry, I don\u0027t remember what they were called. I\u0027m also not trying to hijack your thread, just felt like this would be a good place to share this little trick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jhdgkss","CreatedById":65910,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T10:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there thanks for your reply..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t crossing your eyes hurt after a bit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have an Oculus rift, I did some trials and the effect was not as good as using a TV.
