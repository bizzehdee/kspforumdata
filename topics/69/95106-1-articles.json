I backed up the entire save folder then ran a link to a third folder to get it off my main install leaving a second backup. I then clicked the 64 bit ksp thing and the game started up and I loaded my user. I load my ship and the data won\u0027t come up from the craft stats and teh stuff in teh sidebar is all messed up. when I try to launch it says \u0022 Craft size unknown!\u0022 no size information is Vessel name. Please open in space plane hanger to have it revised by the engineer staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ve been working really hard on this ship design. How can I get it back again. Nothing is working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI keep trying to post the contents of the ship file from gedit wrapped in code, but it crashes firefox...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edum dum dum... I figured something out. I also have the problem where it won\u0027t bring up the load window. I removed all ships and added back one at a time. The big ships has a subassembly of a smaller ship in the cargo. When I put the subasembly back in the subasembly folder it won\u0027t allow the load window to pop up. But without the sub it I can load the big ship but it has the above problem. Anyone have any idea how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I load it on the runway it loads but I\u0027m zoomed out and it falls through the world. I forgot I had launched it earlier and the game crashed while it was on the runway zoomed out in the same manner. But it didn\u0027t fall through the world that I know of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also went into the other hanger and could load other ships and do stuff with them. When I did load the big ship that is currently corrupted it will not let me move any parts either.

I also can\u0027t move the ship as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vessel is also nameless... And I forgot to say the subassembly part is a seperate ship(a rover) it has the same problems as the bigger ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also deleted and reinstalled the game. Put back the save folder and no changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I go into the rocket hanger and load the big ship I can still click some of the headers in the sidebar like mass, size, name. One of the glitches is a flag and a kerbel show up and if you hover over them they increase in size up to a point outside of their boxes. clicking the rocket pad and launching the big ship also gets a similar problem to the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is stupid is I think the autosave ship is the one I\u0027m using at near it\u0027s latest save but I don\u0027t think I could get it to work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/226609-aurora-orbital-explorer-drone-spaceplane-project/files/2223345\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/226609-aurora-orbital-explorer-drone-spaceplane-project/files/2223345\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;- Here is a link to the ship file on curse.
