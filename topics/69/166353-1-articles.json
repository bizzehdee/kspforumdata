But there are some graphics hacks that KSP just doesn\u0027t like, such as RivaTuner Server, as linked to in my signature. Upgrade that, or better yet remove that if you have it; a lot of MSI card users will have some version of that installed as part of MSI Afterburner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only delays I notice when launching KSP on Win10 come from KSP trying to phone home to Squad\u0027s network and\u00A0I don\u0027t have working internet access at the moment. There doesn\u0027t appear to be a reasonable timeout setting if KSP can\u0027t reach Squad\u0027s network. I take issue with that, but yet it\u0027s part of the EULA so I can\u0027t do anything about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
