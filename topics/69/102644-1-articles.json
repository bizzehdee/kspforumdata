This happens whether you wait on the main menu or start playing. If you wait for it in the main menu, for example, the Kerbal on screen stops moving and the button\u0027s mouse-over animation doesn\u0027t happen anymore, while the main theme song happily continues.\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\n- The problem happens after 30 seconds or so whether you wait on the main menu or start playing.\n\n- [Log file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92135466/output_log.txt)\n\n- [DxDiag](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92135466/DxDiag.txt)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:13:39Z","Content":"Try running the game directly from KSP.exe (instead of through steam) and see if that works for you.\n\nIf it\u0027s a graphics problem, you can try fiddling with the graphics settings. Try using the switch -force-opengl, or try -popupwindow. Each does different things, but may (or may not) help your computer with graphics problems. I found a lot of my issues went away completely with the -popwindow command.\n\nAlso, try disabling the NVIDIA GeForce experience. I personally don\u0027t have any issues with it, but some people have had problems with that and KSP.\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamos","CreatedById":139960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:45:51Z","Content":"Hi Claw,\n\nI was about to come here and report on a solution I found. I created a shortcut for KSP.exe using the -force-d3d11 flag. That did it, but also made most of the text distorted.
