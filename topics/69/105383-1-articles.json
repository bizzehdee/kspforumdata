I switched over to them to see what was afoot, and discovered this:\n\n![AcrccWo.png](http://i.imgur.com/AcrccWo.png)\n\nThese two goo canisters had been contained in a service bay (craft screenshot for reference).\n\n![ESd17HF.png](http://i.imgur.com/ESd17HF.png)\n\nI had detached the bottom section during reentry, and decided to switch to it to watch the explosive fireworks, which unfortunately never happened. I watched until it splashed down and was completely destroyed, or so I thought.\n\n![O3Jz5Zq.png](http://i.imgur.com/O3Jz5Zq.png)\n\nThe two canisters are ascending at a fixed velocity of 63.8 m/s. Interestingly, their rate of ascent does not seem to change when I timewarp, the rate the altimeter changes seems to remain constant regardless of what setting I warp at.\n\nSome more screenshots.\n\n![VOzYMAB.png](http://i.imgur.com/VOzYMAB.png)\n\n![fj0c8nJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/fj0c8nJ.png)\n\nSemi-not-really edit: I switched back to one of the canisters after seeing that its speed had changed to 61.8 m/s, where I was stuck in this view.\n\n![krIYWwU.png](http://i.imgur.com/krIYWwU.png)\n\nI was able to pause, but I was unable to return to the space center and had to force quit the game.\n\n [System specs](http://www./view/jsuooukd943tyfg/specs.spx)\n\n[output.log](http://www./view/5rpg8ok8r2rhm93/output.rtf)\n\nI neglected to get the output.log from when it happened the first time, so I got the log from when I switched to the parts in space again."},{"CreatedByName":"MrCynical","CreatedById":116703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:42:10Z","Content":"I\u0027m seeing the same thing with the windows 32 bit version. Dropped a stage with a utility bay containing two goo canisters and various batteries into the ocean shortly before landing. Saw something shoot upwards from it at high speed. In tracking station discovered the two goo canisters as debris on elliptical orbits which took them out to well beyond the Mun. They seemed to move normally in the tracking station after that, but I didn\u0027t try switching to them."},{"CreatedByName":"Beduino","CreatedById":81326,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:48:09Z","Content":"I think i saw a variation of this bug after switching to debris when one of my rockets exploded. Also there was at least one stream in ksptv where the rocket crashed in kerbin and some debris went flying in scape velocity out of kerbin soi.\n\nSo yeah big bugs!"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:47:05Z","Content":"That\u0027s confirmed. I suspect physics stops affecting parts in service bays, but doesn\u0027t get reenabled after the bay is destroyed.\n\nIf it happens to you, try deleting the debris from the tracking station."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:01:24Z","Content":"This looks like the cargo bay bug at work. Thanks for the report.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:00:01Z","Content":"Lol, glad I\u0027m not the only one! Just got this - the goo has constant speed wrt it\u0027s current environment. But switching the Navball from \u0022orbit\u0022 to \u0022surface\u0022 mode shows a rapidly increasing velocity.\n\nGuess it\u0027s just trying to escape from the Kerbals who keep putting it into weird situations and poking it!"}]}
