Is this a mistake or intended?\n\nI guess you can burn retrograde near Jool to get your periapsis down then bring it up again after the contract completes, but that would still be insanely costly.\n\nNote I haven\u0027t even been outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI yet, the Pol missions are due to a bug with taking data from the Poles of Minmus.\n\n![screenshot29.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87213001/KSP/Contracts%201.0/screenshot29.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T02:32:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerano**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:16:57Z","Content":"This is a thrill seeker.
