I\u0027m running from a new download and haven\u0027t done anything with mods. I\u0027ve also verified the integrity of the game cache on steam and no problems have come up. I\u0027ve reinstalled the game a few times but it didn\u0027t help. I don\u0027t know what the issue is and I don\u0027t have any crash logs because the game doesn\u0027t actually crash, it just freezes then tabs out. If you need computer specs or anything I can provide them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T07:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, doesn\u0027t seem an issue tied to KSP, but to hardware/OS. Those symptoms are similar to what would happen if a stream of Alt-Tab was sent from Keyb (or any input device configured in a similar way), but the same would show should the task switcher hang (something I\u0027ve noticed, other buggy software active on the system can cause this). Also, Windows has \u0022features\u0022 like permanent keypresses that always get in the way (activate automatically at the worst of times) and could have a role in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, seems clear the actual left mousedown action (the left click) isn\u0027t passed to KSP and therefore isn\u0027t processed by the game. It is \u0022consumed\u0022 at the OS level that responds switching focus in and out repeatedly. Can\u0027t tell what caused the OS to behave like that, but my advice is to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) verify system settings, could be some \u0022feature\u0022 is enabled; also, check how the system performs with a mousebutton test;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) disable peripherals you don\u0027t need (should those be shooting events at the OS);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) stop/close all unnecessary background programs/services (and don\u0027t let the unneeded ones to automatically restart until you can be sure they have no effect).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
