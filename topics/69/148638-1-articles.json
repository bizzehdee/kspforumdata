The only time i ever got FPS drops before that where whenever i made ridiculously large crafts or had big bases /w multiple crafts within rendering distance, but that was to be expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince that patch however, i got 40-55 fps in the main menu and in-game, didn\u0027t think too much about it at the time because i was burned out on KSP at the time anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut today, with the 1.2 on the horizon, I\u0027ve been trying to figure out where the problem lies. so i tried out a few things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI can run KSP in ANY resolution, either fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed (-popupwindow) and get 60 fps. That is until i try 1920x1080p, i can run it with a stable 60 fps at 1768x992 with all the graphics settings set to maximum. But it will go straight back to the 40-55fps area\u00A0if i run it at 1920x1080p with all the other graphics options set to minimum, right after activating it it will drop down to between 40-55 fps and go back and forth between that, never settling down.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E apparently i did not check resolutions below 1920x1080p in fullscreen, it is in-fact fullscreen that creates the issue.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis problem persists both on 32 and 64-bit versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently running with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSabertooth 990FX\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAMD FX-8350 8 core at\u00A04GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNvidia Geforce 970\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8GB Ram\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraphics drivers where updated at the release of the Battlefield 1 beta.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have deleted and reinstalled KSP twice, removing any and all files from steamapps/common\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand confirmed integrity of cache via steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried the pre-release of 1.2, same issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be very appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-25T14:34:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2016 02:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Exentenzed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
