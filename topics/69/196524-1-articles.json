The first one appears in the menu screen;\u00A0the button above quit says #autoLOC_8003366. The next one has to do with parts; all the dlc parts have #autoLOC_801 and then a few more numbers to designate each part as its own, the description is gone as well as the name and all the dlc parts are listed before the other stock parts (in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003Esph\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E). The new parts from 1.10 are missing too, the new grabber, science part, and drain valve (I went from 1.8\u00A0to 1.10, I never used 1.9). The last thing that is wrong is the new menus that are supposed to come up when you right click parts, like when I right click on a docking port it just gives me one option (\u0022disable crossfeed\u0022). I am trying to make a kraken drive by using the exploit where you change one docking port\u0027s attraction to have a net force, the menu that allows me to change it does not pop up. I\u00A0have a 100% stock save with both dlcs that are up to date and compatible with 1.10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-26T13:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect your game didn\u2019t update correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u2019re on steam then verify the game files, otherwise try re-downloading the game from wherever you got it from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
