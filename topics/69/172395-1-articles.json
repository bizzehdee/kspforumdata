I understand what the minimum specs are so don\u0027t quote them. From what I understand (What I\u0027ve been told most), is that this game is easy on the gpu and hard on the cpu. (The rest of this post is based on that information, so if I\u0027m wrong just disregard everything else) so when it comes to the CPU\u0027s, are we looking for 16 core 3ghz type cpu\u0027s or 4\u002Bghz 4 cores? And with that said, what\u0027s the minimum gpu that will work pretty Good? Not looking to build the best thing the world has ever seen. Just something that is playable, say 30fps with a goog sized ship. It would be cool if i could spend $100-$200 on a gpu and the upgrade in 3\u00A0months or so(that wait will put me in titan territory, but I don\u0027t want to wait that long)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd basically everyone I\u0027ve talked to have said 8gb of ram is plenty.

But that\u0027s not what I really want to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, the only thing this pc will be used for is playing ksp, it doesn\u0027t need to do anything else.

I\u0027ve been through that thread a few times but it seems like everyone is making a machine that will do the game well, And also video edit and stream. And I really don\u0027t care about that. Yes I would like to upgrade in the future, but just to make KSP better. Is a ryzen 3 1300x a good cpu? The clock speed seems good but it\u0027s also cheap enough to make me not sure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shanrak","CreatedById":186578,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-15T22:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to keep in mind, with cryptocurrency mining driving up GPU prices, its more cost effective right now to buy a pre built than to piece together your own, especially if you want even a half decent card to play other games with.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t upgraded my GPU in 3 years due to inflated prices and its very aggravating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-15T22:29:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2018 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Shanrak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-15T23:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your reference, I have a Dell Alienware 15 R1 laptop with a\u00A0Core i7-4710HQ and a Gefore 970M video card.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16GB of\u00A0DIMM DDR3-RAM\u00A0PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) system RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless I build a giant beast of a rocket, the performance is usually around 45 FPS or more.
