I\u0027ve wanted a large shuttle for a while now, and this seemed like a great opportunity to build one! However, I\u0027ve had some problems building it. That is, specifically problems within the SPH which make it frustrating to build. These issues result in corrupt .craft files, the inability to edit the craft. and crazy launch behavior. I have included a video of some of my issues below, which hopefully illustrates the problems I\u0027ve been having. I also want to illustrate step-by-step how I can replicate these issues, and what I have already done to attempt to correct them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step to creating these issues is to build a craft. It seems that a larger, more complex craft has a higher likelihood of causing issues, but that might also just be because I need to use the undo feature more on more complex craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge craft often contain multiples of smaller units of construction, such as engine pods, wings, etc. It is here that I begin to run into problems. Taking a part off, setting it down to the side, then using undo to put the part back (with duplicate part still to the side) tends to cause glitches. My theory is that stepping back whenever you have parts hanging around the craft causes problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results of using one of these corrupted craft files can range from frustrating to humorous to downright bizarre. I made a video that illustrates my point. Please excuse the quality, I\u0027m still getting to know my screen capture tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to my video: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/GBUXDienDr8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E99 Kerbal Problems\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T22:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Undo\u0022 is very broken. It really only works for a few cases, but nearly always breaks things. I highly recommend not using Undo. If you do, use with extreme caution and watch for part count explosions (resulting from phantom parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
