The game crashed upon reaching the SPH. I will attempt to reproduce and add additional info.\n\nEDIT: Attempted to reproduce twice by flying the plane with the same crew, landing and reverting as I did previously. The crash did not come back.\n\n[Screenshot of craft](http://i.imgur.com/uwZ8zly.jpg)\n\n[Link to craft file.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ttczPyBDOnRkhJTDJGTW9lMzA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Link to crash log download.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ttczPyBDOnY2hEcHZUOU11OUU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T19:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xacktar**"}]}
