It\u0027s part of the nature of KSP in that it tends to run really slow when you have super big part count ships. In fact, the Space Station in my signature (RIP Save File) gave me really bad FPS when I partially took it apart and reassembled it but it was really fun to do. I think I was getting like 10 FPS with this being the only thing in Physics range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
