But if I move one of the ministicks with the pitch, roll or yaw axes mapped, then all four WSAD key will only move my Kerbal forward; he will not turn anymore, not even moving the view with the mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only fix I have found is pressing Alt to toggle movement mode, where the Kerbal will be able to move sideways. Once in that mode, I need to jump (spacebar) and the standard movement mode is restored with all WSAD keys working again as usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
