Hadn\u0027t played in a while and I decided to start up KSP again. I happily played for 5 minutes first time around.. boom uncontrollable lagfest out of nowhere. I restart KSP and it starts laggy. After restarting the PC 15 minutes of happy space time, and back to lagging. Restarted my laptop and reinstalled a vanilla version of KSP and again the same problem. The only thing I can think of that changed with my system since the last time I played\u00A0is the latest Nvidia Gforce driver. I have tried pretty much everything. There\u0027s enough RAM left, my CPU isn\u0027t running at 100% either. I am lost. Anybody an idea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T18:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease fill out the steps listed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E so we can have a better idea of the problem you might be experiencing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T20:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222329201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128206\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450551128\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DuoDex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, DuoDex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease fill out the steps listed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E so we can have a better idea of the problem you might be experiencing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite the list..
