It happens at the exact same position every time.\n\nI have tried deleting the squad/spaces folder where the game seems to crash while loading and then redownloading it via steam. I have also tried lowering the texture quality from 3 to 1 with no notable change as outcome, same with changing the overal graphics to minimum.\n\nSystem specs: \n\n[http://www./view/bj61wp32s903fg6/DxDiag.txt](http://www./view/bj61wp32s903fg6/DxDiag.txt)\n\nLogs: \n\n[http://www./download/d05xaqcl40rwi92/error.log](http://www./download/d05xaqcl40rwi92/error.log)\n\n[http://www./view/bsjjzjnm95cssy2/output_log.txt](http://www./view/bsjjzjnm95cssy2/output_log.txt)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:40:49Z","Content":"Your log indicates that you are running out of memory.

There has been a rash of this problem, and it\u0027s usually been associated with the install location. However, you are using steam, so that /shouldn\u0027t/ be a problem.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
