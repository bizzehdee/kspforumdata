It has never happened before. When I load up the game, one of three things happen. Either it crashes while loading the game, crashes while in the middle of playing the game (not flying a craft), or in the middle of piloting a craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have any mods installed, and I am running the game on a MacBook Pro Late 2011 (4GB RAM,\u00A02.4 GHz Intel Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried restarting my computer, deleting and re-downloading the game, and even deleting steam and re-downloading it. None of it solved the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
