I don\u0027t see intake air there either. Generally I\u0027d been keeping most intakes closed until I got higher in the atmosphere, watching the total intake air decline until the point I knew the engines would starve, then open the other intakes. I mean I can memorize what altitude this happens, but the visual feedback was nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T18:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was intentionally hidden. Because IntakeAir is generated and consumed in the same frame, it can be misleading because IntakeAir may look full (am I using any?) or because it\u0027s showing empty (I have none, why is my engine still running?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, open/close on the intakes pretty much does nothing for drag now. It\u0027s no longer part of the new 1.0 aero model, so closing the intakes doesn\u0027t save you any drag. And IntakeAir isn\u0027t something that can be spammed up anymore and feed an engine well beyond it\u0027s service ceiling, because that was also changed in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be helpful to know if you\u0027re supplying the full demand to the engine, but the existing resource system isn\u0027t set up well for displaying that sort of information given the way IntakeAir works.
