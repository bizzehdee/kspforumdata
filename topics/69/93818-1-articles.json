Now that mod is not ready and I am back to using the stock contract window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the launchpad or anywhere it seems, hover over the contract window then quickly move to another part of the screen (sometimes just to the funds/reputation/sci button) and either there is a long pause/freeze or the entrie game locks and alt-F4 does not exit. Only ctrl-alt-delete to close via task manager. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pause/freeze has happened to my stock version many times and I began being weary of going near that contract button to avoid a complete lock up. I suspect that the game lock up is surely possible in stock, but currently I have some mods installed (KER,Chatterer,HullCAM) and the game lock up just happened. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note the completed contract counter is incorrect. The number changes after visiting the space centre. The current harderS beta career video series shows the issue happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the last part of my previous harderS career I counted 150 or so contracts completed and the counter was indicating around 70. I never once touched that buttun to clear a contract instead was planning to use it as the counter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/mmrgjf6a7pm98cp/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOutputlog\u003C/a\u003E (from the slightly modded) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter removing the mods, I will get the log if able to reproduce the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T06:53:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
